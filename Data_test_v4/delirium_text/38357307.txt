38357307|t|Contrastive analysis on the safety of brand and generic nebivolol: a real-world pharmacovigilance study based on the FDA adverse event reporting system.
38357307|a|Background: The equivalence of generic drugs to their brand-name counterparts is a controversial issue. Current literature indicates disparities between the generic nebivolol (GN) and the brand nebivolol (BN). Aim: The study is designed to investigate the safety difference between GN and BN and provide reference information for clinical practice. Methods: We reviewed adverse event (AE) reports that recorded nebivolol as the primary suspect drug in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 2004 to 2022, conducted a disproportional analysis to detect signals for the GN and BN respectively, and compared the AE heterogeneity between them using the Breslow-Day test. Results: A total of 2613 AE reports of nebivolol were recorded in the FAERS database from 2004 to 2022, of which 2,200 were classified as BN, 346 as GN, and 67 unclassifiable AE reports were excluded. The signals of 37 AEs distributed in cardiac, gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and nervous systems were detected in disproportional analysis. 33 out of 37 AEs were positive signals, with 21 not previously listed on the drug label, indicating an unrecognized risk with nebivolol. In the heterogeneity analysis of AE signals between GN and BN, the GN generally showed a higher AE signal value than BN, especially 15 AEs distributed in the cardiac, neurological, and psychiatric systems that showed statistically significantly higher risk by taking GN. Conclusion: Our study shows some previously overlooked adverse effects of nebivolol. It suggests that the risk of GN's adverse effects may be higher than those in BN, which deserves further attention and investigation by healthcare professionals, regulators, and others.
