32905605|t|Quinolone-induced psychosis: an updated review.
32905605|a|Quinolones are an antibiotic group widely used due to their antimicrobial action and security profile, however, it has been described neuropsychiatric adverse effects, being induced-psychotic episodes one of the most clinically relevant. Nevertheless, this secondary effect has been scarcely studied. A literature search using PRISMA guidelines was performed between 01/01/1962 and 01/31/2019 on PubMed and ScienceDirect, including manuscripts which described substance-induced psychotic disorder according to DSM-5 and in which the symptomatology was not attributable to an acute confusional state (delirium) or to other induced psychiatric disorders. 459 articles were found, but only 27 manuscripts fulfilled inclusion criteria (n=27 patients, median age of 36.15+-16.96 years). Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin were the main antibiotics implicated. Quinolone- induced psychosis is a clinical relevant issue due to the high prescription of these antibiotics and the severity of this clinical syndrome. In general, this syndrome can remit in a few days with the withdrawal of the quinolone and performing symptomatic support if it is necessary. Finally, it is important to perform further research on this issue. Keywords: Quinolones, Psychosis, Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacinn, Psychotic Induced.
