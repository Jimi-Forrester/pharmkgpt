34271885|t|Use of antithrombotics at the end of life: an in-depth chart review study.
34271885|a|BACKGROUND: Antithrombotics are frequently prescribed for patients with a limited life expectancy. In the last phase of life, when treatment is primarily focused on optimizing patients' quality of life, the use of antithrombotics should be reconsidered. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a retrospective review of 180 medical records of patients who had died of a malignant or non-malignant disease, at home, in a hospice or in a hospital, in the Netherlands. All medication prescriptions and clinical notes of patients using antithrombotics in the last three months of life were reviewed manually. We subsequently developed case vignettes based on a purposive sample, with variation in setting, age, gender, type of medication, and underlying disease. RESULTS: In total 60% (n=108) of patients had used antithrombotics in the last three months of life. Of all patients using antithrombotics 33.3 % died at home, 21.3 % in a hospice and 45.4 % in a hospital. In total, 157 antithrombotic prescriptions were registered; 30 prescriptions of vitamin K antagonists, 60 of heparins, and 66 of platelet aggregation inhibitors. Of 51 patients using heparins, 32 only received a prophylactic dose. In 75.9 % of patients antithrombotics were continued until the last week before death. Case vignettes suggest that inability to swallow, bleeding complications or the dying phase were important factors in making decisions about the use of antithrombotics. CONCLUSIONS: Antithrombotics in patients with a life limiting disease are often continued until shortly before death. Clinical guidance may support physicians to reconsider (dis)continuation of antithrombotics and discuss this with the patient.
