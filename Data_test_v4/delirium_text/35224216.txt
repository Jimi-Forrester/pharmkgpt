35224216|t|Prenatal and neonatal complications of COVID-19: A systematic review.
35224216|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) over the past year has affected public health worldwide. During pregnancy, the maternal immune system and inflammatory responses are widely suppressed. Pregnancy-related immune system suppression could make the mother vulnerable to infectious diseases like SARS-COV-2. However, current data suggest little to no possibility of COVID-19 transmission in pregnant women to the fetus during pregnancy or childbirth. This systematic review focused on the possible complications of COVID-19 infection in the fetus and newborn babies including the possibility and evidence of vertical transmission by reviewing articles published during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search using keywords on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. The studies followed a title/abstract and a full-text screening process, and the eligible articles were included in the study. RESULTS: In total, 238 published papers were identified using a systematic search strategy (44 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final review). In all studies, a total of 2375 women with signs and symptoms of COVID-19, who were in the second and third trimester of pregnancy, were assessed mild to moderate pneumonia was one of the most common symptoms. Seventy-three percent of the women did not present any comorbidity, 19% had a fever, 17% had to cough as the most frequent clinical signs and symptoms, 7.5% had pulmonary changes with chest scans, 8% had increased C reactive protein, and 9.4% had decreased lymphocytes (lymphocytopenia). A total of 2716 newborns and fetal were assessed; the delivery method of 1725 of them was reported, 913 (53%) through C-section delivery, and 812 through normal vaginal delivery (47%). Of total newborns, 13 died (five died along with the mother), and 1965 were tested for SARS-CoV-2:118 tested positive. In a study, vertical transmission in seven cases was reported in total of 145 cases assessed. CONCLUSION: It appeared that most pregnant COVID patients were mildly ill, and there is currently no convincing evidence to support the vertical transmission of COVID-19 disease. Therefore, neonates do not represent any additional risk for adverse outcomes neither during the prenatal period nor after birth.
