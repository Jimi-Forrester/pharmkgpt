22277264|a|Increased accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and neuroinflammation is known to exist within the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. However, it remains unclear which form of Abeta pathologies triggers neuroinflammation and whether increased neuroinflammation contributes to cognitive deficits in AD. In the present study we found that increased inflammatory responses might occur early in preplaque APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, and were significantly enhanced in both early- and late-plaque APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Correlational analysis revealed that multiple inflammatory indexes significantly correlated with soluble Abeta level, rather than amyloid plaque burden or insoluble Abeta level, in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Moreover, multiple inflammatory indexes highly correlated with the impaired spatial learning and memory in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Collectively, these results provide evidence that inflammatory responses might be likely triggered by soluble toxic Abeta species. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that multiple inflammatory pathways might be involved in the development and progression of cognitive deficits in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, suggesting that a pharmacological approach targeting multiple inflammatory pathways may be a novel promising strategy to prevent or delay AD.
