34443594|t|Promise of the NLRP3 Inflammasome Inhibitors in In Vivo Disease Models.
34443594|a|Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are conserved cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that track the intracellular milieu for the existence of infection, disease-causing microbes, as well as metabolic distresses. The NLRP3 inflammasome agglomerates are consequent to sensing a wide spectrum of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Certain members of the NLR family have been documented to lump into multimolecular conglomerates called inflammasomes, which are inherently linked to stimulation of the cysteine protease caspase-1. Following activation, caspase-1 severs the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 to their biologically active forms, with consequent commencement of caspase-1-associated pyroptosis. This type of cell death by pyroptosis epitomizes a leading pathway of inflammation. Accumulating scientific documentation has recorded overstimulation of NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor protein 3) inflammasome involvement in a wide array of inflammatory conditions. IL-1beta is an archetypic inflammatory cytokine implicated in multiple types of inflammatory maladies. Approaches to impede IL-1beta's actions are possible, and their therapeutic effects have been clinically demonstrated; nevertheless, such strategies are associated with certain constraints. For instance, treatments that focus on systemically negating IL-1beta (i.e., anakinra, rilonacept, and canakinumab) have been reported to result in an escalated peril of infections. Therefore, given the therapeutic promise of an NLRP3 inhibitor, the concerted escalated venture of the scientific sorority in the advancement of small molecules focusing on direct NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition is quite predictable.
