34815595|t|Outcomes of older COVID-19 patients in Acute Care at Home, Southern HSC Trust, Northern Ireland, from March - June 2020.
34815595|a|INTRODUCTION: The older population has been most affected by COVID-19, with mortality rates of around 27%. The Acute Care at Home (ACAH) team aims to improve outcomes in the older population by preventing hospital admission or facilitating early discharge, allowing patients to be treated in their own environment. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ACAH team administered oxygen therapy, antibiotics, anticipatory medications and other vital interventions to combat the ill effects of COVID-19. METHOD: An observational approach has been used in this study. Patients were included if they were admitted to ACAH during March-June 2020 for treatment of COVID-19. Biochemistry, oxygen saturations and co-morbidities are among the studied parameters. Lymphocyte count and serum magnesium were compared with a non-COVID-19 cohort. Trends within parameters and associated mortality were analysed and tabulated. RESULTS: 70% of admissions were lymphopenic, whilst 54% were hypoxic. There was a 28-day mortality rate of 35%, with an 18% increase in mortality rate when comparing residence in long-term care facilities (LTCF) to personal residence. All patients had existing co-morbidities. CONCLUSION: The data indicates that hypoxaemia, hyperferritinaemia and hypermagnesaemia are associated with early mortality in the older population infected with COVID-19. National Early Warning Score and frailty score are predictive of mortality in this cohort, with higher scores correlating to worse outcomes. Those living in LTCF are at an increased risk of mortality. However, ACAH mortality rates are comparable to those admitted to hospital, validating the concept of ACAH. The highlighted trends can be used to improve outcomes in future admissions.
