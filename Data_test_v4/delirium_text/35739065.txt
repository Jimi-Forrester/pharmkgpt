However, there are no universally accepted cutoff values for the interpretation of AD biomarkers. The aim of this study is to determine the viability of a decision-tree method to analyse CSF biomarkers of AD as a support for clinical diagnosis. METHODS: A decision-tree method (automated classification analysis) was applied to concentrations of AD biomarkers in CSF as a support for clinical diagnosis in older adults with or without cognitive impairment in a Brazilian cohort. In brief, 272 older adults (68 with AD, 122 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 82 healthy controls) were assessed for CSF concentrations of Ass1-42, total-tau, and phosphorylated-tau using multiplexed Luminex assays; biomarker values were used to generate decision-tree algorithms (classification and regression tree) in the R statistical software environment. RESULTS: The best decision tree model had an accuracy of 74.65% to differentiate the three groups. Cluster analysis supported the combination of CSF biomarkers to differentiate AD and MCI vs. controls, suggesting the best cutoff values for each clinical condition. CONCLUSION: Automated analyses of AD biomarkers provide valuable information to support the clinical diagnosis of MCI and AD in research settings.
