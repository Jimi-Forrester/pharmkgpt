22546783|t|COGNOS: care for people with cognitive dysfunction: a national observational study.
22546783|a|Care plans are intended to improve the independence and functioning of patients with cognitive dysfunction and support the caregivers involved. They are an integral part of the Belgian reimbursement procedure for cholinesterase inhibitors. This nationwide, multicenter, observational study examined the content and implementation of the care plan along with patient satisfaction in community-dwelling patients newly diagnosed with Alzheimer disease in Belgium. The patients' opinion of their quality of life was measured using Anamnestic Comparative Self-Assessment (ACSA) scale. A total of 720 participants (453 female) were enrolled with 86.0% (619/719) living at home alone or with their spouse/partner. Cognitive problems (627/717, 87.4%) were the main reason for initiation of the consultation. Most patients had a caregiver (646/719, 89.8%): generally the spouse/partner (351/646, 54.3%) or a child (232/646, 35.9%). A total of 511 patients (71.0%) were prescribed a cholinesterase inhibitor after the initial consultation. A total of 236 care plans were advised with 169 (71.6%) realized and 157 of these (92.9%) considered adequate. Most patients were satisfied with the help received in the care plan (service satisfaction range, 80.0% to 98.6% of patients). Quality of life as rated by the patient significantly increased between baseline (average ACSA score: 5.2+-2.4) and follow-up (5.8+-2.1). The use of care plans appears to improve management of care for Alzheimer disease patients.
