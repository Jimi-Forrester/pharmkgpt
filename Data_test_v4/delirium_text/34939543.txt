34939543|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is still a great global challenge and agents with various mechanisms represent a promising therapeutic opportunity. Theracurmin, a very highly absorbable curcumin formulation, was shown to improve memory and attention in non-demented people. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of Theracurmin on disease course in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. METHODS: This follow-up study was performed retrospectively on 93 patients with MCI or AD. All patients underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment, including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), clock-drawing test, activities of daily living (ADL), at baseline and at the end of the 6th month. 19 patients with AD and 17 with MCI were treated with Theracurmin 180 mg/day per oral. RESULTS: MMSE, MOCA and instrumental ADL scores decreased in AD patients not treated with Theracurmin (p<0.001, p=0.011, and p=0.004, respectively), whereas these scores remained stable in those treated with Theracurmin. This stabilization in the instrumental ADL was also observed in MCI patients treated with Theracurmin. During the follow-up, three MCI patients who did not receive Theracurmin progressed to AD, whereas only one patient progressed in those who received it. CONCLUSION: Theracurmin seems to be a therapeutic option for elderly patients with AD and MCI via providing stabilization of the disease course by preventing progressive loss in cognitive functions and ADLs.
