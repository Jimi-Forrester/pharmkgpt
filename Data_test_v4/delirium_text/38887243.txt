38887243|t|Comparison of regional vs. general anesthesia on the risk of dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
38887243|a|Background: Dementia is a gradual and ongoing cognitive decline due to damage to nerve cells in the brain. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the potential relationship between regional anesthesia (RA) and the risk of dementia. Methods: Electronic databases including Embase, Medline, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies investigating the association between RA and dementia risk from inception to March 2022. The primary outcome was the risk of dementia in patients who underwent RA (RA group) and those who received general anesthesia (GA group). Secondary outcomes included identifying other potential risk factors for dementia and comparing dementia risk between individuals receiving RA and those not receiving surgery/anesthesia (placebo group). Results: Eight cohort studies published between 2014 and 2023 were included in this analysis. A meta-analysis of the available data demonstrated no differences in baseline characteristics and morbidities (i.e., age, male proportion, hypertension, diabetes, depression, and severe comorbidities) between the RA and GA groups (all p > 0.05). Initial analysis revealed that the risk of dementia was higher in the GA group than in the RA group (HR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.29-2.55, p = 0.007, I 2 = 99%, five studies). However, when a study featuring a relatively younger population was excluded from the sensitivity analysis, the results showed a similar risk of dementia (HR, 1.17; p = 0.13) between the GA and RA groups. The pooled results revealed no difference in dementia risk between the RA and placebo groups (HR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.69-2.07, p = 0.52, I 2 = 68%, three studies). Sensitivity analysis revealed that the evidence was not stable, suggesting that limited datasets precluded strong conclusions on this outcome. Anxiety, stroke history, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are potential predictors of dementia. Conclusion: Our results emphasize that, while RA could be protective against dementia risk compared to GA, the association between the type of anesthesia and dementia risk might vary among different age groups. Owing to the significant prevalence of dementia among older people and their surgical needs, further investigations are warranted to clarify the association between dementia risk and regional anesthesia.Systematic review registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, CRD42023411324.
