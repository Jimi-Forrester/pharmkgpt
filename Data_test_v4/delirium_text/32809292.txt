32809292|t|COVID-19 Delirium with Psychosis: A Case Report.
32809292|a|COVID-19 typically presents as severe pneumonia often requiring intubation and ICU management. Descriptions of the potential neurological symptoms in this disease state exist, but minimal research has been conducted on the prevalence of delirium. This case report describes a patient with no past psychiatric history who developed psychotic symptoms in the context of acute COVID-19 delirium. Clinicians should consider COVID-19 in their differential diagnosis with any patient who presents with psychotic symptoms, even in the absence of the typical COVID-19 symptoms of cough or fever. Rule out of COVID-19 via PCR should be completed on any new delirium case, and appropriate isolation of psychiatric patients should occur until negative results are obtained.
