39180225|t|X and Y Differences in Melanoma Survival Between the Sexes.
39180225|a|Marked differences in survival from melanoma are noted between men and women that cannot be accounted for by behavioral differences. We and others have provided evidence that this difference may be due to increased expression of immune-related genes from the second X chromosome because of failure of X inactivation. In the present review, we have examined evidence for the contrary view that survival differences are due to weaker immune responses in males. One reason for this may be the loss of Y chromosomes (LOY), particularly in older males. The genes involved may have direct roles in immune responses or be noncoding RNAs that regulate both sex and autosomal genes involved in immune responses or tumor growth. Loss of the KDM6C and KDM5D demethylases appeared to common genes involved. The second factor appears to be the activation of androgen receptors (AR) on melanoma cells that increase their invasiveness and growth. Induction of T-cell exhaustion by AR that limits immune responses against melanoma appeared a common finding. The development of treatments to overcome effects related to gene loss on Y poses challenges, but several avenues related to AR signaling appear worthy of further study in the treatment of metastatic disease.
