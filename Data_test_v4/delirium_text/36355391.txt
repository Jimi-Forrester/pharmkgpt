36355391|a|Stressful life increases the risk of mental and psychological disorders and cognitive deficits. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that has been recently discovered in mammalians. ABA is produced in response to stressful stimuli and it can reduce anxiety-like behaviors and depression and improve cognitive function. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of microinjection of ABA on depression, anxiety, passive avoidance learning and memory deficits induced by subchronic stress. ABA (10 and 15  mu $ umu $  g/mouse, i.c.v.) was administered one week after recovery period for 4 consecutive days. A three-session forced swimming test (FST) protocol for induction of subchronic stress was administered to the mice. Exploratory, anxiety-like behavior, depression and cognitive function were assessed 24 h after the last swim stress session. The results indicated that ABA (15  mu $ umu $  g/mouse) could ameliorate anxiety and depression induced by FST. In addition, ABA had no effect on the subchronic stress-induced cognitive impairments. Taken together, the results suggest that ABA could improve anxiety and depression induced by subchronic stress.
