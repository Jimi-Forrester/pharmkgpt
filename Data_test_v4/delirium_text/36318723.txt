36318723|t|Radiation and CNS effects: summary of evidence from a recent symposium of the Radiation Research Society.
36318723|a|This article summarizes a Symposium on 'Radiation risks of the central nervous system' held virtually at the 67th Annual Meeting of the Radiation Research Society, 3-6 October 2021. Repeated low-dose radiation exposure over a certain period could lead to reduced neuronal proliferation, altered neurogenesis, neuroinflammation and various neurological complications, including psychological consequences, necessitating further research in these areas. Four speakers from radiation biology, genetics and epidemiology presented the latest data from their studies seeking insights into this important topic. This symposium highlighted new and important directions for further research on mental health disorders, neurodegenerative conditions and cognitive impairment. Future studies will examine risks of mental and behavioral disorders and neurodegenerative diseases following protracted radiation exposures to better understand risks of occupational exposures as well as provide insights into risks from exposures to galactic cosmic rays.
