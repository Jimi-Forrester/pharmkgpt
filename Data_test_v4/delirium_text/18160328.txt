18160328|a|A growing body of evidence supports a central role for biometals in neurodegenerative disorders. Biometals induce oxidative stress through the generation of reactive oxygen species and contribute to neuronal cell dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD), prion disorders and Parkinson's disease (PD). Therapies based on modulation of biometal metabolism are currently being developed and the metal ligand, 5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline (clioquinol or CQ) has been investigated for the treatment of AD. CQ has also shown therapeutic benefits in an animal model of PD. However, little is known about the neuroprotective processes of CQ in vivo. In this study, we examined the effect of CQ in BE(2)-M17 human neuroblastoma cells exposed to increased oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment). Although CQ alone induced a moderate toxic effect on cells, when added to H2O2-treated M17 cells, CQ induced a significant inhibition of H2O2 toxicity. This correlated with up-regulation of phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) activity in CQ-treated cells. The protective action of CQ was not observed in murine N2a neuroblastoma cells treated with H2O2 and this cell-line did not reveal CQ-mediated increases in PI3K activation. The protective effect was specific for CQ and was not induced by a number of different metal ligands. Inhibition of PI3K activity with LY294002 prevented CQ protection against H2O2 toxicity, demonstrating a crucial role for CQ activation of PI3K in protection against oxidative stress. Furthermore, CQ inhibited H2O2-mediated up-regulation of p53 activity in the M17 cells and this was dependent on PI3K activation. Our studies demonstrate that in human M17 cells, CQ can protect against oxidative stress by activating the PI3K-dependent survival pathway and blocking p53-mediated cell death. These findings have important implications for the development of protective metal ligand-based therapies for treatment of disorders involving oxidative stress.
