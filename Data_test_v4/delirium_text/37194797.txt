37194797|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations among race/color, gender, and intrinsic capacity (IC) (total and by domains) in middle-aged and older adults from a Brazilian cohort. As a secondary objective, we investigate these associations across Brazilian regions. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted with baseline data from the 2015-2016 Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil). IC was investigated via cognitive (verbal fluency), physical (gait velocity/handgrip), and psychosocial (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression) domains. Moreover, IC sensory domain was evaluated via self-reported sensory disease diagnoses (vision and/or hearing impairment) and race/color was identified via self-reported criteria. RESULTS: We evaluated a total of 9,070 participants (aged >= 50 years). Black and Brown participants were 80% and 41% more likely to show a worse IC cognitive domain than white controls, respectively (OR = 1.80, 95%CI: 1.42-2.28, p < 0.001 and OR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.21-1.65, p < 0.001). Moreover, Black and Brown women had almost a threefold greater chance of showing a worse IC than white men (OR = 2.91, 95%CI: 1.89-4.47, p < 0.001 and OR = 2.51, 95%CI: 2.09 - 3.02, p < 0.001) and a 62% (OR = 1.62, 95%CI: 1.02-2.57) and 32% (OR = 1.32, 95%CI: 1.10-1.57) greater risk of falling below our IC score cutoff point than white women. We found the greatest differences in the Brazilian South, whereas its North showed the lowest associations among race/color, gender, and IC. CONCLUSION: IC racial and gender disparities reinforce the need for public health policies to guarantee equality during aging. Promoting greater access to good health care requires understanding how racism and sexism can contribute to health inequities and their consequences in different Brazilian regions.
