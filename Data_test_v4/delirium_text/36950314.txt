36950314|a|Objective: To explore the key factors affecting the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. Methods: Based on the GEO dataset and differential expression analysis of normal and osteosarcoma tissues, the gene modules related to the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients were screened by WGCNA, and intersecting genes were taken with differential genes, and the risk prognosis model of osteosarcoma patients was constructed by LASSO regression analysis of intersecting genes, and the prognosis-related factors of osteosarcoma patients were obtained by survival analysis, followed by target for validation, and finally, the expression of prognostic factors and their effects on osteosarcoma cell migration were verified by cellular assays and lentiviral transfection experiments. Results: The prognosis-related gene module of osteosarcoma patients were intersected with differential genes to obtain a total of 9 common genes. PARM1 was found to be a prognostic factor in osteosarcoma patients by LASSO regression analysis, followed by cellular assays to verify that PARM1 was lowly expressed in osteosarcoma cells and that overexpression of PARM1 in osteosarcoma cells inhibited cell migration. Pan-cancer analysis showed that PARM1 was lowly expressed in most cancers and that low expression of PARM1 predicted poor prognosis for patients. Conclusion: The data from this study suggest that PARM1 is closely associated with the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients, and PARM1 may serve as a novel potential prognostic target for osteosarcoma, providing a heartfelt direction for the prevention and treatment of osteosarcoma.
