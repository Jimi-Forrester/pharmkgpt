32951372|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium is a common disorder, affecting many patients in nursing-homes, with large impact on patients. Implementation of good care and treatment can potentially prevent development of a delirium or may reduce the severity or duration. This research was conducted to get an impression of delirium care in Dutch nursing homes, and of the implementation of the recommendations of the national guideline. OBJECTIVES: 1. How many Dutch nursing homes have a local protocol for delirium?2. To what extend do doctors, specialised in care for older people in nursing homes, screen, diagnose and treat delirium according to the Dutch guideline for delirium? METHODS: Between June and December 2016, Dutch nursing homes were approached with an online questionnaire. Data were collected in Survey Monkey and descriptive analyses were performed. RESULTS: 68 nursing homes were included. 32% of the nursing homes had a local delirium protocol. 48% of the doctors knew about the national guideline delirium, 60% used preventive measures, and screening instruments were used in 98%. 29% used diagnostic criteria. Non-medical interventions were applied by 96%. In 98%, haloperidol was the drug of first choice. Preventive antipsychotics were prescribed by 21%. CONCLUSIONS: Only a third of the organisations developed a local delirium protocol. Standardising delirium care by a local delirium protocol, with special attention for prevention, diagnostics and aftercare of delirium, can be an important step in improving the quality of care in nursing homes.
