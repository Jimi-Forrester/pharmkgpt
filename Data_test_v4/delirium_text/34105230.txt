34105230|t|Association of regional white matter hyperintensity volumes with cognitive dysfunction and vascular risk factors in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment.
34105230|a|AIM: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been reported to promote neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, little is known about the association between regional WMH (rWMH) and cognitive dysfunction in MCI. We hence investigated the associations between rWMH volumes and cognitive dysfunction in MCI. METHODS: Thirty-eight subjects with amnestic MCI were analysed. The volumes of periventricular hyperintensities (PVH) and deep WMH (DWMH) were measured on a T2-FLAIR MRI using a 3D-slicer, and regional PVH and DWMH (rPVH and rDWMH) volumes were calculated. The associations of rPVH and rDWMH volumes with cognition and blood levels of various molecules were investigated. Furthermore, rPVH and rDWMH volumes were compared between MCI with vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and dyslipidemia, and those without these risk factors. RESULTS: rPVH volume (bilateral cornu frontale, pars parietalis, and cornu occipitale) positively correlated with Trail Making Test-A/B scores and CysC level, whereas rDWMH volume did not correlate with any of the items. rPVH volumes (right cornu frontale, bilateral pars parietalis and cornu occipitale, and right pars temporalis) and rDWMH volumes (left frontal and parietal lobes) were significantly larger in MCI patients with DM than in those without. CONCLUSIONS: PVH volumes (bilateral areas of cornu frontale, pars parietalis, and cornu occipitale) were closely associated with attention and executive dysfunction. Serum CysC level and DM were associated with WMH volume, suggesting that CysC level and DM might be important markers for determining treatment strategies for white matter abnormalities in MCI.
