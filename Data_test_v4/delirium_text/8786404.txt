8786404|t|Immunolocalization and redistribution of the FAC1 protein in Alzheimer's disease.
8786404|a|The presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are hallmark neuropathologic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many proteins have previously been immunolocalized to amyloid-containing plaques in AD brain. Using a monoclonal antibody to a recently described developmentally regulated gene product, we demonstrate the presence of FAC1 protein in a subset of diffuse and neuritic plaques in AD brain. FAC1 is not observed in neurofibrillary tangles common in the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex, nor is it localized in diffuse plaques of nondemented elderly control subjects. FAC1 protein is also immunolocalized in swollen dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells observed in some cases of early stage AD. Therefore, FAC1 is a novel protein localized in early pathologic features of AD and in a subset of plaques.
