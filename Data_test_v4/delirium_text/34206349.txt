34206349|t|A Prediction Model for Severe Complications after Elective Colorectal Cancer Surgery in Patients of 70 Years and Older.
34206349|a|Introduction Older patients have an increased risk of morbidity and mortality after colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery. Existing CRC surgical prediction models have not incorporated geriatric predictors, limiting applicability for preoperative decision-making. The objective was to develop and internally validate a predictive model based on preoperative predictors, including geriatric characteristics, for severe postoperative complications after elective surgery for stage I-III CRC in patients >=70 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospectively collected database contained 1088 consecutive patients from five Dutch hospitals (2014-2017) with 171 severe complications (16%). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used for predictor selection and prediction model building. Internal validation was done using bootstrapping. RESULTS: A geriatric model that included gender, previous DVT or pulmonary embolism, COPD/asthma/emphysema, rectal cancer, the use of a mobility aid, ADL assistance, previous delirium and polypharmacy showed satisfactory discrimination with an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI 0.73-0.64); the AUC for the optimism corrected model was 0.65. Based on these predictors, the eight-item colorectal geriatric model (GerCRC) was developed. CONCLUSION: The GerCRC is the first prediction model specifically developed for older patients expected to undergo CRC surgery. Combining tumour- and patient-specific predictors, including geriatric predictors, improves outcome prediction in the heterogeneous older population.
