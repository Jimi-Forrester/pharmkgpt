11063050|t|Caspase pathways, neuronal apoptosis, and CNS injury.
11063050|a|Caspases are a family of mammalian proteases related to the ced-3 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans. They mediate many of the morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis, including structural dismantling of cell bodies and nuclei, fragmentation of genomic DNA, destruction of regulatory proteins, and propagation of other pro-apoptotic molecules. Based on their substrate specificities and DNA sequence homologies, the 14 currently identified caspases may be divided into three groups: apoptotic initiators, apoptotic executioners, and inflammatory mediators. Caspases are activated through two principal pathways, known as the "extrinsic pathway," which is initiated by cell surface death receptor ligation, and the intrinsic pathway, which arises from mitochondria. Endogenous inhibitors, such as the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family, modulate caspase activity at various points within these pathways. Upon activation, caspases appear to play an important role in sequelae of traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and cerebral ischemia. In addition, they may also play a role in mediating cell death in chronic neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This article reviews the current literature on the role of caspases in acute and chronic CNS injury, and provides evidence for the potential therapeutic use of caspase inhibitors in the setting of these conditions.
