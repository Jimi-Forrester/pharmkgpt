39177606|t|Characterization of Ptau181 Among a Diverse Community-Based Cohort: A HABS-HD Study.
39177606|a|Background: Examination of Alzheimer's disease (AD) related biomarkers among diverse communities has remained limited. Objective: The aim of this study was to expand on prior work to provide a characterization of ptau181 among a diverse community sample. Consideration was taken regarding the impact of comorbidities on ptau181 levels including medical. Methods: 3,228 (n = 770 African American [AA], n = 1,231 Hispanic, and n = 1,227 non-Hispanic white [NHW]) Health and Aging Brain Study- Health Disparities (HABS-HD) participants were included in this study. ANCOVAs were conducted to examine differences in ptau181 levels across race and ethnic groups. Violin plots were also generated stratified by APOEe4 carrier status, Amyloid PET positivity status, medical comorbidity (hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease [CKD], and diabetes) and by cognitive diagnosis. Results: Ptau181 levels were found to differ between Hispanics and NHW after covarying for age, sex, and APOEe4 status. Amyloid PET positivity was associated with higher ptau181 levels across all groups. APOEe4 positivity status was only significantly associated with ptau181 levels among AAs. Across all race and ethnic groups, those with a diagnosis of CKD had higher levels of ptau181. When stratified by cognitive diagnosis, cognitively unimpaired Hispanics had higher ptau181 if they also had a diagnosis of CKD or diabetes. p-values <=0.01. Conclusions: Differences in ptau181 levels were shown in a diverse community sample. Medical comorbidities had a differing effect on ptau181 levels particularly among Hispanics even without cognitive impairment. Findings support the need for future work to consider comorbid conditions when examining the utility of ptau181.
