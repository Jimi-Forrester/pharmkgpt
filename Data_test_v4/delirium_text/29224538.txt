29224538|a|Preview Abrupt changes in consciousness or attention span are not normal at any age. No healthcare professional would ignore these signs of delirium in a 30-year-old, but the authors note that such changes are often ignored (or worse, treated with tranquilizers) in older patients. A gradually decreasing ability to reason, to remember, and to exercise appropriate judgment is not normal either. The authors describe careful evaluation of patients exhibiting such changes, with particular emphasis on seeking potentially reversible causes.
