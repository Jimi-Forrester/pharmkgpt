34941776|t|Alterations in CNS Functions and DNA Methylation in Rats after 24 h Exposure to Peat Smoke.
34941776|a|The use of a developed experimental model of a natural fire made it possible to assess the consequences of 24 h exposure to peat combustion products in albino rats. Peat smoke exposure leads to behavioral disturbances in rats, characterized by an increase in locomotor activity and an increased level of anxiety. Indicators of brain bioelectrical activity of the exposed animals supported the state of anxiety and psychoemotional stress. Epigenetic changes in the blood cells of exposed animals were revealed under 24 h exposure to peat smoke, characterized by a decrease in the level of global DNA methylation.
