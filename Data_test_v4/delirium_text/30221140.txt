30221140|t|More Than an Association: Latent Toxoplasmosis Might Provoke a Local Oxidative Stress That Triggers the Development of Bipolar Disorder.
30221140|a|INTRODUCTION: Toxoplasma gondii, a common parasitic infection, has a special affinity to the brain. It has a lifelong existence without an apparent clinical disease. While the etiology of bipolar disorder (BD) remains unclear, epidemiological studies suggest a role for infections. Central nervous system is particularly susceptible to oxidative stress (OS) because of its high metabolic rate and its low levels of antioxidant defenses. OS is a contributor to the initiation and progression of many neurological illnesses. OS injury is a constantly and compelling finding associated with BD and toxoplasmosis. AIM: This cross-sectional study has investigated a possible role of toxoplasma-induced OS in the development of BD. METHODS: Healthy controls and BD patients were examined for anti-Toxoplasma immunoglobulin-G (IgG) and two protein (3-nitrotyrosine) and DNA (8-hydroxy-2' deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG]) OS markers. RESULTS: Toxoplasma positivity was higher (40%) among BD patients compared to controls (12%). Significantly higher levels of anti-Toxoplasma IgG were detected in BD patients compared to controls. Nitrotyrosine (796.7 +- 106.28) and especially 8-OHdG (20.31 +- 8.38) were significantly higher among toxo-positive BD compared to toxo-negative BD (675.97 +- 144.19 and 7.44 +- 2.86) and healthy controls (464.02 +- 134.6 and 4.17 +- 1.43). CONCLUSION: These findings might indicate a role for Toxoplasma infection in the development of BD, possibly through creating a highly oxidative brain environment.
