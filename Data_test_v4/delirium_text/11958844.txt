11958844|a|Cells cultured from Alzheimer disease leptomeninges or skin were grafted into the cortex of adult thymectomized rats. At 3 days post-implant, plaque-like aggregates were found in the cortex, corpus callosum, septum and caudate nucleus. These structures were immunopositive for human amyloid precursor protein (APP), human amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), cathepsin D, apolipoprotein E and ubiquitin. Aberrant tau+ neurites, reactive astrocytes and microglia were associated with many aggregates. Although birefringent amyloid occupied the central area of most aggregates, these structures had disappeared by l month post-implant. Abeta and APP produced by grafted non-neural human cells can penetrate rat brain and form plaque-like structures, which can be effectively cleared by the rat.
