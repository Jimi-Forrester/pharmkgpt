29457334|t|Establishing a successful perioperative geriatric service in an Australian acute surgical unit.
29457334|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of a perioperative geriatric service (PGS) in an acute surgical unit (ASU) on patient and organizational outcomes. METHODS: Single centre retrospective cohort study. Inclusion criteria were patients over the age of 65 admitted to the ASU between January and June 2014 (pre-PGS) and 2015 (post-PGS). Chart reviews were performed to identify outcomes of interest including in-hospital morbidity and mortality, length of stay (LOS), 30-day representation and mortality. RESULTS: Geriatric admissions increased by 32% over the two study periods (154 pre-PGS and 203 post-PGS). Surgical intervention increased by 11% (P = 0.01). Significantly more medical complications (14% versus 33%, P < 0.001) were identified after the implementation of the PGS. Recognition of delirium in the over 80s also increased by 57%. Rate of surgical complications was unchanged over the study (28% pre-PGS and 34% post-PGS, P = 0.6). In-hospital (<1%, P = 0.5) and 30-day mortality (<1%, P = 0.6) remained low, as did 30-day representation (10% versus 8%, P = 0.5). A trend towards decreased LOS of 1 day was identified after the implementation of the PGS (P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated successful implementation of a PGS into an ASU. This multi-disciplinary approach has been effective in maintaining low numbers of surgical complications, in-hospital mortality, LOS and patient representations despite an increased number of medical complications. This likely reflects more timely recognition and intervention of medically unwell patients with the PGS.
