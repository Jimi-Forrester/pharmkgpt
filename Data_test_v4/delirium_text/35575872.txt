35575872|a|The pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include formation of senile plaques resulting from amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles caused by tau hyperphosphorylation. Reducing tau hyperphosphorylation is crucial for treatment of AD. Network pharmacology analysis showed that CTS may reduce tau hyperphosphorylation by regulating the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinases/protein kinase B/ glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta) pathway. We investigated the ability of cryptotanshinone (CTS) to reduce Abeta-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and characterized the underlying mechanisms. Amyloid-beta42 oligomers (AbetaO) were used to establish an AD model in HT22 cells. The expression levels of tau and related proteins in PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta pathway were measured using western blot and immunofluorescence staining. The above-mentioned proteins were then evaluated in an okadaic acid (OKA)-induced AD cell model to verify the results. Synapse-associated proteins including post-synaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) and synaptophysin were also evaluated. We found that CTS significantly reduced tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser202, Ser404, Thr181, and Thr231 in AbetaO- and OKA-induced cell models. Moreover, we also found that CTS reversed AbetaO-induced reductions in the levels of PSD95 and synaptophysin. We used LY294002 to block PI3K and the results showed that CTS exerted neuroprotective effects through regulation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta signaling pathway. In summary, we showed for the first time that CTS inhibited AD-related tau hyperphosphorylation and reduced the effects of AbetaO on the expression levels of PSD95 and synaptophysin via the PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta pathway in HT22 cells.
