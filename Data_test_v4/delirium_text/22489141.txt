22489141|t|Unraveling the early events of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) aggregation: techniques for the determination of Abeta aggregate size.
22489141|a|The aggregation of proteins into insoluble amyloid fibrils coincides with the onset of numerous diseases. An array of techniques is available to study the different stages of the amyloid aggregation process. Recently, emphasis has been placed upon the analysis of oligomeric amyloid species, which have been hypothesized to play a key role in disease progression. This paper reviews techniques utilized to study aggregation of the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) associated with Alzheimer's disease. In particular, the review focuses on techniques that provide information about the size or quantity of oligomeric Abeta species formed during the early stages of aggregation, including native-PAGE, SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, capillary electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, light scattering, size exclusion chromatography, centrifugation, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and dot blotting.
