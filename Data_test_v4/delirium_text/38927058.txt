38927058|a|The retina, a tissue of the central nervous system, is vital for vision as its photoreceptors capture light and transform it into electrical signals, which are further processed before they are sent to the brain to be interpreted as images. The retina is unique in that it is continuously exposed to light and has the highest metabolic rate and demand for energy amongst all the tissues in the body. Consequently, the retina is very susceptible to oxidative stress. VDAC, a pore in the outer membrane of mitochondria, shuttles metabolites between mitochondria and the cytosol and normally protects cells from oxidative damage, but when a cell's integrity is greatly compromised it initiates cell death. There are three isoforms of VDAC, and existing evidence indicates that all three are expressed in the retina. However, their precise localization and function in each cell type is unknown. It appears that most retinal cells express substantial amounts of VDAC2 and VDAC3, presumably to protect them from oxidative stress. Photoreceptors express VDAC2, HK2, and PKM2-key proteins in the Warburg pathway that also protect these cells. Consistent with its role in initiating cell death, VDAC is overexpressed in the retinal degenerative diseases retinitis pigmentosa, age related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma. Treatment with antioxidants or inhibiting VDAC oligomerization reduced its expression and improved cell survival. Thus, VDAC may be a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of these diseases.
