38941706|t|Cortex-to-caudate volume ratio as a predictor of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.
38941706|a|BACKGROUND: Brain and cortical atrophy play crucial roles in supporting the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study hypothesized that the ratios of brain or cortical volume to subcortical gray matter structure volumes are potential imaging markers for cognitive alterations in AD dementia and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). METHODS: Seventy-seven subjects diagnosed with AD dementia or aMCI underwent baseline neuropsychological testing, 2-year follow-up cognitive assessments, and high-resolution T1-weighted MRI scans. Total brain/cortical volume and subcortical gray matter structure volumes were automatically segmented and measured. Univariate and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the associations between volumetric ratios and interval changes in cognitive scores. RESULTS: The ratio of cortical volume to caudate volume showed the most significant association with changes in MoCA (B = 0.132, SE = 0.042, p = 0.002), MMSE (B = 0.140, SE = 0.040, p = 0.001), and CDR-SOB (B = -0.013, SE = 0.005, p = 0.007) scores over the 2-year follow-up period. These associations remained significant after adjusting for various covariates. Similar associations were observed for the ratios of cortical volume to putamen and globus pallidum volumes. CONCLUSIONS: The cortex-to-caudate volume ratio is significantly associated with cognitive decline in AD dementia and aMCI. This ratio may serve as a useful biomarker for monitoring disease progression and predicting cognitive outcomes. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the relative atrophy of cortical and subcortical structures in understanding AD pathology.
