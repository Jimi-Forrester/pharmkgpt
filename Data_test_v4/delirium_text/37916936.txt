37916936|t|A Longitudinal Evaluation of the Pattern of Social Cognition Impairment in Brazilians With Alzheimer's Disease.

Our objective was to longitudinally investigate the relationship between SC and cognitive and clinical variables in persons with AD and their caregivers. We also evaluated the different SC predictors from 3 perspectives: people with AD, caregivers of people with AD, and discrepancy analysis. METHODS: In all, 137 dyads (people with AD and their caregivers) underwent 2 assessments: at baseline (M1) and after 1 year (M2). During follow-up, 58 dyads were excluded, and the study was thus concluded with 79. RESULTS: Longitudinal analysis of the people with AD showed that while some cognitive functions declined (which is consistent with disease progression), SC impairments showed a more stable pattern. Another interesting result was related to SC predictors. For people with AD, SC was associated with cognition at both time points. For caregivers, besides cognition, other predictors included reduced functional abilities and quality of life in people with AD. These results are consistent with the discrepancy predictors. CONCLUSION: The stable pattern in SC functioning over 12 months in AD suggests that this neurocognitive domain may be influenced more by emotional processing than by cognitive impairment. In addition, the SC predictors showed that the investigation of different points of view enables a more global understanding, contributing to better and more targeted treatment for the patient.
