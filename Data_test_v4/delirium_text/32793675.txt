32793675|a|Durable mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices revolutionized the treatment options for patients with end-stage heart failure (HF). Implantation of durable mechanical support has become an integral treatment modality in end-stage HF patients and it is associated with improved quality of life and survival. There is no doubt that this needs an interdisciplinary and interprofessional approach of cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, cardiac anesthesiologists, perfusionists, intensivists, psychologists, assist device coordinators as well as physiotherapists and intensive care. Implantation of durable MCS is a challenging procedure for the anesthesiologist due to the patient's characteristics and comorbid diseases. It demands comprehensive training, high vigilance and quick response during the acute hemodynamic changes occurring during the surgery. Preoperative risk stratification is of major importance to guide perioperative medical treatment strategies. Most of these patients have several comorbidities and multiple medications. Therefore, to anticipate postoperative end-organ dysfunction such as cognitive dysfunction, pulmonary or renal failure, an interdisciplinary approach is necessary to optimize patient's prior surgery. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography (TTE and TEE), both play an invaluable role in diagnosing the cause and guiding the management in different unstable clinical situations. Especially prevention of postoperative right HF with subsequent necessity of temporary MCS is important as it is associated with higher mortality. The aim of this review is to provide an overview about the current concepts of perioperative management for durable MCS. A multimodal standard operating procedure supports early recovery after surgery and intensive care stay. Standardized perioperative care helps to ensure optimal medical treatment. This review focusses on several major skills of perioperative management of these high-risk surgical patients.
