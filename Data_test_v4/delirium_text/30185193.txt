30185193|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to empirically compare the performance of two generic preference based quality of life instruments, EQ-5D-3 L (with a health and physical function focus) and ICECAP-O (with a wellbeing and capability focus), in a population of older Australians following hip fracture. METHODS: Older adults or their family member proxies (in cases of severe cognitive impairment) following surgery to repair a fractured hip were invited to take part in this cross sectional study. Inclusion criteria included an age of 60 years or older, confirmed falls-related hip fracture and those receiving current palliative care or consented to other research studies were excluded. 87 participants completed the ICECAP-O and EQ-5D-3 L instruments between one and three weeks post-surgery. RESULTS: For the hip fracture population, the mean ICECAP-O score was 0.639 (SD 0.206, n = 82) and the mean EQ-5D-3 L utility score was 0.545 (SD 0.251, n = 87). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the ICECAP-O and EQ-5D-3 L scores (r = 0.529, p = < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Study findings indicate significant impairments in quality of life post hip fracture. In multiple regression analyses, age and health-related QoL (measured by the EQ-5D) were significant determinants of ICECAP-O scores, while proxy respondent status, age, and capability-related QoL (measured by the ICECAP-O) were significant determinants of EQ-5D scores. Approaches to measuring and valuing quality of life in this sample, should consider the target domains of the intervention in their choice of instrument. Studies aiming to measure the impact of interventions targeting broader domains of wellbeing and QoL should consider including a broader measure of QoL in conjunction with a HRQoL measure.
