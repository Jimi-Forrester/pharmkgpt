35176883|t|Assessing the Accuracy of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) Coding for Delirium.
35176883|a|OBJECTIVE: We assessed the accuracy of the ICD-10 code for delirium (F05) and its relationship with delirium discharge summary documentation. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review at three academic hospitals. The Chart-based Delirium Identification Instrument (CHART-DEL) was used to identify 108 hospitalized patients aged >=65 years with delirium, and 758 patients without delirium as controls. We assessed the proportion of patients who received the F05 code and calculated the sensitivity and specificity. We compared the rates of F05 code received between patients with and without "delirium" documented in the discharge summary. RESULTS: Among delirious patients, 46.3% received a F05 code, which has a sensitivity of 46.3% and specificity of 99.6% for delirium. Of charts with "delirium" in the discharge summary (n = 67), 67.2% were appropriately coded. CONCLUSIONS: Current ICD-10 data inadequately capture delirium. Delirium documentation in the discharge summary is associated with improved delirium coding.
