30596496|a|The effects of electric field (EF) on amyloid proteins have been given increasing attention in regulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation and therapeutic methods because of prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. Herein, for the first time, aptamer was used as a tool for investigating the effects of EF on Abeta40 monomer and Abeta40 aggregates (Abeta40 oligomer and Abeta40 fibril) by single-molecule force spectroscopy. Interestingly, EF had different effects on Abeta40 monomer and Abeta40 aggregates, which might be due to the interactions of aptamer with EF-treated Abeta40 monomer and Abeta40 aggregates. With application of EF to Abeta40 oligomer, specific interaction and binding probability of aptamer-Abeta40 oligomer slightly increased. However, the interactions of aptamer with Abeta40 monomer and Abeta40 fibril changed greatly when EF was respectively applied to Abeta40 monomer and Abeta40 fibril. Meanwhile, the interaction of aptamer with Abeta40 monomer changed from nonspecific binding to specific binding. And the rupture force distribution of aptamer-Abeta40 fibril changed from bimodal distribution to unimodal distribution. Hence, it was presumed that Abeta40 oligomer almost maintained oligomeric structure, while Abeta40 fibril and Abeta40 monomer changed into Abeta40 oligomer when EF was applied. Subsequently, this presumption was mainly verified by atomic force microscopy imaging and circular dichroism. This work testifies that aptamer may be a valuable tool to investigate effects of EF on Abeta40 monomer and Abeta40 aggregates. Moreover, the established method provides a new perspective to study aggregation of amyloid proteins.
