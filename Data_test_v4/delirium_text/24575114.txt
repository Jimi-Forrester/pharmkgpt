24575114|t|Postural stability analysis with inertial measurement units in Alzheimer's disease.
24575114|a|BACKGROUND: The cause of frequent falls in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still not well understood. Nevertheless, balance control and sensory organization are known to be critical for moving safely and adapting to the environment. METHODS: We evaluated postural stability in 20 AD patients (11 fallers and 9 nonfallers) and 16 healthy controls with an inertial measurement unit (triaxial accelerometers and gyroscopes) attached to the center of mass (COM) in different balance conditions (Romberg on flat surface and frontward/backward-inclined surface, with or without visual suppression) in a motor lab. RESULTS: In AD patients, the group of fallers showed a different kinetic pattern of postural stability characterized by higher vulnerability to visual suppression, higher total/maximal displacement and a mediolateral/anteroposterior range of sway, and a consequent need for more corrections of COM pitch and roll angles. CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed to consolidate the normative values of the discriminatory kinetic variables with the potential of inclusion in a multifactorial analysis of the risk of falls. Nevertheless, these results highlight signs of impairment of central postural control in AD, which may require early therapeutic intervention.
