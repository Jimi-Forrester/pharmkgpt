28695482|t|Role of Apolipoproteins and alpha-Synuclein in Parkinson's Disease.
28695482|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive brain disorder that interferes with activities of normal life. The main pathological feature of this disease is the loss of more than 80% of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Dopaminergic neuronal cell death occurs when intraneuronal, insoluble, aggregated proteins start to form Lewy bodies (LBs), the most important component of which is a protein called alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn). alpha-Syn structurally contains hexameric repeats of 11 amino acids, which are characteristic of apolipoproteins and thus alpha-syn can also be considered an apolipoprotein. Moreover, apolipoproteins seem to be involved in the incidence and development of PD. Some apolipoproteins such as ApoD have a neuroprotective role in the brain. In PD, apoD levels increase in glial cells surrounding dopaminergic cells. However, elevated levels of some other apolipoproteins such as ApaA1 and ApoE are reported as a vulnerability factor of PD. At present, when a clinical diagnosis of PD is made, based on symptoms such as shaking, stiff muscles and slow movement, serious damage has already been done to nerve cells of the SN. The diagnosis of PD in its earlier stages, before this irreversible damage, would be of enormous benefit for future treatment strategies designed to slow or halt the progression of PD. This review presents the roles of apolipoproteins and alpha-syn in PD and how some of them could potentially be used as biomarkers for PD.
