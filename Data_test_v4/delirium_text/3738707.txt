3738707|t|Delirium in surgical patients seen at psychiatric consultation.
3738707|a|All 150 psychiatric consultations performed upon patients hospitalized on the Surgery service at The Johns Hopkins Hospital during a period of two years were studied with particular attention to delirium which was found in 20.7 per cent of the patients. Delirium was the most common psychosis in elderly and postoperative patients. Mood disturbance was the most common reason given for request for psychiatric consultation (39.3 per cent). Delirium was diagnosed in 26.3 per cent of those patients. Delirium is a common syndrome and presents as altered consciousness with cognitive impairment. It is often not appreciated by the surgeon because of the impressive nature of associated symptoms which might be given undue emphasis. Assessment of consciousness and cognitive function should be performed promptly whenever psychiatric disorders are suspected.
