12119919|t|A relaxation training program to increase self-efficacy for anxiety control in Alzheimer family caregivers.
12119919|a|This study investigated whether relaxation training would increase caregivers' self-efficacy for controlling anxiety associated with difficult behaviors by care recipients. Thirty-six individuals caring for relatives with Alzheimer's disease were taught four types of relaxation techniques. Caregivers' self-efficacy increased following the intervention. Length of time spent in the caregiving role and duration of time since care recipients' diagnosis were significantly related to caregiver self-efficacy before the intervention, but became non-significant following the intervention. An insignificant decrease in incidence of reported behavioral problems occurred following the intervention.
