35192237|t|Melatonin and aggressive behavior: A systematic review of the literature on preclinical and clinical evidence.
35192237|a|The melatonin system and circadian disruption have well-established links with aggressive behaviors; however, the biological underpinnings have not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we aimed at examining the current knowledge regarding the neurobiological and psychopharmacological involvement of the melatonin system in aggressive/violent behaviors. To this end, we performed a systematic review on Embase and Pubmed/MEDLINE of preclinical and clinical evidence linking the melatonin system, melatonin, and melatoninergic drugs with aggressive/violent behaviors. Two blinded raters performed an independent screening of the relevant literature. Overall, this review included 38 papers distributed between clinical and preclinical models. Eleven papers specifically addressed the existing evidence in rodent models, five in fish models, and 21 in humans. The data indicate that depending on the species, model, and timing of administration, melatonin may exert a complex influence on aggressive/violent behaviors. Particularly, the apparent contrasting findings on the link between the melatonin system and aggression/violence (with either increased, no, or decreased effect) shown in preclinical models underscore the need for further research to develop more accurate and fruitful translational models. Likewise, the significant heterogeneity found in the results of clinical studies does not allow yet to draw any firm conclusion on the efficacy of melatonin or melatonergic drugs on aggressive/violent behaviors. However, findings in children and in traits associated with aggressive/violent behavior, including irritability and anger, are emerging and deserve empirical attention given the low toxicity of melatonin and melatonergic drugs.
