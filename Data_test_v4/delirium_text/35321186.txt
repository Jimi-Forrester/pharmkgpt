35321186|t|Quetiapine-related acute lung injury: A case report.
35321186|a|BACKGROUND: Quetiapine, known as a non-classical antipsychotic drug, is frequently used for the treatment of mental diseases, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. Acute lung injury, a rarely reported side effect of quetiapine, is described in this case report. CASE SUMMARY: Due to terminal delirium, a 66-year-old man took a large dose of quetiapine and then developed severe pulmonary disease. His symptoms were not resolved after routine treatment, such as antibiotics, diuretic, and supportive therapies. Quetiapine-related acute lung injury was therefore suspected and hormonal therapy was initiated. Subsequently, his symptoms were alleviated and the radiological results improved dramatically. CONCLUSION: Our findings in the present report highlight a potential adverse effect of quetiapine, drug-related acute lung injury, which deserves awareness in clinical practice.
