29751013|a|Fibril formation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) follows a nucleation-dependent polymerization process and is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Several different lengths of Abeta are observed in vivo, but Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 are the dominant forms. The fibril architectures of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 differ and Abeta1-42 assemblies are generally considered more pathogenic. We show here that monomeric Abeta1-42 can be cross-templated and incorporated into the ends of Abeta1-40 fibrils, while incorporation of Abeta1-40 monomers into Abeta1-42 fibrils is very poor. We also show that via cross-templating incorporated Abeta monomers acquire the properties of the parental fibrils. The suppressed ability of Abeta1-40 to incorporate into the ends of Abeta1-42 fibrils and the capacity of Abeta1-42 monomers to adopt the properties of Abeta1-40 fibrils may thus represent two mechanisms reducing the total load of fibrils having the intrinsic, and possibly pathogenic, features of Abeta1-42 fibrils in vivo. We also show that the transfer of fibrillar properties is restricted to fibril-end templating and does not apply to cross-nucleation via the recently described path of surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation, which instead generates similar structures to those acquired via de novo primary nucleation in the absence of catalyzing seeds. Taken together these results uncover an intrinsic barrier that prevents Abeta1-40 from adopting the fibrillar properties of Abeta1-42 and exposes that the transfer of properties between amyloid-beta fibrils are determined by their path of formation.
