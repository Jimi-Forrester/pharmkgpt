METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study to explore the effect of APOE polymorphisms on sporadic AD in 875 sporadic AD patients and 1,195 cognitive normal controls of Chinese Han. Genotyping of APOE was determined by multiplex amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: APOE epsilon3epsilon4 and epsilon4epsilon4 genotypes increased AD risk with dosage effect. The odds ratio (OR) of epsilon3epsilon4 was 1.89 and the OR of epsilon4epsilon4 was 15.64 compared with that of epsilon3epsilon3 in all the subjects. E2epsilon3 genotype decreased AD risk in all the subjects (OR=0.64), female subgroup (OR=0.57), and late-onset AD subgroup (OR=0.60). However, neither epsilon2epsilon2 nor epsilon2epsilon4 affected AD risk. About the age at onset (AAO), the influence of APOE epsilon4 was only exhibited in late-onset AD subgroup, with 1 year lower in epsilon4-positive ones than negative ones. Further analysis did not show the dosage effect of epsilon4 pertinent to AAO, though the AAO of epsilon4epsilon4 patients decreased by 2 years. E2 did not affect the AAO of AD. CONCLUSION: APOE epsilon4 is a strong risk factor of AD risk in Chinese Han population, and APOE epsilon4epsilon4 genotype might be related to the AAO of late-onset AD.
