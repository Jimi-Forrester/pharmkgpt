19505825|a|The present article expands on the study of structure-activity relationships of the novel class of quinone-bearing polyamines, as multi-target-directed ligands against Alzheimer's disease. Namely, the effect of inserting a methyl substituent at the alpha position of the terminal benzyl amine moieties of lead candidate 1 (memoquin) was evaluated at the multiple targets involved in the multifunctional mechanism of action. The RR stereoisomer 2 resulted more effective than 1 in reverting two important effects mediated by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), that is, acetylcholine hydrolysis and AChE-induced amyloid-beta aggregation.
