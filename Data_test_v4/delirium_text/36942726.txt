36942726|a|BACKGROUND: E-learning has shown to be an effective intervention in helping informal caregivers of people living with dementia. It has the potential to reach people living in remote areas, increasing service coverage. As a response to the demographic context in Spain associated with a higher percentage of ageing, depopulation, and the complexities of health service delivery in rural areas, this paper describes the cultural adaptation and co-design of the iSupport online training and support programme for Castilla y Leon, Spain, as a potential e-health intervention to mitigate these constraints. METHODS: The translation and cultural adaptation were performed following the WHO guidelines, with some adaptation due to the cultural context of Spain. Three focus groups were conducted with informal caregivers, health professionals, and a group of experts on cognitive impairment and dementia. The co-design process was performed as a Patient and Public Involvement activity with three groups consisting of people living with dementia, informal caregivers, rural population and experts on technology and dementia. RESULTS: A total of 435 suggestions were proposed for adaptation associated with erroneous terminology, rewording text/writing, grammatical or punctuation marks errors, and repeated information or need for additional content. Several recommendations were exposed during the co-design process: preference for interactive material such as videos or images, a forum to receive feedback from health care professionals and to leave satisfaction comments, availability in multiple platforms (e.g., tablet, laptop, mobile), slide format for information presentation, and availability to edit letter size and background colours. CONCLUSIONS: A culturally adapted version of the iSupport was developed for Castilla y Leon, Spain. The need for modification of words and expressions, information links to local resources websites, adjustments of characters' names and caregivers' scenarios, and additional content to some sections were recommended. Suggestions for the design should be taken into account for further adapted versions and platform developments.
