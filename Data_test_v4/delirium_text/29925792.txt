29925792|a|The abnormal self-assembly of the amyloid-beta peptide into toxic beta-rich aggregates can cause Alzheimer's disease. Recently, it has been shown that small gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) inhibit Abeta aggregation and fibrillation by slowing down the nucleation process in experimental studies. However, the effects of AuNPs on Abeta oligomeric structures are still unclear. In this study, we investigate the conformation of Abeta(16-22) tetramers/octamers in the absence and presence of AuNPs using extensive all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Our studies demonstrate that the addition of AuNPs into Abeta(16-22) solution prevents beta-sheet formation, and the inhibition depends on the concentration of Abeta(16-22) peptides. A detailed analysis of the Abeta(16-22)/Abeta(16-22)/water/AuNPs interactions reveals that AuNPs inhibit the beta-sheet formation resulting from the same physical forces: hydrophobic interactions. Overall, our computational study provides evidence that AuNPs are likely to inhibit Abeta(16-22) and full-length Abeta fibrillation. Thus, this work provides theoretical insights into the development of inorganic nanoparticles as drug candidates for treatment of AD.
