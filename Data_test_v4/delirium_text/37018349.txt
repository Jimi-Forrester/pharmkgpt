37018349|t|Orthogeriatric co-management for older patients with a major osteoporotic fracture: Protocol of an observational pre-post study.
37018349|a|BACKGROUND: Osteoporotic fractures are associated with postoperative complications, increased mortality, reduced quality of life, and excessive costs. The care for older patients with a fracture is often complex due to multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and presence of geriatric syndromes requiring a holistic multidisciplinary approach based on a comprehensive geriatric assessment. Nurse-led geriatric co-management has proven to prevent functional decline and complications, and improve quality of life. The aim of this study is to prove that nurse-led orthogeriatric co-management in patients with a major osteoporotic fracture is more effective than inpatient geriatric consultation to prevent in-hospital complications and several secondary outcomes in at least a cost-neutral manner. METHODS: An observational pre-post study will be performed on the traumatology ward of the University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium including 108 patients aged 75 years and older hospitalized with a major osteoporotic fracture in each cohort. A feasibility study was conducted after the usual care cohort and prior to the intervention cohort to measure fidelity to the intervention components. The intervention includes proactive geriatric care based on automated protocols for the prevention of common geriatric syndromes, a comprehensive geriatric evaluation followed by multidisciplinary interventions, and systematic follow-up. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients having one or more in-hospital complications. Secondary outcomes include functional status, instrumental activities of daily living status, mobility status, nutritional status, in-hospital cognitive decline, quality of life, return to pre-fracture living situation, unplanned hospital readmissions, incidence of new falls, and mortality. A process evaluation and cost-benefit analysis will also be conducted. DISCUSSION: This study wants to prove the beneficial impact of orthogeriatric co-management in improving patient outcomes and costs in a heterogenous population in daily clinical practice with the ambition of long-term sustainability of the intervention.
