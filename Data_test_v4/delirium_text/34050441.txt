34050441|t|Rheumatology and psychiatry: allies in times of COVID-19.
34050441|a|The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has had a significant global impact. Physical, emotional, and psychological health, particularly its specific mental health area, has been affected. Patients with rheumatic diseases are more likely to be concerned about COVID-19 than the public in general. Depression and anxiety are the symptoms most commonly reported by these patients. Therefore, now more than ever before, rheumatologists and psychiatrists should work together to improve the care of rheumatic disease patients, identifying the symptoms that uniquely reflect mental health problems, so the patients' quality of life can be substantially improved.
