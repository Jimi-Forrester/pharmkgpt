28469641|a|Embryonic neurogenesis is the process of generating neurons, the functional units of the brain. Because of its sensitivity to adverse intrauterine environment such as infection, dysregulation of this process has emerged as a key mechanism underlying many neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Adult neurogenesis, although is restricted to a few neurogenic niches, plays pivotal roles in brain plasticity and repair. Increasing evidence suggests that impairments in adult neurogenesis are involved in major neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. A hallmark feature of these brain disorders is neuroinflammation, which can either promote or inhibit neurogenesis depending upon the context of brain microenvironment. In this review paper, we present evidence from both experimental and human studies to show a complex picture of relationship between these two events, and discussed potential factors contributing to different or even opposing actions of neuroinflammation on neurogenesis in neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders.
