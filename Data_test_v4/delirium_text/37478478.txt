37478478|t|Glial cell response and microthrombosis in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients: An autopsy study.
37478478|a|Neuroinflammation and microthrombosis may be underlying mechanisms of brain injury after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), but they have not been studied in relation to each other. In postmortem brain tissue, we investigated neuroinflammation by studying the microglial and astrocyte response in the frontal cortex of 11 aSAH and 10 control patients. In a second study, we investigated the correlation between microthrombosis and microglia by studying the microglial surface area around vessels with and without microthrombosis in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of 8 other aSAH patients. In comparison with controls, we found increased numbers of microglia (mean +- SEM 50 +- 8 vs 20 +- 5 per 0.0026 mm3, p < 0.01), an increased surface area (%) of microglia (mean +- SEM 4.2 +- 0.6 vs 2.2 +- 0.4, p < 0.05), a higher intensity of the astrocytic intermediate filament protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (mean +- SEM 184 +- 28 vs 92 +- 23 arbitrary units, p < 0.05), and an increased GFAP surface area (%) (mean +- SEM 21.2 +- 2.6 vs 10.7 +- 2.1, p < 0.01) in aSAH tissue. Microglia surface area was approximately 40% larger around vessels with microthrombosis than those without microthrombosis (estimated marginal means [95% CI]; 6.1 [5.4-6.9] vs 4.3 [3.6-5.0], p < 0.001). Our results show that the microglial and astrocyte surface areas increased after aSAH and that microthrombosis and microglia are interrelated.
