36167377|a|INTRODUCTION: Elderly cancer patients often have ageing-related physical and psychosocial problems that should be fully shared with their oncologists. Geriatric assessment (GA) can assess these ageing-related problems and guide management. Communication support might also facilitate implementation of GA-guided management. We will conduct a multicentre, randomised controlled trial to examine the efficacy of a programme that combines a GA summary, management recommendations and communication support to facilitate ageing-related communications between elderly Japanese patients with cancer and their oncologists, and thus to implement programme-guided management. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We plan to recruit a total of 210 patients aged >=70 years, diagnosed with incurable cancers of gastrointestinal origin, and referred for first-line or second-line chemotherapy. In the intervention arm, a summary of management recommendations based on a GA and question prompt list (QPL) will be provided to patients and shared with their oncologists at the first outpatient visit after randomisation by trained intervention providers. For 5 months after the initial intervention, implementation of GA-guided management recommendations will be reviewed monthly with the patients and their oncologists to implement management as needed. The GA and QPL will be re-evaluated at 3 months, with a summary provided to patients and their oncologists. Those participants allocated to the usual care arm will receive usual oncology care. The primary endpoint is the number of conversations about ageing-related concerns at the first outpatient visit after randomisation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the institutional review board of the National Cancer Center Japan on 15 April 2021 (ID: 2020-592). Study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN000045428.
