34117967|a|There has been an increase in the incidence of chronic neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, over the recent years mostly due to the rise in the number of elderly individuals. In addition, various neurodegenerative disorders are related to imbalances in the CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 response axis. Notably, the CXC Chemokine Ligand 12 (CXCL12) is essential for the development of the central nervous system. Moreover, the expression and distribution of CXCL12 and its receptors are associated with the aggravation or alleviation of symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, the current review sought to highlight the specific functions of CXCL12 and its receptors in various neurodegenerative disorders, in order to provide new insights for future research.
