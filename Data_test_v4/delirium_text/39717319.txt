39717319|t|The Awareness of Methylphenidate and Its Use: Experiences and Perceptions of Medical Students.
39717319|a|Background and objective Over the past decade, the use of psychostimulants typically prescribed for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), such as methylphenidate (MP), has become popular among undergraduate students to enhance their academic performance. Despite potential health and legal repercussions, the misuse of these medications has become a significant public health issue, not only in the general population but particularly among students in medical schools across Turkey. This study investigated the prevalence of MP misuse among Turkish medical students and the factors contributing to it. Methods We conducted a survey involving 418 medical students (257 female, 161 male), covering addiction history, physician-recommended ADHD medication, sharing and recommending MP among peers, initial exposure to MP misuse information, reasons for non-prescription MP use, duration of misuse, perceptions of MP's addictive potential, and ethical views on MP use to help with exams. Results The findings revealed that senior students showed a higher level of awareness and earlier initiation of MP misuse compared to younger students (p<0.05). Residing in student housing emerged as a significant reason for exposure to and subsequent misuse of non-medical prescription MP (p<0.05). Both MP misusers and non-users acknowledged the MP's addictive nature. Peer influence was the primary factor for initial recommendations of MP misuse (p<0.05). Conclusions While academic achievement appears to be the primary motivator for MP misuse, the effectiveness of this practice in non-ADHD students is uncertain. Implementing proactive measures is crucial to curb such misuse, particularly among medical students, to prevent a future global health concern.
