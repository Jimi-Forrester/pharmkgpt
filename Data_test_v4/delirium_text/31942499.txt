31942499|t|Functional MRI on executive functioning in aging and dementia: A scoping review of cognitive tasks.
31942499|a|Cognitive decline with aging and dementia is especially poignant with regard to the executive functioning that is necessary for activities of daily independent living. The relationship between age-related neurodegeneration in the prefrontal cortex and executive functioning has been uniquely investigated using task-phase functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect brain activity in response to stimuli; however, a comprehensive list of task designs that have been implemented to task-phase fMRI is absent in the literature. The purpose of this review was to recognize what methods have been used to study executive functions with aging and dementia in fMRI tasks, and to describe and categorize them. The following cognitive subdomains were emphasized: cognitive flexibility, planning and decision-making, working memory, cognitive control/inhibition, semantic processing, attention and concentration, emotional functioning, and multitasking. Over 30 different task-phase fMRI designs were found to have been implemented in the literature, all adopted from standard neuropsychological assessments. Cognitive set-shifting and decision-making tasks were particularly well studied in regard to age-related neurodegeneration, while emotional functioning and multitasking designs were found to be the least utilized. Summarizing the information on which tasks have shown the greatest usability will assist in the future design and implementation of effective fMRI experiments targeting executive functioning.
