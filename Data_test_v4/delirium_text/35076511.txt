35076511|t|Systematic Review of Dementia Support Programs with Multicultural and Multilingual Populations.
35076511|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia care programs have become more common due to a growing number of persons living with dementia and lack of substantial benefit from pharmacologic therapies. Cultural and language differences may present barriers to access and efficacy of these programs. In this article, we aimed to systematically review the current literature regarding outcomes of dementia care programs that included multicultural and non-English speaking populations. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using four scientific search engines. All studies included in the review are English language, randomized control trials evaluating various care coordination models. The initial search strategy focusing on studies specifically targeting multicultural and non-English speaking populations resulted in too few articles. We expanded our search to articles that included these populations although these populations may not have been the focus of the study. RESULTS: Seven articles met inclusion criteria for final review. Measured outcomes included emergency room use, hospitalizations, provider visits, quality of life indicators, depression scores, and caregiver burden. CONCLUSIONS: Dementia care programs demonstrate significant ability to provide support and improve outcomes for those living with dementia and their caregivers. There is limited research in this field and thus opportunity for further study in underserved and safety net populations including more high-quality randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes.
