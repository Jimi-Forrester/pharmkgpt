34308906|a|BACKGROUND: Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) constitutes a natural compound with high protection over cognitive function that could positively alter brain dynamics and the mixture of within and between-frequency connectivity. OBJECTIVE: The balance of cross-frequency coupling over within-frequency coupling can build a nonlinearity index (NI) that encapsulates the over-excitation of information flow between brain areas and across experimental time. The present study investigated for the very first time how the Greek High Phenolic Early Harvest Extra Virgin Olive Oil (HP-EH-EVOO) versus Moderate Phenolic (MP-EVOO) and Mediterranean Diet (MeDi) intervention in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) could affect their spontaneous EEG dynamic connectivity. METHODS: Forty-three subjects (14 in MeDi, 16 in MP-EVOO, and 13 in HP-EH-EVOO) followed an EEG resting-state recording session (eyes-open and closed) before and after the treatment. Following our dominant coupling mode model, we built a dynamic integrated dynamic functional connectivity graph that tabulates the functional strength and the dominant coupling mode model of every pair of brain areas. RESULTS: Signal spectrum within 1-13 Hz and theta/beta ratio have decreased in the HP-EH-EVOO group in the eyes-open condition. The intervention improved the FIDoCM across groups and conditions but was more prominent in the HP-EH-EVOO group (p < 0.001). Finally, we revealed a significant higher post-intervention reduction of NI (DeltaNITotal and alpha) for the HP-EH-EVOO compared to the MP-EVOO and MeDi groups (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Long-term intervention with HP-EH-EVOO reduced the over-excitation of information flow in spontaneous brain activity and altered the signal spectrum of EEG rhythms.
