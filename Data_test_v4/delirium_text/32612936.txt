32612936|a|This review summarizes the current knowledge linking cancer and neuro-degenerative diseases to dysregulation of microRNA network following pesticide exposure. Most findings revealed differential miRNA expression targeting biomolecules and pathways involved in various neoplastic localizations and neurodegenerative diseases. A growing body of evidence in recent literature indicates that alteration of specific miRNAs can represent an early biomarker of disease following exposure to chemical agents, including pesticides. Different miRNAs seem to regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and metastasis via many biological pathways through modulation of the expression of target mRNAs. The evaluation of miRNA expression levels may be used to develop new non-invasive strategies for the prediction and prognosis of many diseases, including cancer. However, the application of miRNAs as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers in the clinical field is extremely challenging.
