20641253|a|Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disease associated with an irreversible decline of mental functions and with cognitive impairment (1). It is characterized by the presence in the brain of senile plaques of b-amyloid (Ab) peptides with intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of filaments that contain the hyperphosphorylated protein tau (2, 3). Accelerated deposition of Ab deposits seems to be a key risk factor associated with AD, and although the mechanisms of the disease are still not fully understood, reducing the deposition of amyloid plaques seems to benefit patients. Several radioligands have been developed (4-6) and tested in humans as <i>in vivo</i> diagnostic tools for imaging and measuring the formation of Ab deposits (6). The first agent successfully used in human studies was [<sup>18</sup>F]FDDNP (7), a malonitrile derivative found to bind to both neurofibrillary tangles and Ab plaques. The second successful attempt was made with [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB (8), also known as Pittsburgh Compound B or [<sup>11</sup>C]6-OH-BTA-1, which showed marked retention in areas of the cortex known to contain substantial amounts of Ab deposits. The third PET radioligand successfully tested in humans was [<sup>11</sup>C]4-<i>N</i>-methylamino-4 -hydroxystilbene, a stilbene derivative commonly named [<sup>11</sup>C]SB-13 that exhibited good binding affinities for Ab aggregates <i>in vitro</i>, moderate lipophilicity, high initial brain uptake in the normal rat cortex, and a rapid washout (9). Benzofuran derivatives labeled with radioactive iodine have shown very good binding affinities for Ab aggregates and good brain penetration (10). Unfortunately, their level of nonspecific binding was found to be very high, which makes them unsuitable for <i>in vivo</i> plaque imaging. However, [<sup>125</sup>I]IMPY displayed good initial brain uptake and rapid washout from normal mouse brain and postmortem AD brain sections (11). Several conjugated thioflavin compounds based on benzothiazole have been shown to bind specifically to amyloid plaques. However, the thioflavins contain an ionic quaternary amine that is permanently charged and unfavorable to brain uptake. For that reason, several alternatives that use neutral derivatives have been synthesized and are currently being evaluated as potential ligands for imaging Ab deposits in the AD brain. One of them, 2-(4'-dimethylaminophenyl)-6-[<sup>125</sup>I]iodobenzothiazole ([<sup>125</sup>I]TZDM) is currently being studied both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> (12).
