26267422|t|A retrospective classification of diagnoses in terms of DSM-5 for patients included in randomized controlled trials of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761( ).
26267422|a|When the early trials of Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761( ) were conducted, different terms were used to denote ageing-associated neurocognitive disorders. With the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a taxonomy covering dementia and pre-dementia stages of such disorders became available. DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) were applied to patients with any type of ageing-associated cognitive impairment, including dementia, enrolled in randomized controlled clinical trials of EGb 761( ), taking into account the reported inclusion and exclusion criteria and patient characteristics at baseline. For 23 of 31 trials (74 %), the inclusion diagnoses could be classified as NCD in accordance with DSM-5. Thirteen trials enrolled patients with major NCD, four trials enrolled patients with mild NCD and six trials enrolled patients with NCD, who could not be classified unambiguously as having mild or major NCD. Although various terms were formerly used for neurocognitive disorders, the patients enrolled in the majority of clinical trials with EGb 761( ) could be classified retrospectively using modern DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.
