32309400|t|Never too old for hip arthroplasty: a 111-year-old woman walks out of hospital-a case report and literature review.
32309400|a|Centenarians population is proliferating, and hip fractures are responsible for more than 10% of all hospital admissions for centenarian patients, which represents a considerable challenge to patients and healthcare providers. Herein, we first report a case of a 111-year-old woman who suffered from a hip fracture and was successfully managed with cemented hemiarthroplasty surgery. In addition, we further reviewed case reports, news, and related studies to address the central points in managing hip fractures in the centenarian population.
