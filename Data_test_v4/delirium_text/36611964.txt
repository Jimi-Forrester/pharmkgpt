36611964|t|The Past and Present Lives of the Intraocular Transmembrane Protein CD36.
36611964|a|Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) belongs to the B2 receptors of the scavenger receptor class B family, which is comprised of single-chain secondary transmembrane glycoproteins. It is present in a variety of cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, microvascular endothelial cells, adipocytes, hepatocytes, platelets, skeletal muscle cells, kidney cells, cardiomyocytes, taste bud cells, and a variety of other cell types. CD36 can be localized on the cell surface, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and endosomes, playing a role in lipid accumulation, oxidative stress injury, apoptosis, and inflammatory signaling. Recent studies have found that CD36 is expressed in a variety of ocular cells, including retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), retinal microvascular endothelial cells, retinal ganglion cells (RGC), Muller cells, and photoreceptor cells, playing an important role in eye diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and glaucoma. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of CD36 function and downstream signaling pathways is of great significance for the prevention and treatment of eye diseases. This article reviews the molecular characteristics, distribution, and function of scavenger receptor CD36 and its role in ophthalmology in order to deepen the understanding of CD36 in eye diseases and provide new ideas for treatment strategies.
