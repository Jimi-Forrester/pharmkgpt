36554588|t|Cognitive Function Trajectories and Factors among Chinese Older Adults with Subjective Memory Decline: CHARLS Longitudinal Study Results (2011-2018).
36554588|a|Older adults with subjective cognitive decline are at increased risk of future pathological cognitive decline and dementia. Subjective memory decline is an early sign of cognitive decline; preventing or slowing cognitive decline in at-risk populations remains an elusive issue. This study aimed to examine the cognitive trajectories and factors in older adults with subjective memory decline. Latent growth curve models (LGCMs) were fitted to examine the cognitive function trajectories and factors among 1465 older adults (aged 60+ years) with subjective memory decline. Data were obtained from four waves from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2011-2018), which is a large nationally representative sample of the Chinese population. The results showed that older adults with better initial cognition had a slower decline rate, which may be accelerated by advanced age, low-level education, a rapid decrease in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) ability, and rapid increase in depression levels. This study was the first to examine the trajectories of cognitive function and its factors in a high-risk population with subjective memory decline. These findings may guide prevention approaches to tackle the issues of cognitive function decline and dementia.
