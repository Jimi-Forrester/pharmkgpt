28410655|t|Tau Spread, Apolipoprotein E, Inflammation, and More: Rapidly Evolving Basic Science in Alzheimer Disease.
28410655|a|To date, Alzheimer disease drug candidates have produced negative results in human trials, and progress in moving new targets out of the laboratory and into trials has been slow. However, based on 3 decades of previous work, there is reason to hope that amyloid-based and other novel therapies will move at a faster pace toward successful clinical trials. This article highlights selected preclinical research topics that are rapidly advancing in the laboratory.
