35494290|a|Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical and chondroprotective efficacy and safety of orally administered Theracurmin in patients who underwent mosaicplasty for knee chondral or osteochondral diseases over 12 months of treatment. Methods: We enrolled 50 patients, older than 20 years of age, who underwent mosaicplasty for their knee joint diseases. Theracurmin at 180 mg of curcumin per day or placebo was administered orally every day for 12 months. Because 7 patients dropped out of the study, 43 patients were examined; they included 14 men and 29 women and 24 right and 19 left knees. The mean operative age was 59.5 years (range, 24-84 years). We evaluated the Japanese Orthopaedic Association knee osteoarthritis score (JOA), visual analog scale (VAS), and Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure (JKOM) as clinical symptoms; T2 mapping values using magnetic resonance imaging as an indication of the chondroprotective effect; and blood concentration of curcumin at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months after the operations. We performed intraoperative acoustic evaluation of articular cartilage as a measure of chondroprotective effect during the operations and second-look arthroscopy. Results: The JOA, VAS and JKOM at 3, 6, and 12 months were significantly better than those during the preoperative period. However, the values of JOA, VAS and JKOM and T2 mapping were not significantly different between the Theracurmin and placebo groups. The blood concentration of curcumin in the Theracurmin group was significantly higher than that in the placebo group at 3, 6, and 12 months after the operations. Cartilage stiffness and surface roughness were significantly better in the Theracurmin group than in the placebo group at second-look arthroscopy. Conclusions: The oral administration of Theracurmin for 1 year demonstrated significantly better chondroprotective effects and no worse clinical effects and adverse events than the placebo. Level of Evidence: Level I, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study.
