37958657|t|Identification of MicroRNAs Associated with Prediabetic Status in Obese Women.
37958657|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) recently emerged as means of communication between insulin-sensitive tissues to mediate diabetes development and progression, and as such they present a valuable proxy for epigenetic alterations associated with type 2 diabetes. In order to identify miRNA markers for the precursor of diabetes called prediabetes, we applied a translational approach encompassing analysis of human plasma samples, mouse tissues and an in vitro validation system. MiR-652-3p, miR-877-5p, miR-93-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR-152-3p and let-7i-5p were increased in plasma of women with impaired fasting glucose levels (IFG) compared to those with normal fasting glucose and normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Among these, let-7i-5p and miR-93-5p correlated with fasting blood glucose levels. Human data were then compared to miRNome data obtained from islets of Langerhans and adipose tissue of 10-week-old female New Zealand Obese mice, which differ in their degree of hyperglycemia and liver fat content. Similar to human plasma, let-7i-5p was increased in adipose tissue and islets of Langerhans of diabetes-prone mice. As predicted by the in silico analysis, overexpression of let-7i-5p in the rat beta-cell line INS-1 832/12 resulted in downregulation of insulin signaling pathway components (Insr, Rictor, Prkcb, Clock, Sos1 and Kcnma1). Taken together, our integrated approach highlighted let-7i-5p as a potential regulator of whole-body insulin sensitivity and a novel marker of prediabetes in women.
