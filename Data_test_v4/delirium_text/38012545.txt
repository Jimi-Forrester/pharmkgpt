38012545|a|BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression-like behaviors in allergic rhinitis (AR) are attracting attention, while the precise mechanism has not been clearly elucidated. Recent evidence shows that neuroinflammation in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) may be the core of these neuropsychiatric symptoms in AR. Here, we investigated the molecular link between the anxiety and depression-like behaviors and neuroinflammation in ACC. METHODS: Mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) to induce AR. Nasal inflammation levels were assessed by H&E staining and PAS staining. Anxiety and depression-like behaviors were evaluated by behavioral experiments including open field test, forced swimming test, and sucrose preference test. Neuronal impairment was characterized via Nissl staining and 18FDG-PET. The role of ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) in AR-related anxiety and depression was assessed by Tet2-/- mice. In addition, the murine BV2 microglial cell line was utilized to explore the molecular mechanisms by which TET2 mediates neuroinflammation. The levels of TET2, NLRP3 and their downstream molecules were detected by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, Dot blot and ELISA. The effects of metformin on depression-like behaviors in AR mice were also evaluated. RESULTS: AR mice showed significant anxiety and depression-like behaviors, which associated with the activation of ACC. Loss of TET2 activated the NLRP3/IL-1beta pathway of microglia in AR mice, further accelerating the anxiety and depression-like behaviors. In addition, knockdown of TET2 activated the NLRP3/IL-1beta pathway in BV2 cells. Metformin improved the neuropsychiatric symptoms of AR mice by reducing the activation of NLRP3/IL-1beta pathway after upregulating TET2. CONCLUSION: TET2 deficiency activates the NLRP3/IL-1beta pathway of microglia in the ACC, promoting the pathological process of anxiety and depression-like behavior in AR. Metformin could be effective in treating neuroinflammation by regulating microglia via TET2 up-regulation, indicating that metformin is a potential way to treat anxiety and depression-like behaviors in AR.
