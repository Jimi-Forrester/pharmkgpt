34224430|t|Noble gases and neuroprotection: summary of current evidence.
34224430|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the current data on neuroprotection derived by noble gas treatment focusing on xenon and argon. RECENT FINDINGS: Both xenon and argon have demonstrated neuroprotective properties in an array of disease models. However, current data for argon after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is conflicting. Recent human data is only available for xenon showing some beneficial aspects (fewer adverse events) but no effect on outcomes, such as incidence of postoperative delirium. SUMMARY: Promising results are available for neuroprotection derived by noble gas treatment. Results for xenon are more consistent than those for argon. The mechanism of action of xenon (noncompetitive NMDA-receptor inhibition) is also better understood compared with that of argon. The evidence for argon's neuroprotective actions (particularly after TBI) remains uncertain.
