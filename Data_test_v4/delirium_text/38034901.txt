38034901|t|Association of Apolipoprotein E Gene Polymorphism with Type 2 Diabetic Nephropathy in the Southern Chinese Population.
38034901|a|Background: Common polymorphisms within the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene are rs429358 and rs7412, which result in three major alleles (e2, e3, and e4) and six genotypes (E2/E2, E2/E3, E3/E3, E3/E4, E4/E4, and E2/E4). Although APOE gene polymorphisms have been suggested to be associated with the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN), their potential association remains unclear in different regions. This study aims to unveil the genetic effects of APOE gene polymorphisms on DN susceptibility and serum lipid profiles in southern Chinese population. Methods: A total of 306 DN patients and 483 type 2 diabetic patients as controls were included in the study. The APOE gene polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) microarray gene chip. Relevant medical records and information of these participants were collected. Results: There were statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in gender, SBP, hypertension, hyperuricemia, UTP, TG and HDL-C between DN patients and controls. DN patients exhibited a higher frequency of the epsilon2 allele and E2/E3 genotype than controls (p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the epsilon2 allele and E2/E3 genotype were independent risk factors (adjusted OR: 3.237, 95% CI: 1.789-5.854, p < 0.001; adjusted OR: 3.453, 95% CI: 1.873-6.368, p < 0.001), while the epsilon3 allele or E3/E3 genotype might serve as protective role (adjusted OR: 0.395, 95% CI: 0.255-0.612, p < 0.001) for development of DN. Conclusion: Our study indicates a correlation between APOE polymorphisms and DN in the southern Chinese Hakka population. Specifically, individuals carrying the APOE epsilon2 allele and E2/E3 genotype are at a higher risk of developing DN. Conversely, those with the APOE epsilon3 allele and E3/E3 genotype have a lower risk of DN in southern Chinese population.
