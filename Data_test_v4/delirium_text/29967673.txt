29967673|a|INTRODUCTION: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has been used as a non-invasive method to increase the plasticity of brain. Growing evidence has shown several brain disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, and chronic pain syndrome are improved following tDCS. In patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), increased brain rhythm activity particularly in the frontal lobe has been reported in several studies using Eectroencephalogram (EEG). To our knowledge, no research has been done on the effects of electrical stimulation on brain signals of patients with OCD. We measured the electrical activity of the brain using EEG in patients with OCD before and after tDCS and compared it to normal participants. METHODS: Eight patients with OCD (3 males) and 8 matched healthy controls were recruited. A 64-channel EEG was used to record a 5-min resting state before and after application of tDCS in both groups. The intervention of tDCS was applied for 15 minutes with 2 mA amplitude where anode was placed on the left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) and cathode on the right DLPFC. RESULTS: In line with previous studies, the results showed that the power of Delta frequency band in OCD patients are significantly higher than the normal group. Following anodal tDCS, hyperactivity in Delta and Theta bands declined in most channels, particularly in DLPFC (F3, F4) and became similar to normal signals pattern. The reduction in Delta band was significantly more than the other bands. CONCLUSION: Anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC significantly decreased the power of frequency bands of Delta and Theta in Patients with OCD. The pattern of EEG activity after tDCS became particularly similar to normal, so tDCS may have potential clinical application in these patients.
