37984591|a|BACKGROUND: Calcineurin (CN) is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase. In healthy tissue, CN exists mainly as a full-length (~60 kDa) highly-regulated protein phosphatase involved in essential cellular functions. However, in diseased or injured tissue, CN is proteolytically converted to a constitutively active fragment that has been causatively-linked to numerous pathophysiologic processes. These calpain-cleaved CN fragments ( CN) appear at high levels in human brain at early stages of cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). NEW METHOD: We developed a monoclonal antibody to  CN, using an immunizing peptide corresponding to the C-terminal end of the  CN fragment. RESULTS: We obtained a mouse monoclonal antibody, designated 26A6, that selectively detects  CN in Western analysis of calpain-cleaved recombinant human CN. Using this antibody, we screened both pathological and normal human brain sections provided by the University of Kentucky's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. 26A6 showed low reactivity towards normal brain tissue, but detected astrocytes both surrounding AD amyloid plaques and throughout AD brain tissue. In brain tissue with infarcts, there was considerable concentration of 26A6-positive astrocytes within/around infarcts, suggesting a link with anoxic/ischemia pathways. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: The results obtained with the new monoclonal are similar to those obtained with a polyclonal we had previously developed. However, the monoclonal is an abundant tool available to the dementia research community. CONCLUSIONS: The new monoclonal 26A6 antibody is highly selective for the  CN proteolytic fragment and labels a subset of astrocytes, and could be a useful tool for marking insidious brain pathology and identifying novel astrocyte phenotypes.
