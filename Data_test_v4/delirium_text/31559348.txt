31559348|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a protocol for enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) for colon cancer in older patients. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-nine patients enrolled in the ERAS group of our previous clinical study were divided according to age into an older group (n = 31; >=80 years old) and a younger group (n = 128; <80 years old). We compared the two groups for clinical outcomes, including surgical complications, re-admission rates, and the time to discharge, based on criteria for hospital discharge. Compliance with each ERAS element was compared between groups. RESULTS: Concomitant diseases were present in all older patients (100%), but only in 57.8% of the younger group (P < 0.0001). The preoperative risk grade according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification was significantly higher in the older group than in the younger group. The postoperative surgical complications and re-admission rates were not significantly different between groups. Discharge criteria were met three days after the operation. The median length of hospital stay was slightly longer in the older group (9 days, range 5-15) than in the younger group (8 days, range 4-41; P = 0.061). Compliance above 80% was observed for 13 ERAS items in the older group and 14 ERAS items in the younger group; thus, compliance with the ERAS protocol was equally feasible in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: For older patients undergoing colon cancer surgery, an ERAS protocol might be feasible with a high implementation rate of the elements in the protocol.
