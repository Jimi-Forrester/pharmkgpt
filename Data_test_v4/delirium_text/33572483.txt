33572483|t|Bibliometric Analysis on Research Trend of Accidental Falls in Older Adults by Using Citespace-Focused on Web of Science Core Collection (2010-2020).
33572483|a|The present study aimed to identify the trends in research on accidental falls in older adults over the last decade. The MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) and entry terms were applied in the Web of Science Core Collection. Relevant studies in English within articles or reviews on falls in older adults were included from 2010 to 2020. Moreover, CiteSpace 5.6.R5 (64-bit) was adopted for analysis with scientific measurements and visualization. Cooper Cyrus, Stephen R Lord, Minoru Yamada, Catherine Sherrington, and others have critically impacted the study of falls in older adults. Osteoporosis, dementia, sarcopenia, hypertension, osteosarcopenia, traumatic brain injury, frailty, depression, and fear of falling would be significantly correlated with falls in older adults. Multiple types of exercise can provide effective improvements in executive cognitive performance, gait performance, quality of life, and can also lower the rates of falls and fall-related fractures. Fall detection, hospitalization, classification, symptom, gender, and cost are the current research focus and development direction in research on falls in older adults. The prevention of falls in older adults is one of the most important public health issues in today's aging society. Although lots of effects and research advancements had been taken, fall prevention still is uncharted territory for too many older adults. Service improvements can exploit the mentioned findings to formulate policies, and design and implement exercise programs for fall prevention.
