22232000|t|Clusterin mRNA and protein in Alzheimer's disease.
22232000|a|Clusterin, a multifunctional lipoprotein is expressed in a number of tissues but expression is particularly high in the brain, where it binds to amyloid-beta (Abeta), possibly facilitating Abeta transport into the bloodstream. Its concentration in peripheral blood was identified as a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and predicted retention of (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound B in the temporal lobe. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the clusterin gene, CLU, are associated with the risk of developing AD. We measured clusterin mRNA levels in control and AD brains and investigated the relationship of the clusterin protein to soluble, insoluble, and plaque-associated Abeta. Clusterin mRNA levels were unchanged when normalized to GAPDH but modestly increased in the frontal and temporal cortex in AD in relation to NSE and MAP-2. Levels of NSE and MAP-2 mRNA were reduced in the AD frontal cortex. Clusterin protein concentration was unchanged and did not correlate with the amount of Abeta present. In the frontal cortex, clusterin concentration was higher in APOE epsilon4-negative brains but no effect of APOE was detected in the temporal cortex or thalamus. Overall clusterin mRNA and protein levels are unaltered in the neocortex in AD and clusterin concentration does not reflect Abeta content. The increase in clusterin noted in peripheral blood in AD may reflect increased passage of this chaperone protein across the blood-brain barrier but further work is needed to determine how CLU variants influence the development of AD.
