18806646|t|Use of the acute confusion protocol: a research utilization project.
18806646|a|This evidence-based project was undertaken to implement research-based preventive protocols to decrease the negative outcomes associated with delirium/acute confusion. After implementation, the medical-surgical unit experienced a 62% reduction in falls and a 100% decrease in sitter usage the first year. The use of medications known to cause acute confusion was decreased by more than 50%. Since implementation, the fall rate as well as the use of restraints has decreased by 25%.
