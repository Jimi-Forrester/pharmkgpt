36986669|t|Relevance of the Extraction Stage on the Anti-Inflammatory Action of Fucoidans.
36986669|a|The anti-inflammatory action of fucoidans is well known, based on both in vitro and some in vivo studies. The other biological properties of these compounds, their lack of toxicity, and the possibility of obtaining them from a widely distributed and renewable source, makes them attractive novel bioactives. However, fucoidans' heterogeneity and variability in composition, structure, and properties depending on seaweed species, biotic and abiotic factors and processing conditions, especially during extraction and purification stages, make it difficult for standardization. A review of the available technologies, including those based on intensification strategies, and their influence on fucoidan composition, structure, and anti-inflammatory potential of crude extracts and fractions is presented.
