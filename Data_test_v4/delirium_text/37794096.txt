Moreover, identifying novel probiotics can help develop a new therapeutic approach and may help in personalized probiotic-formulations for individual's unique gut microbiome. In this study, we evaluated the benefits of our novel probiotic strains in promoting healthy aging and whether they protect against Amyloid beta toxicity of Alzheimer's disease. Henceforth, we analyzed the impact of four different probiotics (Lactobacillus paracasei HII01, L. rhamnosus, L. reuteri, L. salivarius) on the lifespan extension of Caenorhabditis elegans model. Our results determine that L. paracasei HII01 provided the most positive effect on longevity and antiaging effects on C. elegans. The qPCR data and mutant-based studies indicated that L. paracasei HII01-mediated lifespan extension could be modulated by DAF-16 mediated pathway. The probiotic strains also protected the worms from the toxicity induced by beta-Amyloid-expressing (Abeta) transgenic C. elegans strains, and L. paracasei HII01 provided the most significant protection. Overall, identifying novel probiotics is an important area of research that can improve health outcomes. Our study showed that L. paracasei HII01 could be considered a dietary supplement for providing healthy aging and preventing aging-related diseases.
