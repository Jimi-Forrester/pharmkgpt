12440481|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains display A beta (Abeta) plaques, inflammatory changes and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Converging evidence suggests a neuronal origin of Abeta. We performed a temporal study of intraneuronal Abeta accumulation in Down syndrome (DS) brains. Sections from temporal cortex of 70 DS cases aged 3 to 73 years were examined immunohistochemicallyf or immunoreactivity (IR) for the Abeta N-terminal, the Abeta40 C-terminus and the Abeta42 C-terminus. N-terminal antibodies did not detect intracellular Abeta. Abeta40 antibodies did not detect significant intracellular Abeta, but older cases showed Abeta40 IR in mature plaques. In contrast, Abeta42 antibodies revealed clear-cut intraneuronal IR. All Abeta42 antibodies tested showed strong intraneuronal Abeta42 IR in very young DS patients, especially in theyoungest cases studied (e.g., 3 or 4yr. old), but this IR declined as extracellular Abeta plaques gradually accumulated and matured. No inflammatory changes were associated with intraneuronal Abeta. We also studied the temporal development of gliosis and NFT formation, revealing that in DS temporal cortex, inflammation and NFT follow Abeta deposition. We conclude that Abeta42 accumulates intracellularly prior to extracellular Abeta deposition in Down syndrome, and that subsequent maturation of extracellular Abeta deposits elicits inflammatory responses andprecedes NFTs.
