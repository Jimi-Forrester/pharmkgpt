38608829|a|Cognitive reserve has shown promise as a justification for neuropathologically unexplainable clinical outcomes in Alzheimer's disease. Recent evidence suggests this effect may be replicated in conditions like Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. However, the relationships between cognitive reserve and different cognitive abilities, as well as motor outcomes, are still poorly understood in these conditions. Additionally, it is unclear whether the reported effects are confounded by medication. This review analysed studies investigating the relationship between cognitive reserve and clinical outcomes in these alpha-synucleinopathy cohorts, identified from MEDLINE, Scopus, psycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science. 85 records, containing 176 cognition and 31 motor function effect sizes, were pooled using multilevel meta-analysis. There was a significant, positive association between higher cognitive reserve and both better cognition and motor function. Cognition effect sizes differed by disease subtype, cognitive reserve measure, and outcome type; however, no moderators significantly impacted motor function. Review findings highlight the clinical implications of cognitive reserve and importance of engaging in reserve-building behaviours.
