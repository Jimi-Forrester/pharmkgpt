33342280|t|Facilitating recruitment for dementia research: Insights from an international panel.
33342280|a|Dementia research is critical to improve dementia care; however, participation in this research remains limited, and recruitment is challenging. During an international panel at the 2018 Alzheimer Disease International Conference in Chicago, presentations were given to raise the profile of dementia research and share the patient experience of research participation. We observed notable shifts in perspectives on research participation from 39 participants who completed a survey before and after the presentations. These findings set the stage for future studies exploring the strength of independent motivations for research participation as well as improving recruitment efforts through education and peer support.
