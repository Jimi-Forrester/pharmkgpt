20641418|a|[[5 -(4-Hydroxyphenyl)[2,2 -bithiophen]-5-yl]methylene]-propanedinitrile (NIAD-4) is a fluorophore that was developed for optical imaging of amyloid-b (Ab) in the central nervous system (CNS) in basic and pre-clinical research for Alzheimer s disease (AD). Ab-peptide was sequenced from the meningeal blood vessels of AD patients and individuals with Downs syndrome (1). Ab peptides contain 40-42 amino acid residues and are metabolic products of Ab precursor protein (APP) from cleavage by b  and g secretases . Ab is also identified as the primary component of the neuritic plaques of AD patient brain tissue (2). The cloning of the gene encoding the APP and its localization to chromosome 21 led to the hypothesis that Ab accumulation is the primary event in AD pathogenesis (1, 3). This hypothesis proposes that neuronal death in AD is related to toxic effect of Ab on the adjacent cell bodies or cell processes (4). AD is a progressive, neurogenerative disorder of the CNS, and is characterized by a common set of clinical and pathological features . In addition to Ab, the microtubule-associated protein, tau ( ), is also found in the cell body and axons of neurons as neurofibrillary tangles. The search for a cure or effective treatment of AD requires <i>in vivo</i> detection and quantification of Ab in the brain for evaluation of the efficacy of AD therapy . Various amyloid-imaging probes have been developed based on positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, and optical imaging. Optical imaging is an imaging method that utilizes light photons emitted from bioluminescence and fluorescence probes (5). Fluorescence imaging in the visible light range of 395-600 nm can penetrate only to a depth of 1 2 cm and has significant background signal because of tissue autofluorescence. Depth penetration is one major limiting factor in <i>in vivo</i> optical imaging. Currently, <i>in vivo</i> optical imaging has wide applications in small animal imaging but only limited applications in large animal and human studies (6). Near-Infrared (NIR) (light range 650 900 nm) fluorescence imaging has the advantages of relatively higher tissue penetration and lower autofluorescence from nontarget tissue. One promising approach of developing optical imaging probes is based on the development of small-molecules of Ab staining compounds, such as Congo red and thioflavin T. The specific binding of these compounds to Ab aggregates is believed to be a combination of electrostatic interactions of the compounds with the Ab protein, and the compound s shape is complementary to Ab s surface whichinvolves hydrophobic interactions with the planarized aromatic   system of the compound (7, 8). In an effort to produce an <i>in vivo</i> optical imaging probe which gives specific far-red fluorescence, Nesterov et al. (7) developed NIAD-4 which has a relatively low molecular weight of 334 Da and a dithienyl-ethenyll  -conjugated bridge between donor and acceptor. NIAD-4 has a structure geometry that is readily planarized and results in a red shift upon binding to Ab. The highly polarizable bridge provides a substantial bathochromic shift in both absorption and emission spectra of the agent. The rigid rodlike aromatic core of the agent is designed to achieve high specific binding to Ab aggregrates. NIAD-4 is commercially available for <i>in vitro</i>/<i>in situ</i> applications and <i>in vivo</i> imaging in animal research.
