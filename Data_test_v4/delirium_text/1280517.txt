1280517|t|Serial reconstruction of beta-protein amyloid plaques: relationship to microvessels and size distribution.
1280517|a|The suggestion that the amyloid plaques in Alzheimer disease are formed by abnormal leakage from microvessels is mainly based on the finding that many plaques are topographically associated with microvessels. However, because the microvessel network is dense and amyloid plaques are numerous, the frequently observed association may result from chance contact, especially for larger plaques. Therefore, we determined the frequency of this association as a variable of plaque size. If all the amyloid plaques are associated with microvessels, a constant and high rate of association would be expected for all plaque sizes. On the other hand, if the association is a chance contact, larger plaques would show more frequent contact than smaller ones. Sections were double-immunostained for amyloid plaques and microvessels with antibodies raised against beta-protein and collagen type IV, respectively. Amyloid plaques were reconstructed using 12 serial sections (7 microns thick) from the entorhinal cortex of two Alzheimer patients. With reconstruction we determined the size distribution of amyloid plaques as well as the influence of size on vascular association. All the amyloid plaques larger than 42 microns were associated with microvessels, however, the smaller the amyloid plaques, the less frequently they were associated with microvessels. Interestingly, although diffuse amyloid plaques occur in all size classes, core-containing amyloid plaques have a more discrete size. We conclude that the topographical relationship between amyloid deposition and capillaries does not support the leakage theory for amyloid plaque formation.
