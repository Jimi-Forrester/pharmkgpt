37571344|t|Association between Nonfood Pre- or Probiotic Use and Cognitive Function: Results from NHANES 2011-2014.
37571344|a|In this study, we collected data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the years 2011-2014. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression were used to analyse the association between nonfood pro- or prebiotic use and cognitive function among elderly Americans. To estimate the potential unobserved results, propensity score matching (PSM) was used to analyse the causal effect. Nonfood pro- or prebiotic use was analysed through the Dietary Supplement Use 30-Day Study. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), the Animal Fluency Test (AFT), the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD), and a composite Z-score calculated by summing the Z-scores of three tests. Male participants who used nonfood pro- or prebiotics tended to have higher comprehensive cognitive function (sum.z) with a beta-coefficient of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.08-1.19). Probiotics or prebiotics may be a protective factor against cognitive impairment in males, with an odds ratio of 0.08 (95% CI: 0.02-0.29). Furthermore, the average treatment effect for the treated (ATT) with nonfood pro- or prebiotics (0.555) on sum.z in males was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Our research revealed that nonfood pre- or probiotic use was an effective method to improve cognitive function in elderly men from the USA.
