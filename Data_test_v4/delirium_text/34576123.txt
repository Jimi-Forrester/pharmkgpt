34576123|t|A Shotgun Proteomic Platform for a Global Mapping of Lymphoblastoid Cells to Gain Insight into Nasu-Hakola Disease.
34576123|a|Nasu-Hakola Disease (NHD) is a recessively inherited systemic leukodystrophy disorder characterized by a combination of frontotemporal presenile dementia and lytic bone lesions. NHD is known to be genetically related to a structural defect of TREM2 and DAP12, two genes that encode for different subunits of the membrane receptor signaling complex expressed by microglia and osteoclast cells. Because of its rarity, molecular or proteomic studies on this disorder are absent or scarce, only case reports based on neuropsychological and genetic tests being reported. In light of this, the aim of this paper is to provide evidence on the potential of a label-free proteomic platform based on the Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT), combined with in-house software and on-line bioinformatics tools, to characterize the protein expression trends and the most involved pathways in NHD. The application of this approach on the Lymphoblastoid cells from a family composed of individuals affected by NHD, healthy carriers and control subjects allowed for the identification of about 3000 distinct proteins within the three analyzed groups, among which proteins anomalous to each category were identified. Of note, several differentially expressed proteins were associated with neurodegenerative processes. Moreover, the protein networks highlighted some molecular pathways that may be involved in the onset or progression of this rare frontotemporal disorder. Therefore, this fully automated MudPIT platform which allowed, for the first time, the generation of the whole protein profile of Lymphoblastoid cells from Nasu-Hakola subjects, could be a valid approach for the investigation of similar neurodegenerative diseases.
