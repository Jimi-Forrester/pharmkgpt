37623051|t|Enhancing Therapeutic Efficacy of Curcumin: Advances in Delivery Systems and Clinical Applications.
37623051|a|Curcumin, a potent active compound found in turmeric and Curcuma xanthorrhiza oil, possesses a wide range of therapeutic properties, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and wound healing activities. However, its clinical effectiveness is hindered by its low bioavailability and rapid elimination from the body. To overcome these limitations, researchers have explored innovative delivery systems for curcumin. Some promising approaches include solid lipid nanoparticles, nanomicelle gels, and transdermal formulations for topical drug delivery. In the field of dentistry, curcumin gels have shown effectiveness against oral disorders and periodontal diseases. Moreover, Pickering emulsions and floating in situ gelling systems have been developed to target gastrointestinal health. Furthermore, curcumin-based systems have demonstrated potential in wound healing and ocular medicine. In addition to its therapeutic applications, curcumin also finds use as a food dye, contraception aid, corrosion-resistant coating, and environmentally friendly stain. This paper primarily focuses on the development of gel compositions of curcumin to address the challenges associated with its clinical use.
