35568778|t|Do Sleep Disturbances have a Dual Effect on Alzheimer's Disease?
35568778|a|Sleep disturbances and Alzheimer's disease have deleterious effects on various physiological and cognitive functions including synaptic plasticity, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and memory. In addition, clock genes expression is significantly altered following sleep disturbances, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In this review article, we aimed to discuss the role of sleep disturbances and Alzheimer's disease in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and clock genes expression. Also, we aimed to find significant relationships between sleep disturbances and Alzheimer's disease in the modulation of these mechanisms. We referred to the controversial effects of sleep disturbances (particularly those related to the duration of sleep deprivation) on the modulation of synaptic function and neuroinflammation. We aimed to know that, do sleep disturbances have a dual effect on the progression of Alzheimer's disease? Although numerous studies have discussed the association between sleep disturbances and Alzheimer's disease, the new point of this study was to focus on the controversial effects of sleep disturbances on different biological functions, and to evaluate the potential dualistic role of sleep disturbances in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
