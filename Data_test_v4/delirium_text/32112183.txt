32112183|a|Family members provide the majority of caregiving to individuals living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. Asian American families are disproportionately impacted by the burden of caregiving due to limited knowledge about the disease in this community. This study explored how Vietnamese American caregivers understand AD and provide care to family members with AD. Twenty caregivers who have provided care to a family member with AD participated in a semi-structured qualitative interview. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Several themes were identified in the caregivers' understanding of AD: (a) "Now I know:" the disruptions, shocks and surprises leading up to the initial diagnosis; (b) The frustrations of managing family members' cognitive impairments; (c)"Going with the flow:" challenges in managing personality and behavioral changes; (d) The exhaustion of around-the-clock caregiving; (e)"Taking it day by day" in the face of progressively worsening symptoms. Underlining the participants' descriptions of AD was a shared understanding of the progressively worsening, complex and unpredictable nature of the disease that makes it challenging for family caregivers on a daily basis. Findings provide important implications for healthcare workers' outreach to Vietnamese American families to ease the caregiving experience through culturally-responsive education, thereby enhancing the families' ability to recognize the early symptoms and seek appropriate help.
