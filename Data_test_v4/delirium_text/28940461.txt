28940461|t|Incidence and predictors of postoperative delirium after cytoreduction surgery-hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
28940461|a|BACKGROUND: Incidence of, and baseline characteristics associated with delirium in patients after cytoreduction surgery-hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC), were subject of investigation. METHODS: The study was conducted among a consecutive series of prospectively included patients who underwent CRS-HIPEC at the University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands, between February 2006 and January 2015. A chart-based instrument for delirium during hospitalization was used to identify patients with symptoms of delirium who were not diagnosed by a psychiatrist during admission. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Data of 136 patients were included in the analysis. Median age was 60 years (range: 18-76) and 50 (37%) patients were male. During hospitalization, 38 (28%) patients were diagnosed with delirium. Factors that differed significantly between the patients with and without delirium by univariate analysis were included in multivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that after adjustment for age and complications other than delirium, having three or more organs resected and the CRP serum levels were independent predictors for delirium (OR: 3.97; 95% 1.24-12.76; OR: 1.01; 95% 1-1.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This report shows an incidence of 28% of delirium, occurring after CRS-HIPEC and suggests a role for systemic inflammation in the development of postoperative delirium.
