29213522|t|Memory specificity training can improve working and prospective memory in amnestic mild cognitive impairment.
29213522|a|Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is one of the cognitive profiles of aging. OBJECTIVE: In this study, Memory Specificity Training (MEST) was used as cognitive training in patients with amnestic MCI to understand the effectiveness of the intervention on memory dimensions. METHODS: Twenty patients that met the criteria for amnestic MCI were selected and randomly assigned to experimental (n=10) or control (n=10) groups. The experimental group received five sessions of training on memory specificity while the participants in the control group took part in two general placebo sessions. Participants were assessed before, immediately after, and three months after, the treatment using the Autobiographical Memory Test, the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire, the Wechsler Memory Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Analysis of variance was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Results from both post-test and follow-up treatment indicated that MEST improves working and prospective memory (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings support the effectiveness of MEST for MCI patients as a viable cognitive intervention. Also, the findings have implications for the role of brain plasticity in the effectiveness of this intervention.
