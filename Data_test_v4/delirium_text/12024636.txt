12024636|t|Managing delirium and agitation in elderly hospitalized orthopaedic patients: Part 2--Interventions.
12024636|a|Delirium, a disorder of consciousness that may afflict over one-half of elderly surgical orthopaedic patients is a common sequela of surgery in the elderly. Agitation, either as an element of the delirium or dimension of a preexisting dementia, is another common behavioral problem that can confront the orthopaedic nurse in acute care. It is time now to tear down the barriers to intelligent and compassionate care of patients with agitation and delirium, including late or missed recognition and diagnosis, biases about what is "normal" and acceptable behavior in the elderly, and lack of familiarity with pharmacologic strategies. In Part 1 (Jan/Feb issue), current thinking about the phenomena was presented, including hypotheses about causation and pathophysiology. That foundation is intended to serve as the basis for the current discussion. The triad of interventions available to manage disorganized behavior in elderly orthopaedic patients is presented in Part 2. They include an extensive selection of pharmacologic options, a discussion of therapeutic use of self and environmental-organizational issues to address and consider on a case-by-case basis. Though it may be impossible to prevent behavioral decompensation during an acute orthopaedic admission, it is certainly possible to improve our performance to date, using a compassionate, intelligent, and inclusive approach with every patient.
