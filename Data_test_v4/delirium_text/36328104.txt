36328104|t|A Systematic Review of the Efficacy and Safety of Ketamine in Total Joint Arthroplasty.
36328104|a|BACKGROUND: Ketamine is administered intraoperatively to treat pain associated with primary total hip (THA) and knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ketamine in primary THA and TKA to support the combined clinical practice guidelines of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS), American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), Hip Society, Knee Society, and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Management (ASRA). METHODS: The MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for studies published prior to 2020 on ketamine in THA and TKA. All included studies underwent qualitative assessment and quantitative homogeneity testing followed by a systematic review and direct comparison meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of ketamine. After a critical appraisal of 136 publications, 7 high-quality studies were included for analyses. RESULTS: High-quality evidence demonstrates that intraoperative ketamine decreases postoperative opioid consumption. Four of 7 studies found that ketamine reduces postoperative pain. Intraoperative ketamine is not associated with an increase in adverse events and may reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting (relative risk [RR] 0.68; 95% CI 0.50-0.92). CONCLUSION: High-quality evidence supports the use of ketamine intraoperatively in THA and TKA to reduce postoperative opioid consumption. Most studies found ketamine reduces postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting. Moderate quality evidence supports the safety of ketamine, but it should be used cautiously in patients at risk for postoperative delirium, such as the elderly.
