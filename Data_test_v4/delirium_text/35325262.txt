35325262|a|BACKGROUND: Proximal femur fractures (PFFs) occur frequently among geriatric patients due to diverse risk factors, such as a lower bone mineral density and the increased risk of falls. METHODS: In this review, we focus on recent literature of patient-specific risk factors and their impact on common complications and outcome parameters in patients with PFF. RESULTS: Patient- and treatment related factors have a significant impact on outcome and are associated with an increased risk of mortality, impairments in functional rehabilitation and complicative courses. CONCLUSION: Geriatric patients at high risk for complications are nursing home inhabitants suffering from severe osteoporosis, dementia and sarcopenia. The early and ongoing assessment for these individual risk factors is crucial. Strategies including interdisciplinary approaches, addressing comorbidities and facilitating an optimal risk factor evaluation result in a beneficial outcome. The ongoing ambulant assessment and therapy of complicating factors (e.g., malnutrition, sarcopenia, frailty or osteoporosis) have to be improved.
