34039965|a|The circadian clock controls daily rhythms of physiological processes. The presence of the clock mechanism throughout the body is hampering its local regulation by small molecules. A photoresponsive clock modulator would enable precise and reversible regulation of circadian rhythms using light as a bio-orthogonal external stimulus. Here we show, through judicious molecular design and state-of-the-art photopharmacological tools, the development of a visible light-responsive inhibitor of casein kinase I (CKI) that controls the period and phase of cellular and tissue circadian rhythms in a reversible manner. The dark isomer of photoswitchable inhibitor 9 exhibits almost identical affinity towards the CKIalpha and CKIdelta isoforms, while upon irradiation it becomes more selective towards CKIdelta, revealing the higher importance of CKIdelta in the period regulation. Our studies enable long-term regulation of CKI activity in cells for multiple days and show the reversible modulation of circadian rhythms with a several hour period and phase change through chronophotopharmacology.
