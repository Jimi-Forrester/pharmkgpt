21380737|a|PROBLEM: Preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific hypertensive syndrome, is one of the leading causes of premature births as well as fetal and maternal death. Preeclampsia lacks effective therapies because of the poor understanding of disease pathogenesis. The aim of this paper is to review molecular signaling pathways that could be responsible for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. METHOD OF STUDY: This article reviews the English-language literature for pathogenesis and pathophysiological mechanisms of preeclampsia based on genome-wide gene expression profiling and proteomic studies. RESULTS: We show that the expression of the genes and proteins involved in response to stress, host-pathogen interactions, immune system, inflammation, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, growth and tissue remodeling was increased in preeclampsia. Several significant common pathways observed in preeclampsia overlap the datasets identified in TLR (Toll-like receptor)- and RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products)-dependent signaling pathways. Placental oxidative stress and subsequent chronic inflammation are considered to be major contributors to the development of preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes recent advances in TLR- and RAGE-mediated signaling and the target molecules, and provides new insights into the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.
