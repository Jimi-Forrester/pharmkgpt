28361953|a|Systemic AA amyloidosis arises from the misfolding of serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) protein and the deposition of AA amyloid fibrils at multiple sites within the body. Previous research already established that mononuclear phagocytes are crucial for the formation of the deposits in vivo and exposure of cultures of such cells to SAA1 protein induces the formation of amyloid deposits within the culture dish. In this study we show that both non-fibrillar and fibrillar SAA1 protein can be readily transferred between cultured J774A.1 cells, a widely used model of mononuclear phagocytes. We find that the exchange is generally faster with non-fibrillar SAA1 protein than with fibrils. Exchange is blocked if cells are separated by a membrane, while increasing the volume of cell culture medium had only small effects on the observed exchange efficiency. Taken together with scanning electron microscopy showing the presence of the respective types of physical interactions between the cultured cells, we conclude that the transfer of SAA1 protein depends on direct cell-to-cell contacts or tunneling nanotubes.
