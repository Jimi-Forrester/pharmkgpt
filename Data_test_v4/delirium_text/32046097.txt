32046097|t|Inflammasome and Cognitive Symptoms in Human Diseases: Biological Evidence from Experimental Research.
32046097|a|Cognitive symptoms are prevalent in the elderly and are associated with an elevated risk of developing dementia. Disease-driven changes can cause cognitive disabilities in memory, attention, and language. The inflammasome is an innate immune intracellular complex that has a critical role in the host defense system, in that it senses infectious pathogen-associated and endogenous danger-associated molecular patterns. An unbalanced or dysregulated inflammasome is associated with infectious, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative diseases. Due to its importance in such pathological conditions, the inflammasome is an emerging drug target for human diseases. A growing number of studies have revealed links between cognitive symptoms and the inflammasome. Several studies have shown that reducing the inflammasome component mitigates cognitive symptoms in diseased states. Therefore, understanding the inflammasome regulatory mechanisms may be required for the prevention and treatment of cognitive symptoms. The purpose of this review is to discuss the current understanding of the inflammasome and its relationships with cognitive symptoms in various human diseases.
