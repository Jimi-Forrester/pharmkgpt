37297946|t|Sustaining Life versus Altering Life-Saving Drugs: Insights to Explain the Paradoxical Effect of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation on Drugs.
37297946|a|There has been a substantial increase in the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support in critically ill adults. Understanding the complex changes that could affect drugs' pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) is of suitable need. Therefore, critically ill patients on ECMO represent a challenging clinical situation to manage pharmacotherapy. Thus, clinicians' ability to predict PK and PD alterations within this complex clinical context is fundamental to ensure further optimal and, sometimes, individualized therapeutic plans that balance clinical outcomes with the minimum drug adverse events. Although ECMO remains an irreplaceable extracorporeal technology, and despite the resurgence in its use for respiratory and cardiac failures, especially in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, scarce data exist on both its effect on the most commonly used drugs and their relative management to achieve the best therapeutic outcomes. The goal of this review is to provide key information about some evidence-based PK alterations of the drugs used in an ECMO setting and their monitoring.
