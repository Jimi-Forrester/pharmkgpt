37259091|a|Sepsis is the most common cause of admission to intensive care units worldwide. Sepsis patients frequently suffer from sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) reflecting acute brain dysfunction. SAE may result in increased mortality, extended length of hospital stay, and long-term cognitive dysfunction. The diagnosis of SAE is based on clinical assessments, but a valid biomarker to identify and confirm SAE and to assess SAE severity is missing. Several blood-based biomarkers indicating neuronal injury have been evaluated in sepsis and their potential role as early diagnosis and prognostic markers has been studied. Among those, the neuroaxonal injury marker neurofilament light chain (NfL) was identified to potentially serve as a prognostic biomarker for SAE and to predict long-term cognitive impairment. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of biomarkers, especially NfL, in SAE and discuss a possible future clinical application considering existing limitations.
