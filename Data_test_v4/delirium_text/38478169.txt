38478169|a|Necroptosis, a programmed cell death pathway, has been demonstrated to be activated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the precise role of necroptosis and its correlation with immune cell infiltration in AD remains unclear. In this study, we conducted non-negative matrix factorization clustering analysis to identify three subtypes of AD based on necroptosis-relevant genes. Notably, these subtypes exhibited varying necroptosis scores, clinical characteristics and immune infiltration signatures. Cluster B, characterized by high necroptosis scores, showed higher immune cell infiltration and was associated with a more severe pathology, potentially representing a high-risk subgroup. To identify potential biomarkers for AD within cluster B, we employed two machine learning algorithms: the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and Random Forest. Subsequently, we identified eight feature genes (CARTPT, KLHL35, NRN1, NT5DC3, PCYOX1L, RHOQ, SLC6A12, and SLC38A2) that were utilized to develop a diagnosis model with remarkable predictive capacity for AD. Moreover, we conducted validation using bulk RNA-seq, single-nucleus RNA-seq, and in vivo experiments to confirm the expression of these feature genes. In summary, our study identified a novel necroptosis-related subtype of AD and eight diagnostic biomarkers, explored the roles of necroptosis in AD progression and shed new light for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of this disease.
