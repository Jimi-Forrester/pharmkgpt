37236067|a|The precise causation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unknown, and the factors that contribute to its etiology are highly complicated. Numerous research has been conducted to investigate the potential impact of various factors to the risk of AD development or prevention against it. A growing body of evidence suggests to the importance of the gut microbiota-brain axis in the modulation of AD, which is characterized by altered gut microbiota composition. These changes can alter the production of microbial-derived metabolites, which may play a detrimental role in disease progression by being involved in cognitive decline, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and accumulation of Abeta and tau. The focus of this review is on the relationship between the key metabolic products of the gut microbiota and AD pathogenesis in the brain. Understanding the action of microbial metabolites can open up new avenues for the development of AD treatment targets.
