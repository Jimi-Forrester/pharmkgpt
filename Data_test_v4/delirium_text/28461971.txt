28461971|a|In our previous review, we described brain cholesterol metabolism in control conditions and in the case of some rare neurological pathologies linked to defects in the genes which are directly involved in the synthesis and/or traffic of cholesterol. Here, we have analyzed disruptions in cholesterol homeostasis in widespread neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases) and autism spectrum disorders. We particularly focused on the synaptic dysfunctions that could arise from changes in both membrane cholesterol availability and oxysterol production. Notably, alterations in the brain cholesterol metabolism and neurotransmission occur in the early stages of these pathologies and the polymorphism of the genes associated with cholesterol homeostasis and synaptic communication affects the risk of onset and severity of these diseases. In addition, pharmacological and genetic manipulations of brain cholesterol homeostasis in animal models frequently have marked effects on the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the development of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and autism spectrum disorders may be partially associated with an imbalance of cholesterol homeostasis that leads to changes in the membrane cholesterol and oxysterol levels that, in turn, modulates key steps in the synaptic transmission.
