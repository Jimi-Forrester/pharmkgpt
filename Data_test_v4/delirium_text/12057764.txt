12057764|t|The relationship between oxidative/nitrative stress and pathological inclusions in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
12057764|a|Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD) are late-onset neurodegenerative diseases that have tremendous impact on the lives of affected individuals, their families, and society as a whole. Remarkable efforts are being made to elucidate the dominant factors that result in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Extensive postmortem studies suggest that oxidative/nitrative stresses are prominent features of these diseases, and several animal models support this notion. Furthermore, it is likely that protein modifications resulting from oxidative/nitrative damage contribute to the formation of intracytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of each disease. The frequent presentation of both AD and PD in individuals and the co-occurrence of inclusions characteristic of AD and PD in several other neurodegenerative diseases suggests the involvement of a common underlying aberrant process. It can be surmised that oxidative/nitrative stress, which is cooperatively influenced by environmental factors, genetic predisposition, and senescence, may be a link between these disorders.
