35173173|a|Early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by an aggressive buildup of amyloid beta (Abeta) proteins, yet the neural circuit operations impacted during the initial stages of Abeta pathogenesis remain elusive. Here, we report a coding impairment of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) grid cell network in the J20 transgenic mouse model of familial AD that over-expresses Abeta throughout the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Grid cells showed reduced spatial periodicity, spatial stability, and synchrony with interneurons and head-direction cells. In contrast, the spatial coding of non-grid cells within the MEC, and place cells within the hippocampus, remained intact. Grid cell deficits emerged at the earliest incidence of Abeta fibril deposition and coincided with impaired spatial memory performance in a path integration task. These results demonstrate that widespread Abeta-mediated damage to the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit results in an early impairment of the entorhinal grid cell network.
