1361081|a|Observations with slow-release neuroleptics used in the treatment of inpatients of a psychiatric ward of a general hospital have been discussed. The comparative examinations were performed within a period of two and a half years in a total of 48 patients who were ranged into two groups at random. One group received Piportil, the other Haloperidol decanoate therapy. It has to be emphasized that Haloperidol is available also in its tablet form and as short-acting injection, and is readily accessible (contrary to other products), so it is a good basis for assessing the expectable effectivity of and tolerance to depot products. When comparing the two drugs, in the course of Piportil administration neuroleptic depression developed more frequently, in one case delirium occurred which unwanted effects did not develop in the course of the administration of Haloperidol decanoate. According to our observations on a low number of cases relapse also occurred more frequently in the Piportil-treated cases. Pathological change was not observed in the results of routine laboratory examinations in the course of the administration of any of the drugs. The advantages of the use of depot products have been discussed in detail from both the physician's and the patient's aspect. Due to their beneficial antipsychotic action schizophrenic clinical conditions and especially paranoid conditions constitute the major indication field of these drugs. The use of depot products in the treatment of patients refusing therapy means a dramatic change.
