25610551|t|Predictors of prolonged mechanical ventilation after open heart surgery.
25610551|a|INTRODUCTION: Due to the importance of prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) as a postoperative complication, predicting "high-risk" patients by identifying predisposing risk factors is of important issue. The present study was aimed to identify perioperative variables associated with PMV in patients undergoing open heart surgery. METHODS: A total of 743 consecutive patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class III, who were scheduled to undergo open heart surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass were included in this observational study. Perioperative variables were compared between the patients with and without PMV, as defined by an extubation time of >48 h. RESULTS: PMV occurred in 45 (6.1%) patients. On univariate analysis, pre-operative variables; including gender, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); chronic kidney disease and endocarditis, intra-operative variables; including type of surgery, operation time, pump time, transfusion in operating room and postoperative variables; including bleeding and inotrope-dependency were significantly different between patients with and without PMV (all P<0.001, except for COPD and transfusion in operating room; P=0.004 and P=0.017, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings reinforce that risk stratification for predicting delayed extubation should be an important aspect of preoperative clinical evaluation in all anesthesiology settings.
