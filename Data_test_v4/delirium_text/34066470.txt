34066470|t|Zinc Affects Cholesterol Oxidation Products and Fatty Acids Composition in Rats' Serum.
34066470|a|The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of the nanosized or microsized zinc (Zn) particles on fatty acid profile, enzyme activity and the level of cholesterol, squalene and oxysterols in rats with breast cancer. Rats (female, n = 24) were divided into the following groups: control, and two test groups, whose diets were enriched with either Zn microparticles (342 nm) or Zn nanoparticles (99 nm). All rats were treated twice with the carcinogenic agent; 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene. In rats whose diet was enriched with zinc (especially in the form of nanoparticles), the number and sizes of tumors were lower. Diet supplementation also significantly reduced the cholesterol (p = 0.027) and COPs (cholesterol oxidation products) levels (p = 0.011) in rats serum. Enriching the diet with Zn microparticles decreased the Delta6-desaturase activity (p < 0.001). Zn influences fatty acids' profile in rats' serum as well as inhibiting desaturating enzymes. A reduced amount of pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid derivatives may be the expected effect.
