9816700|t|Therapeutic implications of microglia activation by lipopolysaccharide and reactive oxygen species generation in septic shock and central nervous system pathologies: a review.
9816700|a|The pathophysiology of organ system failure in sepsis, in particular the effects of septic shock on the central nervous system, are still incompletely understood. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria affects the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and causes the activation of brain microglia. A growing body of research supports involvement of activated brain microglia in brain pathologies caused by infectious diseases, trauma, tumors, ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Down's syndrome, multiple sclerosis and AIDS. Those seminal studies that have contributed to the characterization of the in vivo and in vitro effects of LPS on microglia function, mediator generation and receptor expression are presented within a historical perspective. In particular, all those in vitro studies on O2-, H2O2 and NO. generation by either unprimed or primed microglia have been extensively reviewed. The apparent controversial effect of LPS on microglia O2- is discussed. Because treatment modalities for septic shock have not significantly affected the current high mortality, alternative strategies with antioxidants are currently being investigated. Reduction of microglia O2- generation is proposed as a possible complementary strategy to antioxidative therapy for septic shock and CNS pathologies that involve activated microglia.
