39445210|t|The Potential of Gingival Crevicular Fluid as a Tool for Molecular Diagnosis: A Systematic Review.
39445210|a|A biomarker is defined as a characteristic that is measured as an indicator of a normal biological or pathological process, a response to an exposure or intervention. Biomarkers with a diagnostic approach must identify not only the presence but also the absence of the disease with high precision, so having the biological source of the said marker is of vital importance to ensure precision and accuracy; the aim was to carry out a review of its diagnostic potential. The search strategy was carried out in three databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. The keywords that were used were as follows: "gingival crevicular fluid", "Biomarker", and "Diagnosis", using the Boolean operator "AND". The filter was used at 10 years. Within the type of molecules most studied, the cytokine family was the most abundant with 25.42% of the studies, followed by metalloproteinases and proteins with 16.9% each one. Studies that included RNA-type genetic material were less frequently found. As has been demonstrated, the use of GCF as a source of biomolecules for diagnostic use has been increasing, both for oral diseases, which reflects the local conditions of the disease; it also has the ability to reflect the development of distant diseases; and this is because GCF is a blood ultrafiltrate.
