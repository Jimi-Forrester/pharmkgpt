37176104|t|Systemic Metabolism and Mitochondria in the Mechanism of Alzheimer's Disease: Finding Potential Therapeutic Targets.
37176104|a|Elderly people over the age of 65 are those most likely to experience Alzheimer's disease (AD), and aging and AD are associated with apparent metabolic alterations. Currently, there is no curative medication against AD and only several drugs have been approved by the FDA, but these drugs can only improve the symptoms of AD. Many preclinical and clinical trials have explored the impact of adjusting the whole-body and intracellular metabolism on the pathogenesis of AD. The most recent evidence suggests that mitochondria initiate an integrated stress response to environmental stress, which is beneficial for healthy aging and neuroprotection. There is also an increasing awareness of the differential risk and potential targeting strategies related to the metabolic level and microbiome. As the main participants in intracellular metabolism, mitochondrial bioenergetics, mitochondrial quality-control mechanisms, and mitochondria-linked inflammatory responses have been regarded as potential therapeutic targets for AD. This review summarizes and highlights these advances.
