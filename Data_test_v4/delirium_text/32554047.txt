32554047|t|Apolipoprotein D.
32554047|a|ApoD is a 25 to 30 kDa glycosylated protein, member of the lipocalin superfamily. As a transporter of several small hydrophobic molecules, its known biological functions are mostly associated to lipid metabolism and neuroprotection. ApoD is a multi-ligand, multi-function protein that is involved lipid trafficking, food intake, inflammation, antioxidative response and development and in different types of cancers. An important aspect of ApoD's role in lipid metabolism appears to involve the transport of arachidonic acid, and the modulation of eicosanoid production and delivery in metabolic tissues. ApoD expression in metabolic tissues has been associated positively and negatively with insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in a tissue dependent manner. ApoD levels rise considerably in association with aging and neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, meningoencephalitis, moto-neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. ApoD is also modulated in several animal models of nervous system injury/pathology.
