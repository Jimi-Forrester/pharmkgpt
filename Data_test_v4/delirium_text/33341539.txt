33341539|t|Antipsychotics and hemodialysis: A systematic review.
33341539|a|OBJECTIVE: Antipsychotics play a crucial role in the management of behavioral problems in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Oral and injectable antipsychotics are routinely prescribed to control emergent delirium or exacerbation of previous psychiatric symptoms. However scanty literature is available on the pharmacokinetics of antipsychotics in such patients. Avoiding amisulpride and warning against increasing the dosage in renal failure is the only recommendation by drug manufacturers and clinical guidelines. Hemodialysis affects the volume of distribution (Vd) and blood levels of antipsychotics in a complex manner. It is hence difficult to equate data on renal failure with hemodialysis to reliably predict the treatment response. METHOD: We systematically analyzed online data from 1981 to 2019 on the use of antipsychotics in hemodialysis. The outcome was defined as the safety and efficacy of AP, measured in terms of adverse effects and relapse of existing or new onset of behavioral symptoms in Hemodialysis. RESULTS: The data from 182 studies revealed that only 14 case reports and 1 case series met the review criteria. Oral Risperidone, Clozapine, Aripiprazole, Ziprasidone, Haloperidol, and Long-acting Risperidone, Flupenthixol, and Paliperidone were the antipsychotics studied in terms of pharmacokinetics during hemodialysis. AP levels in the blood were found to be unaffected in two studies during HD while the other two studies recommended scheduling of AP regimen w.r.t HD session. Six reports mentioned exacerbation of pre-existing psychiatric ailments in patients undergoing HD, the most common being schizophrenia. CONCLUSION: Findings of the review reveals modest evidence favoring multiple dosing regimens of oral aripiprazole, ziprasidone, olanzapine, and risperidone. Long-acting risperidone and paliperidone are well tolerated and half of the conventional dose may be effective in the case of paliperidone. Though CYP-3A4 remains relatively and transiently unaltered during hemodialysis, none of the antipsychotics are compromised in HD. While selecting an AP during HD, one has to consider the protein binding, clearance by dialysis, duration of an HD session, route of administration of AP, and impaired bowel absorption in HD.
