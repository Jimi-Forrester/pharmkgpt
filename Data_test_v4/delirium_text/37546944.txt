37546944|t|The Potential Role of Ocular and Otolaryngological Mucus Proteins in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
37546944|a|Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating illness associated with a constellation of other symptoms. While the most common symptom is unrelenting fatigue, many individuals also report suffering from rhinitis, dry eyes and a sore throat. Mucin proteins are responsible for contributing to the formation of mucosal membranes throughout the body. These mucosal pathways contribute to the body's defense mechanisms involving pathogenic onset. When compromised by pathogens the epithelium releases numerous cytokines and enters a prolonged state of inflammation to eradicate any particular infection. Based on genetic analysis, and computational theory and modeling we hypothesize that mucin protein dysfunction may contribute to ME/CFS symptoms due to the inability to form adequate mucosal layers throughout the body, especially in the ocular and otolaryngological pathways leading to low grade chronic inflammation and the exacerbation of symptoms.
