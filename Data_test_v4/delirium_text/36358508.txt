36358508|t|Hydrogen Sulfide Biomedical Research in China-20 Years of Hindsight.
36358508|a|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important gasotransmitter that is produced by mammalian cells and performs profound physiological and pathophysiological functions. Biomedical research on H2S metabolism and function in China began 20 years ago, which pioneered the examination of the correlation of abnormal H2S metabolism and cardiovascular diseases. Over the last two decades, research teams in China have made numerous breakthrough discoveries on the effects of H2S metabolism on hypertension, atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension, shock, angiogenesis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pain, iron homeostasis, and testicle function, to name a few. These research developments, carried by numerous research teams all over China, build nationwide research network and advance both laboratory study and clinical applications. An integrated and collaborative research strategy would further promote and sustain H2S biomedical research in China and in the world.
