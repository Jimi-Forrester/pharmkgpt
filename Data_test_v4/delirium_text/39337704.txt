39337704|t|NMDARs in Alzheimer's Disease: Between Synaptic and Extrasynaptic Membranes.
39337704|a|N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate receptors with key roles in synaptic communication and plasticity. The activation of synaptic NMDARs initiates plasticity and stimulates cell survival. In contrast, the activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs can promote cell death underlying a potential mechanism of neurodegeneration occurring in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The distribution of synaptic versus extrasynaptic NMDARs has emerged as an important parameter contributing to neuronal dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases including AD. Here, we review the concept of extrasynaptic NMDARs, as this population is present in numerous neuronal cell membranes but also in the membranes of various non-neuronal cells. Previous evidence regarding the membranal distribution of synaptic versus extrasynaptic NMDRs in relation to AD mice models and in the brains of AD patients will also be reviewed.
