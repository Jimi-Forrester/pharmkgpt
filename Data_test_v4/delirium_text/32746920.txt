32746920|t|Body image before and after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: comparison and its contributing factors.
32746920|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the world. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is among the treatment options for coronary artery disease. However, it is associated with significant physical and psychological problems. This study sought to compare body image before and after the surgery and to determine its contributing factors. METHODS: This comparative study was conducted in 2017 on a sample of 140 patients consecutively recruited from Shahid Beheshti hospital, Kashan, Iran. Body image was assessed before and 4 weeks after the surgery (T1 and T2) using Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire. The independent-sample and paired t tests, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson correlation test, and multiple regression were conducted for data analysis. RESULTS: Participants' mean score of body image was 139.60 +- 13.21 at T1 and 160.25 +- 7.75 at T2 and the variation was statistically significant (p = < 0.001). At T1, only the three factors of age (p = 0.005), education at high school diploma and higher levels (p < 0.001), and being housekeeper (P = 0.048) could significantly explain BI (R2 = 0.231). However, at T2, none of the factors were significant predictors for BI (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Candidates for CABG have poor body image. After the surgery, their body image improves significantly. Healthcare providers need to employ programs to improve body image among these patients.
