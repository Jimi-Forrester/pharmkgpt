30236753|a|Today, find a good and effective drug for improving the incidence of Alzheimer disease (AD) is a major concern among scientists. Many researchers have recently targeted curcumin, a yellow powder from Curcuma longa, as the useful source of anti-Alzheimer agent. Though this compound widely used since ancient times as food color and/or additive, currently some researchers believed that this compound can treat AD-affected brains. However, the accurate mechanism of action of curcumin in the treatment of AD is obscure. In the recently published paper by Bijari et al. this compound (or pigment) considered as the functional food to cure AD. Their paper aimed to prove evident for the anti-AD activity of curcumin, but I found several errors with this paper that should be corrected by the authors. All of my queries and concerns are listed in the main text of this letter.
