32049831|a|BACKGROUND: Sugammadex reverses rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade quickly and effectively. This study compared efficacy of sugammadex and pyridostigmine for reversal of rocuronium-induced light block or minimal block in children scheduled for elective entropion surgery. METHODS: A prospective randomized study was conducted on 60 pediatric patients aged 1 to 11 years and scheduled for entropion surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia. Neuromuscular blockade was achieved by administration of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium and assessed using train-of-four (TOF) ulnar nerve stimulation. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups receiving sugammadex 2 mg/kg or pyridostigmine 0.2 mg/kg plus glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg. Primary outcomes were time from reversal agents administration to TOF ratio 0.9 and time from reversal agent administration to TOF ratio 1.0. Time from TOF ratio 0.9 to extubation, time from TOF ratio 1.0 to extubation, and postoperative adverse events were also recorded. RESULTS: There were no substantial differences in demographic variables. Time from reversal agents administration to TOF ratio 0.9 and time from reversal agents to TOF ratio 1.0 were significantly faster in sugammadex group: 1.30 +- 0.84 versus 3.53 +- 2.73 minutes (P < .001) and 2.75 +- 1.00 versus 5.73 +- 2.83 minutes (P < .001). Extubation time was shorter in sugammadex group. Incidence of skin rash, nausea, vomiting, and postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade (airway obstruction) was not statistically different between groups. Incidence of patients agitation in recovery room was lower in sugammadex group. CONCLUSION: Sugammadex provided more rapid reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in pediatric patients undergoing surgery lasting 30 to 60 minutes than did pyridostigmine plus glycopyrrolate, with no differences in incidence of adverse events between groups.
