36911089|a|In hospitalized patients the prevalence of constipation is high, especially among elderly patients. Constipation impacts significantly the quality of life of patients and is associated with increased morbidity and length of hospital stay. This retrospective observational study intended to identify the prevalence of constipation in patients hospitalized in an internal medicine ward. In a sample of 80 patients, the median age was 79 years and 53% (n = 42) were women. We identified constipation in 68% (n = 56) of the patients during hospitalization. The medical team prescribed treatment only to 70% of those patients. Constipation was responsible for delirium in 11% of patients and 5% suffered urinary retention. This study shows constipation is prevalent among patients admitted in an internal medicine ward. Systematic assessment of this problem can improve the overall care of the patients, alleviate symptoms, and prevent complications.
