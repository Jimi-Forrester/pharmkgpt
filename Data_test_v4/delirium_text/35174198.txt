35174198|t|Association of Vitamin K Insufficiency With Cognitive Dysfunction in Community-Dwelling Older Adults.
35174198|a|Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin shown to be associated with several age-related diseases. Although a small number of epidemiological studies described the relationship between vitamin K status and cognitive impairment, vitamin K status was estimated by relatively special methods in previous reports. Here, we demonstrated the association of the concentration of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) in serum, which is a biomarker for vitamin K insufficiency, with cognitive function in a cross-sectional study. A total of 800 community-dwelling older adults (mean age = 75.9) were invited to geriatric health examination, including a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a blood test. By using binary logistic regression analysis, the risk of cognitive impairment equivalent or below the mild cognitive impairment level for each tertile of ucOC was examined, with the lowest tertile as the reference. We found a significant association of impaired cognitive function and concentration of ucOC in the highest tertile of ucOC, with the odds ratio of 1.65 (95% CI, 1.06 to 2.59, P = 0.028). When the analysis was repeated with each domain of MMSE, the highest tertile of ucOC was associated with impaired orientation, calculation, and language. As far as we know, this is the first report on the significant association of single ucOC measurement and cognitive impairment. Our analysis also suggests that vitamin K insufficiency could be associated with selected categories of cognitive function. Since the single measurement of ucOC in serum is a simple and widely available method for vitamin K evaluation, it could be useful as a biomarker of neurodegenerative diseases affecting the cognitive functions.
