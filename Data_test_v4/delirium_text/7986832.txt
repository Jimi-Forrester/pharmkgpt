7986832|t|Determination of xanomeline in human plasma by ion-spray tandem mass spectrometry.
7986832|a|Xanomeline is a muscarinic receptor agonist currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. A fast, sensitive and specific assay has been developed to determine xanomeline plasma concentrations using ion-spray tandem mass spectrometry. Xanomeline and a structural analog, LY282122, were extracted from basifed plasma into hexane. The dried hexane extracts were reconstituted and injected onto a 10 x 1 mm C18 reversed-phase column. A mobile phase of 33 mM ammonium acetate and 0.33% acetic acid in 30/70 (v/v) water-acetonitrile was pumped through the column at 50 microliters min-1. The mobile phase eluant was introduced directly into the ion-spray interface. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion mode for specific detection of the product ions of xanomeline and the internal standard. The method has a linear range of 0.075-5.0 ng xanomeline per milliliter of plasma. Sample run times were 2.5 min from one injection to the next.
