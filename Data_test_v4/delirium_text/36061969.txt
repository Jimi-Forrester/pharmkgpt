36061969|a|Background: Postoperative delirium (PD) is a major concern in geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. This prospective observational study aims to examine the incidence of PD, to identify intervention-specific risk factors and to investigate the influence of orthopedic surgery on delirium. Methods: From 2019 to 2020, 132 patients >=70 years of age with endoprosthetic (Group E) or spinal surgery (Group S) were included. Upon admission, the ISAR score, the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale, potential risk factors, the ASA score, duration of surgery, type of anesthesia, blood loss, and hemoglobin drop were recorded. For risk factor analysis patients were grouped into Group D (delirium) and Group ND (no delirium). Primary endpoint was the occurrence of PD. Results: Of 132 patients, 50 were included in Group E and 82 in Group S. Mean age and ISAR score were not significantly different between groups. Delirium rate in Group E and S was 12% vs. 18% (p = 0.3). Differences could be observed between Group D and ND in duration of surgery (173 min vs. 112 min, p = 0.02), postoperative hemoglobin drop (3.2 g/dl vs. 2.3 g/dl; p = 0.026), history of PD (23% vs. 11%, p = 0.039) and use of isoflurane (6 vs. 2). Type of surgery was not an independent risk factor (p = 0.26). Conclusion: Specific type of orthopedic surgery is not an independent risk factor for PD. Prevention of PD should focus on duration of surgery and blood loss, particularly in patients with a history of PD. A possible delirogenic potential of isoflurane should be further studied.
