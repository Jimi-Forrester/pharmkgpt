33757547|a|BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests a causal link between periodontitis and cognitive disorders. Systemic inflammation initiated by periodontitis may mediate the development of cognitive impairment. Our study aims to investigate the effect of ligature-induced periodontitis on cognitive function and the role of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) in this process. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ligature-induced periodontitis was established, and the rats were treated intraperitoneally with/without the pSTAT3 inhibitor cryptotanshinone (CTS). Alveolar bone resorption and periodontal inflammation were detected by micro-computed tomography analysis and histopathological evaluation. Locomotor activity and cognitive function were evaluated by the open field test and the Morris water maze test, respectively. The activation of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus and cortex was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expression of interleukins (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-21) in both the periphery and cortex was evaluated by RT-PCR and ELISA. The expression of TLR/NF-kappaB and ROS cascades was evaluated by RT-PCR. The expression of pSTAT3 and the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway (JAK2, STAT3, and pSTAT3) in the periodontal tissue and cortex were assessed by IHC and Western blot. The expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its key secretases was evaluated by RT-PCR. The level of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) and the ratio of Abeta1-40/1-42 were measured via ELISA in the plasma and cortex while IHC was used to detect the level of Abeta1-42 in the brain. RESULTS: In periodontal ligature rats, significant alveolar bone resorption and local inflammatory cell infiltration were present. Apparent increases in inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-21) were detected in peripherial blood and brain. Additionally, spatial learning and memory ability was impaired, while locomotor activity was not affected. Activated microglia and astrocytes were found in the cortex and hippocampus, presenting as enlarged cell bodies and irregular protrusions. Levels of TLR/NF-kB, PPAR and ROS were altered. The STAT3 signaling pathway was activated in both the periodontal tissue and cortex, and the processing of APP by beta- and gamma-secretases was promoted. The changes mentioned above could be relieved by the pSTAT3 inhibitor CTS. CONCLUSIONS: Ligature-induced periodontitis in rats resulted in systemic inflammation and further abnormal APP processing, leading to cognitive impairments. In this progress, the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway may play an important role by increasing inflammatory load and promoting neuroinflammation.
