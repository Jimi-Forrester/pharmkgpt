29858092|t|Supplemental Treatment for Huntington's Disease with miR-132 that Is Deficient in Huntington's Disease Brain.
29858092|a|Huntington's disease (HD) is an intractable neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutant Huntingtin (HTT) proteins that adversely affect various biomolecules and genes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are functional small non-coding RNAs, are also affected by mutant HTT proteins. Here, we show amelioration in motor function and lifespan of HD-model mice, R6/2 mice, by supplying miR-132 to HD brains using a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) miRNA expression system. miR-132 is an miRNA related to neuronal maturation and function, but the level of miR-132 in the brain of R6/2 mice was significantly lower than that of wild-type mice. Our miR-132 supplemental treatment, i.e., supplying miR-132 to the brain, produced symptomatic improvement or retarded disease progression in R6/2 mice; interestingly, it had little effect on disease-causing mutant HTT mRNA expression and its products. Therefore, the findings suggest that there may be a therapeutic way to treat HD without inhibiting and/or repairing disease-causing HTT genes and gene products. Although miR-132 supplement may not be a definitive treatment for HD, it may become a therapeutic method for relieving HD symptoms and delaying HD progression.
