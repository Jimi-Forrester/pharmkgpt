35683075|t|Heat Treatments of Metastable beta Titanium Alloy Ti-24Nb-4Zr-8Sn Processed by Laser Powder Bed Fusion.
35683075|a|Titanium alloys, especially beta alloys, are favorable as implant materials due to their promising combination of low Young's modulus, high strength, corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility. In particular, the low Young's moduli reduce the risk of stress shielding and implant loosening. The processing of Ti-24Nb-4Zr-8Sn through laser powder bed fusion is presented. The specimens were heat-treated, and the microstructure was investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The mechanical properties were determined by hardness and tensile tests. The microstructures reveal a mainly beta microstructure with alpha'' formation for high cooling rates and alpha precipitates after moderate cooling rates or aging. The as-built and alpha'' phase containing conditions exhibit a hardness around 225 HV5, yield strengths (YS) from 340 to 490 MPa, ultimate tensile strengths (UTS) around 706 MPa, fracture elongations around 20%, and Young's moduli about 50 GPa. The alpha precipitates containing conditions reveal a hardness around 297 HV5, YS around 812 MPa, UTS from 871 to 931 MPa, fracture elongations around 12%, and Young's moduli about 75 GPa. Ti-24Nb-4Zr-8Sn exhibits, depending on the heat treatment, promising properties regarding the material behavior and the opportunity to tailor the mechanical performance as a low modulus, high strength implant material.
