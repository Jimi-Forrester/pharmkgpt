30031569|a|Neurological disease patients living alone or with a single caregiver need a support system to care for their psychological symptoms. We evaluated the clinical effects of a unique telephone call system that automatically called participants at their desired times once a week for 3 months. In total, 104 neurological disease patients and caregivers were evaluated by the geriatric depression scale, apathy scale and state and trait anxiety inventories (STAI) forms X-I for depression, apathy and state anxiety, respectively. High baseline STAI scores (40>=) significantly improved in the Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) + multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients (p = 0.001, p = 0.013 and p = 0.046, respectively) after patients/caregivers used the telephone call service. The baseline (pre) STAI score significantly correlated with the score change (post-pre) in PD, ALS, SCD + MSA, Alzheimer' s disease patients (ADp), and caregivers for ADp (p < 0.0001, p = 0.001, p = 0.011, p = 0.025 and p = 0.020, respectively). The geriatric depression scale and apathy scale did not significantly improve. The present study suggests that there is a positive effect of using an automated telephone call service for anxiety in neurological disease patients and caregivers, especially in ALS, SCD + MSA and PD patients with high STAI scores (40>=).
