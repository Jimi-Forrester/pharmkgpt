38644842|a|Methylene blue (MB) was found to exert neuroprotective effect on different brain diseases, such as ischemic stroke. This study assessed the MB effects on ischemia induced brain edema and its role in the inhibition of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) expression. Rats were exposed 1 h transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), and MB was injected intravenously following reperfusion (3 mg/kg). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was performed 48 h after the onset of tMCAO to evaluate the brain infarction and edema. Brain tissues injuries as well as the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), AQP4 and mGluR5 expressions were detected. Oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) was performed on primary astrocytes (ASTs) to induce cell swelling. MB was administered at the beginning of reoxygenation, and the perimeter of ASTs was measured by GFAP immunofluorescent staining. 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) and fenobam were given at 24 h before OGD to examine their effects on MB functions on AST swelling and AQP4 expression. MB remarkably decreased the volumes of T2WI and ADC lesions, as well as the cerebral swelling. Consistently, MB treatment significantly decreased GFAP, mGluR5 and AQP4 expression at 48 h after stroke. In the cultivated primary ASTs, OGD/R and DHPG significantly increased ASTs volume as well as AQP4 expression, which was reversed by MB and fenobam treatment. The obtained results highlight that MB decreases the post-ischemic brain swelling by regulating the activation of AQP4 and mGluR5, suggesting potential applications of MB on clinical ischemic stroke treatment.
