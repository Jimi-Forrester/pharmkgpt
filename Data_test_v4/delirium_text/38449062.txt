38449062|a|BACKGROUND: With the aging of human society, more and more elderly patients have to undergo surgery and anesthesia. Clinical observations have indicated from time to time that spinal anesthesia in the elderly appears to last longer than in young people, although there is limited research in this area and the mechanism is unclear at present time. This research work is expected to help understand the decline of local anesthetic metabolism in cerebrospinal fluid of elderly patients so as to help them with precise anesthesia and rapid rehabilitation. METHODS: Twenty patients with spinal anesthesia in orthopedic lower limb surgery were selected to study the rate of drug metabolism in cerebrospinal fluid in two age groups, i.e.,18-30 years old and 75-90 years old. Ropivacaine in peripheral blood is used as a probe to reflect the speed of drug metabolism in cerebrospinal fluid. The contents of total Abeta protein and hyaluronic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid were investigated as well. RESULTS: The equivalent dose of ropivacaine anesthetizes the elderly group for a longer time. The metabolism rate of ropivacaine in an elderly patient was slower than that of a young patient. No significant difference in total Abeta protein between the two groups was observed while hyaluronic acid in the elderly group was significantly higher than that in the young group. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the dose of ropivacaine should be reduced when used for anesthesia in elderly patients. The cumulation of ropivacaine and HA appears to imitate the degeneration of central lymphatic circulation metabolism in elderly people.
