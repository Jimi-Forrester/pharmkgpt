20920207|t|Therapeutic versus neuroinflammatory effects of passive immunization is dependent on Abeta/amyloid burden in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
20920207|a|BACKGROUND: Passive immunization with antibodies directed to Abeta decreases brain Abeta/amyloid burden and preserves memory in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This therapeutic strategy is under intense scrutiny in clinical studies, but its application is limited by neuroinflammatory side effects (autoimmune encephalitis and vasogenic edema). METHODS: We intravenously administered the monoclonal Abeta protofibril antibody PFA1 to aged (22 month) male and female 3 x tg AD mice with intermediate or advanced AD-like neuropathologies, respectively, and measured brain and serum Abeta and CNS cytokine levels. We also examined 17 month old 3 x tg AD female mice with intermediate pathology to determine the effect of amyloid burden on responses to passive immunization. RESULTS: The 22 month old male mice immunized with PFA1 had decreased brain Abeta, increased serum Abeta, and no change in CNS cytokine levels. In contrast, 22 month old immunized female mice revealed no change in brain Abeta, decreased serum Abeta, and increased CNS cytokine levels. Identical experiments in younger (17 month old) female 3 x tg AD mice with intermediate AD-like neuropathologies revealed a trend towards decreased brain Abeta and increased serum Abeta accompanied by a decrease in CNS MCP-1. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that passive immunization with PFA1 in 3 x tg AD mice with intermediate disease burden, regardless of sex, is effective in mediating potentially therapeutic effects such as lowering brain Abeta. In contrast, passive immunization of mice with a more advanced amyloid burden may result in potentially adverse effects (encephalitis and vasogenic edema) mediated by certain proinflammatory cytokines.
