27392854|t|Diagnosis of Dementia in the Specialist Setting: A Comparison Between the Swedish Dementia Registry (SveDem) and the Registry of Dementias of Girona (ReDeGi).
27392854|a|The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of dementia diagnoses from two dementia registries in Europe. Patients registered between 2007 and 2013 in the Swedish Dementia Registry (SveDem; Sweden) and in the Registry of Dementias of Girona (ReDeGi; North-East of Spain) were selected. We compared sociodemographic data, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, dementia subtype, and medication consumption of 22,384 cases from SveDem and 5,032 cases from ReDeGi. The average age (78.1 years SveDem versus 79.7 years ReDeGi) and the gender (female 58.2% SveDem versus 61.5% ReDeGi) did not greatly differ. MMSE score at diagnosis was higher for SveDem cases (22.1 versus 17.8). Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounted for the main dementia subtype (36.6% SveDem versus 55.6% ReDeGi). The proportion of vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed dementia was higher in SveDem (18.8% versus 6.4% and 24.9 versus 13.4%), with an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for SveDem relative to the ReDeGi of 3.41 (3.03-3.84) for VaD, and 2.15 (1.97-2.35) for mixed dementia. This was at the expense of a lower frequency of AD in SveDem (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.39-0.44). Other dementia diagnoses such as frontotemporal dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies did not significantly differ between registries (2.3% versus 2.9%; 1.9 versus 3.1%). Large differences in medication consumption at the time of dementia diagnosis were detected (4.7 treatments SveDem versus 6.8 ReDeGi). Northern and southern European dementia cohorts differ in demographic characteristics, MMSE score at diagnosis, and drug treatment profile.
