32434685|t|[The cognitive-behavioural impact of hypertension].
32434685|a|Arterial hypertension is considered the main modifiable vascular risk factor that causes silent damage to brain vessels. This vascular brain injury could be the common nucleus that justifies the cognitive (cognitive impairment, dementia and Alzheimer's disease) and behavioural symptoms (late-life depression) of target organ damage mediated-hypertension. Incomplete knowledge about the complex pathophysiology that links hypertension with cognitive-behavioural changes is overlooking brain involvement and underestimating cardio and cerebrovascular risk. The confluence of cognitive impairment, depression and arterial hypertension in elderly adults, warns of the need for a comprehensive evaluation to plan treatment, improve prognosis and contribute to reducing the risk of dementia and its incidence.
