8883234|t|Usage of haloperidol for delirium in cancer patients.
8883234|a|Although haloperidol is mainly used for the medical treatment of delirium in cancer patients, there are no universally accepted guidelines for its usage. We accordingly assessed the usefulness in managing delirium of a haloperidol treatment regimen in ten delirious cancer patients. The results of this preliminary study suggest that, in the management of delirium, appropriate usage of haloperidol on the first day is important as it affects the dosage thereafter.
