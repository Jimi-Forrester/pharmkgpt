35667744|a|Severe complications related to COVID-19 occur infrequently in children and adolescents. these life-threatening complications are mainly acute respiratory failure from acute COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). MIS-C is a postinfectious complication occurring approximately 3 to 6 weeks mostly after an asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. For both types of complications, supportive ICU care is often required. For MIS-C critical illness, immunomodulation is prescribed to reverse hyperinflammation and its cardiac and other sequelae.
