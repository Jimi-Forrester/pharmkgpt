34585216|t|The Cost-Effectiveness of Three Prevention Strategies in Alzheimer's Disease: Results from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT).
34585216|a|BACKGROUND: To date, no curative treatment is available for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, efforts should focus on prevention strategies to improve the efficiency of healthcare systems. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of three preventive strategies for AD compared to a placebo. DESIGN: The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) study was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled superiority trial with four parallel groups, including three intervention groups (one group with Multidomain Intervention (MI) plus a placebo, one group with Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PFA), one group with a combination of PFA and MI) and one placebo group. SETTING: Participants were recruited and included in 13 memory centers in France and Monaco. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling subject aged 70 years and older were followed during 3 years. INTERVENTIONS: We used data from the MAPT study which aims to test the efficacy of a MI along PFA, the MI plus a placebo, PFA alone, or a placebo alone. MEASUREMENT: Direct medical and non-medical costs were calculated from a payer's perspective during the 3 years of follow-up. The base case incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) represents the cost per improved cognitive Z-score point. Sensitivity analyses were performed using different interpretation of the effectiveness criteria. RESULTS: Analyses were conducted on 1,525 participants. The ICER at year 3 that compares the MI + PFA and the MI alone to the placebo amounted to $21,443 and $21,543 respectively, per improved Z score point. PFA alone amounted to $111,720 per improved Z score point. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that ICERS of PFA combined with MI and MI alone amounted to $21,443 and $21,543 respectively per improved Z score point compared to the placebo and are below the WTP of $50,000 while the ICER of PFA alone amounted to $111,720 per improved Z score point. This information may help decision makers and serve as a basis for the implementation of a lifetime decision analytic model.
