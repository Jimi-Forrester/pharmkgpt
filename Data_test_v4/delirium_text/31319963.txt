31319963|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Clathrin is an adaptor protein that serves as the principal element of the vesicle-coating complex and is important for the membrane cleavage to dispense the invaginated vesicle from the plasma membrane. The functional loss of clathrins has been tied to a lot of human diseases, i.e., neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, Alzheimer's diseases, and so on. Therefore, creating a precise model to identify its functions is a crucial step towards understanding human diseases and designing drug targets. METHODS: We present a deep learning model using a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) profiles to identify clathrin proteins from high throughput sequences. Traditionally, the 2D CNNs take images as an input so we treated the PSSM profile with a 20 x 20 matrix as an image of 20 x 20 pixels. The input PSSM profile was then connected to our 2D CNN in which we set a variety of parameters to improve the performance of the model. Based on the 10-fold cross-validation results, hyper-parameter optimization process was employed to find the best model for our dataset. Finally, an independent dataset was used to assess the predictive ability of the current model. RESULTS: Our model could identify clathrin proteins with sensitivity of 92.2%, specificity of 91.2%, accuracy of 91.8%, and MCC of 0.83 in the independent dataset. Compared to state-of-the-art traditional neural networks, our method achieved a significant improvement in all typical measurement metrics. CONCLUSIONS: Throughout the proposed study, we provide an effective tool for investigating clathrin proteins and our achievement could promote the use of deep learning in biomedical research.
