38930019|a|Background/Objectives: Immediate breast reconstruction surgery (BRS) often leads to significant postoperative pain, necessitating effective analgesia. This study aimed to compare the analgesic efficacy of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) containing nefopam with that of PCA containing opioids alone in patients undergoing BRS. Methods: A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted on 120 patients undergoing immediate BRS after mastectomy. Patients were randomly allocated to receive PCA with fentanyl alone (Group F: fentanyl 10 mcg/kg), fentanyl and nefopam (Group FN: fentanyl 5 mcg/kg + nefopam 1 mg/kg), or nefopam alone (Group N: nefopam 2 mg/kg). Pain intensity (expressed in VASr and VASm), opioid consumption, and opioid-related complications were assessed. Results: PCA with nefopam, either alone or in combination with opioids, demonstrated non-inferior analgesic efficacy compared to PCA with fentanyl alone. At 24 h postoperatively, the VASr scores were 2.9 +- 1.0 in Group F, 3.1 +- 1.2 in Group FN, and 2.8 +- 0.9 in Group N (p = 0.501). At the same timepoint, the VASm scores were 4.1 +- 1.2 in Group F, 4.5 +- 1.5 in Group FN, and 3.8 +- 1.4 in Group N (p = 0.129). Significant differences among the three groups were observed at all timepoints except for PACU in terms of the total opioid consumption (p < 0.0001). However, there were no significant differences in opioid-related complications among the three groups. Conclusions: PCA with nefopam, whether alone or in combination with opioids, offers non-inferior analgesic efficacy compared to PCA with fentanyl alone in patients undergoing immediate BRS.
