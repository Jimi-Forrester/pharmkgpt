30387904|a|BACKGROUND: PD psychosis is often associated with cognitive impairment, including dementia, and involves dopaminergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic mechanisms. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the differential effect of the antipsychotic pimavanserin, a selective serotonin 2A receptor inverse agonist, in PD psychosis patients with versus without cognitive impairment and in those receiving versus not receiving cognitive-enhancing medications. METHODS: Data from the pivotal randomized clinical trial of pimavanserin for PD psychosis were stratified by (1) screening MMSE score as cognitively impaired (21-24) versus unimpaired (>=25) and (2) concomitant use versus nonuse of cognitive-enhancing medications. The primary outcome measure was change in the PD-adapted Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms. RESULTS: Mean (pimavanserin vs. placebo) change from baseline was larger in the cognitively impaired (n = 50; -6.62 vs. -0.91; P = 0.002) versus the cognitively unimpaired (n = 135; -5.50 vs. -3.23; p = 0.046) group. The comparable change was -6.04 versus -2.18 (P = 0.012) and -5.66 versus -3.15 (P = 0.041) in patients treated (n = 69) and not treated (n = 116) with concomitant cognitive-enhancing medication. Pimavanserin was similarly tolerated across all cognitive groups with no additional safety concerns identified. Overall adverse event rates were comparable across the concomitant cognitive-enhancing medication groups; however, rates of serious adverse events and discontinuations attributed to adverse events were increased in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: The antipsychotic effect of pimavanserin is robust in PD patients with cognitive impairment and may be enhanced by concomitant cognitive-enhancing medication use. Future prospective studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.   2018 The Authors.
