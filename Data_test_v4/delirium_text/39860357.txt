39860357|t|Effects of Implementing an Enhanced Recovery After Cardiac Surgery Protocol with On-Table Extubation on Patient Outcome and Satisfaction-A Before-After Study.
39860357|a|Background/Objectives: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols aim to improve clinical outcomes, shorten hospital length of stay (LOS), and reduce costs through a multidisciplinary perioperative approach. Although introduced in colorectal surgery, they are less established in cardiac surgery, especially in combination with on-table extubation (OTE). This study evaluates the impact of a novel ERAS concept with OTE (RERACS) in elective aortic-valve-replacement and coronary bypass surgery. Methods: In a monocentric study, we compared a prospective RERACS-group (n = 114) to a retrospective control group (n = 119) (TRIAL Registration (DRKS00031402). The RERACS concept contained multiple perioperative treatment measures such as respiratory training, short fasting, and OTE. The control group received standard care. Results: Primary endpoint: postoperative LOS. Secondary measurements: length of postoperative vasoactive drug support, duration of mechanical ventilation, complication rate, and patient satisfaction on the second postoperative day. RERACS patients showed significantly shorter postoperative length of stay (ICU: 40 +- 34 h vs. 56 +- 51 h, p = 0.005; hospital: 9 +- 4 d vs. 11 +- 6 d, p = 0.028), lower nosocomial infection rates (24% vs. 40%), fewer cases of postoperative cognitive dysfunction ((subsyndromal) delirium 40% vs. 57%), reduced nausea and vomiting (14.9% vs. 32.8%), and faster weaning from catecholamines (22 +- 30 h vs. 42 +- 48 h, p < 0.001), as well as high patient satisfaction. Conclusions: Our study indicated that an ERAS concept with OTE is safe and associated with faster and improved recovery, including lower catecholamine requirements, reduced LOS, and high patient satisfaction in low-risk cardiac surgery.
