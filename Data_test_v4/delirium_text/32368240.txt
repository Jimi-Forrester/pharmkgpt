32368240|a|INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as a therapeutic option for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). However, an association between cognitive functions (CF) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in TAVI patients is still unclear. AIM: To assess the long-term changes in CF and HRQoL in elderly patients with AS after TAVI. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 259 patients who underwent cardiological and psychological TAVI qualification were enrolled and divided into the normal (n = 174) and impaired cognition group (n = 85). CF and HRQoL characteristics assessed at baseline and 13 months were compared between groups. The analysis of multiple linear regression was performed to identify the association between HRQoL and CF and to assess the influence of TAVI on HRQoL. RESULTS: There was no difference in CF between baseline and follow-up. However, an improvement in attention functions and memory skills in the cognitively impaired group was noted at follow-up. In addition, HRQoL scores increased in both groups. An independent predictor associated with HRQoL was global CF (beta = -213, p = 0.01), which explained 7% of CF variation. Improvements in all five dimensions of HRQoL, from 4.8% in self-care and up to 33.6% in pain/discomfort, were found. At follow-up, 60% of TAVI patients had improved health, 12% had worse health, 4% showed no change and 24% had a "mixed" change. CONCLUSIONS: TAVI is associated with positive changes in the functioning of elderly patients at long-term follow-up.
