16914880|t|Consensus guidelines for the clinical and pathologic diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB): report of the Consortium on DLB International Workshop.
16914880|a|Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) was considered to be an uncommon cause of dementia until improved neuropathological staining methods for ubiquitin were developed in the late 1980's. Subsequent recognition that 10-15% of dementia cases in older people were associated with Lewy body pathology led to the publication in 1996 of Consensus clinical and pathological diagnostic criteria for the disorder. These have greatly raised global awareness of DLB and helped to generate a body of knowledge which informs modern clinical management of this pharmacologically sensitive group of patients. They have also enabled important issues surrounding the relationships of DLB with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease to be addressed and partially resolved. A recent re-evaluation of the Consensus criteria has confirmed many aspects of the original recommendations, supplementing these with suggestions for improved pathological characterisation, clinical detection and management. Virtu-ally unrecognised 20 years ago, DLB could within this decade be one of the best characterised and potentially treatable neurodegenerative disorders of late life.
