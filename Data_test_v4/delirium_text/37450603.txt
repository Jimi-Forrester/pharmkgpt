37450603|a|Patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency can present with impaired free water excretion and hyponatremia, which is due to the enhanced secretion of vasopressin (AVP) despite increased total body water. AVP is produced in magnocellular neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) and supraoptic nucleus and in parvocellular corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the PVH. This study aimed to elucidate whether magnocellular AVP neurons or parvocellular CRF neurons co-expressing AVP are responsible for the pathogenesis of hyponatremia in secondary adrenal insufficiency. The number of CRF neurons expressing copeptin, an AVP gene product, was significantly higher in adrenalectomized AVP-floxed mice (AVPfl/fl) than in sham-operated controls. Adrenalectomized AVPfl/fl mice supplemented with aldosterone showed impaired water diuresis, under ad libitum access to water or after acute water loading. They became hyponatremic after acute water loading, and it was revealed under the condition that aquaporin-2 (AQP2) protein levels were increased in the kidney. Furthermore, translocation of AQP2 to the apical membrane was markedly enhanced in renal collecting duct epithelial cells. Remarkably, all these abnormalities observed in the mouse model for secondary adrenal insufficiency were ameliorated in CRF-AVP-/- mice that lacked AVP in CRF neurons. Our study demonstrates that CRF neurons in the PVH are responsible for the pathogenesis of impaired water excretion in secondary adrenal insufficiency.
