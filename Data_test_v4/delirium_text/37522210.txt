37522210|t|Neuropathologic Changes of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias: Relevance to Future Prevention.
37522210|a|BACKGROUND: Decedents with late-life dementia are often found at autopsy to have vascular pathology, cortical Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, and/or TDP-43 encephalopathy alone or with concurrent Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesions. Nonetheless, it is commonly believed that AD neuropathologic changes (NC) are the dominant or exclusive drivers of late-life dementia. OBJECTIVE: Assess associations of end-of-life cognitive impairment with any one or any combination of five distinct NC. Assess impairment prevalence among subjects having natural resistance to each type of NC. METHODS: Brains from 1,040 autopsied participants of the Honolulu-Asia Study, the Nun Study, and the 90 + Study were examined for NC of AD, Lewy body dementia, microvascular brain injury, hippocampal sclerosis, and limbic predominate TDP-43 encephalopathy. Associations with impairment were assessed for each NC and for NC polymorbidity (variable combinations of 2-5 concurrent NC). RESULTS: Among 387 autopsied decedents with severe cognitive impairment, 20.4% had only AD lesions (ADNC), 25.3% had ADNC plus 1 other NC, 11.1% had ADNC plus 2 or more other NC, 28.7% had no ADNC but 1-4 other NC, and 14.5% had no/negligible NC. Combinations of any two, three, or four NC were highly frequent among the impaired. Natural resistance to ADNC or any other single NC had a modest impact on overall cohort impairment levels. CONCLUSION: Polymorbidity involving 1-5 types of concurrent NC is a dominant neuropathologic feature of AD and related dementias. This represents a daunting challenge to future prevention and could explain failures of prior preventive intervention trials and of efforts to identify risk factors.
