30656148|a|Brain inflammation is involved in many brain disorders, such as brain ischemic injury, Alzheimer diseases, and Parkinson disease. Physical exercise has been recommended for the prevention and treatment of many brain inflammatory diseases. In the present study, the effects of exercise on motor function in relation with apoptotic neuronal cell death following neuroinflammation were investigated. Moreover, we compared the effect of forced exercise with voluntary exercise on neuroinflammation-induced motor malfunction. For this study, rota-rod test, vertical pole test, foot fault test, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, immunohistochemistry for caspase-3, and western blot for Bcl-2 and Bax were performed. Lipopolysaccharide was intraventricular infused for induction of brain inflammation. Treadmill exercise and wheel exercise were conducted during 6 weeks. In the present results, Treadmill exercise and wheel exercise alleviated brain inflammation-induced motor impairments by suppressing apoptotic neuronal cell death in the motor cortex. These effects of treadmill exercise and wheel exercise were similarly appeared.
