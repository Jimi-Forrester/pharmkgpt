37288373|t|Caesium carbonate promoted regioselective O-functionalization of 4,6-diphenylpyrimidin-2(1H)-ones under mild conditions and mechanistic insight.
37288373|a|A facile one-step catalyst free methodology has been developed for the regioselective functionalization of 4,6-diphenylpyrimidin-2(1H)-ones under mild conditions. Selectivity towards the O-regioisomer was achieved by using Cs2CO3 in DMF without use of any coupling reagents. A total of 14 regioselective O-alkylated 4,6-diphenylpyrimidines were synthesized in 81-91% yield. In the DFT studies it was observed that the transition state for the formation of the O-regioisomer is more favourable with Cs2CO3 as compared to K2CO3. Furthermore, this methodology was extended to increase the O/N ratio for the alkylation of 2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one derivatives.
