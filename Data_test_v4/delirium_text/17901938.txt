17901938|t|[Pharmacotherapy of elderly patients].
17901938|a|There is a complex interaction between age-driven changes in physiology and functional limitations in the elderly, which influences the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and management of drug therapy. Another frequent characteristic is multimorbidity, which results in polypharmacy and is a major cause of adverse drug reactions due to drug-drug interactions. Furthermore there are special risks in the elderly, which may alter the risk-benefit analysis of drug therapy and renal impairment, falls and delirium are of particular significance. These factors are discussed in detail and preventive strategies are given to optimize drug therapy in this population. Furthermore, the risks of frequently prescribed drugs and drugs bearing special risks in the elderly are outlined.
