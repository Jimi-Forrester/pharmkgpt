36751225|t|A Retrospective Analysis of Guanfacine for the Pharmacological Management of Delirium.
36751225|a|Background Delirium is a syndrome of acute brain failure that represents a change from an individual's baseline cognitive functioning characterized by deficits in attention and multiple aspects of cognition that fluctuate in severity over time. The symptomatic management of delirium's behavioral manifestations remains difficult. The alpha-2 agonists, dexmedetomidine and clonidine, are efficacious, but their potential cardiovascular adverse effects limit their utilization. Guanfacine is an oral alpha-2 agonist with a lower potential for such adverse outcomes; however, its use in delirium has not been studied. Methods A retrospective descriptive analysis of guanfacine for managing hyperactive or mixed delirium at Tampa General Hospital from January 2020 to October 2020 was conducted. The primary outcome was the time reduction in acute sedative administration. Secondary outcomes included renewed participation in physical therapy or occupational therapy (PT/OT), decreased opioid use, and an incidence of cardiovascular adverse effects. Results One hundred forty-nine patients were identified as having received guanfacine for managing delirium during the study period. All experienced a reduction in acute sedative use after the initiation of guanfacine. In 93 patients receiving PT/OT and no longer participating due to behavioral agitation, 74% had a documented renewal of services within four days. Of 112 patients on opioids, 70% experienced a 25% reduction in opioid administration within four days. No patients experienced consecutive episodes of hypotension that required a change in their clinical care. Two patients experienced a single episode of consecutive bradycardia that led to the discontinuation of guanfacine.  Conclusions Based on our retrospective study, guanfacine is a well-tolerated medication for the management of delirium. Even in medically and critically ill patients, cardiovascular adverse events were rare with guanfacine. Patients treated with guanfacine experienced decreased acute sedative use for behavioral agitation. Additionally, patients treated with guanfacine received fewer opioids and were better able to participate in PT/OT. Future studies with prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled designs are warranted to evaluate this promising intervention for delirium further.
