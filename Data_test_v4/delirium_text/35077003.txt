35077003|t|Intensive care-related cognitive impairment: A biopsychosocial overview.
35077003|a|Advancements in critical care medicine have improved survival rates for patients experiencing critical illness in intensive care units (ICUs). Although mortality has declined, more than half of ICU survivors experience functional impairments that persist beyond discharge. Of particular concern is ICU-related cognitive impairment, which can extend across the care continuum, ranging from acute and transient presentations in the ICU (eg, delirium) to long-term impairments years after discharge. ICU-related cognitive impairment has received increased attention in the literature, particularly as it relates to ICU survivors who have received and survived critical care in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and are now experiencing postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The medical complexity and heterogeneity of ICU survivors, coupled with the multifactorial etiology of ICU-related cognitive impairments, lead to challenges in how to optimize care for ICU survivors at various stages of recovery. This review aims to provide an overview of cognitive outcomes associated with critical illness by integrating recent literature focused on etiology, assessment, and interventions in the context of ICU-related cognitive impairments. The narrative review employs a biopsychosocial framework to comprehensively evaluate the multifactorial nature of ICU-related cognitive outcomes. Authors also highlight that multidisciplinary teams composed of key rehabilitation providers are likely best suited for optimizing recovery trajectories of ICU survivors.
