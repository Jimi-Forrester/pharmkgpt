37653770|t|Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging on brain network in amnestic mild cognitive impairment: A mini-review.
37653770|a|Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a stage between normal aging and Alzheimer disease (AD) where individuals experience a noticeable decline in memory that is greater than what is expected with normal aging, but dose not meet the clinical criteria for AD. This stage is considered a transitional phase that puts individuals at a high risk for developing AD. It is crucial to intervene during this stage to reduce the changes of AD development. Recently, advanced multimodal magnetic resonance imaging techniques have been used to study the brain structure and functional networks in individuals with aMCI. Through the use of structural magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional magnetic resonance imaging, abnormalities in certain brain regions have been observed in individuals with aMCI. Specifically, the default mode network, salience network, and executive control network have been found to show abnormalities in both structure and function. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the brain structure and functional networks associated with aMCI. By analyzing the existing literature on multimodal magnetic resonance imaging and aMCI, this study seeks to uncover potential biomarkers and gain insight into the underlying pathogenesis of aMCI. This knowledge can then guide the development of future treatments and interventions to delay or prevent the progression of aMCI to AD.
