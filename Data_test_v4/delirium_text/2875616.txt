2875616|t|Comparative investigation of chlormethiazole and neuroleptic agents in the treatment of alcoholic delirium.
2875616|a|A retrospective study comparing the efficacy of chlormethiazole and neuroleptic agents showed that a mortality rate of 0% was associated with chlormethiazole treatment and 6% with neuroleptic treatment (P less than 0.005). Data from the literature support this result. Chlormethiazole treatment seems to be superior to the neuroleptic treatment of alcoholic delirium.
