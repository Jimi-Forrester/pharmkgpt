29564391|t|Automation of the Radiosynthesis of Six Different 18F-labeled radiotracers on the AllinOne.
29564391|a|BACKGROUND: Fast implementation of positron emission tomography (PET) into clinical and preclinical studies highly demands automated synthesis for the preparation of PET radiopharmaceuticals in a safe and reproducible manner. The aim of this study was to develop automated synthesis methods for these six 18F-labeled radiopharmaceuticals produced on a routine basis at the University of Pennsylvania using the AllinOne synthesis module. RESULTS: The development of automated syntheses with varying complexity was accomplished including HPLC purification, SPE procedures and final formulation with sterile filtration. The six radiopharmaceuticals were obtained in high yield and high specific activity with full automation on the AllinOne synthesis module under current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) guidelines. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates the versatility of this synthesis module for the preparation of a wide variety of 18F-labeled radiopharmaceuticals for PET imaging studies.
