36685078|t|Holothuria scabra extracts confer neuroprotective effect in C. elegans model of Alzheimer's disease by attenuating amyloid-beta aggregation and toxicity.
36685078|a|Background and aim: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common aged-related neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with the toxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation in the brain. While the efficacies of available drugs against AD are still limited, natural products have been shown to possess neuroprotective potential for prevention and therapy of AD. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of H. scabra extracts against Abeta aggregation and proteotoxicity in C. elegans model of Alzheimer's diseases. Experimental procedure: Whole bodies (WB) and body wall (BW) of H. scabra were extracted and fractionated into ethyl acetate (WBEA, BWEA), butanol (WBBU, BWBU), and ethanol (BWET). Then C. elegans AD models were treated with these fractions and investigated for Abeta aggregation and polymerization, biochemical and behavioral changes, and level of oxidative stress, as well as lifespan extension. Results and conclusion: C. elegans AD model treated with H. scabra extracts, especially triterpene glycoside-rich ethyl acetate and butanol fractions, exhibited significant reduction of Abeta deposition. These H. scabra extracts also attenuated the paralysis behavior and improved the neurological defects in chemotaxis caused by Abeta aggregation. Immunoblot analysis revealed decreased level of Abeta oligomeric forms and the increased level of Abeta monomers after treatments with H. scabra extracts. In addition, H. scabra extracts reduced reactive oxygen species and increased the mean lifespan of the treated AD worms. In conclusion, this study demonstrated strong evidence of anti-Alzheimer effects by H. scabra extracts, implying that these extracts can potentially be applied as natural preventive and therapeutic agents for AD.
