7607222|t|The glycan moiety of human pancreatic lithostathine. Structure characterization and possible pathophysiological implications.
7607222|a|Lithostathine, also known as pancreatic stone protein, pancreatic thread protein or regenerating protein, is a glycoprotein which is normally found in the exocrine pancreas, whereas in other tissues it appears either only under pathological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (brain), cancer (colon) or during regeneration (endocrine pancreas). In the latter case, it has been shown recently that it acts as a growth factor which stimulates islet regeneration. Little is known about its glycan moiety, which conceivably might be involved in this tissue specificity and pathophysiological characteristics. Therefore we isolated the major oligosaccharide chains of human pancreatic lithostathine and determined their sequences by means of NMR analysis. We obtained eleven different glycoforms and we were able to determine the sequence of seven of them. They all were from the same site of glycosylation (Thr5) and displayed the same core 2 structure: GlcNAc(beta 1-6)[Gal(beta 1-3)]GalNAc alpha-. They ranged in size from 4 to 9 sugar residues. Elongation was found to proceed from a common tetrasaccharidic core: Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc(beta 1-6)[Gal(beta 1-3)]GalNAc-ol through N-acetyllactosamine units. The non-reducing ends of some oligosaccharides carry the antigenic determinant H, with presence of external Fuc linked only in (alpha 1-2) to Gal. All the glycans, except one, carry a sialic acid in (alpha 2-3) linkage to Gal, with one disialylated form which displays a supplementary (alpha 2-6) linkage. These findings are consistent with the polymorphism of the protein, shown by means of SDS gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing, either in its native form or after enzymic processing. Moreover, sialylation seems to protect to some extent the Arg11-Ile12 bond from in situ hydrolysis, thus preventing the harmful precipitation of the C-terminal polypeptide in the pancreatic ducts.
