12197070|a|The potentiation of central cholinergic activity has been proposed as a therapeutic approach for improving cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Increasing the acetylcholine concentration in brain by modulating acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity is among the most promising strategies. We have used a combinatorial approach to identify different 2,5-piperazinediones (DKP) with AChE inhibitory activity. Our goal was to find inhibitors exhibiting high AChE/BuChE (butyrylcholinesterase) selectivity, in order to reduce the undesirable side effects elicited by most of the inhibitors that have been developed to date. Screening of a DKP library constructed on solid-phase using the multiple parallel synthesis format, resulted in the identification of several compounds with moderate efficacy on AChE. In particular, DKP-80 had an IC50 = 2.2 microM with no significant inhibitory activity on BuChE. Moreover, estimated values of Clog P and log BB for the most active compounds fulfilled the bioavailability requirements for enzyme inhibitors acting on the central nervous system. In order to understand the inhibitory properties of the ligand at the molecular level, molecular dynamics simulations were computed on DKP-80 complexed to AChE, and the most relevant binding interactions of this inhibitor to the active center of the enzyme were characterized. Overall the present results indicate that the DKP-based compounds identified are novel AChE inhibitors which may be considered likely lead compounds for further development of drug candidates against Alzheimer's disease.
