21903112|a|Cholinergic receptors have been implicated in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. However, to better target therapeutically the appropriate receptor subsystems, we need to understand more about the functions of those subsystems. In the current series of experiments, we assessed the functional role of M(1) receptors in cognition by testing M(1) receptor-deficient mice (M1R(-/-)) on the five-choice serial reaction time test of attentional and response functions, carried out using a computer-automated touchscreen test system. In addition, we tested these mice on several tasks featuring learning, memory and perceptual challenges. An advantage of the touchscreen method is that each test in the battery is carried out in the same task setting, using the same types of stimuli, responses and feedback, thus providing a high level of control and task comparability. The surprising finding, given the predominance of the M(1) receptor in cortex, was the complete lack of effect of M(1) deletion on measures of attentional function per se. Moreover, M1R(-/-) mice performed relatively normally on tests of learning, memory and perception, although they were impaired in object recognition memory with, but not without an interposed delay interval. They did, however, show clear abnormalities on a variety of response measures: M1R(-/-) mice displayed fewer omissions, more premature responses, and increased perseverative responding compared to wild-types. These data suggest that M1R(-/-) mice display abnormal responding in the face of relatively preserved attention, learning and perception.
