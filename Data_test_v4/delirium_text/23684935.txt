23684935|a|Stereoselective differences in pharmacokinetics between clausenamide (CLA) enantiomers have been found after intravenous and oral administration of each enantiomer to rats. The differences could be associated with excretion and first-pass metabolism of two enantiomers. The data from this study demonstrated that (-)CLA was mainly excreted in feces with 13.9% of dose, whereas (+)CLA in bile with 17.2%. A large portion of CLA enantiomers could be transformed into hydroxyl metabolites. In the in vitro metabolic system using rat liver microsomes, it was found that (-)CLA was cleared more than its antipode with peak height ratios [(+)/(-)] from 1.0 to 1.8 at the corresponding substrate concentrations from 0.25 to 2mM. Further study in rabbits showed that two enantiomers underwent an intermediate degree of first-pass metabolism. (-)CLA had lower concentrations and AUC0-8h in the portal vein and heart than those of (+)CLA with rates of hepatic extraction 64.7% for (-)-isomer and 50.8% for (+)-isomer, and intrinsic metabolic clearances of (-) and (+)CLA being 186.3 and 107.2 (l/h), respectively. The first-pass metabolism was involved in CYP3A enzymes in the gut and liver, and different levels of CYP3A1 expression induced by (-)CLA or (+)CLA. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that (-)-isomer significantly increased the expression of CYP3A1, while (+)-isomer had no obvious effects on it. Taken together, the results provided new evidence that stereoselective pharmacokinetics of CLA enantiomers could be resulted from their stereoselective excretion, first-pass metabolism and induction to metabolizing enzymes, which might be important in understanding the clinic pharmacology of active eutomer, (-)CLA, for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
