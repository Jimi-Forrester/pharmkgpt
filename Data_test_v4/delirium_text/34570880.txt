34570880|a|Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains the leading cause of nonrelapse mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation for hematological malignancies. Manifestations of GVHD in the central nervous system (CNS) present as neurocognitive dysfunction in up to 60% of patients; however, the mechanisms driving chronic GVHD (cGVHD) in the CNS are yet to be elucidated. Our studies of murine cGVHD revealed behavioral deficits associated with broad neuroinflammation and persistent Ifng upregulation. By flow cytometry, we observed a proportional shift in the donor-derived T-cell population in the cGVHD brain from early CD8 dominance to later CD4 sequestration. RNA sequencing of the hippocampus identified perturbations to structural and functional synapse-related gene expression, together with the upregulation of genes associated with interferon-gamma responses and antigen presentation. Neuroinflammation in the cortex of mice and humans during acute GVHD was recently shown to be mediated by resident microglia-derived tumor necrosis factor. In contrast, infiltration of proinflammatory major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II+ donor bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages (BMDMs) was identified as a distinguishing feature of CNS cGVHD. Donor BMDMs, which composed up to 50% of the CNS myeloid population, exhibited a transcriptional signature distinct from resident microglia. Recipients of MHC class II knockout BM grafts exhibited attenuated neuroinflammation and behavior comparable to controls, suggestive of a critical role of donor BMDM MHC class II expression in CNS cGVHD. Our identification of disease mediators distinct from those in the acute phase indicates the necessity to pursue alternative therapeutic targets for late-stage neurological manifestations.
