36991385|a|BACKGROUND: Although a relationship between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and dementia has been reported, the initial severity upon emergency department (ED) visits and the medications used have not been well evaluated as risk factors for increased dementia occurrence. We aimed to analyze the risks of dementia development over 5 years among patients with COPD compared to matched controls (primary) and the impact of different severities of acute exacerbations (AEs) of COPD and medications on the risk of dementia development among COPD patients (secondary). METHOD: This study used the Taiwanese government deidentified health care database. We enrolled patients during the 10-year study period (January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2010), and each patient was followed up for 5 years. Once these patients received a diagnosis of dementia or died, they were no longer followed up. The study group included 51,318 patients who were diagnosed with COPD and 51,318 matched (in terms of age, sex, and the number of hospital visits) non-COPD patients from the remaining patients as the control group. Each patient was followed up for 5 years to analyze the risk of dementia with Cox regression analysis. Data on medications (antibiotics, bronchodilators, corticosteroids) and severity at the initial ED visit (ED treatment only, hospital admission, or ICU admission) were collected for both groups, as well as demographics and baseline comorbidities, which were considered confounding factors. RESULTS: In the study and control groups, 1,025 (2.0%) and 423 (0.8%) patients suffered from dementia, respectively. The unadjusted HR for dementia was 2.51 (95% CI: 2.24-2.81) in the study group. Bronchodilator treatment was associated with the HRs, especially among those who received long-term (> 1 month) treatment (HR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.91-2.45). Furthermore, among 3,451 AE of COPD patients who initially visited the ED, patients who required ICU admission (n = 164, 4.7%) had a higher risk of dementia occurrence (HR = 11.05, 95% CI: 7.77-15.71). CONCLUSION: Bronchodilator administration might be associated with a decreased risk of dementia development. More importantly, patients who suffered AEs of COPD and initially visited the ED and required ICU admission had a higher risk of developing dementia.
