2812226|t|Considerations in the treatment of neurological disorders with trophic factors.
2812226|a|The rationale for the therapeutic administration of NGF in Alzheimer's disease cannot be based purely on the premise of replacement therapy, and must instead consider the general anabolic properties of this trophic substance. In addition, there are potentially deleterious side effects of such therapy which should be evaluated in clinical trials. The selectivity of NGF for cholinergic neurons (in CNS) compared to the more generalized degeneration found in Alzheimer's disease raises the possibility of using trophic factors supporting a broader variety of neuron classes (FGF, ILGF).
