35853986|a|Non-invasive stimulation technologies are emerging as potential treatment options for a range of neurodegenerative disorders. Experimental evidence suggests that stimuli-evoked changes in slow brain rhythms may mitigate or even prevent neuropathological and behavioral impairments. Slow wave activity is prevalent during sleep and can be triggered non-invasively by sensory stimulation targeting the visual system or directly via activation of neurons locally using optogenetics. Here, we developed new tools for delivering visual stimulation using light-emitting diodes in freely moving mice while awake and during sleep. We compared these tools to traditional optogenetic approaches used for local stimulation of neurons in the cerebral cortex. We then used these tools to compare the effects of low-frequency visual versus optogenetic stimulations on the slow wave activity and sleep pattern in mice. Visual stimulation effectively enhanced slow wave activity without disrupting the sleep pattern. Optogenetic stimulation of cortical GABAergic neurons increased NREM sleep. These results suggest that visual stimulation can be effective at boosting slow wave activity without having adverse effects on sleep and thus holds great potential as a non-invasive stimulation treatment strategy.
