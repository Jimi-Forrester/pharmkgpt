33381273|t|SARS-CoV-2 and Other Respiratory Viruses: What Does Oxidative Stress Have to Do with It?
33381273|a|The phenomenon of oxidative stress, characterized as an imbalance in the production of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant responses, is a well-known inflammatory mechanism and constitutes an important cellular process. The relationship of viral infections, reactive species production, oxidative stress, and the antiviral response is relevant. Therefore, the aim of this review is to report studies showing how reactive oxygen species may positively or negatively affect the pathophysiology of viral infection. We focus on known respiratory viral infections, especially severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs), in an attempt to provide important information on the challenges posed by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Because antiviral therapies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) are rare, knowledge about relevant antioxidant compounds and oxidative pathways may be important for understanding viral pathogenesis and identifying possible therapeutic targets.
