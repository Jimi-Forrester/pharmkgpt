22810792|t|Neurologic complications of anesthesia.
22810792|a|Neurologic complications after anesthesia are relatively uncommon but occasionally severe. Intraoperative intracranial hypertension in patients with brain masses, delayed arousal, and postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction are among the main complications of general anesthesia. Neuropathy and transient gluteal and leg pain are the most frequent complications of regional blockade. Seizures are infrequent with both anesthesia modalities. Patients with primary neurologic disorders, such as neurodegenerative or neuromuscular conditions, can be at risk for specific complications, and the anesthesia plan must be cautiously adjusted in these patients. In the neurointensive care unit, the complications from large doses of anesthetic agents used for suppression of seizures or control of intracranial pressure are different from those seen perioperatively. Propofol infusion syndrome can be life-threatening when administered for those indications.
