38162760|a|In this work, some new 2-[(5-((2-acetamidophenoxy)methyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)thio]acetamide derivatives (4a-4l) were synthesized and studied for their anticancer activity. Twelve new compounds were tested on the A549 human lung cancer cell line, C6 rat glioma cell line, and L929 murine fibroblast cell line. Compounds 4f, 4i, 4k, and 4l (IC50: 1.59-7.48 muM), and especially 4h (IC50: <0.14 muM), exhibited excellent cytotoxic profile on A549 with selectivity. Compounds 4g and 4h showed remarkable antiproliferative activity on the C6 cell line with IC50 values of 8.16 and 13.04 muM, respectively. The compounds with the lowest IC50 value on the A549 cell line (4f, 4h, 4i, 4k, and 4l) were further studied to determine the mechanism of action. These compounds were found to induce apoptosis with a higher ratio (16.10-21.54%) than that of the standard drug cisplatin (10.07%). Compound 4f displayed mitochondrial membrane depolarization and caspase-3 activation at most, whereas compounds 4h (89.66%) and 4i (78.78%) had outstanding retention rates in the G0/G1phase of the cell cycle (cisplatin 74.75%). Compounds 4f, 4g, 4h, and 4l exhibited matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) inhibition higher than 75% at 100 mug/mL; even IC50 values were found to be 1.65 and 2.55 muM for 4h and 4l. In addition, in silico physicochemical properties of the compounds and molecular docking interaction of compound 4h on the MMP-9 enzyme were evaluated; the desired and expected results were obtained.
