36274955|a|Neurodegenerative disorders are associated with widespread disruption to brain activity and brain rhythms. Some disorders are linked to dysfunction of the membrane-associated protein Tau. Here, we ask how brain rhythms are affected in rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy, at an early stage of tauopathy (5 months), and at a more advanced stage (8 months). We measured brain rhythms in primary visual cortex in presence or absence of visual stimulation, while monitoring pupil diameter and locomotion to establish behavioral state. At 5 months, we found increased low-frequency rhythms during resting state in tauopathic animals, associated with periods of abnormally increased neural synchronization. At 8 months, this increase in low-frequency rhythms was accompanied by a reduction of power in the gamma range. Our results therefore show that slower rhythms are impaired earlier than gamma rhythms in this model of tauopathy, and suggest that electrophysiological measurements can track the progression of tauopathic neurodegeneration.
