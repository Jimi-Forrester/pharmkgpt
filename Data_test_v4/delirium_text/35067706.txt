35067706|t|Interplay between Inflammaging, Frailty and Nutrition in Covid-19: Preventive and Adjuvant Treatment Perspectives.
35067706|a|As humans age, their immune system undergoes modifications, including a low-grade inflammatory status called inflammaging. These changes are associated with a loss of physical and immune resilience, amplifying the risk of being malnourished and frail. Under the COVID-19 scenario, inflammaging increases the susceptibility to poor prognostics. We aimed to bring the current concepts of inflammaging and its relationship with frailty and COVID-19 prognostic; highlight the importance of evaluating the nutritional risk together with frailty aiming to monitor older adults in COVID-19 scenario; explore some compounds with potential to modulate inflammaging in perspective to manage the COVID-19 infection. Substances such as probiotics and senolytics can help reduce the high inflammatory status. Also, the periodic evaluation of nutrition risk and frailty will allow interventions, assuring the appropriate care.
