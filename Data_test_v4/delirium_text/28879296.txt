28879296|t|Dexmedetomidine intravenous sedation using a patient-controlled sedation infusion pump: a case report.
28879296|a|Dental treatment under sedation requires various sedation depths depending on the invasiveness of the procedure and patient drug sensitivity. Inappropriate sedation depth may cause patient discomfort or endangerment. For these reasons, patient-controlled sedation (PCS) pumps are commonly used. Patients are able to control the sedation depths themselves by pushing the demand button after the practitioner sets up the bolus dose and lock-out time. Dexmedetomidine is an alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonist with sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic properties. It has been widely used for sedation for its minimal respiratory depression; however, there are few studies on PCS using dexmedetomidine. This study assessed the applicability of dexmedetomidine to PCS.
