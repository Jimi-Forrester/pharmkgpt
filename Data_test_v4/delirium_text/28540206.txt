28540206|a|AIM: To report our experience of acute kidney injury (AKI) developed after exposure to poisonous substance. METHODS: Retrospective study where data was collected from case records of patients coming to this institute during January 1990 to May 2016. This institution is a tertiary care center for renal care in the metropolitan city of Karachi, Pakistan. History of ingested substance, symptoms on presentation, basic laboratory tests on arrival, mode of treatment and outcome were recorded from all patients and are presented here. Patients developing AKI after snake envenomation or scorpion stings are not included in this study. RESULTS: During studied period 184 cases of AKI developing after poisoning were seen at our institution. The largest group was from paraphenyline diamine poisoning comprising 135 patients, followed by methanol in 8, organophosphorus compounds in 5, paraquat in 5, copper sulphate in 5, tartaric acid in 4, phenobarbitone in 3 and benzodiazipines, datura, rat killer, fish gall bladder, arsenic, boiler water, ammonium dichromate, acetic acid and herbs with lesser frequency. In 8 patients multiple substances were ingested in combination. Renal replacement therapy was required in 96% of patients. Complete recovery was seen in 72.28% patients, 20% died during acute phase of illness. CONCLUSION: It is important to report poisonous substances causing vital organ failure to increase awareness among general population as well as health care providers.
