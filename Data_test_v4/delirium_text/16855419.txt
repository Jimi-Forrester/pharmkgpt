16855419|t|Nonfatal suicidal olanzapine overdose: a case report.
16855419|a|There is an increase in the usage of olanzapine because of its relatively benign adverse effect profile. We report a case of suicidal overdose who survived after ingestion of 1600 mg of olanzapine requiring minimal intervention. Fluctuation in mental status suggestive of toxic delirium was noted during recovery from overdose. There was minimal alteration in the clinical and biochemical parameters. Olanzapine is safe in monointoxication as evident from this case study.
