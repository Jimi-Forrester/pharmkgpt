36361505|t|Necroptosis: A Pathogenic Negotiator in Human Diseases.
36361505|a|Over the past few decades, mechanisms of programmed cell death have attracted the scientific community because they are involved in diverse human diseases. Initially, apoptosis was considered as a crucial mechanistic pathway for programmed cell death; recently, an alternative regulated mode of cell death was identified, mimicking the features of both apoptosis and necrosis. Several lines of evidence have revealed that dysregulation of necroptosis leads to pathological diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular, lung, renal, hepatic, neurodegenerative, and inflammatory diseases. Regulated forms of necrosis are executed by death receptor ligands through the activation of receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-1/3 and mixed-lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL), resulting in the formation of a necrosome complex. Many papers based on genetic and pharmacological studies have shown that RIPKs and MLKL are the key regulatory effectors during the progression of multiple pathological diseases. This review focused on illuminating the mechanisms underlying necroptosis, the functions of necroptosis-associated proteins, and their influences on disease progression. We also discuss numerous natural and chemical compounds and novel targeted therapies that elicit beneficial roles of necroptotic cell death in malignant cells to bypass apoptosis and drug resistance and to provide suggestions for further research in this field.
