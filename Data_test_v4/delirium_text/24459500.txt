24459500|t|SIADH associated with prostate cancer.
24459500|a|Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is the most common disease leading to hyponatremia, and it is characterized by an inappropriately elevated serum ADH level relative to serum osmolality. This syndrome may occur in a variety of clinical settings including malignancies. However, it is rarely observed in association with prostate cancer. Moreover, its pathogenesis and clinical characteristics have not been completely understood. We report a case of SIADH associated with prostate cancer in a 64-year-old male patient with a literature review.
