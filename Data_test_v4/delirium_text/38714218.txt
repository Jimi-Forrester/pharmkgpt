38714218|t|Doxycycline inhibits neurotropic enterovirus proliferation in vitro.
38714218|a|Human enteroviruses (EVs) represent a global public health concern due to their association with a range of serious pediatric illnesses. Despite the high morbidity and mortality exerted by EVs, no broad-spectrum antivirals are currently available. Herein, we presented evidence that doxycycline can inhibit in vitro replication of various neurotropic EVs, including enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), and coxsackievirus (CV)-A6, in a dose-dependent manner. Further investigations indicated that the drug primarily acted at the post-entry stage of virus infection in vitro, with inhibitory effects reaching up to 89 % for EV-A71 when administered two hours post-infection. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of antiviral drugs against EV infections.
