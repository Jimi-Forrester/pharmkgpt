39412367|a|Postoperative neurocognitive disorders (pNCD) are a common neurological complication, especially in elderly following anesthesia and surgery. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of pNCD remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms that compromise synaptic metaplasticity in pNCD development with a focus on the involvement of Nogo-66 receptor 1 (NgR1) in the pathogenesis of pNCD in aged mice. Aged mice subjected to anesthesia and laparotomy surgery exhibited anxiety-like behavior and contextual fear memory impairment. Moreover, the procedure significantly increased NogoA and NgR1 expressions, particularly in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions. This increase led to the depolymerization of F-actin, attributed to the activation of the RhoA-GTPase, resulting in a reduction of dendritic spines and changes in their morphology. Additionally, these changes hindered the efficient postsynaptic delivery of the subunit GluA1 and GluA2 of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), consequently diminishing excitatory neurotransmission in the hippocampus. Importantly, administering the competitive NgR1 antagonist peptide NEP1-40 (Nogo-A extracellular peptide residues 1-40 amino acids of Nogo-66) and Fasudil (a Rho-kinase inhibitor) effectively mitigated synaptic impairments and reversed neurocognitive deficits in aged mice following anesthesia and surgery. Our work indicates that high hippocampal Nogo66-NgR1 signaling disrupts postsynaptic AMPA receptor surface delivery due to F-actin depolymerization in the pathophysiology of pNCD.
