36141341|t|Collaboration between Psychiatrists and Other Allied Medical Specialists for the Treatment of Delusional Disorders.
36141341|a|BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that individuals with psychosis are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and several other medical comorbidities. In delusional disorder (DD), this is particularly so because of the relatively late onset age. AIMS: The aim of this narrative review is to synthesize the literature on the necessity for medical collaboration between psychiatrists and other specialists. METHODS: A non-systematic narrative review was carried out of papers addressing referrals and cooperation among specialists in the care of DD patients. RESULTS: Psychiatrists, the primary care providers for DD patients, depend on neurology to assess cognitive defects and rule out organic sources of delusions. Neurologists rely on psychiatry to help with patient adherence to treatment and the management of psychotropic drug side effects. Psychiatrists require ophthalmology/otolaryngology to treat sensory deficits that often precede delusions; reciprocally, psychiatric consults can help in instances of functional sensory impairment. Close collaboration with dermatologists is essential for treating delusional parasitosis and dysmorphophobia to ensure timely referrals to psychiatry. CONCLUSIONS: This review offers many other examples from the literature of the extent of overlap among medical specialties in the evaluation and effective treatment of DD. Optimal patient care requires close collaboration among specialties.
