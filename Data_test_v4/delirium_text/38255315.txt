38255315|t|The Impact of Microglia on Neurodevelopment and Brain Function in Autism.
38255315|a|Microglia, as one of the main types of glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), are widely distributed throughout the brain and spinal cord. The normal number and function of microglia are very important for maintaining homeostasis in the CNS. In recent years, scientists have paid widespread attention to the role of microglia in the CNS. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder, and patients with ASD have severe deficits in behavior, social skills, and communication. Most previous studies on ASD have focused on neuronal pathological changes, such as increased cell proliferation, accelerated neuronal differentiation, impaired synaptic development, and reduced neuronal spontaneous and synchronous activity. Currently, more and more research has found that microglia, as immune cells, can promote neurogenesis and synaptic pruning to maintain CNS homeostasis. They can usually reduce unnecessary synaptic connections early in life. Some researchers have proposed that many pathological phenotypes of ASD may be caused by microglial abnormalities. Based on this, we summarize recent research on microglia in ASD, focusing on the function of microglia and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. We aim to clarify the essential factors influenced by microglia in ASD and explore the possibility of microglia-related pathways as potential research targets for ASD.
