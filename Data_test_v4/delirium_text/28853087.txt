28853087|a|In primary culture of mouse hippocampal neurons, peptide EDR (200 ng/ml) under conditions of amyloid synaptotoxicity (a model of Alzheimer's disease) increased the number of mushroom spines by 71% and returned this parameter to the normal level. Under the same conditions, tripeptide KED (200 ng/ml) increased the number of mushroom spines in hippocampal neurons by 20%. Tripeptide EDR can be recommended for further experimental study as a candidate neuroprotective agent for prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
