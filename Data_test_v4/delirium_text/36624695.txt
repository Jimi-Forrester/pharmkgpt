36624695|a|BACKGROUND The Twinstream  ventilator is a microprocessor-controlled electric jet ventilator that allows the simultaneous application of 2 different jet streams, one at low frequency and one at high frequency to result in pulsatile bi-level (p-BLV) mode of ventilation. This study aimed to evaluate supraglottic jet oxygenation and ventilation in 105 patients during bronchoscopy using the Twinstream  microprocessor-controlled jet ventilator and the Wei Nasal Jet  (WNJ) tube. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients were randomly divided into 2 parallel groups (N=50 per group): group W using the WNJ tube and group M using an endoscopic face mask connected to Twinstream  microprocessor-controlled jet ventilator under monitored anesthesia care. Arterial blood gas was examined and recorded 15 minutes after the initiation of procedure. The demographic and clinical characteristics, procedure duration, doses of anesthetics, and adverse events in the 2 groups were also recorded. RESULTS The arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) (P=0.006) and lactic acid (P=0.001) were significantly lower, while pH (P=0.024) was significantly higher than in the group M. Pearson analysis showed that PaCO2 was significantly correlated with ventilation tools (P=0.006) and procedure duration (P=0.003). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that ventilation tools and procedure duration were both independent influencing factors (P=0.006, P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS Supraglottic jet oxygenation and ventilation using the WNJ tube can reduce PaCO2 and had advantages in enhancing oxygenation and ventilation function in patients during bronchoscopy intervention therapy under monitored anesthesia care.
