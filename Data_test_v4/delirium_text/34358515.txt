34358515|a|Metallothioneins (MTs) are crucial for metal ion homeostasis in mammalian cells. Specialized mass spectrometry methods have been developed to detect MTs in tissue extracts, though facile methods with scalable throughput are lacking. To improve analytical throughput and repeatability, we developed a standardised liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for robust determination of metallothionein-3 (MT3) that is amenable to microplate processing. This method uses standard protein digestion conditions with commercially available reagents and commonly practiced reversed-phase chromatography, detecting MT3 at low ng/mL levels in human brain tissue extracts. We found that trypsin digestion largely underestimated MT3 levels, whereas endopeptidase Lys-C yielded vastly higher signals with low replicate variance. The choice of target peptide was critical for accurate MT3 detection - a peptide in the alpha-domain yielded the most robust signals. We demonstrate the utility of this method by comparing the expression of MT3 in post-mortem brain tissues of a cohort of Alzheimer's disease (AD) individuals and age-matched controls.
