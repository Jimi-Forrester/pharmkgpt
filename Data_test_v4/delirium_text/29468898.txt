29468898|a|BACKGROUND: Paratonia is a major underlying motor problem impeding functionality and locomotion in dementia. Despite its undeniable impact on patient's quality of life and daily care, there is a lack of evidence-based therapy on patients with this condition. METHODS: We surveyed physiotherapists working in nursing homes in Flanders (Belgium) concerning the use and perceived effect of therapeutic strategies and positioning methods/aids. RESULTS: Positioning and soft passive mobilization were the most applied and positively appraised therapeutic interventions. Highest ratings for positioning were found for C-shaped positioning cushions and multi-position wheelchair. According to the respondents, key points for paratonia approach were relaxation, positioning, active movement stimulation, and-to some extent-passive mobilization. Indispensable for any success however is multidisciplinary cooperation. CONCLUSION: These findings might provide an inspirational path for research to verify possible (evidence based) beneficial treatments that could be applied to improve current and future treatment of patients with paratonia.
