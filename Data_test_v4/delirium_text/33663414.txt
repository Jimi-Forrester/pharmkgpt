33663414|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia is a leading cause of death and disability that was declared as one of the greatest health and social care challenges of the twenty-first century. Regular physical activity and exercise have been proposed as a non-pharmacological strategy in disease prevention and management. Multicomponent Training (MT) combines aerobic, strength, balance and postural exercises and might be an effective training to improve both functional capacity and cognitive function in individuals with dementia (IwD). Nevertheless, data on the effects of MT in IwD are still limited and the extent to which IwD can retain improvements after an exercise intervention still needs to be elucidated. The aim of "Body & Brain" study is to investigate the effects of a 6-month MT intervention and 3-month detraining on the physical and cognitive function of IwD. Additionally, we aim to explore the impact of this intervention on psychosocial factors and physiologic markers related to dementia. METHODS: This study is a quasi-experimental controlled trial using a parallel-group design. The study sample consists of community-dwelling individuals aged >=60 years who are clinically diagnosed with dementia or major neurocognitive disorder. Participants will be either allocated into the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group will participate in MT biweekly exercise sessions, whereas the control group will receive monthly sessions regarding physical activity and health-related topics for 6 months. The main outcomes will be physical function as measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and cognitive function evaluated using the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) at baseline, after 6-months and 3-months after the end of intervention. Secondary outcomes will be body composition, physical fitness, daily functionality, quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregiver's burden. Cardiovascular, inflammatory and neurotrophic blood-based biomarkers, and arterial stiffness will also be evaluated in subsamples. DISCUSSION: If our hypothesis is correct, this project will provide evidence regarding the efficacy of MT training in improving physical and cognitive function and give insights about its impact on novel molecular biomarkers related to dementia. This project may also contribute to provide guidelines on exercise prescription for IwD.
