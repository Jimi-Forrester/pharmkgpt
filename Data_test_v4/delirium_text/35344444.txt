35344444|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that pre-exercise suppresses anxiety-like behavior, but the effects of different exercise times on vascular dementia induced anxiety-like behavior have not been well investigated. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to investigate the underlying neurochemical mechanism of different pre-vascular-dementia exercise times on 5-HT and anxiety-like behavior in rats with vascular dementia. METHODS: 32 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham group (S group, n = 8), vascular dementia group (VD group, n = 8), 1-week physical exercise and vascular dementia group (1WVD group, n = 8), and 4 weeks physical exercise and vascular dementia group (4WVD group, n = 8). 1 week and 4 weeks of voluntary wheel running were used as pre-exercise training. The vascular dementia model was established by bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion (BCCAo) for 1 week. But bilateral common carotid arteries were not ligated in the sham group. The level of hippocampal 5-HT was detected with in vivo microdialysis coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (MD-HPLC). Elevated plus maze (EPM), open field (OF), and light/dark box test were used to test anxiety-like behavior. RESULTS: Compared with the C group, the hippocampal 5-HT was significantly decreased in the VD group after 1 week of ligated operation. The hippocampal 5-HT levels in 1WVD and 4WVD groups were substantially higher than the level in the VD group. The hippocampal 5-HT level has no significant difference among C, 1WVD, and 4WVD. Behavioral data suggested that the rats in the VD group developed obvious anxiety-like behavior after 1 week of ligation surgery. Still, the rats in 1WVD and 4WVD groups did not show significant anxiety-like behavior. CONCLUSION: Both 1 week and 4 weeks of voluntary running wheel exercise can inhibit the anxiety-like behavior in rats with vascular dementia by upregulating 5-HT levels in the hippocampus in the VD model.
