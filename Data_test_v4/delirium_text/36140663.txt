36140663|t|Dynamic Brain Connectivity in Resting-State FMRI Using Spectral ICA and Graph Approach: Application to Healthy Controls and Multiple Sclerosis.
36140663|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease that involves structural and functional damage to the brain. It changes the functional connectivity of the brain between and within networks. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables us to measure functional correlation and independence between different brain regions. In recent years, statistical methods, including independent component analysis (ICA) and graph-based analysis, have been widely used in fMRI studies. Furthermore, topological properties of the brain have been appeared as significant features of neuroscience studies. Most studies are focused on graph analysis and ICA methods, rather than considering spectral approaches. Here, we developed a new framework to measure brain connectivity (in static and dynamic formats) and incorporate it to study fMRI data from MS patients and healthy controls (HCs). For this purpose, a spectral ICA method is proposed to extract the nodes of the brain graph. Spectral ICA extracts more reliable components and decreases the processing time in calculation of the static brain connectivity. Compared to Infomax ICA, dynamic range and low-frequency to high-frequency power ratio (fALFF) show better results using the proposed ICA. It is also helpful in selection of the states for dynamic connectivity. Furthermore, the dynamic connectivity-based extracted components from spectral ICA are estimated using a mutual information method and based on correlation of sliding time-windowed on selected IC time courses. First-level and second-level connectivity states are calculated using correlations of connectivity strength between graph nodes (spectral ICA components). Finally, static and dynamic connectivity are analyzed based on correlation nodes percolated by an anatomical automatic labeling (AAL) atlas. Despite static and dynamic connectivity results of AAL correlations not showing any significant changes between MS and HC, our results based on spectral ICA in static and dynamic connectivity showed significantly decreased connectivity in MS patients in the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas it was significantly weaker in the core but stronger at the periphery of the posterior cingulate cortex.
