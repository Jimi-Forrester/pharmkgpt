12732196|a|Mutant presenilins cause early-onset of familial Alzheimer's disease and render cells vulnerable to apoptosis. Calsenilin/DREAM/KChIP3 is a multifunctional calcium-binding protein that interacts with presenilin and mediates calcium-mediated apoptosis. In the present study, we report that the calsenilin-mediated apoptosis is regulated by presenilin. The expression of calsenilin was highly up-regulated in neuronal cells undergoing Abeta42-triggered cell death. The incidence of calsenilin-mediated apoptosis was diminished in presenilin-1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells or neuronal cells stably expressing a loss-of-function presenilin-1 mutant. On the contrary, an array of familial Alzheimer's disease-associated presenilin mutants (gain-of-function) increased calsenilin-induced cell death. Moreover, gamma-secretase inhibitors, including compound E and DAPT, decreased the calsenilin-induced cell death. These results suggest that the pro-apoptotic activity of calsenilin coordinates with presenilin/gamma-secretase activity to play a crucial role in the neuronal death of Alzheimer's disease.
