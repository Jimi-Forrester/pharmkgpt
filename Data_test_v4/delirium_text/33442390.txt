33442390|a|BACKGROUND: The rate of elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has increased over recent decades. The Feuerstein Instrumental Enrichment (FIE) program for the elderly has been shown to be effective in various age groups but is has never been tested as a treatment for MCI in elderly patients. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the FIE on the cognitive and functional state of elderly patients with MCI. METHODS: This was an interventional pilot study in community-dwelling patients aged >=65 years diagnosed with MCI in the previous year. The protocol included 30 twice-weekly 90-min sessions with a full neurocognitive evaluation prior to the intervention (v1), at its conclusion (v2), and half a year later (v3). RESULTS: Nine of the 15 recruited participants completed the study. The mean age was 76.2 years. Compared to v1 and v2, the only significant improvements found at v3 were in the "visual perception" subtest of the NeuroTrax test and the total score of the MOCA test (p = 0.048 and 0.028, respectively). The effect size was >0.7 (r = 0.7), indicating a moderate-to-high clinical significance. The results of the qualitative questionnaire were consistent with the positive effect of the group on the fostering of social ties, the motivation to learn, the cognitive contribution, and the development of a sense of self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: The study findings support the conclusion that an intervention with a focus on cognitive exercising can promote a feeling of self-efficacy and preserve some cognitive skills.
