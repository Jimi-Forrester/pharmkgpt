37864322|t|Abnormal presentation of pregnancy and postpartum initial-onset systemic lupus erythematosus combined with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: A case report.
37864322|a|Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that most commonly occurs in women of childbearing age. However, cases of SLE with abnormal pregnancy as the initial manifestation, involving the development of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), have rarely been reported. Herein, we report the case of a young woman who underwent a cesarean section for fetal distress and growth restriction at 35 + 1 weeks' gestation. Following discharge, she experienced progressive worsening of anemia and chest tightness, which was later diagnosed as SLE complicated by DAH.
