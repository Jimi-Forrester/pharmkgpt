36177437|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances as a major health problem are common in patients hospitalized in critical care units. This study examined the effects of a team-based care plan on the quality of sleep in patients hospitalized in a cardiac surgery intensive care unit (CSICU) of a multidisciplinary hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this clinical trial, 100 patients with cardiac surgery were selKMected through convenience sampling and then nonrandomly allocated to the intervention and or the control group. A plan of care with the recommendation of all intensive care unit care teams was designed and then applied. In this study, the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire was used to evaluate sleep quality. Patients in the intervention group received the care plan for two consecutive nights. The study's national approval code is IRCT2017091915512N2. Collected data were analyzed using SPSS software (v. 21), and by paired, independent t, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Quality of sleep in patients admitted to the CSICU is significantly improved by noise reduction both in the first and second nights. Moreover, the team-based care plan requires good coordination between all team members taking care of cardiac surgery patients admitted to the CSICU (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The team-based care plan significantly improves the quality of sleep. It may be due to the close coordination between all team members to avoid sleep disturbances.
