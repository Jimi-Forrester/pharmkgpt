39077553|a|Background: Biologics are the important drugs for severe asthma, but clinical trials included few elderly patients. Data on the safety and efficacy of benralizumab in elderly asthma patients are limited. Methods: This clinical study was a multicentre, retrospective, observational study at two hospitals. Patients aged >=18 years diagnosed with severe asthma treated with benralizumab were included. Elderly patients were defined as those aged 70 years or older. Efficacy and safety were then analyzed in elderly and non-elderly patients. The primary endpoints were the annual number of asthma exacerbations for efficacy and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events for safety. Results: Between August 2016 and October 2022, 61 patients were enrolled; 10 patients were excluded, and 51 (22 elderly, 29 non-elderly) patients were analyzed. In elderly patients, the annual number of asthma exacerbations before treatment with benralizumab (pre-benralizumab) was 3.78, and the number during treatment with benralizumab was 1.26, a decrease of 2.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 3.74, p < 0.001). In non-elderly patients, the annual number of asthma exacerbation in the pre-benralizumab period was 3.24, and during treatment with benralizumab it was 0.68, a decrease of 2.56 (95% CI, 1.3 to 3.82, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in discontinuation due to treatment-related adverse events (elderly vs non-elderly, 2 (9%) vs 0 (0%), p = 0.18). Conclusion: Benralizumab reduced the annual number of asthma exacerbations and was well tolerated in elderly patients.
