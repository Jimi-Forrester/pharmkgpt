38626888|t|The role and impact of therapeutic counselling on the emotional experience of adults living with dementia: A systematic review.
38626888|a|Introduction There is limited psychological support available to help people living with dementia to deal with the emotional consequences of their condition. Anxiety and depression are commonly experienced in this population, yet the use of counselling and psychotherapeutic interventions is not well documented. Aim This systematic review sought to understand the current knowledge on the role and impact of therapeutic counselling on the emotional experience of adults living with dementia. Methods Qualitative and quantitative research designs were accepted for review. A comprehensive search of the main biomedical, nursing and other specialist databases was performed to access articles published between 2015 and 2022. Trial registers and academic journals were also searched. 43 original studies were included: qualitative (n = 15); RCTs (n = 9); other designs (n = 19); plus eight systematic reviews. Results The majority of studies were conducted in Europe, the United Kingdom in particular, although a range of countries from across the globe were represented. The combined evidence from the different study designs suggest a range of ways that people living with different stages of dementia can participate in, and gain emotional benefit from, therapeutic counselling. Key themes identified: (1) The emotional and well-being benefits of therapeutic counselling; (2) No one size fits all - relational and tailored approaches driven by person-centred values; (3) Training, supervision and building community for counsellors; (4) Involvement of people with dementia in therapeutic interventions. Conclusions Our findings from this systematic review show that different therapeutic approaches have been tested with people at different stages of a dementia diagnosis. The results suggest the value of therapeutic counselling as a supportive medium to help with the processing and coping of difficult emotions and feelings across the trajectory of a dementia illness.
