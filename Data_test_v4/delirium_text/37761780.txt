37761780|t|The Impact of an Intensive Care Diary on the Psychological Well-Being of Patients and Their Family Members: Longitudinal Study Protocol.
37761780|a|BACKGROUND: Thanks to medical and technological advancements, an increasing number of individuals survive admission to intensive care units. However, survivors often experience negative outcomes, including physical impairments and alterations in mental health. Anxiety, depression, cognitive impairments, post-traumatic stress disorders, and functional disorders are known collectively as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Among the key triggering factors of this syndrome, memory impairment appears to play a significant role. AIMS: This study aims to evaluate the impact of an intensive care diary on the psychological well-being of patients and their relatives after discharge from the ICU. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. EXPECTED RESULTS: The results of this study evaluate the impact of an ICU diary on the quality of life of ICU survivors and their family members.
