10705167|a|This paper describes retrograde memory performances of 12 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 12 frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients. First of all, we observed that FTD and AD patients did not differ for language tests (verbal fluency tests and oral denomination 80), for semantic memory tests, for logical memory test and Benton visual memory test and differed for anterograde verbal memory and frontal tests. Concerning retrograde memory, there was no difference between AD and FTD patients in retrograde memory scores (autobiographical memory interview, Crovitz's task, French public events interview battery) and both FTD and AD patients exhibited a retrieval deficit in their remote memory. We observed that the mechanisms of remote memory deficit was different in FTD and in AD patients. We observed no classical paradigm of Ribot for FTD patient's remote informations, and they appeared to have lost of access to memories and executive difficulties. In AD, the results indicated these patients' ability to learn new information and to search semantic memory failed.
