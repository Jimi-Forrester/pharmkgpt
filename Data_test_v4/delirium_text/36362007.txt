36362007|t|Comparative Study of the Solid-Liquid Interfacial Adsorption of Proteins in Their Native and Amyloid Forms.
36362007|a|The adhesive properties of amyloid fibers are thought to play a crucial role in various negative and positive aggregation processes, the study of which might help in their understanding and control. Amyloids have been prepared from two proteins, lysozyme and beta-lactoglobulin, as well as an Exendin-4 derivative miniprotein (E5). Thermal treatment was applied to form amyloids and their structure was verified by thioflavin T (ThT), 8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) dye tests and electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy (ECD). Adsorption properties of the native and amyloid forms of the three proteins were investigated and compared using the mass-sensitive quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technique. Due to the possible electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, similar adsorbed amounts were found for the native or amyloid forms, while the structures of the adsorbed layers differed significantly. Native proteins formed smooth and dense adsorption layers. On the contrary, a viscoelastic, highly loose layer was formed in the presence of the amyloid forms, shown by increased motional resistance values determined by the QCM technique and also indicated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and wettability measurements. The elongated structure and increased hydrophobicity of amyloids might contribute to this kind of aggregation.
