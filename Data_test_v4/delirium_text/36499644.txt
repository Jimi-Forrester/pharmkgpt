36499644|t|Role of Ceramides and Lysosomes in Extracellular Vesicle Biogenesis, Cargo Sorting and Release.
36499644|a|Cells have the ability to communicate with their immediate and distant neighbors through the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs facilitate intercellular signaling through the packaging of specific cargo in all type of cells, and perturbations of EV biogenesis, sorting, release and uptake is the basis of a number of disorders. In this review, we summarize recent advances of the complex roles of the sphingolipid ceramide and lysosomes in the journey of EV biogenesis to uptake.
