34482237|t|Drug repurposing: small molecules against Cu(II)-amyloid-beta and free radicals.
34482237|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a complex pathology entangling numerous pathological factors, including amyloid-beta (Abeta), metal ions, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increasing evidence reveals pathological connections among these distinct components in AD. For instance, the association between the amyloid cascade and metal ion hypotheses has introduced a novel pathogenic target: metal-bound Abeta. Investigation of such interconnections requires substantial research and can be expedited by chemical reagents that are able to modify multiple pathogenic factors in AD. Drug repurposing is an efficient approach for rediscovering previously utilized molecules with desirable biological and pharmaceutical properties as chemical reagents. Herein, we report the evaluation of three pre-approved drug molecules, selected based on their chemical structure and properties, as chemical reagents that can be used for elucidating the complicated pathology of AD.
