35264864|t|Molecular Functions of Ceruloplasmin in Metabolic Disease Pathology.
35264864|a|Ceruloplasmin (CP) is a multicopper oxidase and antioxidant that is mainly produced in the liver. CP not only plays a crucial role in the metabolic balance of copper and iron through its oxidase function but also exhibits antioxidant activity. In addition, CP is an acute-phase protein. In addition to being associated with aceruloplasminemia and neurodegenerative diseases such as Wilson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, CP also plays an important role in metabolic diseases, which are caused by metabolic disorders and vigorous metabolism, mainly including diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, etc. Based on the physiological functions of CP, we provide an overview of the association of type 2 diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, CP oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolism of copper and iron. Studies have shown that metabolic diseases are closely related to systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and disorders of copper and iron metabolism. Therefore, we conclude that CP, which can reduce the formation of free radicals in tissues, can be induced during inflammation and infection, and can correct the metabolic disorder of copper and iron, has protective and diagnostic effects on metabolic diseases.
