31654319|t|The Molecular Misreading of APP and UBB Induces a Humoral Immune Response in Alzheimer's Disease Patients with Diagnostic Ability.
31654319|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide with 10-30% prevalence in aging population and a high socioeconomic impact. Because AD definitive diagnostic requires post-mortem verification, new approaches to study the disease are necessary. Here, we analyze the humoral immune response in AD to survey whether APP+1 or UBB+1 frameshift proteins, produced as a consequence of the "molecular misreading" alteration in AD occurring in the APP (amyloid precursor protein) and UBB (ubiquitin-B protein) proteins' mRNA, elicit the production of autoantibodies specific of AD. To this end, APP+1 and UBB+1 peptides were expressed in bacteria as 6xHisHalo fusion proteins and after purification to homogeneity their seroreactivity was analyzed using 81 individual sera from AD patients and 43 individual sera from healthy individuals by luminescence beads immunoassay. We found that as a result of the molecular misreading, APP+1 and UBB+1 frameshift peptides produced a humoral immune response in AD patients, whose autoantibody levels are significantly higher in comparison with healthy controls. Their combination with a previously reported panel of four autoantigens specific of AD (ANTXR1, OR8J1, PYGB, and NUPR1) increased their diagnostic ability assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves up to an area under the curve (AUC) of 73.5%. Collectively, our results demonstrate that APP+1 and UBB+1 frameshift proteins, non-previously described as AD-specific autoantigens, elicit the production of autoantibodies which might be useful as blood-based biomarkers to aid in the detection of the disease.
