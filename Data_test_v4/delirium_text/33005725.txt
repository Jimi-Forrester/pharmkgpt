33005725|a|INTRODUCTION: We sought to examine whether depressive symptoms and level of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology are independently or interactively associated with the risk of progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: The study included a total of 216 participants from the Biomarkers for Older Controls at Risk for Alzheimer's Disease study, a cohort of individuals who were cognitively normal at baseline (mean age = 57) and followed for more than 20 years (mean = 12.7 years), who had baseline Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) scores and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (Abeta)1-42 , t-tau, and p-tau measures available. RESULTS: Cox regression demonstrated that baseline HAM-D and CSF AD biomarkers were both associated with time to onset of MCI. There was an interaction between HAM-D scores and markers of AD pathology, in which depression was associated with time of onset in participants with low levels of AD pathology (hazard ratio = 0.64; 95% confidence interval = 0.43-0.95; P= .026). DISCUSSION: The effect of depressive symptoms on progression to clinical symptoms of MCI may be most evident among individuals with low levels of AD pathology.
