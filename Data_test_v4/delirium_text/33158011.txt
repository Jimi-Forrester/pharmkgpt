33158011|t|Thyroid Storm in Head and Neck Emergency Patients.
33158011|a|BACKGROUND: Thyroid storm is a rare but life-threatening emergency that prompts urgent intervention to halt its potentially disastrous outcomes. There is not much literature available on thyroid storm in head neck trauma and non-thyroid/parathyroid head neck surgery. Due to rarity of thyroid storm in head and neck trauma/surgery patients, its diagnosis becomes challenging, is often misdiagnosed and causes delay in the diagnosis and management. Therefore, the aim of this work was to compile, analyze and present details to develop a consensus and augment available literature on thyroid storm in this group of patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of the last 30 years was performed on PUBMED/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Science Citation Index for thyroid storm using MeSH words and statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: Seven articles describing seven cases of thyroid storm were reviewed. All patients required medical management and one patient (14.3%) required adjunctive surgical management. Burch and Wartofsky Diagnostic criteria for thyroid storm were used in diagnosis of 42% patients. Time of diagnosis varied from immediately upon presentation to formulating a retrospective diagnosis of having a full-blown thyroid storm at 4 days post presentation. It was misdiagnosed and unthought of initially in majority of these cases, (71.4%) were not diagnosed in the first day of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Early recognition of thyroid storm in head and neck patients markedly reduce morbidity/mortality. Albeit unexpected, it should be ruled out in any symptomatic head and neck trauma or post-surgery patient.
