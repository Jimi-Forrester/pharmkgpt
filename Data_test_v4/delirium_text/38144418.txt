38144418|a|Purpose: We investigate the efficacy and safety of butorphanol in multimodal analgesia combined with dexmedetomidine and ketorolac via patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) after hepatobiliary surgery, as compared with sufentanil. Patients and Methods: Postoperative follow-up data of hepatobiliary surgery patients in Henan Provincial People's Hospital from March 2018 to June 2021 were collected retrospectively and divided into butorphanol group (group B) or sufentanil group (group S) according to the postoperative intravenous controlled analgesia scheme. The baseline characteristics and surgical information of the two groups were matched through propensity score matching (PSM). Results: A total of 3437 patients were screened, and PSM yielded 1816 patients after matching, including 908 in the butorphanol group and 908 in the sufentanil group. Compared with group S, the incidence of moderate-to-severe pain on the first postoperative day and the second postoperative day was lower in group B during rest (3.2% vs 10.9%, P<0.001; 1.2% vs 4.6%, P<0.001), and during movement (7.0% vs 18.9%, P<0.001; 2.6% vs 8.7%, P<0.001). Patients receiving butorphanol had a lower morphine consumption (50mg vs 120mg, P<0.001). The bolus attempts of an analgesic pump in group B were significantly lower than in group S (1 vs 2, P<0.001). Postoperative hospital length of stay was shortened in group B (11d vs 12d, P=0.017). The occurrence of postoperative vomiting was lower in group B (1.4% vs 3.0%, P=0.025) than in group S. However, more patients in group B experienced dizziness (0.9% vs 0.1%, P=0.019). Conclusion: Compared with sufentanil, the application of butorphanol in multimodal analgesia combined with dexmedetomidine and ketorolac via PCIA ameliorated postoperative pain after hepatobiliary surgery, with reduced opioid consumption and shorter postoperative hospital length of stay.
