37609868|a|Aging of the central nervous system (CNS) leads to motoric and cognitive decline and increases the probability for neurodegenerative disease development. Astrocytes fulfill central homeostatic functions in the CNS including regulation of immune responses and metabolic support of neurons and oligodendrocytes. In this study, we investigated the effect of redox imbalance in astrocytes by using a conditional astrocyte-specific SOD2-deficient mouse model (SOD2ako ) and analyzed these animals at different stages of their life. SOD2ako mice did not exhibit any overt phenotype within the first postnatal weeks. However, already as young adults, they displayed progressive motoric impairments. Moreover, as these mice grew older, they exhibited signs of a progeroid phenotype and early death. Histological analysis in moribund SOD2ako mice revealed the presence of age-related brain alterations, neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and myelin impairment in brain and spinal cord. Additionally, transcriptome analysis of primary astrocytes revealed that SOD2 deletion triggered a hypometabolic state and promoted polarization toward A1-neurotoxic status, possibly underlying the neuronal and myelin deficits. Conclusively, our study identifies maintenance of ROS homeostasis in astrocytes as a critical prerequisite for physiological CNS aging.
