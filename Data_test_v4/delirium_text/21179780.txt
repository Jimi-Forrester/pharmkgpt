21179780|a|AIM: To observe the expression of Presenilin-1 (PS-1) and production of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in hippocampus of female senile rats and to investigate the effect of vitamin E(VE) on preventing Alzheimer's disease after menopause. METHODS: The animal model was established using female senile rats. Experimental groups (n=8) were respectively given different doses of VE(5 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg) per day. The expression of PS-1 in hippocampus was detected by immunohistochemistry, the level of Abeta in hippocampus was measured by Radioimmunoassay, and neuronal ultrastructure in hippocampal DG area was observed using transmission electron microscope. RESULTS: The expression of PS-1 in rat hippocampus of senile control group was stronger than that of adult control group. PS-1 expressed weakly in three medication groups along with augmentation of dosage. The levels of Abeta were found to correlate statistically with the expression of PS-1. The content of Abeta in VE groups was significantly decreased compared to that in senile control group (P < 0.01). There were some changes in the neuronal ultrastructure of senile rats. Neurons were gradually recovered in VE groups. CONCLUSION: VE may depress the production of Abeta by regulating the expression of PS-1, reducing neuronal injuries. VE may play a role in neuronal protection.
