15207448|a|The exponential growth in the prevalence of cognitive impairment of old patients leads the physicians to deal with a larger incidence of behavioral disorders (such as excitement,aggressiveness), and psychotic symptoms (such as delirium and visual hallucinations). The presence of psychotic troubles in dementia causes a remarkable distress to caregivers and involves higher difficulties in the patient management. The estimates of such troubles range between 15 and 75 %. Geriatric assessment and the management of behavioral troubles require a prompt evaluation of all their possible causes. As a matter of fact, their appearance often reveals a physical disturbance (pain, fever, etc.), or adverse environmental conditions, or it could also be a consequence of a multiple drug therapy. For this reason,the use of antipsychotics should always be preceded by an accurate clinical diagnosis.Anxiolytic, anti-depressive, anti-convulsive and anti-psychotic drugs are among the therapeutic strategies for the management of the psychogeriatric patient. Atypical antipsychotics seem to be able to decrease the psychotic symptoms, with low levels of therapeutic failure. They also reduce extrapyramidal effects and the growth of prolactine hormone, which is quite useful when dealing with very old patients. Risperidone and olanzapine are two atypical anti-psychotics, which already proved to be adequate and well tolerated during the treatment of schizophrenia and of acute maniacal disorders. Our experience, with a population of patients followed by our Alzheimer Evaluation Unit (AEU), confirms that a low dose of olanzapine (5mg/day) and risperidone (0.5-1.0 mg/day) are effective in lowering behavioral disturbances, and psychotic symptoms due to dementia. Even in the long run,low doses of these drugs are still well tolerated. Higher levels of risperidone (> 1 mg/die)often caused extra-pyramidal symptoms such as rigidity and dyskinesia, whereas higher levels of olanzapine (> 5 mg/day) lead to an exceeding sedation. The management of behavioral disturbances is one of the most important goals in the global treatment of patients affected by dementia, to the extent of improving the quality of life. Atypical antipsychotics are preferable compared to old-generation drugs, therefore, they are the key therapeutic strategy we cannot renounce.
