37854491|t|Microfluidic paper-based colorimetric quantification of malondialdehyde using silver nanoprism toward on-site biomedical analysis: a new platform for the chemical sensing and biosensing of oxidative stress.
37854491|a|Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a critical product of polyunsaturated adipose acid peroxidation and represents a common biomarker of oxidative stress. The effect of different MDA concentrations on human biofluids reflects pathological changes, which has been seen in diverse types of sickness, such as leukemia, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and age-related macular degeneration and liver disease. In this study, different types of silver nanoparticles, including silver nanoprism (AgNPrs), silver nanowires (AgNWs), and silver nanospheres (AgNSs), were synthesized and used for the chemosensing of MDA by colorimetric and spectrophotometric methods. Colorimetric tests were performed to identify malondialdehyde in the solution as well as the one-droplet-based microfluidic paper substrate as a miniaturization device for the monitoring of analytes in human real samples. The analytical quantification of the MDA was done using the UV-Vis method. Also, the utilization of the designed chemosensor for the analysis of MDA in real sample was evaluated in human urine samples. Using the spectrophotometric method, MDA was deformed in the linear range of 0.01192 to 1.192 mM with a low limit of quantification of 0.12 muM. Essential significant features of this study include the first application of AgNPrs with high stability and great optical properties without any reagent as an optical sensing probe of MDA and optimized OD-muPCD toward on-site and on-demand MDA screening in real samples diagnosis and the innovative time/color semi-analytical recognition strategy. Moreover, the prepared OD-muPCD decorated by AgNPrs could be a prized candidate for commercialization due to the benefits of the low-cost materials used, like paper and paraffin, and portability. This innovative process led to uniform hydrophilic micro-channels on the surface of cellulose, without the use of a UV lamp, clean room, and organic solvents. This report could be a pioneering work, inspiring simple and effective on-site semi-analytical recognition devices for harmful substances or illegal drugs, which simply consist of a piece of lightweight paper and one drop of the required reagent.
