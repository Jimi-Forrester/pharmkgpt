31473169|t|Pain Screening in the Older Adult With Delirium.
31473169|a|BACKGROUND: In patients with cognitive impairments who are unable to self-report pain, nurses must rely on behavioral observation tools to assess and manage pain. Although frequently employed in medical-surgical units, evidence supporting the psychometric efficacy of the Pain in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) for pain screening in older adults with delirium is lacking. AIM: To examine the psychometrics of the PAINAD for older adults with delirium in medical-surgical settings. DESIGN: A descriptive repeated measures design. SETTING: Medical-surgical units in an urban tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-eight older adults with delirium. METHODS: Patients with delirium unable to self-report pain were screened by two data collectors with the PAINAD and the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT). Patients with a PAINAD score >=3 or a CPOT score >=2 received a pain intervention. Pain assessments were repeated 30 minutes post baseline or pain intervention. RESULTS: Patients were predominately female (58.8%) with dementia (71%). Thirty-nine patients screened positive for pain and received a pain intervention. PAINAD reliability was strong (Cronbach's alpha = 0.81-0.87; interrater intraclass coefficients [ICC] = 0.91-0.94; test-retest ICC = 0.76-0.77). Construct validity was supported by a statistically significant interaction effect between time (baseline versus follow-up) and condition (pain intervention versus no pain group; Rater 1: F(1,66) = 8.31, p = 0.005, etap2 = 0.11; Rater 2: F(1,66) = 8.22, p = 0.006, etap2 = 0.11. CONCLUSIONS: The PAINAD is a reliable and valid tool for pain screening for older adults with delirium in medical-surgical settings. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Pain and delirium frequently co-occur in the older adult population. Best practices require a holistic assessment for contributing pain and non-pain factors in patients exhibiting distress.
