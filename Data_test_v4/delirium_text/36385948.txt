36385948|a|Understanding and ameliorating neurodegenerative diseases represents a key challenge for supporting the health span of the aging population. Diverse protein aggregates have been implicated in such neurodegenerative disorders, including amyloid-beta, alpha-synuclein, tau, fused in sarcoma (FUS), and transactivation response element (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Recent years have seen significant growth in our mechanistic knowledge of relationships between these proteins and some of the membrane-less nuclear structures that fulfill key roles in the cell function. These include the nucleolus, nuclear speckles, and paraspeckles. The ability of macromolecular protein:RNA complexes to partition these nuclear condensates through biophysical processes that involve liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has also gained attention recently. The paraspeckle, which is scaffolded by the architectural long-non-coding RNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) plays central roles in RNA processing and metabolism and has been linked dynamically to TDP-43. In this mini-review, we outline essential early and recent insights in relation to TDP-43 proteinopathies. We then appraise the relationships between TDP-43 and NEAT1 in the context of neuronal paraspeckles and neuronal stress. We highlight key areas for investigation based on recent advances in our understanding of how TDP-43 affects neuronal function, especially in relation to messenger ribosomal nucleic acid (mRNA) splicing. Finally, we offer perspectives that should be considered for translational pipelines in order to improve health outcomes for the management of neurodegenerative diseases.
