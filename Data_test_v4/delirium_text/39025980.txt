39025980|a|To analyze the differential expression genes of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), clarify their functions and pathways, as well as the protein-protein interaction network, identify HUB genes, and explore the pathological mechanism. PCOS microarray datasets were screened from the GEO database. Common differentially expressed genes (co-DEGs) were obtained using GEO2R and Venn analysis. Enrichment and pathway analyses were conducted using the DAVID online tool, with results presented in bubble charts. Protein-protein interaction analysis was performed using the STRING tool. HUB genes were identified using Cytoscape software and further interpreted with the assistance of the GeneCards database. A total of two sets of co-DEGs (108 and 102), key proteins (15 and 55), and hub genes (10 and 10) were obtained. The co-DEGs: (1) regulated inflammatory responses and extracellular matrix, TNF, and IL-17 signaling pathways; (2) regulated ribosomes and protein translation, ribosome and immune pathways. The key proteins: (1) regulated inflammation, immunity, transcription, matrix metabolism, proliferation/differentiation, energy, and repair; (2) regulated ubiquitination, enzymes, companion proteins, respiratory chain components, and fusion proteins. The Hub genes: (1) encoded transcription factors and cytokines, playing vital roles in development and proliferation; (2) encoded ribosomes and protein synthesis, influencing hormone and protein synthesis, associated with development and infertility. The dysregulated expression of inflammation and protein synthesis genes in PCOS may be the key mechanism underlying its onset and progression.
