38235614|t|Metabolic Bypass Rescues Aberrant S-nitrosylation-Induced TCA Cycle Inhibition and Synapse Loss in Alzheimer's Disease Human Neurons.
38235614|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), dysfunctional mitochondrial metabolism is associated with synaptic loss, the major pathological correlate of cognitive decline. Mechanistic insight for this relationship, however, is still lacking. Here, comparing isogenic wild-type and AD mutant human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cerebrocortical neurons (hiN), evidence is found for compromised mitochondrial energy in AD using the Seahorse platform to analyze glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Isotope-labeled metabolic flux experiments revealed a major block in activity in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle at the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alphaKGDH)/succinyl coenzyme-A synthetase step, metabolizing alpha-ketoglutarate to succinate. Associated with this block, aberrant protein S-nitrosylation of alphaKGDH subunits inhibited their enzyme function. This aberrant S-nitrosylation is documented not only in AD-hiN but also in postmortem human AD brains versus controls, as assessed by two separate unbiased mass spectrometry platforms using both SNOTRAP identification of S-nitrosothiols and chemoselective-enrichment of S-nitrosoproteins. Treatment with dimethyl succinate, a cell-permeable derivative of a TCA substrate downstream to the block, resulted in partial rescue of mitochondrial bioenergetic function as well as reversal of synapse loss in AD-hiN. These findings have therapeutic implications that rescue of mitochondrial energy metabolism can ameliorate synaptic loss in hiPSC-based models of AD.
