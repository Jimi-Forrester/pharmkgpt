36745142|t|Focused ultrasound: Innovation in use for neurologic conditions.
36745142|a|Focused ultrasound has emerged as a key tool for neurologic disorders. In this focused review, we discuss the utility in disrupting the blood brain barrier to maximize treatment. This can facilitate creating direct coagulative lesions and aid in the administration of chemotherapy. Furthermore, it can facilitate neuromodulation when used in pulse sequencing. The current literature regarding brain tumors, essential tremor, and obsessive-compulsive disorder is reviewed. Additionally, concepts and experimental outcomes for neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's is presented. Focused ultrasound as a tool is still in its infancy but the potential for adjuvant and direct therapy is promising. More clinical uses will become apparent in coming decades.
