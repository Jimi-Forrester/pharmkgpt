39425740|t|Evaluating the Regional and Demographic Variations in Dementia-Related Mortality Trends in the United States: 1999 to 2020.
39425740|a|INTRODUCTION: Dementia, a term for a range of cognitive impairments impacting memory, thinking, and social abilities, represents a formidable challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Analysing the temporal trends in dementia-related mortality among individuals, identifying the populations at high risk, and guiding the implementation of tailored interventions to address the escalating effects of dementia on public health. METHODS: Data from CDC WONDER database was examined from 1999 to 2020 for the four causes of dementia mortality: unspecified dementia (F03), Alzheimer's disease (G30), vascular dementia (F01), and other degenerative diseases of nervous system not elsewhere classified (G31). Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) per 100,000 persons and annual percent change (APC) were calculated and stratified by geographic region, year, age groups, sex, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: A total of 4,077,973 reported deaths were related to dementia from 1999 to 2020 in the United States. The greatest proportion of deaths was associated with Alzheimer's disease (45.9%), followed by unspecified dementia (43.8%). Very low proportion of deaths were associated with vascular dementia (4.9%) or other neurodegenerative diseases (5.3%). The AAMR increased in two distinct periods: a steep incline from 1999 to 2010 (APC: 6.95, 95% CI: 6.00-7.90), followed by a modest incline till 2020 (APC: 1.41, 95% CI: 0.80-2.04). Overall, females had a higher AAMR than males. AAMRs were highest among NH Whites patients and lowest in NH Asians or Pacific Islanders. A significant geographical difference was also observed among different US census regions. Nearly equal AAMRs were seen in non-metropolitan areas and metropolitan areas. States with AAMRs in the top 90th percentile included South Carolina, North Carolina, Maine, Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama while states with AAMRs in the bottom 10th percentile included South Dakota, Florida, Hawaii, New Jersey, District of Columbia, and New York (33.1). Individuals aged above 85 had the highest AAMRs. Most deaths occurred in nursing homes and least in hospice facilities. CONCLUSION: The dementia related deaths are continuously increasing. Highest AAMRs were observed among the NH White people, females, and in the southern areas of the United States. People aged 85+ were most affected. To stop the rising death rates, targeted interventions and awareness are required for both prevention and treatment of dementia.
