8733167|a|Inconsistencies within results of case-control studies on Alzheimer's disease risk factors led to a search of the literature for a potential cofactor. Reduced cerebral blood flow was selected and literature was surveyed for evidence of a cerebral blood flow linkage with the more than 40 putative risks. Alcohol abuse, depression, head trauma, underactivity, old age, sleep disturbance, glucose utilization, Down's syndrome, and Parkinson's disease are risk factors where an association with reduced cerebral blood flow is documented. Studies were cited showing that improved cerebral blood flow is associated with factors thought to be helpful in Alzheimer's disease, such as education or occupational attainment, exercise, headache, smoking, and arthritis/anti-inflammatory drugs to the extent that aspirin is used. Sugar consumption is identified as a potential risk factor with glucose management in Alzheimer's disease also shown to involve reduced cerebral blood flow. An hypothesis is developed showing how compromised regional cerebral blood flow could fit as a cofactor for genetic, autoimmune, and neurotoxic aspects of Alzheimer's disease.
