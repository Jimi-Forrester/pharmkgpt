29881524|t|Association between incidence of atrial fibrillation and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass in coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG): a cohort study.
29881524|a|BACKGROUND: Open heart surgery is one of the most common and valuable treatment methods for cardiovascular diseases, a common side effect of which is atrial fibrillation that occurs due to various reasons. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in patients after open heart surgery. METHODS: The present retrospective cohort study was conducted on 330 patients in Farshchian Heart Center through census. The required data were collected from medical records of the patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery using data collection between April 2015 and March 2015. Then, data analysis was performed using SPSS software (ver.16) at error level of p<0.05. The tests used in this study included independent-samples t-test, Mann-Whitney, and chi-squared tests. RESULTS: Based on the results, mean age of the patients was 61.76+-9.2, the majority of the patients (70.1%) were male. The association between Incidence of Atrial Fibrillation and cardiopulmonary pump time (minute) was not meaningful. Incidence of atrial fibrillation had statistically significant relationship with variables of mean age, BMI, PAC, PVC, creatinine and duration of hospitalization (p<0.05); on the other hand, variables of gender, cross clamp time (minute), intubation time (hour), and clinical history had no effect on atrial fibrillation incidence rate (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Since the pathogenesis of AF after cardiac surgery is believed to be multifactorial, including clinical variables and technical intraoperative factors, the relation between incidence of AF with mean age, BMI, PAC, PVC, creatinine and duration of hospitalization was significant. But AF was not related to cardiopulmonary pump time (minute). It is necessary to conduct further research on factors affecting incidence of atrial fibrillation.
