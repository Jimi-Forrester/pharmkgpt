37722790|a|OBJECTIVE: Evaluate relatives' experience of delirium due to an acute health event in a loved person and to compile practical suggestions for health care professionals from these synthesized results. BACKGROUND: Delirium resulting from an acute health event places patients at increased risk for prolonged hospitalization and mortality. A delirium episode also affects family members who may assist in the diagnosis and recovery from this condition. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Qualitative studies of family members or other caregivers who witnessed patient delirium in a clinical setting were included if they had appropriate verbatim evidence. Studies dealing exclusively with delirium in the context of dementia, cancer, palliative care, or drug dependence were excluded, and if quotes could not be clearly allocated to relatives. METHODS: A systematic review of qualitative studies adapted from the Joanna Briggs Institute meta-aggregation approach. A systematic literature search was conducted in CINAHL complete , MEDLINE , and several dissertation databases in September 2022. RESULTS: Eight qualitative studies based on semi-structured interviews were included. In total 75 findings from 105 relatives were aggregated into 13 categories. Finally, three synthesized findings reveal suggestions for health care professionals: providing information adequately, communication and integration during health care and understanding relatives' perspective on delirium experience. CONCLUSION: The identified burdens and needs of relatives should be considered by health care professionals to enhance the delirium experience for them, thus improving patient care by involving relatives with a better understanding.
