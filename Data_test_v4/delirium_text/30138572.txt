30138572|a|INTRODUCTION: Chronic activation of microglia is the hallmark of numerous neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. The activated microglia perpetuate inflammation by releasing an array of pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic factors, which eventually exacerbate neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration upon chronic activation of these cells. However, under acute conditions, activated microglia elicit pro-inflammatory as well as anti-inflammatory responses that are associated with neuroprotection. Given the role of microglia in neuroinflammation, recent studies have attempted to unravel the mechanisms that aid to establish microglial cell-based therapy. Areas covered: While total suppression of microglial activation may compromise its beneficial role in tissue repair in the aftermath of an insult, the benefits of modulating microglial activation and promoting microglia polarization to a neuroprotective phenotype have been highlighted recently. Expert opinion: So far, the therapeutic strategy focussed on neutralizing microglia-mediated neuroinflammation using drugs that block the release of pro-inflammatory mediators has limitations, such as unwarranted side effects. Recent advances reveal several alternative molecular targets and potential epi-drugs that are capable of modulating microglial function and promoting neuroprotection. This review discusses the recent progress made in understanding the mechanisms of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in various neuropathologies, and the emerging anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies in this field.
