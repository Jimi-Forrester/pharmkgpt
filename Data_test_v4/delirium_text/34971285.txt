34971285|t|Effectiveness of home-based telerehabilitation in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: A randomised controlled study.
34971285|a|BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has made it necessity that rehabilitation services are provided remotely to patients. These process required a transformation in healthcare. The aim of this study was investigate the effectiveness of the home-based online supervised exercise program in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the results of real-time supervised physical exercise telerehabilitation program in AD. METHOD: Eighteen subjects with early-middle stage of AD were randomised into 2 group as telerehabilitation group (TG; mean age: 77.7 +- 5.29 years; 7 Female, 3 Male) and control group (CG; mean age: 78.5 +- 7.07 years; 5 Female, 3 Male). Our primary outcome was Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), seconder outcomes were Timed Up&Go (TUG), One-leg Balance Test (OLBT), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS). The 6-week motor-cognitive dual-task exercise training was performed online and under the supervision of physiotherapist through videoconference. No physical or cognitive intervention was applied to the control group for 6 weeks. Subjects were assessed before and after the treatment. In statistical analysis, the change in the outcome scores was calculated (  = last measurement-first measurement), the difference between the groups was performed with the Mann Whitney-U Test in SPSS 22.0. Trial's protocol is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov under number NCT04606251. RESULT: There was a significant difference between TG and CG in favor of TG in MMSE, TUG, FIM and GDS (p<0,05); There was no significant difference between groups in OLBT (p>0,05). Statistical results have been showed in Table 1. No safety problem was observed during the treatment. All subjects were completed the study, there was a high adherence to treatment. CONCLUSION: Physical exercise treatment with telerehabilitation was feasible, safe and well-accepted by people with early-middle stage of AD. Online-supervised exercise program can improve cognitive function, functional mobility, independence and reduce depressive symptoms.
