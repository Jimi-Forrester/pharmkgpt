36297454|t|Vaginal Nanoformulations for the Management of Preterm Birth.
36297454|a|Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality in the world. In 2020, 1 in 10 infants were born prematurely in the United States. The World Health Organization estimates that a total of 15 million infants are born prematurely every year. Current therapeutic interventions for PTB have had limited replicable success. Recent advancements in the field of nanomedicine have made it possible to utilize the vaginal administration route to effectively and locally deliver drugs to the female reproductive tract. Additionally, studies using murine models have provided important insights about the cervix as a gatekeeper for pregnancy and parturition. With these recent developments, the field of reproductive biology is on the cusp of a paradigm shift in the context of treating PTB. The present review focuses on the complexities associated with treating the condition and novel therapeutics that have produced promising results in preclinical studies.
