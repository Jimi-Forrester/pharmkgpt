38401770|a|Neurocognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, are non-psychiatric brain syndromes in which a significant decline in cognitive function causes great trauma to the mental status of the patient. The lack of effective treatments for neurocognitive disorders imposes a considerable burden on society, including a substantial economic impact. Over the past few decades, the identification of resveratrol, a natural plant compound, has provided researchers with an opportunity to formulate novel strategies for the treatment of neurocognitive disorders. This is because resveratrol effectively protects the brain of those with neurocognitive disorders by targeting some mechanisms such as inflammation and oxidative stress. This article reviews the status of recent research investigating the use of resveratrol for the treatment of different neurocognitive disorders. By examining the possible mechanisms of action of resveratrol and the shared mechanisms of different neurocognitive disorders, treatments for neurocognitive disorders may be further clarified.
