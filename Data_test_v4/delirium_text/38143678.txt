38143678|t|Pulmonary Embolization After Gastric Varices Obliteration.
38143678|a|N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NB2CYA) is frequently used in the treatment of variceal hemorrhage with a success rate in hemostatic control of 87%-100%. Although rare, complications include esophageal perforation, infection, or arterial and venous embolization. We present the case of a 67-year-old male with chronic ethanolic liver disease hospitalized due to melena and hematemesis. He had anemia requiring transfusion support, octreotide, and pantoprazole infusion. Upper digestive endoscopy was performed showing gastric varices with a hemorrhagic rupture point treated with cyanoacrylate. The patient developed respiratory failure over the next 48 hours with chest computed tomography (CT) angiography showing several dense, scattered linear images, with arterial vascular trajectories suggestive of cyanoacrylate embolization. It was decided to provide ventilatory support with invasive mechanical ventilation, initiate systemic corticosteroid therapy, and transfer the patient to the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient was ventilated for 11 days with initial favorable evolution, but after two episodes of decompensation of his chronic liver disease (CLD) (hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome) and a new nosocomial pneumonia, he ended up dying. The present case illustrates a rare but potentially fatal complication associated with cyanoacrylate, highlighting the importance of a high suspicion index in cases of respiratory failure and dyspnea after this therapy.
