35670160|t|Beneficial Effects of Taurine on Metabolic Parameters in Animals and Humans.
35670160|a|Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) is a non-essential amino acid mainly obtained through diet in humans. Despite the lack of research on the health effects of taurine in animals and humans, it is widely used as a dietary supplement. Evidence from human and animal studies indicates that taurine is involved in conjugation of bile acids and regulation of blood pressure and has anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obesogenic properties. Taurine can benefit both human and non-human animal health in multiple ways. However, few interventional and epidemiological studies regarding the beneficial impacts of taurine in humans and other animals have been conducted. Here, we review the evidence from animal and human studies showing that taurine protects against dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.
