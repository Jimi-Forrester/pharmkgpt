36086918|t|Clinical presentation and neural correlates of stroke-associated spatial delusions.
36086918|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Incongruent beliefs about self-localization in space markedly disturb patients' behavior. Spatial delusions, or reduplicative paramnesias, are characterized by a firm conviction of place reduplication, transformation, or mislocation. Evidence suggests they are frequent after right hemisphere lesions, but comprehensive information about their clinical features is lacking. METHODS: We prospectively screened 504 acute right-hemisphere stroke patients for the presence of spatial delusions. Their behavioral and clinical features were systematically assessed. Then, we analyzed the correlation of their duration with the magnitude of structural disruption of belief-associated functional networks. Finally, we described the syndrome subtypes and evaluated whether the clinical categorization would be predicted by the structural disruption of familiarity-associated functional networks using an unsupervised k-means clustering algorithm. RESULTS: Sixty patients with spatial delusions were identified and fully characterized. Most (93%) localized the misidentified places closer to home than the hospital. The median time duration was 3 days (interquartile range = 1-7 days), and it was moderately correlated with the magnitude of structural-functional decoupling of belief-associated functional networks (r = 0.39, p = 0.02; beta coefficient regressing for lesion volume = 3.18, p = 0.04). Each clinical subtype had characteristic response patterns, which were reported, and representative examples were provided. Clustering based on structural disruption of familiarity- and unfamiliarity-associated functional networks poorly matched the clinical categorization (lesion: Rand index = 0.47; structural disconnection: Rand index = 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: The systematic characterization of the peculiar clinical features of stroke-associated spatial delusions may improve the syndrome diagnosis and clinical approaches. The novel evidence about their neural correlates fosters the clarification of the pathophysiology of delusional misidentifications.
