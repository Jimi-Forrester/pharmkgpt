METHODS: One hundred eighty-one patients were randomized to treatment in an 11-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients received either LY451395 0.2 mg BID for 28 days and 1.0 mg BID thereafter (n = 90) or placebo (n = 91). The primary outcome measurement was the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) with several secondary outcome measurements: Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change, Trail Making Part A, Stylus Tapping Test, Single Digit Modality Test, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). RESULTS: Baseline demographics were similar between the two groups. Patients did not show any mean change from baseline in the ADAS-Cog after treatment with LY451395 for 4 weeks (p = 0.60) or 8 weeks (p = 0.83). The only secondary outcome measurement that showed changes from baseline compared with placebo was the NPI Total Score: p = 0.06 (marginal significance) after 4 weeks of treatment and p = 0.03 after 8 weeks of treatment. Ninety-two percent of LY451395-treated patients and 95% of placebo-treated patients completed the trial. Adverse events were experienced by 83% of LY451395-treated patients and 86% of placebo-treated patients, the majority of which were rated mild in severity. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with LY451395 did not show a statistically significant separation from patients taking placebo on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, the primary outcome measure.
