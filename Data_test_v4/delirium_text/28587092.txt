28587092|a|Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) has been long considered a master regulator of inflammation and immune responses. Additionally, aberrant NF-kappaB signaling has been linked with carcinogenesis in many types of cancer. In recent years, the study of NF-kappaB members in NF-kappaB unrelated pathways provided novel attractive targets for cancer therapy, specifically linked to particular pathologic responses. Here we review specific functions of IkappaB kinase complexes (IKKs) and IkappaBs, which have distinctly tumor promoting or suppressing activities in cancer. Understanding how these proteins are regulated in a tumor-related context will provide new opportunities for drug development.
