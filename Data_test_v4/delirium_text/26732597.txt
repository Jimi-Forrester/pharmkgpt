26732597|t|GWAS-Linked Loci and Neuroimaging Measures in Alzheimer's Disease.
26732597|a|Recently, 19 susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD) had been identified through AD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) meta-analysis. However, how they influence the pathogenesis of AD still remains largely unknown. We studied those loci with six MRI measures, abnormal glucose metabolism, and beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition on neuroimaging in a large cohort from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database in order to provide clues of the mechanisms through which these genetic variants might be acting. As a result, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at rs983392 within MS4A6A and rs11218343 within SOLR1 were both associated with the percentage of increase in the volume of left inferior temporal regions in the follow-up study. Meanwhile, rs11218343 at SORL1 and rs6733839 at BIN1 was associated with rate of volume change of left parahippocampal and right inferior parietal, respectively. Moreover, rs6656401 at CR1 and rs983392 at MS4A6A were both associated with smaller volume of right middle temporal at baseline. However, in addition to the APOE locus, we did not detect any influence on glucose metabolism and Abeta deposition. APOE epsilon4 allele was associated with almost all measures. Altogether, five loci (rs6656401 at CR1, rs983392within MS4A6A, rs11218343 at SORL1, rs6733839 at BIN1, and APOE epsilon4) have been detected to be associated with one or a few established AD-related neuroimaging measures.
