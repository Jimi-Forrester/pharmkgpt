34101970|t|Senolytics alleviate the degenerative disorders of temporomandibular joint in old age.
34101970|a|Aging is one of the major risk factors for degenerative joint disorders, including those involving the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). TMJ degeneration occurs primarily in the population over 65, significantly increasing the risk of joint discomfort, restricted joint mobility, and reduced quality of life. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective mechanism-based treatment available in the clinic to alleviate TMJ degeneration with aging. We now demonstrate that intermittent administration of senolytics, drugs which can selectively clear senescent cells, preserved mandibular condylar cartilage thickness, improved subchondral bone volume and turnover, and reduced Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) histopathological score in both 23- to 24-month-old male and female mice. Senolytics had little effect on 4 months old young mice, indicating age-specific benefits. Our study provides proof-of-concept evidence that age-related TMJ degeneration can be alleviated by pharmaceutical intervention targeting cellular senescence. Since the senolytics used in this study have been proven relatively safe in recent human studies, our findings may help justify future clinical trials addressing TMJ degeneration in old age.
