24653910|t|The effect of gingko biloba on hearing in mice with noise-induced temporary threshold shift.
24653910|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Gingko biloba extract is known for enhancing blood circulation, scavenging free radicals, and antagonizing against platelet-activating factor. This study evaluated the effect of Gingko biloba on the noise-induced temporary threshold shift of hearing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Temporary threshold shift was induced by exposing mice to 110 dB SPL sound for 1 hour. The experimental group consisted of mice fed Gingko biloba [3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, and 12 mg/kg in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)] for 7 days before noise exposure. CMC solution without Gingko biloba was fed to control mice. Hearing threshold was measured by auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE). RESULTS: The hearing threshold increased after noise exposure and recovered to normal within 5 days in all groups. Compared to control mice (fed CMC solution only), mice fed Gingko biloba showed more rapid recovery of ABR threshold at 16 kHz in all three experimental groups. At the other frequencies, there was no significant change in hearing recovery in the Gingko biloba groups. There was no difference in DPOAE between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Temporary threshold shift of hearing after noise exposure was partly affected by oral Gingko biloba.
