26823165|t|Minimally invasive approach for aortic arch surgery employing the frozen elephant trunk technique.
26823165|a|OBJECTIVES: Classically, repair of extensive thoracic aortic pathologies including the aortic arch and descending aorta required two separate major surgical procedures via full sternotomy and a subsequent left lateral thoracotomy. We describe herein our preliminary institutional experience with minimally invasive single-stage extended thoracic aortic replacement employing the frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique via partial upper sternotomy (PUS) in 14 patients. METHODS: Between December 2013 and January 2015, 14 consecutive patients with elective indications for FET underwent minimally invasive FET via PUS (PUS-FET) during moderate systemic hypothermia (28 C) and selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) using the E-vita Open  hybrid prosthesis (Jotec GmbH, Hechingen, Germany). The patients' mean age was 66 +- 6 years, and 9 patients (64%) were male. The arch vessels were reimplanted en bloc in all patients. Clinical data were prospectively entered into our institutional database. RESULTS: The surgical procedure was successful in all patients with no need for conversion to full sternotomy. An additional David procedure was performed in 1 patient, whereas 2 patients received a concomitant Bentall procedure. There was no perioperative death or 30-day mortality. The mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 214 +- 35 min, and the myocardial ischaemic time was 125 +- 14 min. The ACP time was 54 +- 9 min, whereas the ventilation time reached 11 +- 4 h. Intensive care unit stay was 2 +- 3 days. Chest tube drainage within the first 24 h was 460 +- 130 ml. None of the 14 patients required re-exploration for bleeding. Patients were discharged after a hospital length of stay of 9 +- 2 days. No postoperative permanent neurological complication occurred. Two patients (14%) experienced temporary delirium with complete resolution of symptoms prior to discharge from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary experience suggests that minimally invasive single-stage extended thoracic aortic replacement can safely and reproducibly be performed by employing the concept of PUS-FET.
