20641870|a|Neuronal nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChRs) are a heterogeneous family of ligand-gated ion channels expressed in the central nervous system, where their activation by acetylcholine and nicotine always causes a rapid increase in cellular permeability to ions, such as Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (1-3). Nicotinic receptors exist as pentamers (homomeric or heteromeric) in various brain regions and ganglia. There are nine subtypes of ligand-binding a (a2-a10) and four subtypes of structural b (b2-b5). nAChRs have been demonstrated to be involved in cognitive processes such as learning and memory and control of movement in normal subjects. Dysfunction of nAChR has been implicated to a number of human diseases such as schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. nAChRs also play a significant role in nicotine addiction. 6-[<sup>18</sup>F]Fluoro-A-85380 (6-[<sup>18</sup>F]FA) and 2-[<sup>18</sup>F]FA have been evaluated as positron emission tomography (PET) agents for the non-invasive study of a4b2 nAChR in humans (4, 5). However, prolonged imaging times (2-4 h) are required for reliable quantification because of their slow kinetics. 2-(+/-)-2-<i>exo</i>-(2'-Fluoro-3'-phenyl-pyridin-5'-yl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (FPhEP) is a highly potent and selective a4b2 nAChR antagonist with subnanomolar affinity (6, 7). FPhEP is an analogue of epibatidine, which was showed to be a functional antagonist of a4b2 nAChR in mice. [<sup>18</sup>F]FPhEP is being developed as a PET agent with a faster kinetics than 2-[<sup>18</sup>F]FA and 6-[<sup>18</sup>F]FA for the non-invasive study of a4b2 nAChR in the brain.
