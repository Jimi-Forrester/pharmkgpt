38553562|a|Autophagy is a dynamic self-renovation biological process that maintains cell homeostasis and is responsible for the quality control of proteins, organelles, and energy metabolism. The E1-like ubiquitin-activating enzyme autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7) is a critical factor that initiates classic autophagy reactions by promoting the formation and extension of autophagosome membranes. Recent studies have identified the key functions of ATG7 in regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, and metabolism associated with the occurrence and development of multiple diseases. This review summarizes how ATG7 is precisely programmed by genetic, transcriptional, and epigenetic modifications in cells and the relationship between ATG7 and aging-related diseases.
