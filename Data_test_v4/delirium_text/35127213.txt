35127213|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) evacuation by two burr-hole craniostomies under local versus general anesthesia (GA) in elderly patients over 70 years. METHODS: This retrospective study included 45 patients with CSDH aged over 70 years old treated from March 2018 to April 2020. The cases were subdivided into Group A (n = 22) that underwent evacuation under local anesthesia and Group B (n = 23) that was treated under GA. Patients' demographics and history of comorbidities were recorded. Variables including pre- and post-operative neurological status and Markwalder's score, complication rate, operative time, and length of hospital stay were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean and standard deviation of patients' age of groups (A) and (B) were 74.3 +- 2.5 and 73.2 +- 1.7 years, respectively. Postoperative Glasgow Coma Scale of group (A) was statistically higher than Group B at postoperative day 1 (P = 0.01). Operative time was statistically shorter in Group A than B (P < 0.0001). The length of hospital stay was found to be longer in group (B) than (A) (P = 0.0001). The complication rate was found to be higher in group (B) than (A) (P = 0.044). CONCLUSION: Evacuation of CSDH under local anesthesia in elderly patients over 70 years is effective, safe, and economic with less complication rate than the traditional technique with GA.
