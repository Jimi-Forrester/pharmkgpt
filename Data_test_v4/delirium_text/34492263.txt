34492263|t|Defining (and blocking) neuronal death in Parkinson's disease: Does it matter what we call it?
34492263|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, comprised of both familial and idiopathic forms, behind only Alzheimer's disease (AD). The disease is characterized, regardless of the pathogenesis, primarily by a loss of DA neurons in the ventral midbrain as well as noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus; however, by the time symptoms manifest, considerable neuronal loss in both areas has occurred. Neuroprotective strategies thus have to be paired with more sensitive and specific biomarker assays that can identify early at-risk patients in order to initiate disease-modifying therapies at an earlier stage in the disease. Complicating this is the fact that multiple forms of cell death mediate the neuronal loss; however, with a common underlying element that the cell death is considered a "regulated" form of cell death, in contrast to an un-controlled necrotic cell death process. In this review we focus our discussion on several categories of regulated cell death in the context of PD: apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and autophagic cell death. In clinical studies as well as experimental in vivo models of PD, there is evidence for a role of each of these forms of cell death in the loss of midbrain DA neurons, and specific therapeutic strategies have been proposed and tested. What remains unclear however is the relative contributions of these distinct forms of cell death to the overall loss of DA neurons, whether they occur at different stages of the disease, or whether specific sub-regions within the midbrain are more susceptible to specific death triggers and pathways.
