36979225|a|Understanding the transmission pathways of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will aid in developing effective therapies directed at the virus's life cycle or its side effects. While severe respiratory distress is the most common symptom of a coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection, the virus is also known to cause damage to almost every major organ and system in the body. However, it is not obvious whether pathological changes in extra-respiratory organs are caused by direct infection, indirect, or combination of these effects. In this narrative review, we first elaborate on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, followed by the mechanisms of this virus on various organs such as brain, eye, and olfactory nerve and different systems such as the endocrine and gastrointestinal systems.
