38967486|a|OBJECTIVES: This study examined the role of caregivers' perception of cognitive impairment in burden of family caregivers in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that the evaluation of cognitive impairment by family caregivers plays a pivotal role in burden. METHODS: The study included 110 dyads (person with AD and their caregiver) recruited from a Memory Unit in France. The cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms of person with AD were evaluated by a geriatrician using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). Caregivers provided self-reports on the perception of cognitive impairment (IQCODE) of the care recipient, the caregiving burden (ZBI), depressive symptoms (GDS-15), and self-esteem (RSE). Descriptive analyses, comparison of different caregiver burden groups, and multinomial logistic regression analyses to understand correlates of caregiver burden were conducted with SPSS , version 20. RESULTS: The findings show that the caregivers are on average 60 years old and the majority are women. They care for persons with AD, who are on average 82 years old and most of whom are women. Our results show that the duration of caregiving, depression of the caregiver, and caregivers' perception of cognitive impairment contribute significantly to burden of caregiver. DISCUSSION: This study shows that it is necessary to adopt the caregiver-centered approach to support the dyad. The role of the caregivers' perception of cognitive impairment in AD should be developed when supporting caregivers in suffering.
