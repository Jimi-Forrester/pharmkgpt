METHODS: Ultracentrifugation, chromatography, manual Edman degradation and autosequence techniques were used to prepare and phosphorylate human recombinant tau, isolate and purify 32P tau peptides and determine phosphorylation sites. RESULTS: Phosphorylation of tau by casein kinase 1 (CK-1), cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and glycogen synthetase kinase 3 (GSK-3) separately inhibited its biological activity and the inhibition of this activity by (CSK-3 was significantly increased if tau was prephosphorylated by CK-1 or PKA. The most potent inhibition was seen by a combined phosphorylation of tau with PKA and GSK-3. The treatment of tau by PKA and GSK-3 combination induced phosphorylation of tau at Ser-195, Ser-198, Ser-199, Ser-202, Thr-205, Thr-231, Ser-235, Ser-262, Ser-356, Ser-404, whereas Thr-181, Ser-184, Ser-262, Ser-356 and Ser-400 were phosphorylated by GSK-3 alone under the same condition. CONCLUSION: Phosphorylation of tau by PKA plus GSK-3 at Thr-205 might play a key role in tau pathology in AD.
