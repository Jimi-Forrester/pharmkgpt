37662615|t|The Abnormal Alternations of Brain Imaging in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Systematic Review.
37662615|a|Background: Cognitive impairment (CI) is an important extrapulmonary complication in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Multimodal Neuroimaging Examination can display changes in brain structure and functions in patients with COPD. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the variations in brain imaging in patients with COPD and their potential relationship with CI. Furthermore, we aim to provide new ideas and directions for future research. Methods: Literature searches were performed using the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. All articles published between January 2000 and November 2021 that met the eligibility criteria were included. Results: Twenty of the 23 studies focused on changes in brain structure and function. Alterations in the brain's macrostructure are manifested in the bilateral frontal lobe, hippocampus, right temporal lobe, motor cortex, and supplementary motor area. The white matter microstructural changes initially appear in the bilateral frontal subcortical region. Regarding brain function, patients with COPD exhibited reduced frontal cerebral perfusion and abnormal alterations in intrinsic brain activity in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, right lingual gyrus, and left anterior central gyrus. Currently, there is limited research related to brain networks. Conclusion: CI in patients with COPD may present as a type of dementia different from Alzheimer's disease, which tends to manifest as frontal cognitive decline early in the disease. Further studies are required to clarify the neurobiological pathways of CI in patients with COPD from the perspective of brain connectomics based on the whole-brain system in the future.
