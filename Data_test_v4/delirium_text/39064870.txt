39064870|t|Principal Bioactive Properties of Oleanolic Acid, Its Derivatives, and Analogues.
39064870|a|Natural products have always played an important role in pharmacotherapy, helping to control pathophysiological processes associated with human disease. Thus, natural products such as oleanolic acid (OA), a pentacyclic triterpene that has demonstrated important activities in several disease models, are in high demand. The relevant properties of this compound have motivated re-searchers to search for new analogues and derivatives using the OA as a scaffold to which new functional groups have been added or modifications have been realized. OA and its derivatives have been shown to be effective in the treatment of inflammatory processes, triggered by chronic diseases or bacterial and viral infections. OA and its derivatives have also been found to be effective in diabetic disorders, a group of common endocrine diseases characterized by hyperglycemia that can affect several organs, including the liver and brain. This group of compounds has been reported to exhibit significant bioactivity against cancer processes in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we summarize the bioactive properties of OA and its derivatives as anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, antiviral, anti-diabetic, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, and anticancer agents.
