33940354|t|An automated radiosynthesis of (S)-[18F]28 for PET imaging of Alzheimer's disease.
33940354|a|18F-labeled 2-arylbenzoxazole derivative (S)-[18F]28 is potent and selective radiopharmaceutical Abeta tracers for Alzheimer's disease positron-emission tomography (PET). Our study aimed to enable facile preparation of (S)-[18F]28 in commercially available PET tracer production facilities to promote the widespread application and clinical translation. Here, we successfully demonstrated an automated radiosynthesis of (S)-[18F]28 with high radiochemical yield and radiochemical purity by the AllinOne radiosynthesis module. The method developed here can facilitate extensive use of (S)-[18F]28 in large-scale clinical trials.
