35563059|t|Spiro-Oxindole Skeleton Compounds Are Efficient Inhibitors for Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase 1: An Attractive Target for Tumor Immunotherapy.
35563059|a|Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is an attractive heme enzyme for its significant function in cancer immunotherapy. Potent IDO1 inhibitors have been discovered for decades, whereas no clinical drugs are used for cancer treatment up to now. With the goal of developing medically valuable IDO inhibitors, we performed a systematic study of SAR405838 analogs with a spiro-oxindole skeleton in this study. Based on the expression and purification of human IDO1, the inhibitory activity of spiro-oxindole skeleton compounds to IDO1 was evaluated by IC50 and Ki values. The results demonstrated that inhibitor 3 exhibited the highest IDO1 inhibitory activity with IC50 at 7.9 muM among all inhibitors, which is ~six-fold of the positive control (4-PI). Moreover, inhibitor 3 was found to have the most effective inhibition of IDO1 in MCF-7 cancer cells without toxic effects. Molecular docking analysis revealed that the hydrophobic interaction stabilized the binding of inhibitor 3 to the IDO1 active site and made an explanation for the uncompetitive mode of inhibitors. Therefore, this study provides valuable insights into the screen of more potent IDO1 inhibitors for cancer immunotherapy.
