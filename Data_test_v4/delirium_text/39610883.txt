39610883|t|Zika virus encephalitis causes transient reduction of functional cortical connectivity.
39610883|a|Significance: Determining the long-term cognitive impact of infections is clinically challenging. Using functional cortical connectivity, we demonstrate that interhemispheric cortical connectivity is decreased in individuals with acute Zika virus (ZIKV) encephalitis. This correlates with decreased presynaptic terminals in the somatosensory cortex. During recovery from ZIKV infection, presynaptic terminals recover, which is associated with recovered interhemispheric connectivity. This supports the contribution of synapses in the cortex to functional networks in the brain, which can be detected by widefield optical imaging. Although myeloid cell and astrocyte numbers are still increased during recovery, RNA transcription of multiple proinflammatory cytokines that increase during acute infection decreases to levels comparable to mock-infected mice during recovery. These findings also suggest that the immune response and cytokine-mediated neuroinflammation play significant roles in the integrity of brain networks during and after viral encephalitis. Aim: We hypothesized that widefield optical imaging would allow us to assess functional cortical network disruption by ZIKV, including hippocampal-cortical networks. Approach: We use widefield optical imaging to measure cortical functional connectivity (FC) in mice during acute infection with, and recovery from, intracranial infection with a mouse-adapted strain of ZIKV. Results: Acute ZIKV infection leads to high levels of myeloid cell activation, with loss of neurons and presynaptic termini in the cerebral cortex and associated loss of FC primarily within the somatosensory cortex. During recovery, neuron numbers, synapses, and FC recover to levels near those of healthy mice. However, hippocampal injury and impaired spatial cognition persist. The magnitude of activated myeloid cells during acute infection predicted both recovery of synapses and the degree of FC recovery after recovery from ZIKV infection. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a robust inflammatory response may contribute to the health of functional brain networks after recovery from infection.
