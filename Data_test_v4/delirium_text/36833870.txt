36833870|t|Dementia Care Competency Model for Higher Education: A Pilot Study.
36833870|a|A statewide landscape analysis was initiated to identify workforce development and educational needs concerning the support of persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Educational programs preparing healthcare professionals were targeted since people with ADRD, and their families/caregivers, often have frequent, ongoing contact with healthcare providers. A literature review and thematic analysis discovered a dearth of research and a lack of consistent competency identification for healthcare education. A crosswalk comparison of various competency models led to the development of a five factor model. A survey based on this model was sent to educators statewide evaluating confidence in ADRD-specific competency attainment in graduates. Descriptive statistics and factor analysis led to a revision of the original five factor model to a three factor model, including competencies in Global Dementia knowledge, Communication, and Safety, each with various sub-competencies. Identifying ADRD-specific competencies for graduating healthcare students is essential. This three factor competency framework will support educational programs in examining curricular offerings and increasing awareness concerning the needs of the ADRD population. Furthermore, using a robust competency model for healthcare education can assist in preparing graduates to address the needs of those with ADRD as well as the needs of the family/caregiving system and environment.
