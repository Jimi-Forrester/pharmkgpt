38338222|t|Prevalence and Cost of Antipsychotic Prescribing, within the Context of Psycholeptic Prescribing, in the Irish Setting.
38338222|a|Psycholeptic and specifically antipsychotic prescribing is increasing worldwide each year. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and cost of antipsychotic prescribing, within the wider frame of psycholeptic prescribing, in the Irish context. Quantitative analysis of a dataset from the Primary Care Reimbursement Service relating to cost and prescribing frequency of ATC Class N05 psycholeptic drugs from January 2020-August 2022 inclusive was conducted using Microsoft  Excel  for Microsoft 365 MSO (Version 2311) and STATA 18. Descriptive statistics and time-trend regression analysis were used to investigate the prescribing prevalence of psycholeptics and antipsychotics licensed for use in the Republic of Ireland, and the total cost per funding scheme. The prevalence of psycholeptic prescribing increased yearly from 2020-2022, peaking at 328,572 prescriptions in December 2020 with a total cost of psycholeptic drugs to the State in 2021 of $57,886,250, which was 0.5% of an increase on 2020. Over the 32-month time period, the average monthly cost of psycholeptic drugs was $4,436,469 on the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme and $369,154 on the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS). In 2021, quetiapine, olanzapine, and risperidone were the most prescribed antipsychotics, accounting for 66.58% of antipsychotics prescribed on the GMS scheme. This study identified the large expenditure on psycholeptics and antipsychotics in Ireland, with a higher proportion of the Irish healthcare budget spent on antipsychotics than that of the UK and the USA. The development of Irish antipsychotic prescribing guidelines may allow for structured, cost-effective prescribing.
