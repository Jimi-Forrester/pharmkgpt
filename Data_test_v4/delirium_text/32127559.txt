32127559|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease, causes behavioural abnormalities such as disinhibition, impulsivity, and hyperphagia. Preclinical studies using AD model mice have investigated these phenotypes by measuring brain activity in awake, behaving mice. In this study, we monitored the behavioural alterations of impulsivity and hyperphagia in middle-aged AD model mice. As a behavioural readout, we trained the mice to accept a water-reward under thirsty conditions. To analyse brain activity, we developed a measure for licking behaviour combined with visualisation of whole brain activity using awake fMRI. In a water-reward learning task, the AD model mice showed significant hyperactivity of the dorsal raphe nucleus in thirsty conditions. In summary, we successfully visualised altered brain activity in AD model mice during reward-oriented behaviour for the first time using awake fMRI. This may help in understanding the causes of behavioural alterations in AD patients.
