31325015|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Delirium is a very common neurobehavioral complication after stroke, but its influence on long-term outcome is not well characterized. The objective of the study was to determine the prognostic significance of delirium for functional status, nursing home admission, and mortality in a large cohort of patients with delirium in the acute phase of stroke assessed 3 and 12 months after stroke. METHODS: All stroke survivors included in PROPOLIS were followed up (n = 682). Outcome data included: discharge destination, recurrence of stroke, cardiovascular complications, functional activity and mobility, nursing home admission, and mortality. RESULTS: Patients with delirium were discharged to another hospital or nursing home significantly more often than those presenting without delirium. The 3- and 12-month post-stroke mortality rates were higher in delirious patients (OR 6.41 CI 3.76-10.92; p < 0.001 and OR 5.17 CI 3.36-7.96; p < 0.001). When considering 3-month mortality, higher age, modified Rankin Scale prior to admission and temperature between 1 and 3 days after admission, as well delirium, pneumonia and more severe neurological deficits on admission were independent risk factors. For 12-month mortality, the independent risk factors were higher age and modified Rankin Scale post-stroke, delirium, and history of respiratory diseases prior to stroke. Patients with delirium were more likely to live in nursing homes 3 and 12 months after stroke and were more disabled than patients without delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium in acute phase of stroke negatively influences the long-term prognosis. A study addressing the effect of early recognition and treatment of identified modifiable risk factors for adverse long-term outcomes is urgently needed to decrease bad prognosis within this population.
