38549639|t|Intelligent Alzheimer's Diseases Gene Association Prediction Model Using Deep Regulatory Genomic Neural Networks.
38549639|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an illness that affects the nervous system, leading to a loss in cognitive and logical abilities. Gene regulatory expressions, which are the complex language exhibited by DNA, serve several functionalities, including the physical and biological life cycle processes in the human body. The gene expression sequence affects the pathology experienced by an individual, its longevity, and potential for a cure. The transcription factors, from DNA to RNA conversion, and the binding process determine the gene expression, which varies for every human organ and disease. This study proposes Deep convolutional neural network model that reads the gene regulatory expression sequence through various convolutional layers encoded to detect positive spikes in transcription factors. This results in the prediction of disease conversion probability from mild cognitive impairment to AD which is the key-requisite for affected geriatric cohorts.
