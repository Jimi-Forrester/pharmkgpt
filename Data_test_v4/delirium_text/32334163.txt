32334163|a|Since December 2019, a respiratory pandemic named as coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by a new coronavirus named as SARS-CoV-2, has taken the world by storm. The symptoms are fever, malaise, and cough which resolve in a few days in most cases; but may progress to respiratory distress and organ failure. Transmission is through droplet infection or fomites, but other modes such as airborne transmission and oro-fecal transmission are also speculated. Research is underway to develop effective vaccines and medicines for the disease. In such a scenario, we present the measures described in Unani system of medicine for health protection during epidemics. Unani is a traditional system of medicine developed during the middle ages, which employs natural drugs of herbal, animal and mineral origin for treatment. In Unani medicine, during an epidemic, apart from isolation and quarantine, three measures are of utmost importance, (i) purification of surroundings using certain herbal drugs as fumigants or sprays, (ii) health promotion and immune-modulation, and (iii) use of health-protecting drugs and symptom-specific drugs. Drugs such as loban (Styrax benzoides W. G. Craib), sandroos (Hymenaea verrucosa Gaertn.) za'fran (Crocus sativus L.), vinegar etc. are prescribed in various forms. Scientific researches on these drugs reveal the presence of a number of pharmacologically active substances, which may provide a new insight into the management of infections and epidemics.
