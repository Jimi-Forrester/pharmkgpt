909981|t|[The increase of alcoholic delirium in our area since 1972].
909981|a|There has been a considerable increase since 1972 in the number of delirium alcoholicum patients admitted to our hospital. On the other hand, the number of chronic drinkers admitted for disaccustoming treatment has remained relatively constant during the past several years. The majority of patients are under 40. The relapse rate is rather high. The lethality rate is low in the case of treatment with clomethiazol. The purpose of this report is to incite workers at other clinics to analyze their respective patient stocks in order to discover supraregional causal factors, if any.
