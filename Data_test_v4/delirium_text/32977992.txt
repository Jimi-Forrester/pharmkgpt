32977992|t|The effect of resistance training on sleep in Chinese older adults: A randomized controlled trial.
32977992|a|Sleep disturbances affect approximately half of the older adult population and add additional risks of developing Alzheimer's disease. This study is to test the effects of a 12-week resistance training (RT) program on sleep in older adults residing in an assisted living facility in China. A total of 62 eligible participants were randomly assigned to RT (n = 31) or control group (n = 31). Participants in RT group participated in three 1-hour moderate intensity RT sessions per week for 12 weeks (at least 48 h between sessions). In the overall sample, sleep efficiency increased (P < 0.01), wake after sleep onset (P < 0.01) decreased in participants in RT group at post-intervention, compared to control group. Similar results were found in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The findings support that RT improves sleep efficiency and decreases sleep fragmentation in older adults in general and in those with MCI.
