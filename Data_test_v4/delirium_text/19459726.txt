19459726|a|The antioxidative and protective effects of zeatin against amyloid beta-protein (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity were investigated using PC12 cells. Zeatin showed antioxidative and cell protective effects against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. In this study, we also evaluated the effect of zeatin on learning and memory capacity in vivo using ICR mice with amnesia induced by scopolamine (1 mg/kg of body weight). Zeatin, when administered to mice at 4.5 mg/kg of body weight, significantly ameliorated scopolamine-induced amnesia as measured in both the passive avoidance test and Y-maze test. Injecting mice with scopolamine impaired performance on the passive avoidance test (48 +/- 4.5% decrease) and on the Y-maze test (12 +/- 1.3% decrease). In contrast, mice treated with zeatin before scopolamine injections were protected from these changes (5-34% decrease in step-through latency; 1-4% decrease in alternation behavior). The present results suggest a possible chemopreventive role of zeatin in Alzheimer's disease.
