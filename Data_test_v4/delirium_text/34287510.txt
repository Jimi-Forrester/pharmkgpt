34287510|a|BACKGROUND: Growth in aging of the population has led to increasing numbers of elderly people presenting cognitive impairment and evolution to dementia. There is still no consensus within primary care on the best strategy for screening for cognitive impairment among elderly people. Standardization of a simple but reasonably accurate instrument for a brief cognitive test, in primary care environments, would enable healthcare professionals to identify individuals who require a more in-depth assessment of cognition. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the instruments used by healthcare professionals in studies conducted worldwide and ascertain the most suitable instruments for screening for cognitive impairment among individuals aged 60 years or over, in the Brazilian population. DESIGN AND SETTING: Scoping review developed at Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Sao Paulo, Brazil. METHOD: A systematic search of the literature was conducted for primary studies using instruments to screen for cognitive impairment among individuals aged 60 years or over, in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central and LILACS databases. RESULTS: A total of 983 articles were identified by two independent reviewers, from which 49 were selected for full-text reading, based on the criteria defined for this review. From this, 16 articles adhering to the theme of screening for cognitive impairment among the elderly were selected for in-depth analysis. CONCLUSION: The Mini-Mental State Examination was the instrument most cited in these studies. The Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire and the Verbal Fluency Test (semantic category) present characteristics favoring further studies, for testing as screening instruments for cognitive impairment among elderly people in Brazil.
