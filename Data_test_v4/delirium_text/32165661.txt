32165661|a|Prion infections in the central nervous system (CNS) can cause extensive neurodegeneration. Systemic inflammation can affect the progression of some neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, we used the gastrointestinal helminth pathogen Trichuris muris to test the hypothesis that a chronic systemic inflammatory response to a gastrointestinal infection would similarly affect CNS prion disease pathogenesis. Mice were injected with prions directly into the CNS and subsequently orally co-infected with T. muris before the onset of clinical signs. We show that co-infection with a low dose of T. muris that leads to the development of a chronic T helper cell type 1-polarized systemic immune response accelerated the onset of clinical prion disease. In contrast, co-infection with a high dose of T. muris that induces a T helper cell type 2-polarized immune response did not affect prion disease pathogenesis. The reduced survival times in mice co-infected with a low dose of T. muris on d 105 after CNS prion infection coincided with enhanced astrocyte activation in the brain during the preclinical phase. These data aid our understanding of how systemic inflammation may augment the progression of neurodegeneration in the CNS.
