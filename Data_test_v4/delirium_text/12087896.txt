12087896|t|[Statins in clinical practice].
12087896|a|The review covers principles of treatment with statins, their pharmacokinetics, characterizes six most usable in clinical practice statins and one novel drug--rozuvastatin from a "superstatins" group. Statins proved effective in primary and secondary prophylaxis of coronary atherosclerosis, secondary prevention of ischemic stroke and diseases of peripheral arteries with intermittent claudication, prevention of Alzheimer's disease. Statins are indicated in dyslipidemia in diabetes mellitus type 2, nephrotic syndrome and renal insufficiency. Further studies are needed on statins' effects on hypercholesterolemia, their antiinflammatory and immunomodulating properties, the ability to enhance revascularization of ischemic tissue and stimulate proliferation of osteoblasts in osteoporosis.
