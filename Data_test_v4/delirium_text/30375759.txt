30375759|t|Qualitative Comparison of Semantic Memory Impairment in Patients with Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on beta-Amyloid Status.
30375759|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Semantic memory remains more stable than episodic memory across the lifespan, which makes it potentially useful as a marker for distinguishing pathological aging from normal senescence. To obtain a better understanding of the transitional stage evolving into Alzheimer's dementia (AD), we focused on the amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) stage stratified based on beta-amyloid (Abeta) pathology. METHODS: We analyzed the raw data from Korean version of the Boston Naming Test (K-BNT) and the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT). For K-BNT, the frequencies of six error types and accuracy rates were evaluated. For a qualitative assessment of the COWAT, we computed the number of switching, number of clusters, and mean cluster size. RESULTS: The data from 217 participants were analyzed (53 normal controls, 66 with Abeta- aMCI, 56 with Abeta+ aMCI, and 42 disease controls). There were fewer semantically related errors and more semantically unrelated errors on the K-BNT in Abeta+ aMCI than in Abeta- aMCI, without a gross difference in the z score. We also found that Abeta+ aMCI showed a more prominent deficit in the number of clusters in the semantic fluency task [especially for animal names (living items)] than Abeta- aMCI. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of similar clinical manifestations, Abeta+ aMCI was more similar to AD than Abeta- aMCI in terms of semantic memory disruption. Semantic memory may serve as an early indicator of brain Abeta pathology. Therefore, semantic memory dysfunction deserves more consideration in clinical practice. Longitudinal research with the follow-up data is needed.
