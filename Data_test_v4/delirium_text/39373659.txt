39373659|a|The incidence of Alzheimer's is increasing and poses a significant social and economic burden. The pathogenesis involved in the expansion of AD includes neuronal oxidative damage, tau phosphorylation, amyloid beta aggregation, neuroinflammation, etc. Despite enormous efforts, there is currently no effective treatment or cure for this condition in the allopathic system. Marine compounds are appealing options and have a strong neuroprotective impact. Marine-derived compounds from sponges, algae, and marine invertebrates can be used for neuroprotection, with fewer adverse effects than synthetic drugs. Various compounds such as bryostatin-1, docosahexaenoic acid, spirolides, and astaxanthin, GV-971, have demonstrated outstanding activity and bioavailability.
