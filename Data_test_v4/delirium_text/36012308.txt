36012308|t|Attenuation of Bone Formation through a Decrease in Osteoblasts in Mutant Mice Lacking the GM2/GD2 Synthase Gene.
36012308|a|The ganglioside GD1a has been reported to promote the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts in cell culture systems. However, the involvement of gangliosides, including GD1a, in bone formation in vivo remains unknown; therefore, we herein investigated their roles in GM2/GD2 synthase-knockout (GM2/GD2S KO) mice without GD1a. The femoral cancellous bone mass was analyzed using three-dimensional micro-computed tomography. A histomorphometric analysis of bone using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase was performed to examine bone formation and resorption, respectively. Calcein double labeling was also conducted to evaluate bone formation. Although no significant differences were observed in bone mass or resorption between GM2/GD2S KO mice and wild-type (WT) mice, analyses of the parameters of bone formation using HE staining and calcein double labeling revealed less bone formation in GM2/GD2S KO mice than in WT mice. These results suggest that gangliosides play roles in bone formation.
