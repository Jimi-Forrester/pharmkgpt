28934715|a|INTRODUCTION: Chronic constipation is very common in elderly patients. As a result of this situation fecaloma is also frequently seen at these ages. However, the stercoral perforation caused by fecaloma is a rare situation to occur. The rectosigmoid colon is the most affected colonic segment. It is seen in older patients with concomitant diseases and a low quality of life. PRESENTATION OF CASE: Here in this case, we have to report an 83 - year-old male patient who came to the emergency room with complaints of abdominal pain and constipation for two days. He had Type II Diabetes Mellitus, had a cardiac stent and also Alzheimer's disease. We diagnosed a rectosigmoid perforation due to a large fecaloma. This case presentation was prepared in accordance with the scare checklist guidelines (Agha et al., 2016 [1]). DISCUSSION: Constipation and faecal impaction are common entities, particularly in elderly and bedridden patients. Fecalomas are collections of dehydrated, hardened stool. They rarely can cause colonic ischemia and/or stercoral perforation. Stercoral perforation is the perforation or rupture of the intestine walls by a stercoraceous mass. Stercoral perforation is a very dangerous, life-threatening situation, as well as a surgical emergency, because the spillage of contaminated intestinal contents into the abdominal cavity leads to peritonitis, a rapid bacteremia with many complications. CONCLUSION: Fecalomas can cause stercoral perforations. This situation can be confused with other causes of acuteabdomen in these patients. Early surgery can be life saving.
