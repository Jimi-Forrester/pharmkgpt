8434448|t|Accidental chronic salicylate intoxication in an elderly patient: major morbidity despite early recognition.
8434448|a|Chronic salicylate intoxication represents an unappreciated form of self-poisoning in the elderly and therefore poses a diagnostic challenge. This report describes an elderly female with chronic salicylism who presented with unexplained delirium, dysarthria, diminished short-term memory and hearing, and urinary and fecal incontinence. She was treated with intravenous hydration, urinary alkalinization, and subsequent hemodialysis for persistent aciduria, acidemia and impending circulatory collapse. Major morbidity included myocardial infarction, life-threatening dysrhythmias, and mixed bacterial urosepsis. This report highlights the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for salicylate poisoning in the elderly, who commonly present with nonfocal neurologic features.
