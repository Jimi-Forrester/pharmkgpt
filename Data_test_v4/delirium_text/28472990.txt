28472990|a|BACKGROUND: The impairment of histone acetylation is causally linked to the cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), inhibitor of acetyltransferases (INHAT) can also regulate histone acetylation. As a key component of INHAT, level of ANP32A is selectively upregulated in the brain of AD patients. Here we investigated whether downregulating ANP32A can rescue AD-like synapse and memory deficits. METHODS: RFP-labeled lentiviral ANP32A-shRNA was infused stereotaxically into the hippocampal CA3 region of the human tau transgenic mice (termed htau). The spatial learning and memory were assessed by Morris water maze (MWM). The synaptic function was measured by electrophysiological recording and the spine density was detected by Golgi staining. RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the mRNA and protein levels. RESULTS: Elevation of ANP32 in htau transgenic mice was correlated with learning deficits, while the hippocampal infusion of lenti-siANP32A to downregulate ANP32A in 12 m-old htau mice could rescue memory loss. Further studies demonstrated that downregulating ANP32A restored synapse morphology and the function. In the brain of htau mice, the acetylated histone decreased while knockdown ANP32A unmasked histone for a robust acetylation with reduced INHAT complex formation. Downregulating of ANP32A also attenuated AD-like tau hyperphosphorylation. Finally, several AD-associated risk factors, including tau accumulation, beta-amyloid and H2O2 exposure, increased ANP32A by activating CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta (C/EBPbeta). CONCLUSION: We conclude that downregulating ANP32A rescues synaptic plasticity and memory ability by reducing INHAT formation and unmasking histone for hyperacetylation. Our findings reveal novel mechanisms for AD memory loss and potential molecular markers for protection.
