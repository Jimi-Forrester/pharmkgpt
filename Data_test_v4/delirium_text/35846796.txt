35846796|t|Effect of Perioperative Dexmedetomidine Infusion on Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients Undergoing Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.
35846796|a|Purpose: The aim of the study was to determine whether perioperative dexmedetomidine administration can improve postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing oral and maxillofacial surgery. Patients and Methods: This was a prospective double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in Cangzhou Central Hospital from December 2021 to March 2022. Patients aged 65 and older underwent oral and maxillofacial surgery under general anesthesia. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to dexmedetomidine or control group. Dexmedetomidine was injected intravenously from 10 min before induction of anesthesia to 30 min before the end of surgery in dexmedetomidine group, while patients in the control group were given normal saline at the same rate during the same time period. The primary measurement indicators were the incidence and duration of delirium in the first five days after surgery. The secondary measurement indicators were Visual Analogue Score (VAS) for the first 24 hours following surgery, subjective sleep quality score within 24 hours postoperatively and intraoperative adverse reactions. Results: One hundred and twenty patients were randomly assigned. Baseline characteristics were similar between two groups. The incidence and duration of postoperative delirium did not differ statistically between two groups (all P > 0.05). Compared with control group, VAS scores in dexmedetomidine group were significantly lower at 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery (all P < 0.05); moreover, Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) results were significantly improved 1 day after surgery in dexmedetomidine group (P < 0.05). Dexmedetomidine-related adverse reactions were similar in both groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine 10 min before induction of anesthesia to half an hour before the end of surgery did not improve postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing oral and maxillofacial surgery; however, dexmedetomidine may be associated with decreased postoperative pain and improved postoperative sleep quality.
