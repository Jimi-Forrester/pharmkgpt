39583450|t|The Connection Between Magnesium and Heart Health: Understanding Its Impact on Cardiovascular Wellness.
39583450|a|Magnesium is a crucial mineral that supports various enzymatic processes in the body. It plays a vital role in maintaining vascular, metabolic, and electrical homeostasis, making it an important factor for cardiovascular health. Magnesium is also involved in oxidative and inflammatory responses. Low levels of magnesium are associated with several cardiovascular issues, including arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and abnormal lipid levels. This suggests that a deficiency in magnesium could be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is a major public health concern. Monitoring serum magnesium levels might help in identifying cardiovascular problems and related risk factors. Additionally, magnesium supplementation could lead to new approaches for managing CVDs.
