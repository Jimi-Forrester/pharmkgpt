35520949|a|Although amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide accumulation is considered as a key early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the precise pathophysiology of this deadly illness remains unclear and no effective remedies capable of inhibiting disease progression have been discovered. In addition to deposition of extracellular Abeta plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation has been identified as the third core characteristic crucial in the pathogenesis of AD. More and more evidence from laboratory and clinical studies have suggested that anti-inflammatory treatments could defer or prevent the occurrence of AD. In this review, we will discuss multifaceted evidence of neuroinflammation presented in AD and the newly emerged anti-inflammatory targets both in pre-clinical and clinical AD.
