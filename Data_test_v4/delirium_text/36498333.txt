36498333|a|Despite the growing awareness of poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in family caregivers of people with dementia (PWD), their relationship has rarely been explored with population-based samples. The current cross-sectional study aimed to determine the detrimental impact of informal dementia caregiving on HRQoL by using nationally representative population-based samples from the Korean Community Health Survey. Demographics, socioeconomic, and physical and mental health-related characteristics as well as HRQoL measured by the Korean version of the European Quality of Life Questionnaire Five Dimension (EQ-5D) were compared between 9563 family caregivers of PWD and 186,165 noncaregivers. Caregivers had lower index scores and higher frequency of some/extreme problems in all five dimensions of the EQ-5D compared with noncaregivers. Logistic regression adjusting for potential confounding factors found that caregivers had a higher frequency of poor HRQoL (lowest quartile of EQ-5D index) than noncaregivers (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.46 [1.39-1.53]). Compared to noncaregivers, caregivers had a higher frequency of some/extreme problems in each dimension of the EQ-5D: mobility (1.30 [1.21-1.40]), self-care (1.62 [1.46-1.80]), usual activity (1.39 [1.29-1.51]), pain/discomfort (1.37 [1.31-1.45]), and anxiety/depression (1.51 [1.42-1.61]). A one-to-one propensity score matching analysis confirmed that poor HRQoL was more frequently found in caregivers compared to noncaregivers (1.38 [1.29-1.48]). Our results indicated that family caregivers of PWD are significantly associated with overall poor HRQoL, underscoring the detrimental impact of informal dementia caregiving on HRQoL. Given the high frequency of poor HRQoL in dementia caregivers and the important recognition of its serious consequences on physical and mental health, clinicians should take into consideration efficient interventions to improve health and HRQoL for family caregivers of PWD.
