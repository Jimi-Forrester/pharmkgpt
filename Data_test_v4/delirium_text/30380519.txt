30380519|t|Method for localizing intraoperative recordings from deep brain stimulation surgery using post-operative structural MRI.
30380519|a|BACKGROUND: Implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes for the treatment of involuntary movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, routinely relies on the use of intraoperative electrophysiological confirmation to identify the optimal therapeutic target in the brain. However, only a few options exist to visualize the relative anatomic localization of intraoperative electrophysiological recordings with respect to post-operative imaging. We have developed a novel processing pipeline to visualize intraoperative electrophysiological signals registered to post-operative neuroanatomical imaging. NEW METHOD: We developed a processing pipeline built on the use of ITK-SNAP and custom MATLAB scripts to visualize the anatomical localization of intraoperative electrophysiological recordings mapped onto the post-operative MRI following implantation of DBS electrodes. This method combines the user-defined relevant electrophysiological parameters measured during the surgery with a manual segmentation of the DBS electrode from post-operative MRI; mapping the microelectrode recording (MER) depths along the DBS lead track. RESULTS: We demonstrate the use of our processing pipeline on data from Parkinson's disease patients undergoing DBS implantation targeted to the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The primary processing components of the pipeline are: extrapolation of the lead wire and alignment of intraoperative electrophysiology. CONCLUSION: We describe the use of a processing pipeline to aid clinicians and researchers engaged in deep brain stimulation work to correlate and visualize the intraoperative recording data with the post-operative DBS trajectory.
