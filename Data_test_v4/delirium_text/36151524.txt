36151524|t|Quantitative gait analysis in mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and cognitively intact individuals: a cross-sectional case-control study.
36151524|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive age-related decline is linked to dementia development and gait has been proposed to measure the change in brain function. This study aimed to investigate if spatiotemporal gait variables could be used to differentiate between the three cognitive status groups. METHODS: Ninety-three older adults were screened and classified into three groups; mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 32), dementia (n = 31), and a cognitively intact (n = 30). Spatiotemporal gait variables were assessed under single- and dual-tasks using an objective platform system. Effects of cognitive status and walking task were analyzed using a two-way ANCOVA. Sub-comparisons for between- and within-group were performed by one-way ANCOVA and Paired t-tests. Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) was used to discriminate between three groups on gait variables. RESULTS: There were significant effects (P < 0.05) of cognitive status during both single and dual-task walking in several variables between the MCI and dementia and between dementia and cognitively intact groups, while no difference was seen between the MCI and cognitively intact groups. A large differentiation effect between the groups was found for step length, stride length, and gait speed during both conditions of walking. CONCLUSIONS: Spatiotemporal gait variables showed discriminative ability between dementia and cognitively intact groups in both single and dual-tasks. This suggests that gait could potentially be used as a clinical differentiation marker for individuals with cognitive problems.
