METHODS: Levels of Abeta42, total tau, and Ptau-181 in CSF were measured using commercially available ELISA in 47 EAD patients, 28 FTLD patients, and 21 nondemented control subjects. RESULTS: CSF Abeta42 was significantly lower and CSF total tau and CSF Ptau-181 significantly higher in EAD patients than FTLD patients and control subjects. There was an increase in diagnostic accuracy for CSF Ptau-181 vs CSF total tau (p = 0.067). Combining low CSF Abeta42 and high CSF Ptau-181 allowed EAD patients to be distinguished from FTLD patients with a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 93%. Logistic regression analysis with CSF Abeta42 and CSF Ptau-181 as independent continuous variables resulted in correct classification of 46 of 47 (98%) EAD patients and 23 of 28 (82%) FTLD patients. The diagnostic accuracy for EAD was independent of gender, disease duration, and disease severity. CONCLUSION: The combination of CSF Abeta42 and CSF Ptau-181 may help in differentiating EAD from FTLD.
