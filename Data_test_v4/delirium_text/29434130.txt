29434130|t|Quetiapine-related Acute Kidney Injury Requiring Transient Continuous Hemodiafiltration.
29434130|a|A 73-year-old man, with congestive heart failure due to combined valvar disease, underwent curative surgery. Although the surgery was successful, his clinical course was eventful because of pulmonary complications, and he began to deteriorate mentally. Quetiapine was prescribed, which appeared to effectively settle his mental status. Following the administration of quetiapine, however, he developed acute kidney injury (AKI) that required continuous hemodiafiltration. Subsequent to discontinuation of quetiapine, his renal function gradually improved. Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine, are frequently used to treat delirium in elderly patients in the intensive-care setting. This case highlights a potential risk of quetiapine-related AKI.
