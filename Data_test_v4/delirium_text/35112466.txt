35112466|a|Central nervous system (CNS) tumours have devastating effects and are recurrent, with dismal prognosis (gliomas) or life-threatening by the compression effect (meningiomas). This disease's aetiology remains debatable. Over the last decade, the hypothesis that human viruses may be implicated in these tumours has been proposed. In this study, our aim is to examine the presence of 11 viruses in the most frequent CNS primary tumours. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we assessed the viral presence in archived, paraffin-embedded tumour tissues from 114 patients with glioma and meningioma and in the brain tissue from 40 controls lacking tumour pathology. We focused on candidate neuro-oncogenic types (herpesviridae and polyomaviruses) and on human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV presence, for which involvement in these tumours was hardly investigated, was found to be associated with both tumour categories compared with controls (glioma, p = 0.032; meningioma, p = 0.032), whereas the presence of the neuro-oncogenic viruses was found in a negligible number of both categories, suggesting a lack of association with the tumour presence. Moreover, our study reveals a positive correlation between HPV presence and glioma malignancy, and a negative correlation with meningioma grading. Our results suggest that the presence of HPV seems to be significantly associated with primary tumours of the CNS and its meninges.
