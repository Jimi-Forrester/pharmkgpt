9859124|t|[Delirium during oral therapy of herpes zoster with acyclovir. Case report and brief review of central nervous system side-effects of acyclovir].
9859124|a|In differential diagnosis of a delir also adverse effects of medicaments have to be taken into account beside other causes. We report a case of an agitated delir with nocturnal disturbance of consciousness, confusion, restlessness and sleeplessness. This delir existed exclusively during the therapy of a cutaneous herpes zoster with zovirax-pills which can only be explained by a causal connection--after exclusion of other causes. As a so far undescribed predisposition for neurotoxicity of oral therapy with acyclovir signs of vascular encephalopathy were found in the patient's cranial magnetic resonance imaging. The central nervous side effects of acyclovir were summarized shortly.
