32379048|a|BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Computer-based training programs can improve cognitive performance in elderly populations. However, the effects of computer-based interventions on MCI APOE epsilon4 carriers have never been studied before. OBJECTIVE: The effects of different web-based interventions and the APOE isoform-specific differences in training outcomes are investigated. METHODS: Using a quasi-experimental study design, 202 participants with MCI aged 60 years and older took part in three different intervention programs (physical and cognitive [Long-Lasting Memories, or LLM], cognitive [Active Control, or AC], or physical intervention [Physical Training Control, or PTC]) via an innovative information and communication technologies exergaming platform. Participants in each interventional group were subdivided into APOE epsilon4 carriers and non-APOE epsilon4 carriers. All participants underwent an extensive neuropsychological evaluation before and after the training, blood tests, and brain imaging. RESULTS: All interventions resulted in multiple statistically significant cognitive benefits after the intervention. Verbal learning (California Verbal Learning Test: immediate recall test score-LLM: P=.04; AC: P<.001), working memory (digit span forward and backward test scores-AC: P=.03; PTC: P=.02 and P=.006, respectively), and long-term memory (California Verbal Learning Test: delayed recall test score-LLM: P=.02; AC: P=.002; and PTC: P=.02) were improved. There was no statistically significant difference among the intervention effects. APOE epsilon4 presence moderates intervention effects as the LLM intervention improved only their task-switching processing speed (Trail Making Test, Part B: P=.03) and the PTC intervention improved only the working memory (digit span backward: P=.03). No significant performance alteration was noted for the APOE epsilon4+ cognitive AC training group. CONCLUSIONS: None of the applied interventions could be identified as the optimal one; it is suggested, however, that combined cognitive and physical training and physical training via exergaming may be more effective for the high-risk MCI AlphaPOE epsilon4+ subgroup.
