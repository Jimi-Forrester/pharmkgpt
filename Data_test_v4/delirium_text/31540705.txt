31540705|a|Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are one of the world's leading causes of death. >50 million people throughout the world are suffering with these diseases. They are two distinct progressive neurodegenerative disorders affecting different regions of the brain with diverse symptoms, including memory and motor loss respectively, but with the advancement of diseases, both affect the whole brain and exhibit some common biological symptoms. For instance, >50% PD patients develop dementia in their later stages, though it is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. In fact, latest research has suggested the involvement of some common pathophysiological and genetic links between these diseases, including the deposition of pathological Abeta, Tau, and alpha-synuclein in both the cases. Therefore, it is pertinent to diagnose the shared biomarkers, their aggregation mechanism, their intricate relationships in the pathophysiology of disease and therapeutic markers to target them. This would enable us to identify novel markers for the early detection of disease and targets for the future therapies. Herein, we investigated molecular aspects of Abeta, Tau, and alpha-Synuclein aggregation, and characterized their functional partners involved in the pathology of AD and PD. Moreover, we identified the molecular-crosstalk between AD and PD associated with their pathogenic proteins- Abeta, Tau, and alpha-Synuclein. Furthermore, we characterized their ubiquitinational enzymes and associated interaction network regulating the proteasomal clearance of these pathological proteins.
