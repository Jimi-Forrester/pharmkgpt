39657691|t|The relationship between subjective cognitive decline and cognitive leisure activity engagement: A systematic review.
39657691|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a common experience of self-perceived decline without objective cognitive impairment. It has been theorised that SCD is associated with participation in cognitive leisure activities (CLA), but the evidence base is multifarious and unclear. The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize current evidence to determine the association between SCD and CLA engagement. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted in EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science (last searched April 2023). Data were extracted against a priori inclusion criteria and synthesized narratively using Synthesis without Meta-Analysis guidelines. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Reporting follows PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: From 4447 records, 11 articles were included. Due to study heterogeneity, evidence on SCD and CLA association is inconclusive. While a modest correlation was found between greater engagement in CLA and fewer reports of SCD, the heterogeneity in study designs and outcomes, particularly in those addressing only perceived memory decline and CLA engagement, challenges definitive conclusions on this relationship. Evidence from mixed-method and qualitative studies indicated that perceived memory decline may cause negative feelings, such as shame and frustration, which may influence participating in CLA. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings suggest that participation in CLA is moderately associated with, and may act protectively against, SCD. However, establishing a directional or causal relationship between CLA participation and SCD outcomes requires further investigation through longitudinal and/or interventional studies.
