35642353|t|Glutamate-weighted CEST (gluCEST) imaging for mapping neurometabolism: An update on the state of the art and emerging findings from in vivo applications.
35642353|a|Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. As such, its proper regulation is essential to the healthy function of the human brain, and dysregulation of glutamate metabolism and compartmentalization underlies numerous neurological and neuropsychiatric pathologies. Glutamate-weighted chemical exchange saturation transfer (gluCEST) MRI is one of the only ways to non-invasively observe the relative concentration and spatial distribution of glutamate in the human brain. In the past 10 years, gluCEST has developed from a proof-of-concept experiment carried out in imaging phantoms and model systems to an increasingly sophisticated technique applied to reveal deviations from baseline neural metabolism in human beings, most notably in patients experiencing seizures of various origins or those on the psychosis spectrum. This article traces that progress, including in-depth discussion of the technical specifics of gluCEST and potential challenges to performing these experiments rigorously. We discuss the neurobiological context of glutamate, including the widely accepted hypotheses and models in the literature regarding its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases and other pathology. We then review the state of the art of in vivo glutamate detection by magnetic resonance imaging and the limitations on this front of in vivo MR spectroscopy. The gluCEST experiment is introduced and its advantages, challenges and limitations are thoroughly explored, beginning with the phantom experiment results demonstrated in the initial publication, through the latest approaches to correcting human brain images for B1 inhomogeneity. We then give a comprehensive overview of preclinical applications demonstrated to date, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Traumatic brain injury and cancer, followed by a similar discussion of human studies. Finally, we highlight emerging applications, and discuss technical improvements on the horizon that hold promise for improving the robustness and versatility of gluCEST and its increasing presence in the arena of translational and precision medicine.
