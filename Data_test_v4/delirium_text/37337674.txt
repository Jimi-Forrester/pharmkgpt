37337674|t|Post-transcriptional microRNA repression of PMP22 dose in severe Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1.
37337674|a|Copy number variation (CNV) may lead to pathological traits, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), the commonest inherited peripheral neuropathy, is due to a genomic duplication encompassing the dosage-sensitive PMP22 gene. MicroRNAs act as repressors on post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and in rodent models of CMT1A, overexpression of one such microRNA (miR-29a) has been shown to reduce the PMP22 transcript and protein level. Here we present genomic and functional evidence, for the first time in a human CNV-associated phenotype, of the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR)-mediated role of microRNA repression on gene expression. The proband of the family presented with an early-onset, severe sensorimotor demyelinating neuropathy and harboured a novel de novo deletion in the PMP22 3'-UTR. The deletion is predicted to include the miR-29a seed binding site and transcript analysis of dermal myelinated nerve fibres using a novel platform, revealed a marked increase in PMP22 transcript levels. Functional evidence from Schwann cell lines harbouring the wildtype and mutant 3'-UTR showed significantly increased reporter assay activity in the latter which was not ameliorated by overexpression of a miR-29a mimic. This shows the importance of miR-29a in regulating PMP22 expression and opens an avenue for therapeutic drug development.
