30559067|t|Postoperative Pain Management Strategies and Delirium After Transapical Aortic Valve Replacement: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
30559067|a|OBJECTIVE(S): This study was designed to compare 2 different perioperative analgesia strategies with respect to the incidence of postoperative delirium after a transapical approach for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The authors hypothesized that perioperative thoracic paravertebral analgesia with a local anesthetic would decrease opioid consumption and in turn reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium when compared with systemic opioid-based analgesia after a transapical TAVR procedure. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Tertiary referral center, university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised 44 patients undergoing a transapical TAVR procedure. Patients with a history of serious mental illness, delirium, and severe dementia and/or patients with contraindications to regional anesthesia were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to either the paravertebral group (perioperative continuous thoracic paravertebral block with local anesthetic) or the patient-controlled analgesia group (systemically administered opioids) using a computer-generated randomization code in blocks of four patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Assessment of postoperative delirium was performed by trained research staff using the confusion assessment method for intensive care unit preoperatively and postoperatively every 12 hours or more often if needed according to the patient's condition during the first 7 postoperative days or until discharge. Pain was assessed with a 10 cm Visual Analog Scale pain score system during the 48 hours postoperatively. The sedation level was assessed using the Sedation Agitation Scale during the same period. Overall postoperative delirium was detected in 12/44 (27%) patients, with 7/22 (32%) in the patient-controlled analgesia and 5/22 (23%) in the paravertebral groups, respectively (p = 0.73). Both groups were similar with respect to demographic data, preoperative medications, and comorbidities. Paravertebral analgesia was associated with an opioid-sparing effect during surgery and during the 48-hour postoperative period. Sedation and pain scores were similar between the 2 groups. In addition, paravertebral analgesia was associated with earlier extubation times; however, the overall morbidity and mortality were similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Paravertebral analgesia in patients undergoing transapical TAVR procedures appears to have an opioid-sparing effect. However, it did not translate into a statistically significant decrease in the rate of postoperative delirium.
