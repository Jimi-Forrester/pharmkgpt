Serbia shares this need for Acute Geriatric Units (AGU). The National Programme of Health Care of Elderly People Improvement is planning to open the Geriatric Ward in every regional general hospital in Serbia. But in cities with several hospitals, there is a waste need for geriatric ward capable of taking acute care. So, there is a need for geriatric wards in Serbia nowadays. The main targerts for AGU should be: the comprehensive geriatric assessment, prevention of development of worsening of delirium, decubital wounds, incontinence, improving mobility and early planning of discharge. The multidisciplinary team, which includes physicians, nurses, physiatrist and social worker, is the best solution for getting this target day by day.
