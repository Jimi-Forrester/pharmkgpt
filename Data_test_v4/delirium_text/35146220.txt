35146220|t|Late-onset spinal subdural hematoma following cerebrospinal fluid drainage tube removal.
35146220|a|Cerebrospinal fluid drainage is recommended for high-risk patients to prevent spinal cord ischemia during aortic surgery; however, it is associated with complications. We report a case of a late-onset spinal subdural hematoma that developed after removal of the cerebrospinal fluid drainage tube from a patient who undergon thoracic endovascular aortic repair. Spinal hematoma usually develop 2 to 3 days after tube removal; however, in our patient's case, it developed after 7 days. Therefore, a spinal subdural hematoma can occur <=1 week after drainage tube removal, necessitating prompt magnetic resonance imaging for patients with lower limb weakness or back pain.
