38065589|t|Heart failure management at home: a non-randomised prospective case-controlled trial (HeMan at Home).
38065589|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Heart failure (HF) is a growing clinical and economic burden for patients and health systems. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to avoidance and delay in care, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality among many patients with HF. The increasing burden of HF during the COVID-19 pandemic led us to evaluate the quality and safety of the Hospital at Home (HAH) for patients presenting to their community providers or emergency department (ED) with symptoms of acute on chronic HF (CHF) requiring admission. DESIGN/OUTCOMES: A non-randomised prospective case-controlled of patients enrolled in the HAH versus admission to the hospital (usual care, UC). Primary outcomes included length of stay (LOS), adverse events, discharge disposition and patient satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included 30-day readmission rates, 30-day ED usage and ED dwell time. RESULTS: Sixty patients met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in the study. Of the 60 patients, 40 were in the HAH and 20 were in the UC group. Primary outcomes demonstrated that HAH patients had slightly longer LOS (6.3 days vs 4.7 days); however, fewer adverse events (12.5% vs 35%) compared with the UC group. Those enrolled in the HAH programme were less likely to be discharged with postacute services (skilled nursing facility or home health). HAH was associated with increased patient satisfaction compared with Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) score in North Carolina. Secondary outcomes of 30-day readmission and ED usage were similar between HAH and UC. CONCLUSIONS: The HAH pilot programme was shown to be a safe and effective alternative to hospitalisation for the appropriately selected patient presenting with acute on CHF.
