35805406|t|The Impact of COVID-19 Infection on Cognitive Function and the Implication for Rehabilitation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
35805406|a|There is mounting evidence that patients with severe COVID-19 disease may have symptoms that continue beyond the acute phase, extending into the early chronic phase. This prolonged COVID-19 pathology is often referred to as 'Long COVID'. Simultaneously, case investigations have shown that COVID-19 individuals might have a variety of neurological problems. The accurate and accessible assessment of cognitive function in patients post-COVID-19 infection is thus of increasingly high importance for both public and individual health. Little is known about the influence of COVID-19 on the general cognitive levels but more importantly, at sub-functions level. Therefore, we first aim to summarize the current level of evidence supporting the negative impact of COVID-19 infection on cognitive functions. Twenty-seven studies were included in the systematic review representing a total of 94,103 participants (90,317 COVID-19 patients and 3786 healthy controls). We then performed a meta-analysis summarizing the results of five studies (959 participants, 513 patients) to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on cognitive functions. The overall effect, expressed in standardized mean differences, is -0.41 [95%CI -0.55; -0.27]. To prevent disability, we finally discuss the different approaches available in rehabilitation to help these patients and avoid long-term complications.
