37359709|a|Garcinia kola Heckel (Clusiaceae) is a tree indigenous to West and Central Africa. All plant parts, but especially the seeds, are of value in local folklore medicine. Garcinia kola is used in treatment of numerous diseases, including gastric disorders, bronchial diseases, fever, malaria and is used to induce a stimulating and aphrodisiac effect. The plant is now attracting considerable interest as a possible source of pharmaceutically important drugs. Several different classes of compounds such as biflavonoids, benzophenones, benzofurans, benzopyran, vitamin E derivatives, xanthones, and phytosterols, have been isolated from G. kola, of which many appears to be found only in this species, such as garcinianin (found in seeds and roots), kolanone (fruit pulp, seeds, roots), gakolanone (stem bark), garcinoic acid, garcinal (both in seeds), garcifuran A and B, and garcipyran (all in roots). They showed a wide range of pharmacological activities (e.g. analgesic, anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective and neuroprotective effects), though this has only been confirmed in animal models. Kolaviron is the most studied compound and is perceived by many studies as the active principle of G. kola. However, its research is associated with significant flaws (e.g. too high doses tested, inappropriate positive control). Garcinol has been tested under better conditions and is perhaps showing more promising results and should attract deeper research interest (especially in the area of anticancer, antimicrobial, and neuroprotective activity). Human clinical trials and mechanism-of-action studies must be carried out to verify whether any of the compounds present in G. kola may be used as a lead in the drug development.
