35013124|a|Deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain is one of the important histopathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we reported a correlation between cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1) expression and the occurrence of AD, but its relationship was unclear. Here, we report that the expression of L1 and a 70 kDa cleavage product of L1 (L1-70) was reduced in the hippocampus of AD (APPswe) mice. Interestingly, upregulation of L1-70 expression in the hippocampus of 18-month-old APPswe mice, by parabiosis involving the joining of the circulatory system of an 18-month-old APPswe mouse with a 2-month-old wild-type C57BL/6 mouse, reduced amyloid plaque deposition. Furthermore, the reduction was accompanied by the appearance of a high number of activated microglia. Mechanistically, we observed that L1-70 could combine with topoisomerase 1 (Top1) to form a complex, L1-70/Top1, that was able to regulate expression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), resulting in the activation of microglia and reduction of Abeta plaques. Also, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta-1) transferred from the blood of young wild-type C57BL/6 mice to the aged AD mice, was identified as a circulating factor that induces full-length L1 and L1-70 expression. All together, these findings suggest that L1-70 contributes to the clearance of Abeta in AD, thereby adding a novel perspective in understanding AD pathogenesis.
