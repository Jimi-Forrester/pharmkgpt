32953706|t|Effectiveness of Ultrasound-guided Single-injection Triple Nerve Block Before Cementless Bipolar Hip Hemiarthroplasty in Femoral Neck Fractures.
32953706|a|PURPOSE: To compare efficacy of ultrasound (US)-guided single-injection nerve blocks (SINB) before bipolar hemiarthroplasty (BHA) of the hip in patients with femoral neck fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical outcomes of 89 patients who underwent BHA between September 2016 and February 2018 were retrospectively compared. Eight patients were excluded according to exclusion criteria and the remaining patients were divided into two groups: patients who received SINB before surgery (Group I; n=40), and patients who did not (Group II; n=41). The femoral, obturator, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves were each blocked separately under US guidance. Pain scores determined using the visual analogue scale (VAS) were recorded 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively, and all use of analgesics were recorded separately for 72 hours after surgery. Duration of hospitalization, general complications, and local complications due to SINB were also compared among the groups. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between the two groups: I) VAS at 6 hours and at 12 hours after the operation, II) total amounts of analgesics used. VAS at 24 hours and at 48 hours were not significantly different between the two groups. General complications and duration of hospitalization were also not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION: US-guided lower limb nerve blocks provide excellent immediate postoperative pain relief and can be used as a safe, and effective method of pain control after BHA.
