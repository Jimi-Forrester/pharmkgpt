34626386|a|Numerous studies indicate that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) participate in a network of complex molecular events involving amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and formation, oligomerization, intracellular targeting, clearance, and propagation of amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A mutual functional interplay between recycling glypican-1 and APP processing has been demonstrated where the HS released from glypican-1 by a Cu/NO-ascorbate-dependent reaction forms a conjugate with APP degradation products and undergoes an endosome-nucleus-autophagosome co-trafficking. HS has been shown to display contradictory and dual effects in AD involving both prevention and promotion of amyloid beta formation. It is therefore important to identify the source, detailed structural features as well as factors that favor formation of the neuroprotective forms of HS. Here, a method for isolation and identification of HS-containing APP degradation products has been described. The method is based on isolation of radiolabeled HS followed by identification of accompanying APP degradation products by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
