38013259|t|Assessing frailty in elderly patients with hip fractures: A retrospective review comparing geriatrician and orthopedic trainee assessments.
38013259|a|To assess the correlation of orthopedic surgery residents compared with expert geriatricians in the assessment of frailty stage using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) in patients with hip fractures. A retrospective chart review was performed from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019. Patients admitted with a diagnosis of hip fracture were identified. Those patients with a CFS score completed by orthopedic residents with subsequent CFS score completed by a geriatrician during their admission were extracted. Six hundred and forty-eight patients over age 60 (mean 80.5 years, 73.5% female) were admitted during the study period. Orthopaedic residents completed 286 assessments in 44% of admissions. Geriatric medicine consultation was available for 215 patients such that 93 patients were assessed by both teams. Paired CFS data were extracted from the charts and tested for agreement between the 2 groups of raters. CFS assessments by orthopedic residents and geriatrician experts were significantly different at P < .05; orthopedic residents typically assessed patients to be one CFS grade less frail than geriatricians. Despite this, the CFS assessments showed good agreement between residents and geriatricians. Orthopaedic surgery residents are reliable assessors of frailty but tend to underestimate frailty level compared with specialist geriatricians. Given the evidence to support models such as orthogeriatrics to improve outcomes for frail patients, our findings suggest that orthopedic residents may be well positioned to identify patients who could benefit from such early interventions. Our findings also support recent evidence that frailty assessments by orthopedic surgeons may have predictive validity. Low rates of initial frailty assessment by orthopedic residents suggests that further work is required to integrate more global comprehensive care.
