16197661|a|INTRODUCTION: Exploratory pilot studies and knowledge of its mode of action suggested that galantamine, a cholinesterase inhibitor and modulator of nicotinic receptors, can improve attention. This study was designed to test the effects of galantamine on attention in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to see how changes in attention affected their caregivers. METHODS: This was an open-label, multicentre study. Patients received galantamine (up to 24 mg/day) for 12 weeks. Attention was assessed after 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks using computerized tests including Choice Reaction Time (CRT), and caregiver, physician and patient ratings. RESULTS: Data were available from 373 patients (mean age 75 years, mean baseline MMSE score 21). Attention as measured by CRT improved significantly from baseline to study endpoint (p < 0.001), improvements were observed after 1 week and statistical significance was maintained from 8 weeks. Physicians rated 67% of patients as globally improved and 5% as worsened. Caregivers reported improved attention in 57% of patients and worsening in 6%; 62% of patients considered they had improved and 3% considered themselves to be worse. Caregiver stress, time spent caring for patients and patients' interactions with others all improved from baseline to endpoint. Galantamine was generally well tolerated; the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal. CONCLUSION: Previous controlled trials have demonstrated that galantamine has a positive effect on cognition, activities of daily living, behaviour and global condition, but this is the first study to suggest that galantamine may specifically improve attention (according to both objective and subjective measures) in patients with AD. These effects may be a consequence of galantamine's potentiating action at nicotinic receptors.
