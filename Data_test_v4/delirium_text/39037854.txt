39037854|a|This study evaluated the impact of different digestion conditions (adult and senior) on lipolysis and bioaccessibility of plant sterols (PS) and phytosterol oxidation products (POPs) in PS-enriched wholemeal rye bread. Under adult digestion conditions, the addition of gastric lipase (GL) reduced lipolysis products (by 6.1% for free fatty acids and 11.7% for monoacylglycerols) and the bioaccessibility of PS by 6.7%, compared to the control. In digestion with both GL and cholesterol esterase (CE), these reductions were 12.9, 20.1, and 11.3%, respectively. Both modifications (GL and GL + CE) increased the bioaccessibility of POPs by 4.5-4.0%. When simulating the elderly digestion, the modified gastric and intestinal phases did not alter PS bioaccessibility but decreased POPs bioaccessibility by 21.8% compared to control, along with reduced lipolysis. Incorporating GL and CE thus approached physiological conditions and influenced lipid digestion. Elderly simulated digestion conditions resulted in a positive outcome by maintaining PS bioaccessibility while reducing potentially harmful POPs.
