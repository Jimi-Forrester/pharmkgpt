34834150|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder. AD is pathologically characterized by the formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and extracellular amyloid plaques which were comprised of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. Abeta induces neurodegeneration by activating microglia, which triggers neurotoxicity by releasing various inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) is expressed in human tissues including the brain and plays an important role in Abeta-mediated neuronal inflammation. Thus, the identification of molecules that inhibit the NF-kappaB pathway is considered an attractive strategy for the treatment and prevention of AD. Isoorientin (3',4',5,7-Tetrahydroxy-6-C-glucopyranosyl flavone; ISO), which can be extracted from several plant species, such as Philostachys and Patrinia is known to have various pharmacological activities such as anticancer, antioxidant, and antibacterial activity. However, the effect of ISO on Abeta-mediated inflammation and apoptosis in the brain has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we investigated whether ISO regulated Abeta-induced neuroinflammation in microglial cells and further explored the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that ISO inhibited the expression of iNOS and COX-2 induced by Abeta25-35. And, it inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In addition, ISO reduced the ROS production in Abeta25-35-induced BV2 cells and inhibited NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, ISO blocked Abeta25-35-induced apoptosis of BV2 cells. Based on these findings, we suggest that ISO represents a promising therapeutic drug candidate for the treatment and prevention of AD.
