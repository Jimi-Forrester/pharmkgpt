38853788|a|Background: There is a dearth of research on risk factors of delirium among elderly inpatients in nonintensive low resource settings. Aim: To determine the risk factors of delirium in elderly inpatients in a nonintensive care unit setting. Materials and Methods: Sixty two elderly patients with delirium (cases) and 62 patients without delirium (controls) were administered a semi-structured proforma with socio-demographic variables and putative predisposing and precipitating risk factors and the Vellore screening instrument for dementia. Results: On univariate analysis, factors such as past cognitive impairment, history of nocturnal confusion and delirium, diminished daily living activities, severe medical illness, history of psychiatric illness, presence of dementia, infection, fever above 1000F, abnormal electrolytes abnormal RFT, leukocytes in urine, hypoxia, anticholinergics and benzodiazepines, emergency admission, use of physical restraints, bladder catheterization, more than routine investigations, intensive care unit admission, surgery, and duration of hospital stay more than 10 days were found to be significantly associated with delirium. On multivariate analysis with binary logistic regression, bladder catheterization (odds ratio [OR] = 13.85; confidence interval [CI] = 1.44-133.14), abnormal electrolytes (OR = 5.12; CI = 1.11-23.69), and hypoxia (OR = 75.52; CI = 4.64-1.134E3) were detected to be independently associated with delirium. Conclusion: Acute modifiable rather than long-term factors were risk factors for delirium among the elderly. An awareness of modifiable risk factors has the potential of developing targeted interventions for the early mitigation of delirium.
