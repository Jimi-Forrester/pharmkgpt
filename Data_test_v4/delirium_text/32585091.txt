32585091|t|Autoinhibition by Iodide Ion in the Methionine-Iodine Reaction.
32585091|a|The methionine-iodine reaction was reinvestigated spectrophotometrically in detail monitoring the absorbance belonging to the isosbestic point of iodine at 468 nm, at T = 25.0 +- 0.1  C, and at 0.5 M ionic strength in buffered acidic medium. The stoichiometric ratio of the reactants was determined to be 1:1 producing methionine sulfoxide as the lone sulfur-containing product. The direct reaction between methionine and iodine was found to be relatively rapid in the absence of initially added iodide ion, and it can conveniently be followed by the stopped-flow technique. Reduction of iodine eventually leads to the formation of iodide ion that inhibits the reaction making the whole system autoinhibitory with respect to the halide ion. We have also shown that this inhibitory effect appears quite prominently, and addition of iodide ion in the millimole concentration range may result in a rate law where the formal kinetic order of this species becomes -2. In contrast to this, hydrogen ion has just a mildly inhibitory effect giving rise to the fact that iodine is the kinetically active species in the system but not hypoiodous acid. The surprisingly complex kinetics of this simple reaction may readily be interpreted via the initiating rapidly established iodonium-transfer process between the reactants followed by the subsequent hydrolytic decomposition of the short-lived iodinated methionine. A seven-step kinetic model to be able to describe the most important characteristics of the measured kinetic curves is established and discussed in detail.
