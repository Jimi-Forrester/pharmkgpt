32896433|t|VPS10P Domain Receptors: Sorting Out Brain Health and Disease.
32896433|a|VPS10P (vacuolar protein sorting 10 protein) domain receptors are neuronal sorting receptors that direct cargo proteins to their destined location in subcellular compartments of the soma, dendrites, and the axon. Protein sorting by receptors such as SORLA, sortilin, and SorCS2 controls functional integrity and viability of neurons, whereas sorting receptor dysfunctions are linked to acute, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we discuss molecular mechanisms that define ligand repertoire and sorting path and that control plasticity of VPS10P domain receptor expression in the healthy brain and in response to injury. These findings highlight important concepts in neuronal protein sorting and why aberrant sorting contributes to the progression of devastating diseases of the human brain, including epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and frontotemporal dementia.
