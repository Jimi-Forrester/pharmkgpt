32184570|t|Once-Monthly Subcutaneously Administered Risperidone in the Treatment of Schizophrenia: Patient Considerations.
32184570|a|Adherence to antipsychotic medications is a major challenge in schizophrenia. Long-acting injectable antipsychotics have been shown to offer advantages over oral formulations. A new extended release formulation of risperidone for subcutaneous injection was developed to address issues of non-adherence. The aim of this manuscript was to compare the new subcutaneous formulation to currently available formulations of injectable risperidone and paliperidone to determine whether the novel delivery by subcutaneous injection may provide substantial benefits. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, OVID, and Cochrane Library electronic databases to assess the advantages and disadvantages of long-acting formulations of risperidone. Potential advantages of risperidone for subcutaneous injection include a simplified dosing and ease of administration. Potential disadvantages include injection site pain and medication cost.
