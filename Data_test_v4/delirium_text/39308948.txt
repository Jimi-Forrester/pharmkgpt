39308948|a|Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence has increased in the last century which can be attributed to increased lifespan, but environment is also important. Exposure to artificial light at night is one environmental factor that may influence AD. Methods: This study evaluated the relationship between outdoor nighttime light exposure and AD prevalence in the United States using satellite acquired outdoor nighttime light intensity and Medicare data. Results: Higher outdoor nighttime light was associated with higher prevalence of AD. While atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and stroke were associated more strongly with AD prevalence than nighttime light intensity, nighttime light was more strongly associated with AD prevalence than alcohol abuse, chronic kidney disease, depression, heart failure, and obesity. Startlingly, nighttime light exposure more strongly associated with AD prevalence in those under the age of 65 than any other disease factor examined. Discussion: These data suggest light exposure at night may influence AD, but additional studies are needed.
