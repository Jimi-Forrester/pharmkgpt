39839811|a|Estrogen hormones are primarily associated with their role as female sex hormones responsible for primary and secondary sexual development. Estrogen receptors are known to undergo age-dependent decreases due to age-related changes in hormone production. In the mitochondria, estrogen functions by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species in the electron transport chain, inhibiting apoptosis, and regulating mitochondrial DNA content. Moreover, estrogen receptors may be the key components in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and structure. Although estrogen plays a crucial role in the development of pregnancy, our understanding of how estrogen receptors change with aging during pregnancy remains limited. During pregnancy, estrogen levels are significantly elevated, with a corresponding upregulation of estrogen receptors, which play various roles in pregnancy. However, the exact role of estrogen receptors in pregnancy complications remains to be further investigated. The paper reviews the role of estrogen receptors in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and in pregnancy complications, with a special focus on the effect of age-related changes on estrogen levels and estrogen receptors function. We also address how estrogen maintains mitochondrial function, including reducing the production of reactive oxygen species in the electron transport chain, inhibiting apoptosis, regulating mitochondrial DNA content, and maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and structure. However, the effects of estrogen on mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contacts have not been well studied. Based on these emergent roles in mitochondria, the differential roles of estrogen receptors in pregnancy complications are of great relevance. The paper emphasizes the association between maternal health and estrogen receptors and indicates the need for future research to elucidate the interdependence of estrogen receptor-regulated maternal health with mitochondrial function and their relationship with the gut microbiome. Overall, we summarize the important role of estrogen receptors during pregnancy and highlight the need for further research to better understand the role of estrogen receptors in aging and pregnancy complications. This not only helps to reveal the mechanism underlying the role of estrogen in maternal health but also has potential clinical implications for the development of new therapies targeting age-related diseases and pregnancy complications.
