24352055|a|Fordiae Cauliflorae Radix (FC, the root of Fordia cauliflora Hemsl) and Millettiae Pulchrae Radix [MP, the root of Millettia pulchra (Benth.) Kurz var. laxior (Dunn) Z. Wei], which go under the same local name of "Daluosan", have long been used in Southern China for the treatment of stroke, paralysis, dementia in children, Alzheimer's disease and other diseases. The same local name and similar functions always confuse users. To further utilize these two ethnodrugs and identify them unambiguously, an HPLC-DAD-ESI-IT-TOF-MSn method was developed to separate and characterize the flavonoids in FC and MP. A total of 41 flavonoids were detected, of which six compounds were identified by comparing their retention time and MS data with those of the reference standards, and the others were tentatively identified based on their tandem mass spectrometry data obtained in the positive ion detection mode. Nineteen of these characterized compounds are reported from these two plants for the first time.
