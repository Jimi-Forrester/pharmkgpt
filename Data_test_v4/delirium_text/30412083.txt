METHODS: A comprehensive search examining the association between APOE polymorphisms and PD through PubMed, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Cochrane Library databases was performed without published year limited. RESULTS: A total of 47 studies with 7533 cases and 14442 controls were included in present study. The results showed statistically significant association between risk factor ApoE epsilon4 allele and PD in Asian population (P = .003, odds ratio, OR [95% confidence interval, CI] = 1.43 [1.13,1.80]). Genotype epsilon2epsilon4 have significantly associated with PD in Asian population (P = .004, OR [95% CI] = 4.43 [1.62,12.10]). Genotype epsilon3epsilon4 was significantly associated with PD in Latin-American population (P = .01, OR [95% CI] = 1.44 [1.08,1.91]). In addition, the frequency of the genotype epsilon3epsilon4 is lower in PD group than that in the control group in Caucasian population, and the difference of genotype epsilon3epsilon4 is also statistically significant (P = .006, OR [95% CI] = 0.86 [0.77,0.96]). Although significant heterogeneity was observed among all studies, the results were shown to be stabilized by sensitive analysis. No publish bias was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that the APOE epsilon4, but no epsilon2, might be a risk factor for PD in Asian population. Furthermore, the genotype epsilon2epsilon4 may be a susceptible factor for PD in Asian population, and the genotype epsilon3epsilon4 may be a susceptible factor for PD in both Caucasian and Latin-American populations.
