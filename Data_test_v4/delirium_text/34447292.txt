The association between imaging data and patient's cognitive performance, fatigue severity and depressive symptoms is also explored. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 24 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients and 11 healthy controls were compared using high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). The imaging method includes a multi-shell scheme, free water correction to obtain tissue-specific measurements, probabilistic tracking algorithm robust to crossing fibers and white matter lesions, automatic streamlines and bundle dissection and tract-profiling with tractometry. The neuropsychological evaluation included the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale and Beck Depression Inventory-II. RESULTS: Bundle-wise analysis by tractometry revealed a difference between patients and controls for 11 of the 14 preselected white matter bundles. In patients, free water corrected fractional anisotropy was significantly reduced while radial and mean diffusivities were increased, consistent with diffuse demyelination. The fornix and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus exhibited a higher free water fraction. Eight bundles showed an increase in total apparent fiber density and four bundles had a higher number of fiber orientations, suggesting axonal swelling and increased organization complexity, respectively. In the association study, depressive symptoms were associated with diffusion abnormalities in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus. CONCLUSION: Tissue-specific diffusion measures showed abnormalities along multiple cerebral white matter bundles in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The proposed methodology combines free-water imaging, advanced bundle dissection and tractometry, which is a novel approach to investigate cerebral pathology in multiple sclerosis. It opens a new window of use for HARDI-derived measures and free water corrected diffusion measures. Advanced diffusion MRI provides a better insight into cerebral white matter changes in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, namely diffuse demyelination, edema and increased fiber density and complexity.
