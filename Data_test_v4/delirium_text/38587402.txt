38587402|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the evidence of content validity of the Nursing Outcomes "Mechanical Ventilation Response: Adult" and "Mechanical Ventilation Weaning Response: Adult", for patients with severe COVID-19. METHOD: Methodological study developed in two stages: literature review to construct the definitions of the indicators and analysis of the evidence of content validity of the nursing outcomes by a focus group. RESULTS: All the conceptual and operational definitions developed for the 56 indicators were considered clear and precise. However, 17 indicators were excluded because they were deemed not to be relevant. The definitions of the magnitudes for 17 indicators of the Nursing Outcome "Mechanical Ventilation Response: Adult" and 22 indicators "Mechanical Ventilation Weaning Response: Adult" were thus constructed. CONCLUSION: The development of definitions and validation by experts makes the use of these outcomes and their indicators more understandable and precise, favoring their use in clinical practice and providing greater detail in assessment and recording.
