35508925|t|Rehabilitation of Individuals With Cancer.
35508925|a|The survival rate of cancer is increasing as treatment improves. As patients with cancer now live longer, impairments may arise that impact quality of life (QOL) and function. Therefore, a focus on QOL is often as important as survival. An interdisciplinary team can achieve goal-oriented and patient-centered rehabilitation, which can optimize function and QOL, and minimize impairments, restrictions, and activity limitations. In most cases, cancer patients must be active participants in therapy and exhibit carryover. Patients with cancer often have impairments that include fatigue, pain, brain fog, impaired cognition, paresis, mood disorders, difficulty with activities of daily living (ADL), bowel/bladder/sexual dysfunction, and bone and soft tissue involvement. Adaptive equipment, exercise, and ADL training can mitigate restrictions on activity. The trajectory and phase of the disease along the continuum of cancer care may influence the goals of rehabilitation in that time window. QOL is often influenced by participation in vocational, recreational, and home-based activities. A holistic perspective should include an analysis of distress, socioeconomic barriers, and transportation limitations when addressing issues.
