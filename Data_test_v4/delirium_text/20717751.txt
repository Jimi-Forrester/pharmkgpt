20717751|t|Acute intrathecal baclofen withdrawal: a brief review of treatment options.
20717751|a|BACKGROUND: Acute baclofen toxicity and withdrawal can present with a constellation of symptoms making differentiation between these two entities and other potential diagnoses challenging. Baclofen withdrawal is associated with numerous complications which may require neurocritical care expertise such as respiratory failure, refractory seizures, delirium, and blood pressure lability. METHODS: Case report and literature review. RESULTS: This case report discusses a case of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) withdrawal, focusing on the differential diagnosis for acute baclofen withdrawal and reviews the various options that exist to treat the symptoms of acute baclofen withdrawal such as benzodiazepines, propofol, skeletal muscle relaxants, and tizanidine. CONCLUSIONS: Critical care practitioners should be prepared to treat this potentially devastating and often refractory complication of ITB therapy.
