19461988|t|Deletion of mouse MsrA results in HBO-induced cataract: MsrA repairs mitochondrial cytochrome c.
19461988|a|PURPOSE: Considerable evidence indicates a role for methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) in lens cell resistance to oxidative stress through its maintenance of mitochondrial function. Correspondingly, increased protein methionine sulfoxide (PMSO) is associated with lens aging and human cataract formation, suggesting that loss of MsrA activity is associated with this disease. Here we tested the hypothesis that loss of MsrA protein repair is associated with cataract formation. To test this hypothesis we examined the effect of MsrA deletion on lens opacity in mice treated with hyperbaric oxygen, identified lens mitochondrial proteins oxidized upon deletion of MsrA and determined the ability of MsrA to repair the identified proteins. METHODS: Wild-type and MsrA knockout mice were treated or not treated with 100 treatments of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) over an 8 month period and lenses were examined by in vivo light scattering measurements documented by slit-lamp imaging. Co-immunoprecipitation of MsrA was conducted against five specific protein representatives of the five complexes of the electron transport chain in addition to cytochrome c (cyt c). Cyt c in lens protein from the knockout and wild-type lenses was subjected to cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage to identify oxidized methionines. Methionine-specific CNBr cleavage was used to differentiate oxidized and un-oxidized methionines in cyt c in vitro and the ability of MsrA to restore the activity of oxidized cyt c was evaluated. Mass spectrometry analysis of cyt c was used to confirm oxidation and repair by MsrA in vitro. RESULTS: HBO treatment of MsrA knockout mice led to increased light scattering in the lens relative to wild-type mice. MsrA interacted with four of the five complexes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain as well as with cyt c. Cyt c was found to be aggregated and degraded in the knockout lenses consistent with its oxidation. In vitro analysis of oxidized cyt c revealed the presence of two oxidized methionines (met 65 and met 80) that were repairable by MsrA. Repair of the oxidized methionines in cyt c restored the activity of cytochrome c oxidase and reduced cytochrome c peroxidase activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results establish that MsrA deletion causes increased light scattering in mice exposed to HBO and they identify cyt c as oxidized in the knockout lenses. They also establish that MsrA can restore the in vitro activity of cyt c through its repair of PMSO. These results support the hypothesis that MsrA is important for the maintenance of lens transparency and provide evidence that repair of mitochondrial cyt c by MsrA could play an important role in defense of the lens against cataract formation.
