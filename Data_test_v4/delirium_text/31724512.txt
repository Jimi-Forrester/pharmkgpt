31724512|a|BACKGROUND: Various methodologies have been employed for the therapeutic interpolation of the progressive brain disorder Alzheimer's disease. Thus, beta-secretase inhibition is significant to prevent disease progression in the early stages. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to purify and characterize a novel beta-secretase inhibitory peptide from Pacific hake enzymatic hydrolysate. METHODS: A potent beta-secretase inhibitory peptide was isolated by sequential purifications using Sephadex G-25 column chromatography and octadecylsilane (ODS) C18 reversed-phase HPLC. A total of seven peptides were synthesized using the isolated peptide sequences. SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with the human ''Swedish'' amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutation APP695 (SH-SY5YAPP695swe) were used as an in-vitro model system to investigate the effect of Leu-Asn peptide on APP processing. RESULTS: The beta-secretase inhibitory activity (IC50) of the purified peptide (Ser-Leu-Ala-Phe-Val-Asp- Asp-Val-Leu-Asn) from fish protein hydrolysate was 18.65 muM and dipeptide Leu-Asn was the most potent beta-secretase inhibitor (IC50 value = 8.82 microM). When comparing all the seven peptides, the inhibition pattern of Leu-Asn dipeptide was found to be competitive by Lineweaver-Burk plot and Dixon plot (Ki value = 4.24 microM). The 24 h treatment with Leu-Asn peptide in SH-SY5Y cells resulted in reducing the beta-amyloid (Abeta) production in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Therefore, the results of this study suggest that beta-secretase inhibitory peptides derived from marine organisms could be potential candidates to develop nutraceuticals or pharmaceuticals as antidementia agents.
