38535901|t|Chemical Assessment of Drinking Water Quality and Associated Human Health Risk of Heavy Metals in Gutai Mountains, Romania.
38535901|a|Chemical data compiled from field and laboratory studies were analysed on drinking water sources from a mountain area (Gutai Mountains) in Romania. Six physico-chemical indicators, nine anions, and twenty-one metals were determined and analysed. The results of this study showed that waters are generally rich in NH4+ and NO2-, exceeding the recommended limit of 0.5 mg NH4+/L, while some waters are rich in As, Cd, Mn and Pb, but with concentrations below the limits concerning the use of waters with drinking purposes. The applied heavy metal pollution indices (scores: 0.56-47.9) indicate that more than 50% of samples are characterized by medium pollution degrees. Based on the results obtained, it was determined that geological and human activities were influential in enriching the studied waters with the chemicals considered. Emphasizing this aspect related to pollution sources and the importance of a clean chemical status that must characterize waters used for drinking purposes, a human health risk assessment for heavy metals was implemented. The results indicated that even though the studied waters are rich in heavy metals, scores related to the risk assessment of heavy metals indicated a lack of non-carcinogenic risks for As, Mn, Cd and Cu. Nevertheless, this study and the results obtained are significant at national and international levels by offering a perspective on determining the potential pollution and associated human health risks at heavy metals in drinking water sources from a mountain area.
