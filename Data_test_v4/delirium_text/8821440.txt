8821440|t|Sprouting of crossed entorhinodentate fibers after a unilateral entorhinal lesion: anterograde tracing of fiber reorganization with Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHAL).
8821440|a|Fibers from the contralateral entorhinal cortex (EC) to the dentate gyrus partially replace the input lost after an ipsilateral EC lesion. To study the morphology and course of single sprouted crossed entorhinodentate fibers, the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHAL) was used. Rats that survived for 4 to 8 weeks after a unilateral entorhinal lesion received PHAL deposits into the entorhinal cortex contralateral to the lesion. Control animals received a similar PHAL deposit. Single PHAL-labeled fibers in the molecular layer of the contralateral (EC lesion) fascia dentata were drawn with a camera lucida, and an axon-branching index (branch points/100 microns axon length) was calculated for these crossed entorhinodentate fibers in controls and operated animals. In animals with EC lesions, the density of PHAL-labeled crossed entorhinodentate fibers had increased remarkably. Single crossed entorhinodentate axons showed significantly more axon branch points in experimental than in control animals. In addition, some axon segments displayed high densities of small axonal extensions. Frequently, tanglelike structures were observed in the denervated outer molecular layer. These tangles consisted of one or more PHAL-labeled axons that intertwined and formed an axon tangle filled completely with branches, extensions, and boutons. Our data indicate that crossed EC fibers sprout by forming additional collaterals, axonal extensions, and tangles. Abnormal neurite formations are a characteristic feature of plaques in Alzheimer's disease. Future studies must be done to show whether or not there is a close relationship between axonal tangles and plaques in Alzheimer's disease, which, like the present lesion paradigm, severely affects entorhinal projection neurons.
