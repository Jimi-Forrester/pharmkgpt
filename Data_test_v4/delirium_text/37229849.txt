37229849|a|Mouse models of hyper- and hypothyroidism were used to examine the effects of thyroid hormone (TH) dyshomeostasis on the aging mammalian brain. 13-14 month-old mice were treated for 4months with either levothyroxine (hyperthyroid) or a propylthiouracil and methimazole combination (PTU/Met; hypothyroid). Hyperthyroid mice performed better on Morris Water Maze than control mice, while hypothyroid mice performed worse. Brain weight was increased in thyroxine-treated, and decreased in PTU/Met-treated animals. The brain weight change was strongly correlated with circulating and tissue T4. Quantitative measurements of microvessels were compared using digital neuropathologic methods. There was an increase in microvessel area in hyperthyroid mice. Hypothyroid mice showed a trend for elevated glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive astrocytes, indicating an increase in neuroinflammation. Gene expression alterations were associated with TH perturbation and astrocyte-expressed transcripts were particularly affected. For example, expression of Gli2 and Gli3, mediators in the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway, were strongly impacted by both treatments. We conclude that TH perturbations produce robust neurobehavioral, pathological, and brain gene expression changes in aging mouse models.
