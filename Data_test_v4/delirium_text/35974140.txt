35974140|a|We previously developed a novel machine-learning-based brain age model that was sensitive to amyloid. We aimed to independently validate it and to demonstrate its utility using independent clinical data. We recruited 650 participants from South Korean memory clinics to undergo magnetic resonance imaging and clinical assessments. We employed a pretrained brain age model that used data from an independent set of largely Caucasian individuals (n = 757) who had no or relatively low levels of amyloid as confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET). We investigated the association between brain age residual and cognitive decline. We found that our pretrained brain age model was able to reliably estimate brain age (mean absolute error = 5.68 years, r(650) = 0.47, age range = 49-89 year) in the sample with 71 participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), 375 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 204 with dementia. Greater brain age was associated with greater amyloid and worse cognitive function [Odds Ratio, (95% Confidence Interval {CI}): 1.28 (1.06-1.55), p = 0.030 for amyloid PET positivity; 2.52 (1.76-3.61), p < 0.001 for dementia]. Baseline brain age residual was predictive of future cognitive worsening even after adjusting for apolipoprotein E e4 and amyloid status [Hazard Ratio, (95% CI): 1.94 (1.33-2.81), p = 0.001 for total 336 follow-up sample; 2.31 (1.44-3.71), p = 0.001 for 284 subsample with baseline Clinical Dementia Rating <= 0.5; 2.40 (1.43-4.03), p = 0.001 for 240 subsample with baseline SCD or MCI]. In independent data set, these results replicate our previous findings using this model, which was able to delineate significant differences in brain age according to the diagnostic stages of dementia as well as amyloid deposition status. Brain age models may offer benefits in discriminating and tracking cognitive impairment in older adults.
