38252383|t|A Panel of miRNA Biomarkers Common to Serum and Brain-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Identified in Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
38252383|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive motor neuron disease characterised by the deposition of aggregated proteins including TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in vulnerable motor neurons and the brain. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) facilitate the spread of neurodegenerative diseases and can be easily accessed in the bloodstream. This study aimed to identify a panel of EV miRNAs that can capture the pathology occurring in the brain and peripheral circulation. EVs were isolated from the cortex (BDEVs) and serum (serum EVs) of 3 month-old and 6-month-old TDP-43*Q331K and TDP-43*WT mice. Following characterisation and miRNA isolation, the EVs underwent next-generation sequencing where 24 differentially packaged miRNAs were identified in the TDP-43*Q331K BDEVs and 7 in the TDP-43*Q331K serum EVs. Several miRNAs, including miR-183-5p, were linked to ALS. Additionally, miR-122-5p and miR-486b-5p were identified in both panels, demonstrating the ability of the serum EVs to capture the dysregulation occurring in the brain. This is the first study to identify miRNAs common to both the serum EVs and BDEVs in a mouse model of ALS.
