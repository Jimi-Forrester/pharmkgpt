38405854|t|Identification of retinal tau oligomers, citrullinated tau, and other tau isoforms in early and advanced AD and relations to disease status.
38405854|a|Importance: This study identifies and quantifies diverse pathological tau isoforms in the retina of both early and advanced-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and determines their relationship with disease status. Objective: A case-control study was conducted to investigate the accumulation of retinal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), paired helical filament (PHF)-tau, oligomeric tau (oligo-tau), hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), and citrullinated tau (Cit-tau) in relation to the respective brain pathology and cognitive dysfunction in mild cognitively impaired (MCI) and AD dementia patients versus normal cognition (NC) controls. Design setting and participants: Eyes and brains from donors diagnosed with AD, MCI (due to AD), and NC were collected (n=75 in total), along with clinical and neuropathological data. Brain and retinal cross-sections-in predefined superior-temporal and inferior-temporal (ST/IT) subregions-were subjected to histopathology analysis or Nanostring GeoMx digital spatial profiling. Main outcomes and measure: Retinal burden of NFTs (pretangles and mature tangles), PHF-tau, p-tau, oligo-tau, and Cit-tau was assessed in MCI and AD versus NC retinas. Pairwise correlations revealed associations between retinal and brain parameters and cognitive status. Results: Increased retinal NFTs (1.8-fold, p=0.0494), PHF-tau (2.3-fold, p<0.0001), oligo-tau (9.1-fold, p<0.0001), CitR 209 -tau (4.3-fold, p<0.0001), pSer202/Thr205-tau (AT8; 4.1-fold, p<0.0001), and pSer396-tau (2.8-fold, p=0.0015) were detected in AD patients. Retinas from MCI patients showed significant increases in NFTs (2.0-fold, p=0.0444), CitR 209 -tau (3.5-fold, p=0.0201), pSer396-tau (2.6-fold, p=0.0409), and, moreover, oligo-tau (5.8-fold, p=0.0045). Nanostring GeoMx quantification demonstrated upregulated retinal p-tau levels in MCI patients at phosphorylation sites of Ser214 (2.3-fold, p=0.0060), Ser396 (1.8-fold, p=0.0052), Ser404 (2.4-fold, p=0.0018), and Thr231 (3.3-fold, p=0.0028). Strong correlations were found between retinal tau forms to paired-brain pathology and cognitive status: a) retinal oligo-tau vs. Braak stage (r=0.60, P=0.0002), b) retinal PHF-tau vs. ABC average score (r=0.64, P=0.0043), c) retinal pSer396-tau vs. brain NFTs (r=0.68, P<0.0001), and d) retinal pSer202/Thr205-tau vs. MMSE scores (r= -0.77, P=0.0089). Conclusions and Relevance: This study reveals increases in immature and mature retinal tau isoforms in MCI and AD patients, highlighting their relationship with brain pathology and cognition. The data provide strong incentive to further explore retinal tauopathy markers that may be useful for early detection and monitoring of AD staging through noninvasive retinal imaging.
