8884593|a|The AAMR/IASSID practice guidelines, developed by an international workgroup, provide guidance for stage-related care management of Alzheimer's disease, and suggestions for the training and education of carers, peers, clinicians and programme staff. The guidelines suggest a three-step intervention activity process, that includes: (1) recognizing changes; (2) conducting assessments and evaluations; and (3) instituting medical and care management. They also provide guidance for public policies that reflect a commitment for aggressive care of people with Alzheimers's disease and intellectual disability, and avoidance of institutionalization solely because of a diagnosis of dementia.
