30988530|t|Novel reversal agents and laboratory evaluation for direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC): An update.
30988530|a|Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are no longer "novel" but their reversal agents definitely are. Although NOACs enjoy high clinical efficacy, monitoring and reversal of their effect is a challenge which this review attempts to surmount. Ideally, for NOAC activity measurement, specific anti-Factor IIa levels and anti -Factor Xa levels should be monitored (chromogenic assays), but such tests are not readily available. Modifications of the existing coagulation tests catering to this unmet need for quantification of DOAC activity have been reviewed. The available United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved reversal agents, idarucizumab for dabigatrin and andexanet alfa for anti-Xa direct acting oral anticoagulants have given promising results but are prohibitively priced. Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases were thoroughly searched for clinical trials on laboratory investigations and specific as well as non-specific reversal-agents for DOACs.
