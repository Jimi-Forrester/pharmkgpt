38992589|t|Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia found in a patient with eosinophilia for six years: a case report.
38992589|a|BACKGROUND: Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) is a highly aggressive type of blood cancer that falls under the category of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN). In the fifth edition of the WHO classification of tumors, this category has been renamed MDS/MPN with neutrophilia. Although eosinophilia is commonly observed in blood cancers, it is rarely seen in aCML. CASE PRESENTATION: This study presents a case of aCML that was diagnosed six years after the patient developed eosinophilia. The patient had undergone tests to rule out other primary and secondary diseases, but the eosinophilia remained unexplained. Treatment with corticosteroids and hydroxyurea had proven ineffective. Six years later, the patient experienced an increase in white blood cells, primarily neutrophils. After ruling out other possible diagnoses, a combination of morphologic and molecular genetic findings led to the diagnosis of aCML. The patient responded well to treatment with azacitidine. CONCLUSIONS: This study summarizes the current state of aCML diagnosis and management and discusses the possible connection between eosinophilia and aCML.
