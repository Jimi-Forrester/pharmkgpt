25371168|t|beta-Amyloid peptides and amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease.
25371168|a|Many lines of evidence support that beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides play an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia. But despite much effort the molecular mechanisms of how Abeta contributes to AD remain unclear. While Abeta is generated from its precursor protein throughout life, the peptide is best known as the main component of amyloid plaques, the neuropathological hallmark of AD. Reduction in Abeta has been the major target of recent experimental therapies against AD. Unfortunately, human clinical trials targeting Abeta have not shown the hoped-for benefits. Thus, doubts have been growing about the role of Abeta as a therapeutic target. Here we review evidence supporting the involvement of Abeta in AD, highlight the importance of differentiating between various forms of Abeta, and suggest that a better understanding of Abeta's precise pathophysiological role in the disease is important for correctly targeting it for potential future therapy.
