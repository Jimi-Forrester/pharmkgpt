38902025|t|Clinical spectrum of late symptomatic neurosyphilis in China: an 11-year retrospective study.
38902025|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe the clinical features of neurosyphilis in Chinese patients in an attempt to find clinical features that are helpful for the early identification of neurosyphilis. METHODS: This retrospective study included people with syphilis who visited Shanghai Skin Disease Hospital between January 2010 and December 2020. Lumbar puncture was performed on those who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The diagnosis of neurosyphilis was based on clinical and laboratory findings. The parameters were analysed statistically. RESULTS: Of the 3524 patients with neurosyphilis, 2111 (59.9%) and 1413 (40.1%) were asymptomatic and symptomatic neurosyphilis, respectively. General paresis was the most common type of symptomatic neurosyphilis (46.8%). The clinical manifestations of symptomatic neurosyphilis include psychiatric and neurotic symptoms, among which general paresis predominantly presented as psychiatric symptoms such as affective (66.7%) and memory disorder (72.9%). Tabes dorsalis is often presented as neurotic symptoms. One hundred fifty patients (10.6%) with symptomatic neurosyphilis presented candy signs, a rare and specific neurosyphilis symptom that is common in general paresis. Girdle sensation was presented in 13 patients, mainly with tabes dorsalis, which had not been reported in previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: Notably, the candy sign is identified as a specific symptom of general paresis, while girdle sensations are highlighted as a particular symptom of tabes dorsalis. This is the largest study describing the clinical spectrum of neurosyphilis since the onset of the penicillin era and could help doctors learn more about the disease. A comprehensive description of the possible clinical manifestations of late symptomatic neurosyphilis, particularly highlighting rare symptoms, can identify suspicious patients and prevent diagnostic delays.
