22833977|t|Design and evaluation of chitosan nanoparticles as novel drug carrier for the delivery of rivastigmine to treat Alzheimer's disease.
22833977|a|AIM: The objective of the study was to develop chitosan nanoparticles of the drug rivastigmine and to study the effect of polysorbate 80 coating on its biodistribution. RESULTS: Chitosan nanoparticles containing rivastigmine were prepared by spontaneous emulsification. The mean size of the particles was 47 +/- 4 nm. Zeta potential analysis demonstrated a positive charge for the particles and coating with polysorbate 80 slightly reduced the surface charge of the particles. A biphasic release pattern was observed for the release of drug from the nanoparticles. Release of the drug from nanoparticles was diffusion controlled and the mechanism of drug release was Fickian. CONCLUSION: The biodistribution studies demonstrated that coating of nanoparticles with 1% polysorbate 80 altered the uptake of nanoparticles by different organs.
