33111259|t|Iron and Ferroptosis as Therapeutic Targets in Alzheimer's Disease.
33111259|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide, has a devastating personal, familial, and societal impact. In spite of profound investment and effort, numerous clinical trials targeting amyloid-beta, which is thought to have a causative role in the disease, have not yielded any clinically meaningful success to date. Iron is an essential cofactor in many physiological processes in the brain. An extensive body of work links iron dyshomeostasis with multiple aspects of the pathophysiology of AD. In particular, regional iron load appears to be a risk factor for more rapid cognitive decline. Existing iron-chelating agents have been in use for decades for other indications, and there are preliminary data that some of these could be effective in AD. Many novel iron-chelating compounds are under development, some with in vivo data showing potential Alzheimer's disease-modifying properties. This heretofore underexplored therapeutic class has considerable promise and could yield much-needed agents that slow neurodegeneration in AD.
