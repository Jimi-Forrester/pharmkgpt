24423188|a|BACKGROUND: Cathepsin D C224T polymorphism has been reported to associate with AD susceptibility. But the results were inconsistent. This study aimed to assess the relationship between C224T polymorphism and AD risk. METHODS: The relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Wan fang electronic databases updated on July 2013. The relationship between Cathepsin D C224T polymorphism and AD risk was evaluated by ORs and 95% CIs. RESULTS: A total of 25 case-control studies including 5,602 cases and 11,049 controls were included in the meta-analysis. There was no association between C224T polymorphism and AD risk with all the studies were pooled in the meta-analysis (CT vs. CC: OR = 1.125, 95% CI = 0.974-1.299, P = 0.109; CT + TT vs. CC: OR = 1.136, 95% CI = 0.978-1.320, P = 0.094). Furthermore, when stratified by ethnicity, age of onset and APOEepsilon4 status, significant association did not found in all subgroups. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis suggested that the Cathepsin D C224T polymorphism was not associated with AD susceptibility.
