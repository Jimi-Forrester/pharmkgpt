36892630|t|Redefinition of dementia care in Italy in the era of amyloid-lowering agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: an expert opinion and practical guideline.
36892630|a|No disease-modifying therapies are currently available for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Europe. Current evidence from clinical trials testing anti-beta amyloid (Abeta) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in patients with early AD, though, suggests a likely marketing authorization in the next years. Since the implementation of disease-modifying therapies for AD in the clinical practice will evidently require a huge change of dementia care in all countries, a group of prominent AD clinical experts in Italy met to discuss patients' selection and management strategies. The current diagnostic-therapeutic standard of care in Italy was taken as the starting point. The prescription of new therapies cannot ignore the definition of a biological diagnosis through the assessment of both amyloid- and tau-related biomarkers. The high risk/benefit ratio of anti-Abeta immunotherapies, moreover, needs a highly specialized diagnostic work-up and a thorough exclusion criteria assessment, which should be provided by a neurology specialist. The Expert Panel also suggests a reorganization of the Centers for dementia and cognitive decline in Italy into 3 levels of increasing complexity: community center, first- and second-level center. Tasks and requirements for each level were defined. Finally, specific characteristics of a center deputed to prescribe anti-Abeta mAbs were discussed.
