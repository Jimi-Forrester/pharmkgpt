37327302|t|Global status and research trends of cuprotosis research: A bibliometrics study via CiteSpace.
37327302|a|Cuproptosis, a novel copper ion-dependent cell death type being regulated in cells, has raised concerns but lacks scientific analysis. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the global status and emerging trends in cuprotosis research using bibliometric methods. Publications related to cuprotosis were systematically retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection and then screened according to the inclusion criteria. Next, CiteSpace and Microsoft Excel 2021 were used to measure and visualize annual publications, categories, journals, countries, institutions, authors, co-cited references, and keywords to identify future global status and trends. A total of 2776 publications on cuprotosis were included, and the overall trend in the number of publications exhibited a rapid increase over the years. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology is the most common category, whereas the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry is the most active. The United States is the country that produces the most articles, and University of Melbourne in Australia is the core institution involved in this field. Furthermore, Chan Pak of Stanford University is the most prolific author. Oxidative stress and antioxidant, the toxicity of copper in vitro, anticancer mechanism, and brain injury in neurological diseases are hot topics. The research frontiers are copper complexes, anticancer activity, DeoxyriboNucleic Acid binding, inflammation, and nanoparticles. This study provides the current status and trends in cuprotosis research. It may help researchers to identify hot topics and get ideas for future research directions in this field, focusing on copper complexes, anticancer activity, DeoxyriboNucleic Acid binding, inflammation, and nanoparticles.
