37642974|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disorder that progresses gradually but irreversibly leading to dementia and is difficult to prevent and treat. There is a considerable time window in which the progression of the disease can be intervened. Scientific advances were required to help the researchers to identify the effective methods for the prevention and treatment of disease. This research was designed to investigate potential mediators for the remedy of AD, five new carboxylate amide zinc complexes (AAZ9-AAZ13) were synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic and physicochemical techniques. The biological evaluation was carried out based on the cholinesterase inhibitory mechanism. The preparation methodology provided the effective synthesis of targeted moieties. The in vitro pharmacological activities were evaluated involving AChE/BChE inhibition and antioxidant potential. All synthesized compounds displayed activity against both enzymes in higher or comparable to the standard drug Galantamine, a reversible inhibitor but the results displayed by compound AAZ10 indicated IC50 of 0.0013 microM (AChE) and 0.061 microM (BChE) as high values for dual AChE/BChE inhibition with potent anti-oxidant results. Structure activity relationship (SAR) indicated that the potent activity of compound AAZ10 appeared due to the presence of nitro clusters at the ortho position of an aromatic ring. The potent synthesized compound AAZ10 was also explored for the in-vivo Anti-Alzheimer activity and anti-oxidant activity. Binding approaches of all synthesized compounds were revealed through molecular docking studies concerning binding pockets of enzymes that analyzed the best posture interaction with amino acid (AA) residues providing an appreciable understanding of enzyme inhibitory mechanisms. Results indicate that synthesized zinc (II) amide carboxylates can behave as an effective remedy in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
