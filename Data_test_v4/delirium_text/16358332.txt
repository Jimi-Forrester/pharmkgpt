16358332|a|Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) showed decreased mRNA levels in Alzheimer's disease in a large collection of human brain autopsies from prefrontal cortex. The expression levels of three RGS4 splice variants were examined in the same samples, and the association between RGS4 gene expression and/or the disease with single nucleotide polymorphisms located in this gene was explored. We show that all splice variants are down-regulated in patients. We also demonstrate that one rare haplotype (ATAG) is associated with decreased mRNA levels in both cases and controls. Our results suggest that an altered regulation in transcription initiation may be an important mechanism for low RGS4 protein levels in Alzeimer's disease.
