38139840|t|Cardiac PET Imaging of ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) Transporters: Opportunities and Challenges.
38139840|a|Adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a broad family of membrane protein complexes that use energy to transport molecules across cells and/or intracellular organelle lipid membranes. Many drugs used to treat cardiac diseases have an affinity for these transporters. Among others, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) plays an essential role in regulating drug concentrations that reach cardiac tissue and therefore contribute to cardiotoxicity. As a molecular imaging modality, positron emission tomography (PET) has emerged as a viable technique to investigate the function of P-gp in organs and tissues. Using PET imaging to evaluate cardiac P-gp function provides new insights for drug development and improves the precise use of medications. Nevertheless, information in this field is limited. In this review, we aim to examine the current applications of ABC transporter PET imaging and its tracers in the heart, with a specific emphasis on P-gp. Furthermore, the opportunities and challenges in this novel field will be discussed.
