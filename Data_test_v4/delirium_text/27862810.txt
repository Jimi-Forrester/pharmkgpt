27862810|t|Angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism and the longitudinal progression of Alzheimer's disease.
27862810|a|AIM: The angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (ACE) insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism is considered a biologically plausible gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in cross-sectional studies. The present study aimed to investigate the longitudinal effect of ACE I/D polymorphism on AD progression. METHODS: This 3-year observational study investigated the longitudinal effect of ACE I/D polymorphism on AD progression. Clinically diagnosed AD patients with a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0.5 or 1 were enrolled in the study. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Cognitive Assessment Screening Instrument (CASI) and the CDR scale were carried out for all patients on the date of the initial interview and 36 +- 6 months after the initial evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 177 patients with sporadic AD were enrolled in this study. Among all patients, those with the I/I genotype showed a higher risk of CDR deterioration (I/I versus I/D + D/D: adjusted OR 2.103, 95% CI 1.113-3.972; adjusted P = 0.022). Among 74 AD patients without hypertension, those with the I/I genotype showed significantly greater differences in the MMSE, CASI and the CDR-sum of box scores, and a higher risk of CDR deterioration (I/I versus I/D + D/D: adjusted OR 3.255, 95% CI 1.099-9.639; adjusted P = 0.033) after adjustment for possible confounders during the 3-year follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AD who were homozygous for the I allele presented with a more rapid AD deterioration than did those who had other ACE genotypes, particularly those patients without hypertension.
