33556820|t|Generation of a set of isogenic iPSC lines carrying all APOE genetic variants (E2/E3/E4) and knock-out for the study of APOE biology in health and disease.
33556820|a|APOE genotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The low degree of homology between mouse and human APOE is a concerning issue in preclinical models currently used to study the role of this gene in AD pathophysiology. A key objective of ADAPTED (Alzheimer's Disease Apolipoprotein Pathology for Treatment Elucidation and Development) project was to generate in vitro models that better recapitulate human APOE biology. We describe a new set of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) lines carrying common APOE variants (E2, E3, and E3/E4) and a knock-out isogenic to the parental APOE E4/E4 line (UKBi011-A).
