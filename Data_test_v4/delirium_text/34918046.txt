34918046|a|Huntington's disease is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Since mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein is the root cause of Huntington's disease, oligonucleotide-based therapeutic approaches using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and antisense oligonucleotides designed to specifically silence mHTT may be novel therapeutic strategies for Huntington's disease. Unfortunately, the lack of an effective in vivo delivery system remains a major obstacle to realizing the full potential of oligonucleotide therapeutics, especially regarding the delivery of oligonucleotides to the cortex and striatum, the most severely affected brain regions in Huntington's disease. In this study, we present a synthetic biology strategy that integrates the naturally existing exosome-circulating system with artificial genetic circuits for self-assembly and delivery of mHTT-silencing siRNA to the cortex and striatum. We designed a cytomegalovirus promoter-directed genetic circuit encoding both a neuron-targeting rabies virus glycoprotein tag and an mHTT siRNA. After being taken up by mouse livers after intravenous injection, this circuit was able to reprogramme hepatocytes to transcribe and self-assemble mHTT siRNA into rabies virus glycoprotein-tagged exosomes. The mHTT siRNA was further delivered through the exosome-circulating system and guided by a rabies virus glycoprotein tag to the cortex and striatum. Consequently, in three mouse models of Huntington's disease treated with this circuit, the levels of mHTT protein and toxic aggregates were successfully reduced in the cortex and striatum, therefore ameliorating behavioural deficits and striatal and cortical neuropathologies. Overall, our findings establish a convenient, effective and safe strategy for self-assembly of siRNAs in vivo that may provide a significant therapeutic benefit for Huntington's disease.
