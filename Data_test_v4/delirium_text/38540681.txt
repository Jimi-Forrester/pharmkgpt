38540681|t|Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Intermediates and Individual Ageing.
38540681|a|Anti-ageing biology and medicine programmes are a focus of genetics, molecular biology, immunology, endocrinology, nutrition, and therapy. This paper discusses metabolic therapies aimed at prolonging longevity and/or health. Individual components of these effects are postulated to be related to the energy supply by tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates and free radical production processes. This article presents several theories of ageing and clinical descriptions of the top markers of ageing, which define ageing in different categories; additionally, their interactions with age-related changes and diseases related to alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) and succinate SC formation and metabolism in pathological states are explained. This review describes convincingly the differences in the mitochondrial characteristics of energy metabolism in animals, with different levels (high and low) of physiological reactivity of functional systems related to the state of different regulatory systems providing oxygen-dependent processes. Much attention is given to the crucial role of AKG and SC in the energy metabolism in cells related to amino acid synthesis, epigenetic regulation, cell stemness, and differentiation, as well as metabolism associated with the development of pathological conditions and, in particular, cancer cells. Another goal was to address the issue of ageing in terms of individual characteristics related to physiological reactivity. This review also demonstrated the role of the Krebs cycle as a key component of cellular energy and ageing, which is closely associated with the development of various age-related pathologies, such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular or neurodegenerative diseases where the mTOR pathway plays a key role. This article provides postulates of postischaemic phenomena in an ageing organism and demonstrates the dependence of accelerated ageing and age-related pathology on the levels of AKG and SC in studies on different species (roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, mice, and humans used as models). The findings suggest that this approach may also be useful to show that Krebs cycle metabolites may be involved in age-related abnormalities of the mitochondrial metabolism and may thus induce epigenetic reprogramming that contributes to the senile phenotype and degenerative diseases. The metabolism of these compounds is particularly important when considering ageing mechanisms connected with different levels of initial physiological reactivity and able to initiate individual programmed ageing, depending on the intensity of oxygen consumption, metabolic peculiarities, and behavioural reactions.
