22743330|a|Mitochondria are membrane bound organelles that provide cellular energy in form of ATP. In addition to ATP synthesis mitochondria are key regulators of calcium homeostasis, free radical production, steroid synthesis and apoptosis, each of these factors could also be associated with essential mechanisms involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies revealed that changes in mitochondria membrane fluidity might have a direct impact on membrane-based processes such as fission-associated morphogenic changes, opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore or oxidative phosphorylation at the complexes of the electron transport chain. We investigated synaptosomal plasma and mitochondrial membranes isolated from brains of mouse models for ageing, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Membrane properties are disease specifically altered, identifying mitochondrial membranes as targets for possible therapeutic strategies in neurodegenerative diseases.
