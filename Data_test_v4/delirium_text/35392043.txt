35392043|a|Objective: To explore the clinical application effect of perioperative anesthesia management based on enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) concept to elderly patients undergoing total knee replacement (TKR). Methods: By means of retrospective analysis, the medical data of elderly patients undergoing TKR treated in our hospital (02, 2019-02, 2020) were analyzed, and 100 patients were selected as the study objects according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and divided into the study group (SG) and reference group (RG) according to their admission order, with 50 cases each. Patients in SG received perioperative anesthesia management based on ERAS concept, and those in RG accepted routine perioperative anesthesia management, so as to compare the perioperative inflammatory factors levels, postoperative recovery indicators, and postoperative Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores between the two groups. Results: Compared with RG after surgery, SG obtained significantly lower inflammatory factors levels (P < 0.001) and significantly better recovery indicators (P < 0.05), and the pain scores at postoperative 12 h and 24 h of SG were, respectively (1.46 +- 0.67) points and (2.00 +- 0.45) points, which were significantly lower than those of RG (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Perioperative anesthesia management based on EARS concept can improve the perioperative indicators of elderly patients undergoing TKR, result in less postoperative pain, and obtain a more desirable recovery.
