39535517|a|Blood-based biomarkers continue to be explored for disease detection, monitoring of progression, and therapeutic outcomes as the diagnostic determination of Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome (DS-AD) remains challenging in clinical settings. This perspective highlights the current status of this effort. Overall, amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (AT[N]) blood-based biomarkers have been shown to increase with disease pathology for individuals with DS. Phosphorylated tau biomarkers (p-tau217, p-tau181) have been consistently shown to track disease progression for DS-AD and are likely good candidates for use in clinical settings. Biomarkers of inflammation (glial fibrillary acidic protein) also show promise; however, additional work is needed. Findings from stability work of blood-based biomarkers conducted among non-DS also support the potential longitudinal utility of biomarkers such as neurofilament light chain and p-tau181 in DS. Gaps in our knowledge are highlighted, and a potential role for sex differences in biomarker outcomes is noted, along with recommendations for determining the appropriate context of use when translating biomarkers into clinical applications. HIGHLIGHTS: An overview of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) was provided for consideration of their utility among individuals with Down syndrome when looking toward potential clinical applications. Longitudinal stability of many blood biomarkers and improvement in detection sensitivity make blood such as plasma a viable source for exploring AD pathology. Variability in reviewed findings regarding the application of blood biomarkers highlights the importance of understanding and defining the appropriate context of use, particularly when translating them into clinical practice.
