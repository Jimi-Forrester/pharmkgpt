33263220|a|The combination of multiple neurodegenerative proteinopathies is increasingly recognized. Together they can potentiate neuronal dysfunction and contribute to complex neurological symptoms. We report an octogenarian female case of multiple extraneural metastases of a rectal carcinoma. She attempted suicide, which ultimately led to cardiorespiratory failure nine days after hospital admission. Apart from the suicide attempt and late-onset depression, other psychiatric or neurological symptoms were not reported. Unexpectedly, histopathologic examination revealed prominent aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG) of all five types (subpial, subependymal, grey and white matter, and perivascular) affecting cortical and subcortical brain regions. This pathology was associated with intermediate Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (A2B2C2 score), cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Lewy body-type alpha-synuclein proteinopathy (Braak stage 4), and a multiple system transactivation response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy also involving the astroglia. In summary, we report a complex and extensive combination of multiple proteinopathies with widespread ARTAG of all five types in a patient who had attempted suicide. Although longitudinal psychometric tests and neuropsychological evaluations were not performed, this report poses the question of thresholds of cognition and pathology load, describes ARTAG affecting unusually widespread brain regions, and supports the notion that complex proteinopathies should be regarded as a frequent condition in the elderly.
