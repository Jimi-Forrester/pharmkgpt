36888833|a|A healthy 55-year-old woman unvaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 was admitted to the hospital with a SARS-CoV-2 infection with rapid clinical deterioration. On the 17th day of disease, she was intubated, and on the 24th day, the patient was referred and admitted to our extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was initially used to enable lung recovery and allow the patient to rehabilitate and improve her physical condition. Despite an adequate physical condition, the lung function was not adequate to discontinue extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and the patient was considered for lung transplantation. The intensive rehabilitation program was implemented to improve and maintain the physical status throughout all phases. The extracorporeal membrane oxygenation run had several complications that hindered successful rehabilitation: right ventricular failure that required venoarterial-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 10 days; six nosocomial infections, four with progression to septic shock; and knee hemarthrosis. To reduce the risk of infection, invasive devices (i.e., invasive mechanical ventilation, central venous catheter, and vesical catheter) were removed whenever possible, keeping only those essential for monitoring and care. After 162 days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support without other organ dysfunction, bilateral lobar lung transplantation was performed. Physical and respiratory rehabilitation were continued to promote independence in daily life activities. Four months after surgery, the patient was discharged.
