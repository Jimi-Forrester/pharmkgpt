30283709|a|Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disorder of pancreatic tissue initiated in injured acinar cells. Severe AP remains a significant challenge due to the lack of effective treatment. The widely-accepted autodigestion theory of AP is now facing challenges, since inhibiting protease activation has negligible effectiveness for AP treatment despite numerous efforts. Furthermore, accumulating evidence supports a new concept that malfunction of a self-protective mechanism, the unfolded protein response (UPR), is the driving force behind the pathogenesis of AP. The UPR is induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a disturbance frequently found in acinar cells, to prevent the aggravation of ER stress that can otherwise lead to cell injury. In addition, the UPR's signaling pathways control NFkappaB activation and autophagy flux, and these dysregulations cause acinar cell inflammatory injury in AP, but with poorly understood mechanisms. We therefore summarize the protective role of the UPR in AP, propose mechanistic models of how inadequate UPR could promote NFkappaB's pro-inflammatory activity and impair autophagy's protective function in acinar cells, and discuss its relevance to current AP treatment. We hope that insight provided in this review will help facilitate the research and management of AP.
