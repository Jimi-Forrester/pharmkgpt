37330308|t|Amyloid beta and postoperative delirium: partners in crime or strangers in the dark?
37330308|a|Postoperative delirium is a particularly debilitating complication of surgery and perioperative care. Although the aetiology of postoperative delirium is not entirely understood, recent evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease and related dementias pathology plays an important role in the development of postoperative delirium. A recent study evaluating postoperative changes in plasma beta amyloid (Abeta) levels found increased Abeta across the postoperative period, but the association with postoperative delirium incidence and severity was variable. These findings support the idea that Alzheimer's disease and related dementias pathology in combination with blood-brain barrier dysfunction and neuroinflammation may impart risk for postoperative delirium.
