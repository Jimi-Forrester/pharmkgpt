36675950|t|The Allosteric Antagonist of the Sigma-2 Receptors-Elayta (CT1812) as a Therapeutic Candidate for Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease: A Scoping Systematic Review.
36675950|a|Nearly 35 million people worldwide live with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The prevalence of the disease is expected to rise two-fold by 2050. With only symptomatic treatment options available, it is essential to understand the developments and existing evidence that aims to target brain pathology and dementia outcomes. This scoping systematic review aimed to collate existing evidence of CT1812 for use in patients with AD and summarize the methodologies of ongoing trials. Adhering to PRISMA Statement 2020 guidelines, PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically searched through up to 15 November 2022 by applying the following keywords: CT1812, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and/or sigma-2 receptor. Three completed clinical trials were included along with three ongoing records of clinical trials. The three completed trials were in Phases I and II of testing. The sample size across all three trials was 135. CT1812 reached endpoints across the trials and obtained a maximum concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid with 97-98% receptor occupancy. The findings of this systematic review must be used with caution as the results, while mostly favorable so far, must be replicated in higher-powered, placebo-controlled Phase II-III trials.
