31536750|t|Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis: The role of disturbed sleep in attenuated brain plasticity and neurodegenerative processes.
31536750|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive impairments. The classical symptoms of the disease include gradual deterioration of memory and language. Epidemiological studies indicate that around 25-40% of AD patients have sleep-wake cycle disturbances. Importantly, a series of studies suggested that the relationship between AD and sleep disturbance may be complex and bidirectional. Indeed, accumulation of the extracellular neuronal protein amyloid-beta (Abeta) leads to altered sleep-wake behavior in both mice and humans. At the same time, disturbances of the normal sleep-wake cycle may facilitate AD pathogenesis. This paper will review the mechanisms underlying this potential interrelated connection including locus coeruleus damage, reductions in orexin neurotransmission, alterations in melatonin levels, and elevated cytokine levels. In addition, we will also highlight how both the development of AD and sleep disturbances lead to changes in intracellular signaling pathways involved in regulating neuronal plasticity and connectivity, particularly extremes in cofilin phosphorylation. Finally, current pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapeutic approaches will be discussed.
