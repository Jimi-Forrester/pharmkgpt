1540543|t|Amyloidosis. Part II. Implications for neuroscience nurses: Alzheimer's disease.
1540543|a|UNLABELLED: Amyloidosis describes a group of diseases characterized by deposition of abnormal fibrous proteins in body organs and soft tissues. This disease complex is classified under the broad headings primary and secondary based on whether or not chronic infections or inflammatory conditions coexist. In addition, localized versus systemic involvement and heredofamilial considerations are used to subclassify amyloidosis. Many primary and secondary amyloid diseases involve the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous systems. This paper will focus on the latest information concerning systemic and localized forms of amyloidosis involving the nervous system with special emphasis on Alzheimer's disease and amyloidosis secondary to spinal cord injury. The roles of the nurse related to diagnosis, patient care, patient and family education and identification of support systems in the community will be covered. Patient care will be discussed from the standpoint of process and outcome criteria for specific nursing diagnoses. OBJECTIVES: 1. Describe the pathophysiological processes of amyloidosis. 2. Relate four aspects of nursing care to nursing diagnoses. 3. List four critical elements to include in patient/family education.
