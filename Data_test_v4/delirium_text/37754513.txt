37754513|a|BACKGROUND: Older people with cancer carry a high risk of delirium, an underdiagnosed syndrome due to its diagnostic complexity and often subtle presentation. Tools based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) are available to different health professionals. Our aim is to assess the prevalence of delirium in older people with cancer in an inpatient unit and the accuracy of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). METHODS: This exploratory, cross-sectional study included people aged 65 years or older with a diagnosis of cancer and admitted to the medical oncology unit from June 2021 to December 2022. The diagnostic accuracy of CAM and MDAS was analyzed against the gold standard medical diagnosis based on DSM-5 criteria by two medical oncologists. The cutoff point for the MDAS was determined using a receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve. RESULTS: Among the 75 included patients (mean age 71.6 years, standard deviation 4.1; 52% males), the prevalence of delirium was 62.7%. The most prevalent types of cancer in patients with delirium were hematological and lung cancer. The scale with the highest diagnostic accuracy was the CAM, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 86%, followed by the MDAS, with a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 30%. The presence of cognitive impairment hindered the detection of delirium. CONCLUSIONS: The CAM scale was more accurate than the MDAS pre-existing cognitive impairment in our sample. Further studies are needed to analyze the diagnostic accuracy of delirium tools in older populations with cancer and in the presence of cognitive impairment.
