39572918|t|Exploration of the Role of Vitamins in Preventing Neurodegenerative Diseases: Comprehensive Review on Preclinical and Clinical Findings.
39572918|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a multifaceted and heterogeneous group of complex diseases. Unfortunately, a cure for these conditions has yet to be found, but there are ways to reduce the risk of developing them. Studies have shown that specific vitamins regulate the brain molecules and signaling pathways, which may help prevent degeneration. This review focuses on examining the role of vitamins in preventing five significant types of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). This review also highlights promising and controversial findings about the potential impact of vitamins on this group of diseases. Several developed countries standardize daily dietary vitamin intake to meet nutrient requirements, improve health, and prevent chronic diseases like NDDs. However, more research is necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of their therapeutic benefits, including studies exploring different drug-dose paradigms, diverse humanized animal models, and clinical trials conducted in various locations.
