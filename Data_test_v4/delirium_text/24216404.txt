24216404|t|Delirium in elderly vascular surgery patients.
24216404|a|The elderly represent a large percentage of patients seen in departments of vascular surgery. Delirium is a frequent perioperative complication in this population and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. Prevention of problems associated with mental confusion rests in identifying comorbidities, their severity, and the risk factors associated with delirium syndrome. The aging of our population implies management of increasing numbers of older patients who often have concomitant pathologies and, consequently, polypharmacy. Optimization of their management rests on collaboration between surgeons, anesthetists, and geriatrists.
