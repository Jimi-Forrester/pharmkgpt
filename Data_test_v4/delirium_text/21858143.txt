21858143|a|BACKGROUND: Glutamate (Glu) is essential to central nervous system function; however excessive Glu release leads to neurodegenerative disease. Strategies to protect neurons are underdeveloped, in part due to a limited understanding of natural neuroprotective mechanisms, such as those present in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). This study tests the hypothesis that activation of ERK/MAPK provides essential protection to the SCN after exposure to excessive Glu using the SCN2.2 cells as a model. METHODOLOGY: Immortalized SCN2.2 cells (derived from SCN) and GT1-7 cells (neurons from the neighboring hypothalamus) were treated with 10 mM Glu in the presence or absence of the ERK/MAPK inhibitor PD98059. Cell death was assessed by Live/Dead assay, MTS assay and TUNEL. Caspase 3 activity was also measured. Activation of MAPK family members was determined by immunoblot. Bcl2, neuritin and Bid mRNA (by quantitative-PCR) and protein levels (by immunoblot) were also measured. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: As expected Glu treatment increased caspase 3 activity and cell death in the GT1-7 cells, but Glu alone did not induce cell death or affect caspase 3 activity in the SCN2.2 cells. However, pretreatment with PD98059 increased caspase 3 activity and resulted in cell death after Glu treatment in SCN2.2 cells. This effect was dependent on NMDA receptor activation. Glu treatment in the SCN2.2 cells resulted in sustained activation of the anti-apoptotic pERK/MAPK, without affecting the pro-apoptotic p-p38/MAPK. In contrast, Glu exposure in GT1-7 cells caused an increase in p-p38/MAPK and a decrease in pERK/MAPK. Bcl2-protein increased in SCN2.2 cells following Glu treatment, but not in GT1-7 cells; bid mRNA and cleaved-Bid protein increased in GT1-7, but not SCN2.2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Facilitation of ERK activation and inhibition of caspase activation promotes resistance to Glu excitotoxicity in SCN2.2 cells. SIGNIFICANCE: Further research will explore ERK/MAPK as a key molecule in the prevention of neurodegenerative processes.
