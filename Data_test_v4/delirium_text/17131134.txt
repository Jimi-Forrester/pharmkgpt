17131134|a|INTRODUCTION: Trazodone is a unique antidepressant, which blocks the postsynaptic serotonin (5-HT) receptors, 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C), and weakly inhibits presynaptic 5-HT transporters. DISCUSSION: Trazodone is well-absorbed by the mouth and is metabolized by three cytochromes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Clinical benefits include reduced insomnia in those depressed and/or on antidepressants. Pain may be relieved by mechanisms similar to venlafaxine. Delirium unresponsive to neuroleptics has been reported to respond to trazodone. Drug interactions are a risk due to cytochrome metabolism. CONCLUSION: Trazodone has a unique pharmacology, which may be an advantage in palliating symptoms; however, little evidence is available through cohort or randomized trials to give guidance to its use.
