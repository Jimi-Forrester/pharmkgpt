26337484|t|The nitric oxide synthase 3 G894T polymorphism associated with Alzheimer's disease risk: a meta-analysis.
26337484|a|The association between the G894T polymorphism (Glu298Asp) of nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) and risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was explored by performing a meta-analysis of case-control studies. Bibliographical searches were conducted in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases without any language limitations. Two investigators independently assessed abstracts for relevant studies, and reviewed all eligible studies. We adopted regrouping in accordance with the most probably appropriate genetic model. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of this association. We performed a meta-analysis including 21 published articles with 23 case-control studies (5,670 cases and 5,046 controls). In the analyses, we found significant association between G894T polymorphism and AD risk under a complete overdominant model (GG + TT vs. GT) (OR = 1.18; 95%CI, 1.04-1.35; P = 0.010). When stratified by time of AD onset, we found the association between this polymorphism and AD susceptibility to be more substantial among late onset patients than among early onset patients (OR for late vs. early onset: 1.33 vs. 1.02, P interaction = 0.049). The meta-analysis showed that the polymorphism G894T of NOS3 was associated with risk of AD.
