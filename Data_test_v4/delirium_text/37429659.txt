37429659|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Yizhi Tiaoshen (benefiting mental health and regulating the spirit) acupuncture on learning and memory function, and the expression of phosphorylated tubulin-associated unit (tau) protein in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (AD) model rats, and explore the effect mechanism of this therapy on AD. METHODS: A blank group and a sham-operation group were randomly selected from 60 male SD rats, 10 rats in each one. AD models were established in the rest 40 rats by the intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose and okadaic acid in the CA1 region of the bilateral hippocampus. Thirty successfully-replicated model rats were randomly divided into a model group, a western medication group and an acupuncture group, 10 rats in each one. In the acupuncture group, acupuncture was applied to "Baihui" (GV 20), "Sishencong" (EX-HN 1), "Neiguan" (PC 6), "Shenmen" (HT 7), "Xuanzhong" (GB 39) and "Sanyinjiao" (SP 6); and the needles were retained for 10 min. Acupuncture was given once daily. One course of treatment was composed of 6 days, with the interval of 1 day; the completion of treatment included 4 courses. In the western medication group, donepezil hydrochloride solution (0.45 mg/kg) was administrated intragastrically, once daily; it took 7 days to accomplish one course of treatment and a completion of intervention was composed of 4 courses. Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition test (NORT) were used to assess the learning and memory function of the rats. Using HE staining and Nissl staining, the morphological structure of the hippocampus was observed. With Western blot adopted, the protein expression of the tau, phosphorylated tau protein at Ser198 (p-tau Ser198), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) in the hippocampus was detected. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences in all of the indexes between the sham-operation group and the blank group. Compared with the sham-operation group, in the model group, the MWM escape latency was prolonged (P<0.05), the crossing frequency and the quadrant stay time in original platform were shortened (P<0.05), and the NORT discrimination index (DI) was reduced (P<0.05); the hippocampal cell numbers were declined and the cells arranged irregularly, the hippocampal neuronal structure was abnormal and the numbers of Nissl bodies decreased; the protein expression of p-tau Ser198 and GSK-3betawas increased (P<0.05) and that of PP2A decreased (P<0.05). When compared with the model group, in the western medication group and the acupuncture group, the MWM escape latency was shortened (P<0.05), the crossing frequency and the quadrant stay time in original platform were increased (P<0.05), and DI got higher (P<0.05); the hippocampal cell numbers were elevated and the cells arranged regularly, the damage of hippocampal neuronal structure was attenuated and the numbers of Nissl bodies were increased; the protein expression of p-tau Ser198 and GSK-3beta was reduced (P<0.05) and that of PP2A was increased (P<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the above indexes between the acupuncture group and the western medication group (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture therapy of "benefiting mental health and regulating the spirit" could improve the learning and memory function and alleviate neuronal injure of AD model rats. The effect mechanism of this therapy may be related to the down-regulation of GSK-3beta and the up-regulation of PP2A in the hippocampus, and then to inducing the inhibition of tau protein phosphorylation.
