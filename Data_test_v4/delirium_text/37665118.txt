37665118|a|BACKGROUND: Post-stroke dysphagia (PSD), a common and serious disease, affects the quality of life of many patients and their families. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been commonly used effectively in the treatment of PSD, but the therapeutic mechanism is still under exploration at present. We aim to investigate the effect of the nucleus tractus solitarus (NTS) on the treatment of PSD by EA at Lianquan (CV23) through the primary motor cortex (M1). METHODS: C57 male mice were used to construct a PSD mouse model using photothrombotic technique, and the swallowing function was evaluated by electromyography (EMG) recording. C-Fos-positive neurons and types of neurons in the NTS were detected by immunofluorescence. Optogenetics and chemical genetics were used to regulate the NTS, and the firing rate of neurons was recorded via multichannel recording. RESULTS: The results showed that most of the activated neurons in the NTS were excitatory neurons, and multichannel recording indicated that the activity levels of both pyramidal neurons and interneurons in the NTS were regulated by M1. This process was involved in the EA treatment. Furthermore, while chemogenetic inhibition of the NTS reduced the EMG signal associated with the swallowing response induced by activation of M1 in PSD mice, EA rescued this signal. CONCLUSION: Overall, the NTS was shown to participate in the regulation of PSD by EA at CV23 through M1.
