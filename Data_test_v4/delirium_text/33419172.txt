33419172|t|Molecular Mechanisms of Succinimide Formation from Aspartic Acid Residues Catalyzed by Two Water Molecules in the Aqueous Phase.
33419172|a|Aspartic acid (Asp) residues are prone to nonenzymatic isomerization via a succinimide (Suc) intermediate. The formation of isomerized Asp residues is considered to be associated with various age-related diseases, such as cataracts and Alzheimer's disease. In the present paper, we describe the reaction pathway of Suc residue formation from Asp residues catalyzed by two water molecules using the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory. Single-point energies were calculated using the MP2/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory. For these calculations, we used a model compound in which an Asp residue was capped with acetyl and methylamino groups on the N- and C-termini, respectively. In the aqueous phase, Suc residue formation from an Asp residue was roughly divided into three steps, namely, iminolization, cyclization, and dehydration, with the activation energy estimated to be 109 kJ mol-1. Some optimized geometries and reaction modes in the aqueous phase were observed that differed from those in the gas phase.
