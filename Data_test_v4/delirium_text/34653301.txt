34653301|t|Subtypes of delirium after ischaemic stroke-predisposing factors and outcomes: a prospective observational study (PROPOLIS).
34653301|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Delirium is a serious complication after stroke. It remains unclear whether different motor subtypes of delirium are associated with diverse risk factors and outcomes. The aim was to investigate if delirium subtypes differ in predisposing factors, clinical characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: In all, 698 patients with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (median age 73 years; 53.7% female) were prospectively included. Core features of delirium during the first 7 days after admission were examined. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for delirium were used. Pre-stroke characteristics were compared between different delirium subtypes and logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to explore the association between delirium, functional outcome and death. RESULTS: Hyperactive, hypoactive and mixed delirium were diagnosed in 28, 75 and 66 patients, respectively. Patients with hyperactive delirium had less severe neurological deficit on admission and more often had transient ischaemic attack compared with patients with hypoactive and mixed delirium. Compared with patients with hypoactive delirium, those with hyperactive delirium more often suffered from irritability/lability prior to stroke. Hyperactive and hypoactive delirium did not differ in age, sex, comorbidities, pre-stroke dependency, cognitive decline and severity of delirium. Hyperactive, hypoactive and mixed delirium were associated with an increased risk of poor 3- and 12-month functional outcome compared with patients without delirium. Moreover, patients with hypoactive and mixed delirium had an elevated risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperactive delirium is associated with less severe stroke and higher scores of pre-existing irritability/lability. All three motor subtypes of delirium are associated with poor outcome, although hyperactive delirium seems to have a less unfavourable prognosis.
