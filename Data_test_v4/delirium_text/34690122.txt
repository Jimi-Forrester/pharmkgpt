34690122|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the effect of physical activity and metabolic parameters on irisin levels in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. METHODS: Ninety-six patients with schizophrenia and 63 healthy controls comprised the study population. The participants were separated into three groups: inactive, low activity, and sufficiently active according to International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form (IPAQ-SF). We measured irisin levels using Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. We also calculated exercise levels by using the IPAQ-SF for each individual. The independent samples ttest was used in the data analysis to compare irisin levels according to the activity levels of the patients with schizophrenia and controls. RESULTS: The levels of irisin were higher in the healthy controls (p < 0.001) compared to schizophrenia groups. When the activity levels of the schizophrenia and healthy control groups were compared, the irisin levels of the low activity and sufficiently active groups with schizophrenia were found to be lower than those of the low activity and sufficiently active groups in the healthy controls (respectively p = 0.014; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Irisin levels could be affected by physical activity and these results must be supported with new studies.
