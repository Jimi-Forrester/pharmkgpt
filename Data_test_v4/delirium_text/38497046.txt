38497046|a|Biomarkers are measured to evaluate physiological and pathological processes as well as responses to a therapeutic intervention. Biomarkers can be classified as diagnostic, prognostic, predictor, clinical, and therapeutic. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple biomarkers have been reported so far. Nevertheless, finding a specific biomarker in AD remains a major challenge. Three databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were selected with the keywords of Alzheimer's disease, neuroimaging, biomarker, and blood. The results were finalized with 49 potential CSF/blood and 35 neuroimaging biomarkers. To distinguish normal from AD patients, amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42), plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NFL) as potential biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well as the serum could be detected. Nevertheless, most of the biomarkers fairly change in the CSF during AD, listed as kallikrein 6, virus-like particles (VLP-1), galectin-3 (Gal-3), and synaptotagmin-1 (Syt-1). From the neuroimaging aspect, atrophy is an accepted biomarker for the neuropathologic progression of AD. In addition, Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), tractography (DTT), positron emission tomography (PET), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), can be used to detect AD. Using neuroimaging and CSF/blood biomarkers, in combination with artificial intelligence, it is possible to obtain information on prognosis and follow-up on the different stages of AD. Hence physicians could select the suitable therapy to attenuate disease symptoms and follow up on the efficiency of the prescribed drug.
