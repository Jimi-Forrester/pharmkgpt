8239305|a|The cholinergic dysfunction present in Alzheimer's disease (AD) might be due to a specific vulnerability of cholinergic neurons linked to neurotrophic imbalance, neuroimmune impairment, and/or direct effects of beta-amyloid deposition and NFT formation in ACh neurons. The presence of abnormal epitopes exposed on neuronal membranes may contribute to the activation of resting microglia initiating a neuroimmune cascade leading to cell destruction. According to this hypothesis, a multifactorial treatment in AD should produce: 1) inhibition of beta-amyloid and NFT formation; 2) restoration of neuronal membrane integrity; and 3) control of neuroimmune auto-aggression. Since interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an APP gene promoter showing a progressive increase in body fluids in parallel with mental deterioration in AD patients, we have studied the effects of CDP-choline on cognition, several biological parameters, and IL-1 beta production in AD and multi-infarct dementia (MID) in order to elucidate whether this compound alone or in combination with other drugs is able to restore immune function and improve mental performance in senile dementia.
