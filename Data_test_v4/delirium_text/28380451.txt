METHOD: Eighty healthy male SD rats were randomly divided into normal group, model group, intensity I group and intensity II group, with 20 rats in each group. The four-vessel occlusion method of Pulsinelli (4-VO) was used to induce global cerebral ischemia. Brain neuronal morphology was observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining at 3h, 6h, 24h and 48h after modeling, respectively. Hippocampal expressions of cyclin A and cyclin E were detected by immunohistochemistry. At 48h after modeling, the learning and memory performance of rats was tested by water maze experiment. RESULT: Compared with the normal group, the other three groups had a significant reduction in surviving neurons, prolonging of escape latency and decreased number of passes over the former position of the platform (P<0.05). The number of surviving neurons and the number of passes over the former position of the platform were obviously lower in the model group than in intensity I group (P<0.05), but significantly higher compared with intensity II group (P<0.05). Escape latency of the model group was obviously prolonged as compared with intensity I group (P<0.05), but much shorter than that of intensity II group (P<0.05). Compared with the normal group, the expressions of cyclin A and cyclin E were significantly upregulated at different time points after modeling (P<0.05). The expression of the model group was higher than that of intensity I group, but lower than that of intensity II group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Moderate intensity of treadmill running can help protect brain neurons and improve learning and memory performance of rats with global cerebral ischemia. But high intensity of treadmill running has a negative impact, possibly through the regulation of cell cycle-related proteins in ischemia/reperfusion injury.
