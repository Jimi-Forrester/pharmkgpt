However, there are conflicting results and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the effect of depleting adult microglia on spatial learning and memory under both physiological conditions and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation. Our results revealed that microglial depletion by PLX5622 caused mild spatial memory impairment in mice under physiological conditions; however, it prevented memory deficits induced by systemic LPS insult. Inactivating microglia through minocycline administration replicated the protective effect of microglial depletion on LPS-induced memory impairment. Furthermore, our study showed that PLX5622 treatment suppressed LPS-induced neuroinflammation, microglial activation, and synaptic dysfunction. These results strengthen the evidence for the involvement of microglial immunoactivation in LPS-induced synaptic and cognitive malfunctions. They also suggest that targeting microglia may be a potential approach to treating neuroinflammation-associated cognitive dysfunction seen in neurodegenerative diseases.
