37640824|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common and serious neuropsychiatric syndrome among older patients, and lacks effective therapies. Omega-3 fatty acids, possessing anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, have shown potent neuroprotective effects in several diseases. The present study investigated whether omega-3 fatty acids could exert a neuroprotective role against POD in aged mice. A mouse model of POD was established to explore the role of omega-3 fatty acids in laparotomy-induced delirium-like behavior by evaluating systemic inflammatory changes, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and behavior at different time points in aged mice. Oral gavage with omega-3 fatty acids (300 mg/kg) for 3 weeks before surgery significantly attenuated anesthesia/surgery-induced POD-like behavior and the accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines from the peripheral blood in aged mice. Moreover, it also remarkably mitigated neuroinflammation and the oxidative stress response (malondialdehyde [MDA] and superoxide dismutase [SOD]) in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of surgical mice. Our findings provided evidence that pretreatment with omega-3 fatty acids may play a vital role in the treatment of POD through mechanisms involving its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may be a promising prevention strategy for POD in aged patients.
