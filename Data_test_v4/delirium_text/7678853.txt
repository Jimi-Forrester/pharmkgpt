7678853|t|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the striatum in Alzheimer's disease: an immunohistochemical study.
7678853|a|Increasing recognition of diffuse plaques has raised questions about the differences between diffuse and neuritic plaques, particularly in regard to the role of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in their formation. To address this issue, corpus striatum (containing almost exclusively diffuse plaques) and cerebral cortex (containing an admixture of plaque types) from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were examined immunohistochemically with antibodies to domain-specific sites of APP (N-terminal, C-terminal, beta A4-related, isoform-specific, and other epitopes). Striatal plaques labeled strongly with beta A4 antibodies as did cortical plaques in AD and the occasional diffuse plaques in cortex from nondemented elderly controls. Weak labeling of some cortical neuritic plaques but not diffuse plaques was observed with antibodies directed against other APP epitopes. Electron microscopy of diffuse plaque-rich striatum in AD cases revealed only rare degenerating neurites without apparent fibrillar amyloid; no changes were noted in the plaque-free striatum of controls. These results suggest that antibodies to beta A4 recognize not only fibrillar amyloid of neuritic plaques but also antigenic determinants of diffuse plaques which lack fibrillar amyloid. Furthermore, the finding that antibodies to non-A4 domains of APP labeled only cortical but not striatal plaques suggests that APP processing mechanisms in cortical and striatal tissues may differ.
