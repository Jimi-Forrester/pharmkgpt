38957789|a|HIV-1 hijacks host proteins involved in membrane trafficking, endocytosis, and autophagy that are critical for virus replication. Molecular details are lacking but are essential to inform on the development of alternative antiviral strategies. Despite their potential as clinical targets, only a few membrane trafficking proteins have been functionally characterized in HIV-1 replication. To further elucidate roles in HIV-1 replication, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9 screen on 140 membrane trafficking proteins. We identified phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) that influences not only infection dynamics but also CD4+ SupT1 biology. The knockout (KO) of PICALM inhibited viral entry. In CD4+ SupT1 T cells, KO cells exhibited defects in intracellular trafficking and increased abundance of intracellular Gag and significant alterations in autophagy, immune checkpoint PD-1 levels, and differentiation markers. Thus, PICALM modulates a variety of pathways that ultimately affect HIV-1 replication, underscoring the potential of PICALM as a future target to control HIV-1.
