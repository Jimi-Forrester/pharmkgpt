38202817|a|Evernia prunastri is a lichen widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere. Its biological properties still need to be discovered. Therefore, our paper focuses on studies of E. prunastri extracts, including its main metabolites evernic acid (EA) or atranorin (ATR). Phytochemical profiles using chromatographic analysis were confirmed. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using in vitro chemical tests and in vitro enzymatic cells-free tests, namely superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and catalase (CAT). The anti-inflammatory potential using cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and hyaluronidase were determined. The neuroprotective potential using acetylcholinesterase, (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and tyrosinase (Tyr) was estimated. The hypoglycemic activity was also confirmed (alpha-glucosidase). Principal component analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the biological activity of extracts. The inhibitory effect of EA and ATR on COX-2 AChE, BChE, Tyr, and alpha-glucosidase was evaluated using molecular docking techniques and confirmed for EA and ATR (besides alpha-glucosidase). The penetration of EA and ATR from extracts through the blood-brain barrier was confirmed using the parallel artificial membrane permeability assay blood-brain barrier test. In conclusion, depending on chemical surroundings and the concentration, the E. prunastri extracts, EA or ATR, showed attractive pleiotropic properties, which should be further investigated.
