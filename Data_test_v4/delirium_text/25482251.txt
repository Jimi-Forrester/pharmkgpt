25482251|t|Comparison of perioperative complications following staged versus one-day anterior and posterior cervical decompression and fusion crossing the cervico-thoracic junction.
25482251|a|INTRODUCTION: Multilevel cervical pathology may be treated via combined anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) followed by posterior spinal instrumented fusion (PSIF) crossing the cervico-thoracic junction. The purpose of the study was to compare perioperative complication rates following staged versus same day ACDF combined with PSIF crossing the cervico-thoracic junction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of consecutive patients undergoing ACDF followed by PSIF crossing the cervico-thoracic junction at a single institution was performed. Patients underwent either same day (group A) or staged with one week interval surgeries (group B). The minimum follow-up was 12 months. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (14 females and 21 males) were analyzed. The average age was 60 years (37-82 years). There were 12 patients in group A and 23 in group B. Twenty-eight complications noted in 14 patients (40%) included: dysphagia in 13 (37%), dysphonia in 6 (17%), post-operative reintubation in 4 (11%), vocal cords paralysis, delirium, superficial incisional infection and cerebrospinal fluid leakage each in one case. Significant differences comparing group A vs. B were found in: the number of levels fused posteriorly (5 vs. 7; p=0.002), total amount of intravenous fluids (3233ml vs. 4683ml; p=0.03), length of hospital stay (10 vs. 18 days; p=0.03) and transfusion of blood products (0 vs. 9 patients). Smoking and cervical myelopathy were the most important risk factors for perioperative complications regardless of the group. CONCLUSIONS: Staging anterior cervical decompression and fusion with posterior cervical instrumented fusion 1 week apart does not decrease the incidence of perioperative complications.
