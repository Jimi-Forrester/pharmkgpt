36617895|a|CONTEXT: Alkaloid-enriched extract of Huperzia serrata (Thunb.) Trevis (Lycopodiaceae) (HsAE) can potentially be used to manage neuronal disorders. OBJECTIVE: This study determines the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of HsAE on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells and the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BV-2 cells were pre- or post-treated with different concentrations of HsAE (25-150 microg/mL) for 30 min before or after LPS induction. Cell viability was assessed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay and no cytotoxicity was found. Nitric oxide (NO) concentration was determined using Griess reagent. The levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were analyzed using western blotting. RESULTS: HsAE reduced LPS-induced NO production with half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of 99.79 and 92.40 microg/mL at pre- and post-treatment, respectively. Pre-treatment with HsAE at concentrations of 50, 100, and 150 microg/mL completely inhibited the secretion of PGE2, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta compared to post-treatment with HsAE. This suggests that prophylactic treatment is better than post-inflammation treatment. HsAE decreased the expression levels of iNOS and COX-2 and attenuated the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors by downregulating the phosphorylation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase in the MAPK signaling pathway. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: HsAE exerts anti-neuroinflammatory effects on LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells, suggesting that it may be a potential candidate for the treatment of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases.
