28031779|a|AIM: To assess the relationship of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) with cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The study included 40 patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), 37 patients with chronic kidney disease in hem dialysis hemodialysis therapy (HD) and 40 healthy subjects. BDNF in serum was quantified by ELISA. The Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination was used to evaluate cognitive impairment. RESULTS: The patients with DM2 and the patients in HD were categorized into two groups, with cognitive impairment and without cognitive impairment. The levels of BDNF showed significant differences between patients with DM2 (43.78 +- 9.05 vs 31.55 +- 10.24, P = 0.005). There were no differences between patients in HD (11.39 +- 8.87 vs 11.11 +- 10.64 P = 0.77); interestingly, ferritin levels were higher in patients with cognitive impairment (1564 +- 1335 vs 664 +- 484 P = 0.001). The comparison of BDNF values, using a Kruskal Wallis test, between patients with DM2, in HD and healthy controls showed statistical differences (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Low levels of BDNF are associated with cognitive impairment in patients with DM2. The decrease of BDNF occurs early and progressively in patients in HD.
