36363264|a|This paper is to discuss the potential of using CuZn in an electrical biosensor drug carrier for drug delivery systems. CuZn is the main semiconductor ingredient that has great promise as an electrochemical detector to trigger releases of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). This CuZn biosensor is produced with a green metal of frameworks, which is an anion node in conductive polymers linked by bioactive ligands using metal-polymerisation technology. The studies of Cu, Zn, and their oxides are highlighted by their electrochemical performance as electrical biosensors to electrically trigger API. The three main problems, which are glucose oxidisation, binding affinity, and toxicity, are highlighted, and their solutions are given. Moreover, their biocompatibilities, therapeutic efficacies, and drug delivery efficiencies are discussed with details given. Our three previous investigations of CuZn found results similar to those of other authors' in terms of multiphases, polymerisation, and structure. This affirms that our research is on the right track, especially that related to green synthesis using plant extract, CuZn as a nanochip electric biosensor, and bioactive ligands to bind API, which are limited to the innermost circle of the non-enzymatic glucose sensor category.
