30662132|t|Effect of Dexmedetomidine as an Adjuvant to Ropivacaine in Ilioinguinal-Iliohypogastric Nerve Blocks for Inguinal Hernia Repair in Pediatric Patients: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Control Trial.
30662132|a|BACKGROUND: Bulk of published data support the efficacy of dexmedetomidine for prolongation of peripheral nerve block; but most of the studies are in adults. Ample data regarding use of dexmedetomidine in setting of paediatric peripheral nerve blocks is scarce. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adding dexmedetomidine to ropivacaine in ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block prolongs postoperative analgesia in children undergoing inguinal hernia repair. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty children of American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) grade I - II aged between 2-11 years scheduled for elective hernitomy were randomly allocated to receive an ultrasound guided ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block (IINB) with 0.2 ml/kg dose of plain ropivacaine 0.2% (group R; n = 30) or ropivacaine 0.2% with adjunct dexmedetomidine 1 mug/kg (group RD; n = 30). Time to first post-operative need for supplemental analgesia triggered by pain score >=4 according to Children's and infants postoperative pain scale (CHIPPS scale) was the primary end point of study. Number of analgesic doses during first 24 hours; intraoperative hemodynamic changes; sedation; postoperative adverse effects were noted. RESULTS: The mean duration of analgesia was significantly prolonged in group RD (970.23 +- 46.71minutes) as compared to group R (419.56 +- 60.6 minutes). Children in group RD had significantly lower CHIPPS score, and less number of rescue analgesic requirements during first 24 hours postoperatively. No adverse effects were recorded in any group. CONCLUSION: The present study concluded that combined use of ropivacaine and dexmedetomidine in IINB provided profound prolongation of post operative analgesia in children following inguinal hernia repair.
