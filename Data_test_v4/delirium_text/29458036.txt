29458036|a|INTRODUCTION: Diagnostic relevance of plasma amyloid beta (Abeta) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) process yields conflicting results. The objective of the study was to assess plasma levels of Abeta42 and Abeta40 in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), nonamnestic MCI, and AD patients and to investigate relationships between peripheral and central biomarkers. METHODS: One thousand forty participants (417 amnestic MCI, 122 nonamnestic MCI, and 501 AD) from the Biomarker of AmyLoid pepTide and AlZheimer's diseAse Risk multicenter prospective study with cognition, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and magnetic resonance imaging assessments were included. RESULTS: Plasma Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 were lower in AD (36.9 [11.7] and 263 [80] pg/mL) than in amnestic MCI (38.2 [11.9] and 269 [68] pg/mL) than in nonamnestic MCI (39.7 [10.5] and 272 [52] pg/mL), respectively (P = .01 for overall difference between groups for Abeta1-42 and P = .04 for Abeta1-40). Globally, plasma Abeta1-42 correlated with age, Mini-Mental State Examination, and APOE epsilon4 allele. Plasma Abeta1-42 correlated with all CSF biomarkers in MCI but only with CSF Abeta42 in AD. DISCUSSION: Plasma Abeta was associated with cognitive status and CSF biomarkers, suggesting the interest of plasma amyloid biomarkers for diagnosis purpose.
