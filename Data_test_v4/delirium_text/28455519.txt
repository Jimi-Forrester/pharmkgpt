28455519|a|Physiological non-amyloidogenic processing (NAP) of amyloid precursor holoprotein (hAPP) by alpha-secretases (e.g., ADAM10) extracellularly sheds neurotrophic/neuroprotective soluble (s)APPalpha and precludes amyloid-beta peptides (Abetas) production via beta-secretase amyloidogenic processing (AP). Evidence exists that Abetas interact with calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) in human astrocytes and neurons, driving the overrelease of toxic Abeta42/Abeta42-os (oligomers), which is completely blocked by CaSR antagonist (calcilytic) NPS 2143. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying NPS 2143 beneficial effects in human astrocytes. Moreover, because Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves neuroinflammation, we examined whether NPS 2143 remained beneficial when both fibrillary (f)Abeta25-35 and a microglial cytokine mixture (CMT) were present. Thus, hAPP NAP prevailed over AP in untreated astrocytes, which extracellularly shed all synthesized sAPPalpha while secreting basal Abeta40/42 amounts. Conversely, fAbeta25-35 alone dramatically reduced sAPPalpha extracellular shedding while driving Abeta42/Abeta42-os oversecretion that CMT accelerated but not increased, despite a concurring hAPP overexpression. NPS 2143 promoted hAPP and ADAM10 translocation to the plasma membrane, thereby restoring sAPPalpha extracellular shedding and fully suppressing any Abeta42/Abeta42-os oversecretion, but left hAPP expression unaffected. Therefore, as anti-AD therapeutics calcilytics support neuronal viability by safeguarding astrocytes neurotrophic/neuroprotective sAPPalpha shedding, suppressing neurons and astrocytes Abeta42/Abeta42-os build-up/secretion, and remaining effective even under AD-typical neuroinflammatory conditions.
