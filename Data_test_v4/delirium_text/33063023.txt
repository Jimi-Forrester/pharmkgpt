33063023|t|Doppler Interrogation of the Femoral Vein in the Critically Ill Patient: The Fastest Potential Acoustic Window to Diagnose Right Ventricular Dysfunction?
33063023|a|OBJECTIVES: To report the use of common femoral vein Doppler interrogation as a simple technique to diagnose right ventricular dysfunction. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Cardiac surgical ICU. PATIENTS: Postoperative cardiac surgical patients. INTERVENTIONS: Common femoral pulsed-wave and color Doppler examination associated with hepatic, portal, and renal venous Doppler measurement were obtained in both patients and before and after treatment in patient number 1. In addition, right ventricular pressure waveform examination was obtained in patient number 2. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The technique to obtain common femoral venous Doppler is described. Two cases of patients presenting with right ventricular dysfunction and fluid overload with portal and renal venous congestion in the perioperative period undergoing complex multivalvular cardiac surgery are presented. Hemodynamic waveform monitoring was performed alongside echocardiographic, hepatic, and renal venous flow Doppler assessment, and spectral Doppler profiles of the common femoral veins were examined. Those findings were useful in confirming our diagnosis and guiding our response to treatment. An algorithm was developed and tested on two additional hemodynamically unstable patients. CONCLUSIONS: Doppler examination of the common femoral vein is a simple, fast, and noninvasive technique that could be useful to rule in the presence of right ventricular dysfunction with venous congestion and help guide the management of such patients.
