39093297|a|Purpose: To explore the long-term effect of diabetic retinopathy on response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment in age-related macular degeneration-associated type 1 macular neovascularization (MNV) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Methods: A total of 45 eyes with exudative neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) with type 1 MNV were included in the analysis. Among them, 24 eyes of 24 patients had no history of diabetes mellitus (DM) in their anamnesis and were assigned to the Not Diabetic group; 21 eyes of 21 patients had mild diabetic retinopathy and were included in the Diabetic group. We considered the following outcome measures: (1) best-corrected visual acuity changes; (2) central macular thickness; (3) MNV lesion area; and (4) MNV flow area. The OCTA acquisitions were performed at the following time points: (1) baseline visit, which corresponded to the day before the first injection; (2) post-loading phase (LP), which was scheduled at 1 month after the last LP injection; and (3) 12-month follow-up visit. Results: All morphofunctional parameters showed a significant improvement after the LP and at the 12-month follow-up visit. Specifically, both the Diabetic group and the Not Diabetic group displayed a significant reduction of MNV lesion areas at both the post-LP assessment (P = 0.026 and P = 0.016, respectively) and the 12-month follow-up (P = 0.039 and P = 0.025, respectively). Similarly, the MNV flow area was significantly decreased in both the Diabetic group and the Not Diabetic group at the post-LP assessment (P < 0.001 and P = 0.012, respectively) and at the 12-month follow-up (P = 0.01 and P = 0.035, respectively) compared to baseline. A smaller reduction in the MNV lesion area was observed in the Diabetic group at both the post-LP evaluation (P = 0.015) and the 12-month follow-up (P = 0.032). No other significant differences were found between the groups for the other parameters (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Our results indicated that the Diabetic group exhibited a smaller reduction in MNV lesion area after 12 months of anti-VEGF treatment. This highlights the importance of considering diabetic retinopathy as a potential modifier of treatment outcomes in nAMD management, with DM serving as a crucial risk factor during anti-angiogenic treatment.
