30347618|t|Circulating Plasma microRNAs are Altered with Amyloidosis in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
30347618|a|Pathological changes underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) begin decades before the classical symptoms of memory loss become evident. As microRNAs are released from neurons and enter the bloodstream, circulating microRNAs may be reflective of AD progression and are ideal candidates as biomarkers for early-stage disease detection. Here, we provide a novel, in-depth analysis of how plasma microRNAs alter with aging, the most prominent risk factor for AD, and with development of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque deposition. We assessed the circulating microRNAs in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 transgenic mice and wild-type controls at 4, 8 and 15 m (n = 8-10) using custom designed Taqman arrays representing 185 neuropathology-related microRNAs. We performed a linear mixed-effects model to investigate the effects of age and genotype on plasma microRNAs expression. Following this analysis, we found 8 microRNAs were significantly affected by age alone in wild-type animals and 12 microRNAs altered in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice, either prior to Abeta plaque deposition (4 m) or during the development of AD-like pathogenesis (8 m or 15 m). Importantly, we found that differing sets of microRNAs were identified at each time point. Functional analysis of these data revealed that while common biological pathways, such as Inflammatory Response, were enriched throughout the disease process, Free Radical Scavenging, Immunological Disease, and Apoptosis Signaling were specifically enriched later in the disease process. Overall, this study reinforces that distinct biological processes underpin the early versus late stages of AD-like pathogenesis and highlights potential pre-symptomatic microRNAs biomarkers of neurodegeneration.
