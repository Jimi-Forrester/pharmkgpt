37016146|t|Barriers and facilitators of weight bearing after hip fracture surgery among older adults. A scoping review.
37016146|a|PURPOSE: This scoping review aimed to synthesise the available evidence on barriers and facilitators of weight bearing after hip fracture surgery in older adults. METHODS: Published (Cochrane Central, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PEDro) and unpublished (Global Health, EThOS, WorldCat dissertation and thesis, ClinicalTrials.gov , OpenAIRE, DART-Europe) evidence was electronically searched from database inception to 29 March 2022. Barriers and facilitators of weight bearing were extracted and synthesised into patient, process (non-surgical), process (surgical), and structure-related barriers/facilitators using a narrative review approach. RESULTS: In total, 5594 were identified from the primary search strategy, 1314 duplicates were removed, 3769 were excluded on title and abstract screening, and 442 were excluded on full-text screening. In total, 69 studies (all from published literature sources) detailing 47 barriers and/or facilitators of weight bearing were included. Of barriers/facilitators identified, 27 were patient-, 8 non-surgical process-, 8 surgical process-, and 4 structure-related. Patient facilitators included anticoagulant, home discharge, and aid at discharge. Barriers included preoperative dementia and delirium, postoperative delirium, pressure sores, indoor falls, ventilator dependence, haematocrit < 36%, systemic sepsis, and acute renal failure. Non-surgical process facilitators included early surgery, early mobilisation, complete medical co-management, in-hospital rehabilitation, and patient-recorded nurses' notes. Barriers included increased operative time and standardised hip fracture care. Surgical process facilitators favoured intramedullary fixations and arthroplasty over extramedullary fixation. Structure facilitators favoured more recent years and different healthcare systems. Barriers included pre-holiday surgery and admissions in the first quarter of the year. CONCLUSION: Most patient/surgery-related barriers/facilitators may inform future risk stratification. Future research should examine additional process/structure barriers and facilitators amenable to intervention. Furthermore, patient barriers/facilitators need to be investigated by replicating the studies identified and augmenting them with more specific details on weight bearing outcomes.
