35723376|t|Associations of APOE Gene Variants rs429358 and rs7412 with Parameters of the Blood Lipid Profile and the Risk of Myocardial Infarction and Death in a White Population of Western Siberia.
35723376|a|The present study aimed to analyze possible associations of rs7412 and rs429358 of the APOE gene with lipid profile parameters, the risk of myocardial infarction, and death in the mostly white population of Western Siberia (Russia). The study population was selected from a sample surveyed within the framework of the Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial Factors In Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) study (9360 subjects, age 53.8 +- 7.0 years, males/females 50/50). PCR was conducted with fluorescence detection according to the TaqMan principle on a real-time PCR machine. The frequency of a minor allele (C) of rs429358 was 0.13, and the frequency of a minor allele (T) of rs7412 was 0.09. In our study, the woman with the rare e1/e4 genotype had substantial aberrations in blood lipid levels. In Kaplan-Meier curves, statistically significant differences were revealed in the prognosis of survival within the subgroup of females who had a myocardial infarction (p = 0.0006): the prognosis was worse for carriers of the e2/e2 genotype and for e4/e4 carriers. Survival analysis regarding deaths from all causes showed (p = 0.0238) that female carriers of the e2/e4 genotype had a worse prognosis than did carriers of other genotypes. Thus, in the population of Western Siberia (Russia), we confirmed statistically significant associations between rs7412 & rs429358 genotypes and lipid profile parameters.
