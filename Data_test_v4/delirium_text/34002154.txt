34002154|a|BACKGROUND: Gangrenous cholecystitis is a form of acute cholecystitis which involves gangrenous alterations in the gallbladder wall and it often follows an acute and serious course. We herein report on two cases of very elderly people diagnosed early with gangrenous cholecystitis, who safely underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and both demonstrated a good outcome. CASE SUMMARY: Case 1: An 89-year-old female. She underwent abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) due to abdominal pain and diarrhea. Her gallbladder wall indicated the absence of contrast enhancement, thus leading to diagnosis of gangrenous cholecystitis and she therefore underwent LC. Although her gallbladder demonstrated diffuse necrosis and it was also partly perforated, she was able to be discharged without any serious complications. Case 2: A 91-year-old female. She made an emergency visit with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. Abdominal CECT revealed swelling of the gallbladder and an ambiguous continuity of the gallbladder wall. She was diagnosed with gangrenous cholecystitis and underwent LC. Her gallbladder had swelling and diffuse necrosis. Although her preoperative blood culture was positive, she showed a good outcome following surgery. CONCLUSION: Although a definite diagnosis of gangrenous cholecystitis is difficult to make prior to surgery, if an early diagnosis can be made and appropriate treatment can be carried out, then even very elderly individuals may be discharged without major complications.
