30590123|a|Due to dramatic growth of the aging population worldwide, there has been an urgent call for a public health strategy to manage healthy aging, with the ultimate goal being advancement of aging research. Considerable progress has been made in uncovering the mystery of aging process using multidisciplinary methods. There is a growing consensus in the field that aging traits which were originally thought to be disparate are likely to be interconnected. Thus, emerging research is needed to incorporate current findings of aging by building multiscale network models. This study reported the network of healthy aging research using bibliometric approaches. Based on the results, aging of the brain and muscle is a primary research focus which is a critical part of the multiscale network regulating the aging process. Among aging-associated diseases, Alzheimer's disease and frailty are among the main research focuses, and emerging work has focused on developing diagnostic tools for these diseases. For research on anti-aging interventions, calorie restriction, physical activity, and anti-aging pharmacology are the main interventions, of which the underlying mechanisms have been comprehensively studied in animal models.
