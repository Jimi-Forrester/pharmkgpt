33875386|a|The sleep disruption experienced by patients admitted to hospital may have a negative effect on health but the nature and magnitude of the effect has not been conclusively outlined. The review was designed to examine the impact of sleep disruption associated with being a hospital inpatient, on short-term physical health outcomes in adult patients. Searches comprised journal databases, gray literature sources, and backward and forward citation searching. Two reviewers independently screened the records. Original studies of adult hospitalized patients' sleep were included if physical outcomes were also measured. Interventional studies were excluded. The methodological quality was assessed independently by 2 reviewers using CASP checklists. Sleep assessment measures and results, physical outcomes and contextual data were extracted. Results were synthesized according to frequently reported outcomes: delirium, pain intensity, physical strength, and respiratory function. A meta-analysis was not performed; studies were heterogeneous and reporting was limited. Of 9919 retrieved records, 26 published studies were included (published: 2001-2020). Risk of bias was moderately high. Confounding factors were poorly reported. Total sleep time was either normal or reduced. Sleep was disrupted: arousal indices were high (mean: 0 5-21/h); slow wave sleep proportions were limited. Subjective sleep quality was poor. The association between sleep reduction or disruption and short-term health outcomes was negative, mixed or equivocal and included increased delirium, higher pain intensity, poorer strength, and adverse respiratory function. The impact of sleep disruption on outcomes for hospitalized patients is not well defined.
