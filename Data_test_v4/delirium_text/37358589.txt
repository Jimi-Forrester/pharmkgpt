37358589|a|Diabetes is highly linked to the occurrence of Alzheimer disease (AD), which is characterized by beta amyloid peptide (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylation of tau (p-tau), and neuron damage particularly in hippocampus. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is featured by insulin resistance, and phosphorylation of Ser307-IRS-1 is regarded as a resistance marker. Inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) are effective tools for treating T2D. Previously, we reported subfractions of Abelmoschus esculentus (AE, okra) (F1 rich in quercetin glycosides; F2 composed of polysaccharide) attenuated DPP-4 and its downstream signals of insulin resistance, thus preventing Abeta-induced neuron damage. Since autophagy could be protective, we now explore if AE works to modulate neuron autophagy by regulating DPP-4 and insulin resistance and, thus, improves the hippocampal function and behavior. We demonstrated that AE subfractions attenuate Abeta-induced insulin resistance and the expression of p-tau and normalize the autophagy and survival of hippocampal neurons. The action of AE may be attributed to the downregulation of DPP-4, which plays a critical role in mediating insulin resistance and hinders neuron autophagy. The in vivo findings reveal that the hippocampal insulin resistance appears to link with loss of memory, reduction of curiosity, and depression, whereas treatment with AE significantly improves the insulin sensitivity and hippocampal function. Noteworthy, even at only 5 mug/mL, F2 seems to exhibit a meaningful effect. In conclusion, we suggest that AE attenuates insulin resistance and recovers neuron autophagy which are regulated by DPP-4, thus preventing the damage to the hippocampus, improving recognition and emotion. AE may be an effective adjuvant or supplement to prevent insulin resistance-associated pathogenesis of AD if these results can be confirmed in human clinical trials.
