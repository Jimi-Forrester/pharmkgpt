36672701|a|The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing year by year, which brings great challenges to human health. However, the pathogenesis of AD is still unclear, and it lacks early diagnostic targets. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is a key brain region for the occurrence of AD neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation plays a significant role in EC degeneration in AD. This study aimed to reveal the close relationship between inflammation-related genes in the EC and AD by detecting key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) via gene function enrichment pathway analysis. GSE4757 and GSE21779 gene expression profiles of AD were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. R language was used for the standardization and differential analysis of DEGs. Then, significantly enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were analyzed to predict the potential biological functions of the DEGs. Finally, the significant expressions of identified DEGs were verified, and the therapeutic values were detected by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The results showed that eight up-regulated genes (SLC22A2, ITGB2-AS1, NIT1, FGF14-AS2, SEMA3E, PYCARD, PRORY, ADIRF) and two down-regulated genes (AKAIN1, TRMT2B) may have a potential diagnostic value for AD, and participate in inflammatory pathways. The area under curve (AUC) results of the ten genes showed that they had potential diagnostic value for AD. The AUC of PYCARD was 0.95, which had the most significant diagnostic value, and it is involved in inflammatory processes such as the inflammasome complex adaptor protein. The DEGs screened, and subsequent pathway analysis revealed a close relationship between inflammation-related PYCARD and AD, thus providing a new basis for an early diagnostic target for AD.
