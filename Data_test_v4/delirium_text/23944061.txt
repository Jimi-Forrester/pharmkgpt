METHOD: SK-N-SH nerve cells were processed with 20 nmol * L OA to establish the Alzheimer's disease (AD) cellular model, and 5, 10, 20 mg . L-1 acteoside was used to antagonize against its effect. Cell morphology was observed under inverted microscope. The cell survival rate was detected with MTT, and the LDH release rate was measured by enzyme label kit. Western blot was applied to determine the expression of phosphorylation tau proteins in nerve cells. RESULT: The acteoside could significantly improve SK-N-SH cell morphology, enhance the cell survival rate, decrease the cell LDH release rate and the expression of phosphorylated tau proteins at p-Ser 199/202 and p-Ser 404 sites, up-regulated the expression of at non-phosphorylated tau proteins at Ser 202 site and Ser 404 sites. CONCLUSION: Acteoside has significant protective effect on nerve cell injury induced by OA.
