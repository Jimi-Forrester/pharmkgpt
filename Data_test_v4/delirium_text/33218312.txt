33218312|a|BACKGROUND: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is a severe autoimmune encephalitis mediated by anti-NMDA receptor antibodies. Brain MRI manifestations vary and are non-specific. If there are any lesions, they tend to be diffusely or multifocally distributed. Solitary lesion is relatively rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 16-year-old girl who initially presented with focal seizures but developed severe psychiatric and extrapyramidal symptoms later on. Brain MRI revealed a solitary juxtacortical demyelinating lesion in the left frontal lobe. No enhancement was noted. Electroencephalogram captured epileptiform discharges in the same region. NMDAR IgGs were tested positive in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Corticosteroid and intravenous IgG were administered and the patient completely recovered. Brain MRI revealed a fainter lesion in the left frontal lobe. CONCLUSION: In very rare instances, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis can present with a solitary brain lesion. A full panel of antibodies for autoimmune encephalitis is the key leading to the diagnosis.
