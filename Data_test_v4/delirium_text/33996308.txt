33996308|t|Using the Decrease in Trauma Admissions During the COVID-19 Pandemic to Evaluate Compliance With Stay-at-Home and Social Distancing Guidelines.
33996308|a|Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus was declared a pandemic on March 10, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has massively burdened healthcare systems with cases exponentially rising throughout the United States and the rest of the world. Since implementing precautions to reduce the spread of this disease, emergency departments have seen a decrease in the number of traumas. By evaluating the differences in the number of trauma admissions in different subgroups of patients, we can assess where to target messaging to increase compliance with these precautions. In this study, we aim to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on trauma admissions. Methodology This was a retrospective review of the trauma database at our institution, a level 2 trauma center in Southern California, to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the number of traumas. The inclusion criteria were patients activated as traumas, regardless of age. Patients were excluded from the study if they did not have complete information in the trauma database. Data were stratified by date into two groups: (a) COVID period (January to April 2020) and (b) pre-COVID period (January to April 2019). The primary endpoint of this study was to determine whether there was a significant change in the number of patients presenting as trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic. This difference was analyzed and divided into subgroups based on age and trauma type. Results In our review, an average of 279 patients per month presented as trauma from January to April in 2019, and an average of 222 patients per month presented as trauma from January to April 2020 (p = 0.049). We found a significant decrease in the number of patients presenting with the chief complaint of fall and vehicular accident, but a nonsignificant difference in patients presenting as assaults or pedestrian accidents. There was also a significant decrease in the number of traumas in the 18-39 and 65+ age groups and a nonsignificant decrease in the 40-64 age group. It was also noted that the number of trauma admissions in May 2020 increased to 253 compared to 269 in 2019. This increase was most notable in the 18-39 and 40-64 age groups. Discussion As seen in the data, the most notable year-over-year difference was seen in March and April. In California specifically, a stay-at-home order was set in place in March, which was in conjunction with the WHO's declaration of a pandemic. An interesting finding was the significant decrease in patients with traumas in the age groups of 18-39 and 65+ from 2019 to 2020. There was a smaller, nonsignificant decrease in patients aged 40-64. This would be a good group to target with future messaging to increase compliance with health advisories. There was also a notable increase in the number of traumas in May 2020, signaling an end to the cooperation of the majority of people, also indicating that further measures needed to be enacted in all groups. Conclusions COVID-19 has disrupted social structures worldwide. As the pandemic continued, even the observers of stay-at-home and social distancing measures, the 18-39 age group, became fatigued with the guidelines and ventured out into the warming weather and summer activities. This difference in trauma admission due to COVID-19 between subsequent years can highlight the behavioral changes in our patient population and can be further extrapolated to target additional messaging to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.
