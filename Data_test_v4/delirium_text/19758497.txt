19758497|t|[Terminal phase hydration, pain and delirium].
19758497|a|Hydration of the terminal patient may relieve confusion and complaints of "dry mouth". But it may worsen oedema of the brain, lungs, and extremities, worsen terminal rattling and cause a need for frequent changing of diapers. The decision of whether and how to treat a dying patient with fluids should therefore be an integral part of the terminal treatment plan. Such plans should be discussed with the patient and the relatives, and it will very likely need to be revised as the condition worsens.
