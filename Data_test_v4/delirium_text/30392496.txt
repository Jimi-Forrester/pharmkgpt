30392496|t|The role of polysaccharide peptide of Ganoderma lucidum as a potent antioxidant against atherosclerosis in high risk and stable angina patients.
30392496|a|OBJECTIVES: Antioxidants can reduce oxidative radicals that affect the early phase of atherogenesis, that is endothelial dysfunction. Polysaccharide Peptide (PsP) derived from Ganoderma lucidum has an active substance in the form of beta-glucan. Previous studies have proven the PsP of Ganoderma lucidum as an effective antioxidant in atherosclerotic rats and shows no toxicity in animal model. This study aims to prove the effect of PsP as potent antioxidant in high risk and stable angina patients. METHOD: This is a clinical trial conducted to 37 high risk and 34 stable angina patients, which were determined based on ESC Stable CAD Guidelines and Framingham risk score, with pre and post test design without control group. The parameters are superoxide dimustase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, circulating endothelial cell (CEC) and endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) counts. The patients were given PsP 750mg/day in 3 divided dose for 90days. Paired t-test was performed for normally distributed data, and Wilcoxon test for not normally distributed data, and significant level of p<=0,05. RESULTS: SOD level in high risk patients slightly increased but not statistically significant with p=0,22. Level of SOD in stable angina group significantly increased with p=0,001. MDA concentration significantly reduced in high risk and stable angina patients with p=0.000. CEC significantly reduced both in high risk and stable angina patients, with p=0.000 in both groups. EPC count significantly reduced in high risk and stable angina with p=0.000. CONCLUSION: PsP of Ganoderma lucidum is a potent antioxidant against pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in stable angina and high risk patients.
