29941408|t|Rehospitalization following a stay in geriatric rehabilitation wards: rates and predictive factors.
29941408|a|Hospitalization in the elderly patients is highly associated with morbi-mortality. Geriatric post-acute and rehabilitation care wards are designed to provide care and to implement life project of elderly patients. Objective of this study was to characterize rehospitalizations after a stay in geriatric post-acute and rehabilitation care wards. METHODS: The study was retrospective, case-control, including all the patients hospitalized in the 4 geriatric post-acute and rehabilitation care wards of a hospital in Paris (France) and returned at home. Data collection was carried out on the basis of the hospitalization report and the information system of the hospital. Rehospitalizations were documented by the information system as well as by telephone interview. We compared patients according to whether they had been rehospitalized or not within 60 days after discharge. RESULTS: Out of a total of 1,063 stays during a 12 months period, 435 (41%) were discharged at home. Re-admission rate was 10.1% at 30 days and 18.4% at 90 days. Mean age of rehospitaliszed patients was 87.2 years +- 5.3 vs 87.9 years +- 5.8 for non-rehospitalized patients. Patients rehospitalized had more often a delirium during the prior hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Unplanned rehospitalisation is a major public health issue and should be prevented particularly after a stay in a geriatric post-acute and rehabilitation care wards.
