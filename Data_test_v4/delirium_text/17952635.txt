17952635|t|Structure analysis of activity-dependent neurotrophic factor 9 by circular dichroism and sedimentation equilibrium.
17952635|a|Activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF) is a glia-derived neurotrophic peptide, which protects neurons from tetrodoxin treatment and Alzheimer's disease-related and amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-related insults at femto-molar concentrations. However, the mechanism of the femto-molar neuroprotection by the peptide has not been elucidated. The characterization of the peptide structure in solution at molecular level should shed light in the mechanism of such extremely high biological activity. From that point of view, the secondary and quaternary structure analysis of ADNF9, an active core fragment peptide of ADNF, was performed by circular dichroism (CD) and sedimentation equilibrium. ADNF9 has also been shown to exhibit a neurotrophic activity in femto-molar concentrations; in this study it showed sub-pM neuroprotective activity against V642I-APP-induced cytotoxity in the mouse primary cortical neuron. CD analysis showed that the secondary structure of ADNF9 is identical in water and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and is independent of the peptide concentration. The CD spectra appear to be characterized most likely as disordered. The sedimentation equilibrium experiments demonstrated monomeric structure of the protein over the wide range of peptide concentration. There is a slight enhancement of CD intensity at 37 degrees C relative to 20 degrees C, suggesting a possible hydrophobic association of the peptide. There is no change in the secondary structure in PBS upon freeze-thaw treatment, which has previously been suggested to cause activity loss.
