38746636|t|Attitudes of Family Members and Caregivers Regarding Alzheimer's Disease Pre-Symptomatic Screening.
38746636|a|Background: In recent years, studies have examined the acceptability and attitudes that influence the intention to early screen for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the general population, older people, carers, and asymptomatic individuals who report a family history of AD. However, it remains unclear what specific factors promote or reduce the acceptability of pre-symptomatic screening. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the attitudes of family and non-family members as well as caregivers and non-caregivers toward the pre-symptomatic screening of AD. Methods: A total of 213 participants completed the Perceptions regarding pRE-symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease Screening (PRE-ADS) Questionnaire. Group comparisons using t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to examine differences in attitudes toward pre-symptomatic screening regarding age, family history, knowing someone with AD, influence of depression, and feelings of anxiety. The subscale "Acceptability of Screening" was developed to investigate the willingness to undergo pre-symptomatic screening. Results: Participants with a family history showed greater acceptance of pre-symptomatic screening while both caregivers and non-caregivers had similar attitudes. People with a family history as well as those with personal connections to dementia indicate a greater need for knowledge. The findings suggest that younger adults appear to perceive less harm from testing, whereas those who experience higher levels of anxiety and depression seem to perceive more testing harms. Conclusions: Comparing the attitudes of people with and without a family history as well as caregivers and non-caregivers toward pre-symptomatic screening of AD is critical to understand the differences between these groups and develop comprehensive screening programs.
