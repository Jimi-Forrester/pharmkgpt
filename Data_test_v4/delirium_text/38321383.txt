38321383|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a severe perioperative complication that may increase mortality and length-of-stay in older patients. Moreover, POD is a major economic burden to any healthcare system. An altered expression of Acetylcholine- and Butyrylcholinesterases (AChE, BuChE) due to an unbalanced neuroinflammatory response to trauma or an operative stimulus has been reported to play an essential role in the development of POD. We investigated if perioperative measurement of cholinesterases (ChEs) can help identifying patients at risk for the occurrence of POD in both, scheduled and emergency surgery patients. METHODS: This monocentric prospective observational cohort study was performed in a tertiary hospital (departments of orthopaedic surgery and traumatology). One hundred and fifty-one patients aged above 75 years were enrolled for scheduled (n = 76) or trauma-related surgery (n = 75). Exclusion criteria were diagnosed dementia and anticholinergic medication. Plasma samples taken pre- and postoperatively were analysed regarding AChE and BuChE activity. Furthermore, perioperative assessment using different cognitive tests was performed. The type of anaesthesia (general vs. spinal anaesthesia) was analysed. Primary outcome was the incidence of POD assessed by the approved Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) in combination with the expression of AChE and BuChE. RESULTS: Of 151 patients included, 38 (25.2%) suffered from POD; 11 (14%) in scheduled and 27 (36%) in emergency patients. AChE levels showed no difference throughout groups or time course. Trauma patients had lower BuChE levels prior to surgery than scheduled patients (p < 0.001). Decline in BuChE levels correlated positively with the incidence of POD (1669 vs. 1175 U/l; p < 0.001). Emergency patients with BuChE levels below 1556 U/L were at highest risk for POD. There were no differences regarding length of stay between groups or incidence of POD. The type of anaesthesia had no influence regarding the incidence of POD. Only Charlson Comorbidity Index and Mini Nutrition Assessment demonstrated reliable strength in respect of POD. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative measurement of BuChE activity can be used as a tool to identify patients at risk of POD. As a point-of-care test, quick results may alter the patients' course prior to the development of POD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://drks.de/search/de/trial/DRKS00017178 .
