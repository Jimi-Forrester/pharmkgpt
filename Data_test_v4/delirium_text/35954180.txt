35954180|t|Versatile Triad Alliance: Bile Acid, Taurine and Microbiota.
35954180|a|Taurine is the most abundant free amino acid in the body, and is mainly derived from the diet, but can also be produced endogenously from cysteine. It plays multiple essential roles in the body, including development, energy production, osmoregulation, prevention of oxidative stress, and inflammation. Taurine is also crucial as a molecule used to conjugate bile acids (BAs). In the gastrointestinal tract, BAs deconjugation by enteric bacteria results in high levels of unconjugated BAs and free taurine. Depending on conjugation status and other bacterial modifications, BAs constitute a pool of related but highly diverse molecules, each with different properties concerning solubility and toxicity, capacity to activate or inhibit receptors of BAs, and direct and indirect impact on microbiota and the host, whereas free taurine has a largely protective impact on the host, serves as a source of energy for microbiota, regulates bacterial colonization and defends from pathogens. Several remarkable examples of the interaction between taurine and gut microbiota have recently been described. This review will introduce the necessary background information and lay out the latest discoveries in the interaction of the co-reliant triad of BAs, taurine, and microbiota.
