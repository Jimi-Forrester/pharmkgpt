38892958|a|Introduction: The relationship between psychiatric disorders, including depression, and invasive interventions has been a topic of debate in recent literature. While these conditions can impact the quality of life and subjective perceptions of surgical outcomes, the literature lacks consensus regarding the association between depression and objective perioperative medical and surgical complications, especially in the neurosurgical domain. Methods: MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were queried in a comprehensive manner from inception until 10 November 2023, with no language restrictions, for citations investigating the association between depression and length of hospitalization, medical and surgical complications, and objective postoperative outcomes including readmission, reoperation, and non-routine discharge in patients undergoing spine surgery. Results: A total of 26 articles were considered in this systematic review. Upon pooled analysis of the primary outcome, statistically significantly higher rates were observed for several complications, including delirium (OR:1.92), deep vein thrombosis (OR:3.72), fever (OR:6.34), hematoma formation (OR:4.7), hypotension (OR:4.32), pulmonary embolism (OR:3.79), neurological injury (OR:6.02), surgical site infection (OR:1.36), urinary retention (OR:4.63), and urinary tract infection (OR:1.72). While readmission (OR:1.35) and reoperation (OR:2.22) rates, as well as non-routine discharge (OR:1.72) rates, were significantly higher in depressed patients, hospitalization length was comparable to non-depressed controls. Conclusions: The results of this review emphasize the significant increase in complications and suboptimal outcomes noted in patients with depression undergoing spinal surgery. Although a direct causal relationship may not be established, addressing psychiatric aspects in patient care is crucial for providing comprehensive medical attention.
