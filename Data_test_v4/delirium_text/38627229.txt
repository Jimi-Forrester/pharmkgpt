38627229|t|Survey of the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices of Neurologists Regarding Exercise in Parkinson's Disease.
38627229|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Exercise and physiotherapy can exert potentially beneficial effects on the motor and nonmotor features of Parkinson's disease (PD). We conducted an e-mail survey to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of neurologists regarding exercise among patients with PD. METHODS: A total of 222 neurologists from the Korean Movement Disorder Society and the Korean Society of Neurologists completed the survey and were classified into 4 clusters using the k-means clustering algorithm based on their institute types, the proportions of PD patients in their clinics, and the number of years working as neurologists. RESULTS: Specialists working at referral hospitals (Clusters 1 and 2) were more confident than general neurologists (Clusters 3 and 4) about exercise improving the general motor features of PD. Specialists recommended more-frequent intense exercise compared with physicians not working at referral hospitals. The specialists in Cluster 1, representing >50% of PD patients in the clinics at referral hospitals, recommended exercise regardless of the disease stage, whereas the general neurologists in Clusters 3 and 4 recommended low-intensity exercise at an early stage of disease. Although most of the respondents agreed with the need for PD patients to exercise, less than half had prescribed rehabilitation or physiotherapy. More than 90% of the respondents answered that developing an exercise/physiotherapy protocol for PD would be helpful. CONCLUSIONS: Specialists were more confident than general neurologists about the effect of exercise and recommended more-intense activities regardless of the disease stage. These results highlight the need to develop clinical practice guidelines and PD-specialized exercise protocols to provide optimal care for PD patients.
