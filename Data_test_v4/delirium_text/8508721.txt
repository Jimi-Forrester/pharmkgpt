8508721|a|Cytosolic free Ca2+ functions as a main regulator of numerous cellular processes, including those implicated in synthesis, release and responsiveness of hormones and neurotransmitters are discussed. To examine whether a change in the intracellular free calcium ion concentration [Ca2+]i occurs associated with delirium tremens and related states we compared [Ca2+]i in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of alcoholic patients under withdrawal with that of non-alcoholic patients and of healthy controls. [Ca2+]i in PBMC of alcoholic patients was significantly higher (P < 0.001) compared to both control groups, suggesting that changes in [Ca2+]i may be relevant to increased excitability of the central nervous system. Increased [Ca2+]i in PBMC might be diagnostically valuable as a biological marker of alcohol dependency.
