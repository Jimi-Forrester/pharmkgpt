29106038|t|The physical approximation of APP and BACE-1: A key event in alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
29106038|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of insoluble deposits of Amyloid beta (Abeta) in brains. Abeta is derived by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site secretase enzyme (BACE-1) and gamma-secretase. Proteolytic processing of APP by BACE-1 is the rate-limiting step in Abeta production, and this pathway is a prime target for AD drug development. Both APP and BACE-1 are membrane-spanning proteins, transported via secretory and endocytic pathways; and the physical interaction of APP and BACE-1 during trafficking is a key cell biological event initiating the amyloidogenic pathway. Here, we highlight recent research on intracellular trafficking/sorting of APP and BACE-1, and discuss how dysregulation of these pathways might lead to enhanced convergence of APP and BACE-1, and subsequent beta-cleavage of APP.   2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
