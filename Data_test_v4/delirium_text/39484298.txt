39484298|a|Dementia involves several factors, and it is required to administer an agent with several efficiencies for its treatment. Sake is known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and improves the serum concentration of BDNF. This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective action of Japanese sake yeast on dementia of the Alzheimer disease type in rats by behavioral evaluation and neurobiochemical assessment. The rats were grouped as non-Alzheimer rats (control rats) and Alzheimer rats administrated with 0 (AD), 10 (10-AD), 20 (20-AD), 30 (30-AD), and 40 mg/kg (40-AD) of sake. Anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors, the concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), malondialdehyde (MDA), and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) were evaluated. The expressions of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 were assessed. The results showed that Alzheimer disease caused anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors (p = 0.000), decreased the concentrations of BDNF (p = 0.000) and FRAP (p = 0.000), increased the concentration of MDA (p = 0.000), and increased the expressions of IL-1beta (p = 0.000), TNF-alpha (p = 0.000), and IL-6 (p = 0.000). The results showed that oral gavage of sake in higher doses decreased anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors (p = 0.000), increased the concentrations of BDNF (p = 0.000) and FRAP (p = 0.000), and reduced the concentration of MDA (p = 0.000) and the expressions of IL-1beta (p = 0.000), TNF-alpha (p = 0.000), and IL-6 (p = 0.000). In sum, Japanese sake yeast can have roles in treating dementia of the Alzheimer disease type, but its mechanisms must be assessed in future studies.
