39472479|a|Engineered biological neural networks are indispensable models for investigation of neural function and dysfunction from the subcellular to the network level. Notably, advanced neuroengineering approaches are of significant interest for their potential to replicate the topological and functional organization of brain networks. In this study, we reverse engineered feedforward neural networks of primary cortical and hippocampal neurons, using a custom-designed multinodal microfluidic device with Tesla valve inspired microtunnels. By interfacing this device with nanoporous microelectrodes, we show that the reverse engineered multinodal neural networks exhibit capacity for both segregated and integrated functional activity, mimicking brain network dynamics. To advocate the broader applicability of our model system, we induced localized perturbations with amyloid beta to study the impact of pathology on network functionality. Additionally, we demonstrate long-term culturing of subregion- and layer specific neurons extracted from the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus of adult Alzheimer's-model mice and rats. Our results thus highlight the potential of our approach for reverse engineering of anatomically relevant multinodal neural networks to study dynamic structure-function relationships in both healthy and pathological conditions.
