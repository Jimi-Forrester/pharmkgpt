35622461|t|Increasing the Cognitive Screening Efficiency of Global Phase III Trials in Early Alzheimer Disease: The Cognitive Task Force.
35622461|a|PURPOSE: A Cognitive Task Force (CTF) was established for the MissionAD program with the aim of reducing the screen failure (SF) rate to ~30% and thereby reduce unnecessary subject burden, site burden, and excess trial costs. METHODS/SUBJECTS: The MissionAD program consisted of 2 global phase 3 studies evaluating the BACE inhibitor elenbecestat in subjects with early Alzheimer disease. The CTF monitored and engaged with MissionAD clinical sites to provide support through collegial discussions to maximize the efficiency of the preconsent recruitment phase. RESULTS: The CTF significantly improved cognitive screening efficiency in the MissionAD program, with a 24% decline in cognitive SF rate for the sites that the CTF contacted. The study-wide 11.5% reduction in cognitive SF rates were likely further driven by wider country-level initiatives in which CTF members held CTF-specific Investigator meetings with the recruitment staff, speaking to all sites on a country level regardless of their recruitment performance. CONCLUSIONS: The establishment of a CTF to support efficient cognitive screening is highly recommended for future Alzheimer disease studies. Additional benefits included improved site relationships, increased engagement in MissionAD and access to a group of cognitive experts for consulting, with a focus on achieving more efficient trial recruitment.
