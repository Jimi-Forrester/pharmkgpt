34503506|a|BACKGROUND: The microtubule-associated protein tau forms aggregates in different neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies. Prior work has shown that a single P301L mutation in tau gene, MAPT, can promote alternative tau folding pathways that correlate with divergent clinical diagnoses. Using progressive chemical denaturation, some tau preparations from the brain featured complex transitions starting at low concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) denaturant, indicating an ensemble of differently folded tau species called conformers. On the other hand, brain samples with abundant, tangle-like pathology had simple GdnHCl unfolding profile resembling the profile of fibrillized recombinant tau and suggesting a unitary conformer composition. In studies here we sought to understand tau conformer progression and potential relationships with condensed liquid states, as well as associated perturbations in cell biological processes. RESULTS: As starting material, we used brain samples from P301L transgenic mice containing tau conformer ensembles that unfolded at low GdnHCl concentrations and with signatures resembling brain material from P301L subjects presenting with language or memory problems. We seeded reporter cells expressing a soluble form of 4 microtubule-binding repeat tau fused to GFP or YFP reporter moieties, resulting in redistribution of dispersed fluorescence signals into focal assemblies that could fuse together and move within processes between adjacent cells. Nuclear envelope fluorescent tau signals and small fluorescent inclusions behaved as a demixed liquid phase, indicative of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS); these droplets exhibited spherical morphology, fusion events and could recover from photobleaching. Moreover, juxtanuclear tau assemblies were associated with disrupted nuclear transport and reduced cell viability in a stable cell line. Staining for thioflavin S (ThS) became more prevalent as tau-derived inclusions attained cross-sectional area greater than 3 mum2, indicating (i) a bipartite composition, (ii) in vivo progression of tau conformers, and (iii) that a mass threshold applying to demixed condensates may drive liquid-solid transitions. CONCLUSIONS: Tau conformer ensembles characterized by denaturation at low GdnHCl concentration templated the production of condensed droplets in living cells. These species exhibit dynamic changes and develop in vivo, and the larger ThS-positive assemblies may represent a waystation to arrive at intracellular fibrillar tau inclusions seen in end-stage genetic tauopathies.
