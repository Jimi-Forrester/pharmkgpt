32725777|a|Since 1989, four Canadian Consensus Conferences on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia (CCCDTD) have provided evidence-based dementia guidelines for Canadian clinicians and researchers. We present the results of the 5th CCCDTD, which convened in October 2019, to address topics chosen by the steering committee to reflect advances in the field, and build on previous guidelines. Topics included: (1) utility of the National Institute on Aging research framework for clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis; (2) updating diagnostic criteria for vascular cognitive impairment, and its management; (3) dementia case finding and detection; (4) neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers in diagnosis; (5) use of non-cognitive markers of dementia for better dementia detection; (6) risk reduction/prevention; (7) psychosocial and non-pharmacological interventions; and (8) deprescription of medications used to treat dementia. We hope the guidelines are useful for clinicians, researchers, policy makers, and the lay public, to inform a current and evidence-based approach to dementia.
