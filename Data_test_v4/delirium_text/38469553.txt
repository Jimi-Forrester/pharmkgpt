38469553|a|INTRODUCTION: In September 2022, The Jackson Laboratory Center for Alzheimer's and Dementia Research (JAX CADR) hosted a workshop with leading researchers in the Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) field. METHODS: During the workshop, the participants brainstormed new directions to overcome current barriers to providing patients with effective ADRD therapeutics. The participants outlined specific areas of focus. Following the workshop, each group used standard literature search methods to provide background for each topic. RESULTS: The team of invited experts identified four key areas that can be collectively addressed to make a significant impact in the field: (1) Prioritize the diversification of disease targets, (2) enhance factors promoting resilience, (3) de-risk clinical pipeline, and (4) centralize data management. DISCUSSION: In this report, we review these four objectives and propose innovations to expedite ADRD therapeutic pipelines.
