30405996|t|Prolonged Post-electroconvulsive Therapy Delirium: An Unusual Presentation.
30405996|a|Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective but underutilized modality for the treatment of depression unresponsive to antidepressants. Mild to moderate cognitive impairment is a commonly encountered adverse effect but it normally resolves within hours. We report a case of post-ECT delirium lasting over a course of 14 days with succeeding sessions. Modification of ECT protocol by spacing the intervals of subsequent sessions and switching from bilateral brief pulse to unilateral ultra-brief pulse was found to be effective in reducing the confusion.
