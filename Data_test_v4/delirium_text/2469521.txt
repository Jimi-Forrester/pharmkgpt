2469521|a|Identification of the neuronal components incorporated into the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer disease has primarily been derived from immunocytochemical procedures. Previous antibody studies have been able to directly determine the shared epitopes of known neuronal proteins with neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) only when the appropriate monoclonal antibodies were available. In this study, we use an immuno-affinity purification protocol to directly determine the properties of the epitopes recognized by two antisera which recognize NFT. Characterization of the purified antibodies demonstrates that NFT share epitopes with the two heavier neurofilament subunits. NFH and NFM, as well as MAP2 and tau. Further, this method indicates that the epitopes shared with neurofilaments and tau are distinct from each other.
