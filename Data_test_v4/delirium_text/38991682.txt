38991682|t|Modulation of brain activity in brain-injured patients with a disorder of consciousness in intensive care with repeated 10-Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS): a randomised controlled trial protocol.
38991682|a|INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic interventions for disorders of consciousness lack consistency; evidence supports non-invasive brain stimulation, but few studies assess neuromodulation in acute-to-subacute brain-injured patients. This study aims to validate the feasibility and assess the effect of a multi-session transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) intervention in subacute brain-injured patients on recovery of consciousness, related brain oscillations and brain network dynamics. METHODS AND ANALYSES: The study is comprised of two phases: a validation phase (n=12) and a randomised controlled trial (n=138). Both phases will be conducted in medically stable brain-injured adult patients (traumatic brain injury and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy), with a Glasgow Coma Scale score <=12 after continuous sedation withdrawal. Recruitment will occur at the intensive care unit of a Level 1 Trauma Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The intervention includes a 20 min 10 Hz tACS at 1 mA intensity or a sham session over parieto-occipital cortical sites, repeated over five consecutive days. The current's frequency targets alpha brain oscillations (8-13 Hz), known to be associated with consciousness. Resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) will be recorded four times daily for five consecutive days: pre and post-intervention, at 60 and 120 min post-tACS. Two additional recordings will be included: 24 hours and 1-week post-protocol. Multimodal measures (blood samples, pupillometry, behavioural consciousness assessments (Coma Recovery Scale-revised), actigraphy measures) will be acquired from baseline up to 1 week after the stimulation. EEG signal analysis will focus on the alpha bandwidth (8-13 Hz) using spectral and functional network analyses. Phone assessments at 3, 6 and 12 months post-tACS, will measure long-term functional recovery, quality of life and caregivers' burden. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for this study has been granted by the Research Ethics Board of the CIUSSS du Nord-de-l'Ile-de-Montreal (Project ID 2021-2279). The findings of this two-phase study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed academic journal and submitted for presentation at conferences. The trial's results will be published on a public trial registry database (ClinicalTrials.gov). TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05833568.
