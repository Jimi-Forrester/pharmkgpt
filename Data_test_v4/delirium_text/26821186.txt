26821186|a|The present preclinical study was designed to examine the effects of prolonged Ropren  administration (8.6 mg/kg, orally, once daily, 28 days) in a beta-amyloid (25-35) rat model of Alzheimer's disease following gonadectomy. The experimental model was created by intracerebroventricular injection of beta-amyloid (25-35) into gonadectomized (GDX) rats and GDX rats with testosterone propionate (TP, 0.5mg/kg, subcutaneous, once daily, 28 days) supplementation. Ropren  was administered to the GDX rats and GDX rats treated with TP. Memory performance was assessed using the passive avoidance and the Morris water maze tests and the spontaneous locomotor activity was assessed using the open field test. Treatment with Ropren  significantly improved and restored the cognitive ability of GDX rats with beta-amyloid (25-35)-induced amnesia in the passive avoidance test and Morris water maze. Co-administration of Ropren  with TP exerted a markedly synergistic memory-enhancing effect in the GDX rats with beta-amyloid (25-35)-induced amnesia on the same models of memory testing. Ropren  administered alone or together with TP significantly enhanced crossing, frequency of rearing and grooming of the GDX rats with beta-amyloid (25-35)-induced amnesia in the open field test. These results indicate that Ropren  has a marked memory-enhancing action in the experimental model of Alzheimer's disease in male rats with altered levels of androgens.
