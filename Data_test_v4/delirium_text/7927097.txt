7927097|t|[Alcoholic delirium--a potentially life-threatening condition].
7927097|a|Full-blown alcoholic delirium is characterised by the symptoms of an exogenous psychosis and signs of vegetative dysregulation. Organic brain disease may initiate its development. The pathogenesis of the condition remains hypothetical. Therapeutic drugs of first choice have long been clomethiazole and benzodiazepines. Basic sedative treatment may be usefully supplemented by highly potent neuroleptic agents. This, together with improvements in intensive medical care, has reduced the mortality rate to 3 to 8%. Concomitant organic diseases may complicate and prolong the condition. A defective state is a possible outcome.
