37936169|a|Neuroinflammation is an important biological process induced by complex interactions between immune cells and neuronal cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Recent research on the bidirectional communication between neuronal and immunological systems has provided evidence for how immune and inflammatory processes are regulated by nerve activation. One example is the gateway reflex, in which immune cells bypass the blood brain barrier and infiltrate the CNS to cause neuroinflammation. We have found several modes of the gateway reflex in mouse models, in which gateways for immune cells are established at specific blood vessels in the spinal cords and brain in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and systemic lupus erythematosus models, at retinal blood vessels in an experimental autoimmune uveitis model, and the ankle joints in an inflammatory arthritis model. Several environmental stimulations, including physical and psychological stresses, activate neurological pathways that alter immunological responses via the gateway reflex, thus contributing to the development/suppression of autoimmune diseases. In the manuscript, we describe the discovery of the gateway reflex and recent insights on how they regulate disease development. We hypothesize that artificial manipulation of specific neural pathways can establish and/or close the gateways to control the development of autoimmune diseases.
