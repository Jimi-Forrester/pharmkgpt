32353061|t|Pulse wave velocity is a new predictor of acute kidney injury development after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.
32353061|a|BACKGROUND: Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) is the simple, non-invasive, gold-standard method for assessing arterial stiffness. However, baPWV has been shown to be associated with renal dyfunction, with a few reports demonstrating an association between baPWV and postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) among surgical patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed preoperative baPWV data that were prospectively collected from 164 patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) between April 2013 and July 2019 (mean age: 66.2 +- 10.3 years, 29.3% females). Primarily, baPWV was investigated as an independent predictor of postoperative AKI development; secondarily, the patients were divided into high and low PWV groups according to the optimal baPWV cut-off value. Postoperative complications, mortality, and mid-term survival were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: AKI developed in 30 patients (18.3%). Univariate analysis showed that AKI was significantly associated with baPWV (20.2+-7.3 vs. 16.2+-2.8 m/s, p < 0.001), age, preoperative serum creatinine, and EuroSCORE. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed baPWV as independently associated with postoperative AKI even after adjustment for preoperative creatinine, old age (> 75 years), hypertension, diabetes under insulin therapy, and EuroSCORE. Moreover, area under the curve (AUC) analysis indicated that PWV can predict AKI better than preoperative creatinine levels (AUC, 0.781 [95% confidence interval, 0.688-0.874] vs. 0.680 [0.568-0.792]). The group-dividing baPWV cut-off value for AKI was 19 m/s. There were no 30-day mortality. The in-hospital mortality rates in the high and the low PWV groups were 2.2% (n = 1) and 0.8% (n = 1), respectively (p = 0.484). Midterm survival rates were not different between the two groups, but the rate of composite neurologic complication composed of stroke and delirium, was higher, and rate of mechanical ventilatory support was longer, in the high PWV group. CONCLUSION: Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was an independent predictor of postoperative AKI following off-pump CABG, and high baPWVs may affect the composite neurologic outcome and the duration of mechanical ventilatory support.
