36831138|t|An Array SPRi Biosensor for the Determination on PARP-1 in Blood Plasma.
36831138|a|A biosensor was developed for the quantification of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) in body fluids. An antibody specific for PARP-1 was placed on a chip with cysteamine (linker) and a gold layer. This biosensor has a linear response range (10-1000 pg mL-1) under appropriate pH conditions and with an antibody ligand concentration of 5 ng mL-1. Plasma samples were diluted with PBS buffer in appropriate quantities so that they fell within the linear range of the calibration curve. The biosensor exhibited suitable precision and accuracy, and good recovery (at levels from 95% to 105%). The method was validated by means of PARP-1 determinations in plasma samples from patients with endometriosis and a control group, using surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) biosensors and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. The Spearman correlation coefficient was close to 1. PARP-1 may be a marker providing information about pathological changes in the body during endometriosis.
