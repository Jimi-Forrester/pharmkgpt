35897709|t|The Role of Pyrazolopyridine Derivatives on Different Steps of Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 In Vitro Replicative Cycle.
35897709|a|Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) infection causes several disorders, and acyclovir is used as a reference compound. However, resistant strains are commonly observed. Herein, we investigate the effects of N-heterocyclic compounds (pyrazolopyridine derivatives), named ARA-04, ARA-05, and AM-57, on HSV-1 in vitro replication. We show that the 50% effective concentration (EC50) values of the compounds ARA-04, ARA-05, and AM-57 were 1.00 +- 0.10, 1.00 +- 0.05, and 0.70 +- 0.10 microM, respectively. These compounds presented high 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) values, which resulted in a selective index (SI) of 1000, 1000, and 857.1 for ARA-04, ARA-05, and AM-57, respectively. To gain insight into which step of the HSV-1 replication cycle these molecules would impair, we performed adsorption and penetration inhibition assays and time-of-addition experiments. Our results indicated that ARA-04 and ARA-05 affected viral adsorption, while AM-57 interfered with the virus replication during its alpha- and gamma-phases and decreased ICP27 content during initial and late events of HSV-1 replication. In addition, we also observed that AM-57 caused a strong decrease in viral gD content, which was reinforced by in silico calculations that suggested AM-57 interacts preferentially with the viral complex between a general transcription factor and virion protein (TFIIBc-VP16). In contrast, ARA-04 and ARA-05 interact preferentially in the proteins responsible for the viral adsorption process (nectin-1 and glycoprotein). Thus, our results suggest that the 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine derivatives inhibit the HSV-1 replicative cycle with a novel mechanism of action, and its scaffold can be used as a template for the synthesis of promising new molecules with antiviral effects, including to reinforce the presented data herein for a limited number of molecules.
