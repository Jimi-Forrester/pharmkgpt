35518545|t|A Case of Hypomagnesemia Presenting as New-Onset Seizure.
35518545|a|Identifying the etiology of a new-onset seizure can be challenging due to the extraordinarily large number of differential diagnoses. Electrolyte disturbances, through a mechanism of disruption of neurotransmission within the central nervous system, are often implicated as a possible etiology in many cases of seizures. In this report, we describe the sequence of events related to a 68-year-old patient who suffered from convulsions precipitated by hypomagnesemia and the possible contributors to such a condition.
