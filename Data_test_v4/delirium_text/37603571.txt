37603571|t|Factors associated with Alzheimer's disease prevalence and mortality in Brazil-An ecological study.
37603571|a|A few epidemiological studies are evaluating the prevalence and mortality rates of Alzheimer's disease, with no one using a nationwide sample of Brazilian elderlies. This study aims to calculate the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and investigate possible associations with sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and the presence of diseases non-communicable, and the prevalence and mortality for all Brazilian state capitals. This is an ecological design study made with secondary public data provided by the Ministry of Health. Prevalence rates were calculated based on the analysis of the dispensing of Alzheimer's disease-specific drugs. Correlation analyzes were performed between rates and factors, and a multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze possible associations between variables, controlled for each other. AD prevalence was 313/100,000. Prevalence rates were positively associated with primary health care coverage factors and negatively associated with ultra-processed food consumption and physical activity levels. AD mortality was 98/100,000. Mortality rates were positively associated with the proportion of obese elderly and elderly living on up to half the minimum wage and were inversely associated with the proportion of elderly with diabetes factors. We found positive and negative associations of sociodemographic, behavioral and diabetes indicators with Alzheimer's disease prevalence and mortality, which provide data that can be investigated by studies with different designs.
