35005616|t|Automatic Speech Recognition in Noise for Parkinson's Disease: A Pilot Study.
35005616|a|The sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has significantly advanced in the past decade. However, the observed unpredictability and variability of AI behavior in noisy signals is still underexplored and represents a challenge when trying to generalize AI behavior to real-life environments, especially for people with a speech disorder, who already experience reduced speech intelligibility. In the context of developing assistive technology for people with Parkinson's disease using automatic speech recognition (ASR), this pilot study reports on the performance of Google Cloud speech-to-text technology with dysarthric and healthy speech in the presence of multi-talker babble noise at different intensity levels. Despite sensitivities and shortcomings, it is possible to control the performance of these systems with current tools in order to measure speech intelligibility in real-life conditions.
