36824243|t|The Evaluation of Frailty in the Elderly and Affecting Biopsychosocial Factors: A Cross-Sectional Observational Study.
36824243|a|Background: We aimed to evaluate the frequency of frailty and the affecting factors in people living in our society over 65 yr old. Methods: Our descriptive and cross-sectional study included 261 individuals aged 65 and over who applied to Ankara Training and Research Hospital family practice centers and district polyclinics from 1 Jan to 1 Feb 2020. The participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, FRAIL Scale, Katz Daily Living Activities Scale, Lawton&Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale and Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form. Results: According to the FRAIL Scale results: 35 people were found to be frail (13.4%), 115 to be pre-frail (44.1%). No frailty was observed in 111 people (42.5%). While the mean score of the Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale was found to be 5.65+-0.71, the mean score of the Lawton&Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale was found to be 6.65+-1.69. In the geriatric depression evaluation, mild, medium or severe depression was detected in 87 participants (33.2%). As the level of frailty increased, the Geriatric Depression Scale score climbed significantly (P<0.001). In frail individuals, Lawton&Brody Scale scores were significantly lower (P<0.001). In our study: a correlation was found between frailty and female gender, being single, low income, low educational level, obesity, polypharmacy and decreased physical activity. Additionally, as the number of children increase frailty in women increases therewithal. Conclusion: Elderly people had high frailty. Polypharmacy, depression and reduced physical activity were the more frequent in frail elderly. In frail females, the number of children was significantly higher.
