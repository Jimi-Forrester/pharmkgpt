38248252|t|May Female Autism Spectrum Be Masked by Eating Disorders, Borderline Personality Disorder, or Complex PTSD Symptoms? A Case Series.
38248252|a|Introduction: The prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is four times higher in males than females; however, females are significantly more likely to go undiagnosed due to the existence of a "female autistic phenotype", a manifestation unique to females that conflicts with conventional, masculine conceptualizations of ASD. Furthermore, subthreshold autistic traits, which exert a significantly negative impact on quality of life and represent a vulnerability factor for the development of other psychopathological conditions, may remain even more under-recognized. Subsequently, many women with ASD may never receive a diagnosis or any resulting care, with serious consequences for their health. Aims: We aimed to describe two brief cases in order to confirm the diagnostic difficulties that ASD female undergo during their clinical evaluation and the possible alternative phenotype that they can manifest. Methods: We reported the cases of two young women on the autism spectrum that came to clinical attention only after the development of severe symptomatology attributed to other mental disorders, overlooking the presence of underlying autism spectrum features and a brief resume of the literature on this topic. Results: These cases confirm the need for a timely and proper identification of females on the autism spectrum in order to prevent complications and improve the outcome. Conclusions: Research on gender differences could lead to a reexamination of the sex ratio in the prevalence of ASD and provide a better understanding of several psychiatric conditions that are frequently diagnosed in women, supporting the neurodevelopmental approach to psychopathology.
