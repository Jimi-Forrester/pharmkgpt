36675130|t|Effects of Ozone on Sickness and Depressive-like Behavioral and Biochemical Phenotypes and Their Regulation by Serum Amyloid A in Mice.
36675130|a|Ozone (O3) is an air pollutant that primarily damages the lungs, but growing evidence supports the idea that O3 also harms the brain; acute exposure to O3 has been linked to central nervous system (CNS) symptoms such as depressed mood and sickness behaviors. However, the mechanisms by which O3 inhalation causes neurobehavioral changes are limited. One hypothesis is that factors in the circulation bridge communication between the lungs and brain following O3 exposure. In this study, our goals were to characterize neurobehavioral endpoints of O3 exposure as they relate to markers of systemic and pulmonary inflammation, with a particular focus on serum amyloid A (SAA) and kynurenine as candidate mediators of O3 behavioral effects. We evaluated O3-induced dose-, time- and sex-dependent changes in pulmonary inflammation, circulating SAA and kynurenine and its metabolic enzymes, and sickness and depressive-like behaviors in Balb/c and CD-1 mice. We found that 3 parts per million (ppm) O3, but not 2 or 1 ppm O3, increased circulating SAA and lung inflammation, which were resolved by 48 h and was worse in females. We also found that indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (Ido1) mRNA expression was increased in the brain and spleen 24 h after 3 ppm O3 and that kynurenine was increased in blood. Sickness and depressive-like behaviors were observed at all O3 doses (1-3 ppm), suggesting that behavioral responses to O3 can occur independently of increased SAA or neutrophils in the lungs. Using SAA knockout mice, we found that SAA did not contribute to O3-induced pulmonary damage or inflammation, systemic increases in kynurenine post-O3, or depressive-like behavior but did contribute to weight loss. Together, these findings indicate that acute O3 exposure induces transient symptoms of sickness and depressive-like behaviors that may occur in the presence or absence of overt pulmonary neutrophilia and systemic increases of SAA. SAA does not appear to contribute to pulmonary inflammation induced by O3, although it may contribute to other aspects of sickness behavior, as reflected by a modest effect on weight loss.
