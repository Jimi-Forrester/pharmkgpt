35003257|t|Identification of Latent Diagnostic Biomarkers and Biological Pathways in Dermatomyositis Based on WGCNA.
35003257|a|INTRODUCTION: Dermatomyositis (DM) is a chronic autoimmune disease of predominantly lymphocytic infiltration mainly involving the transverse muscle. Its pathogenesis is remaining unknown. This research is designed to probe the latent pathogenesis of dermatomyositis, identify potential biomarkers, and reveal the pathogenesis of dermatomyositis through information biology analysis of gene chips. METHODS: In this study, we utilised the GSE14287 and GSE11971 datasets rooted in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databank, which included a total of 62 DM samples and 9 normal samples. The datasets were combined, and the differentially expressed gene sets were subjected to weighted gene coexpression network analysis, and the hub gene was screened using a protein interaction network from genes in modules highly correlated with dermatomyositis progression. RESULTS: A total of 3 key genes-myxovirus resistance-2 (MX2), oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), and oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2)-were identified in combination with cell line samples, and the expressions of the 3 genes were verified separately. The results showed that MX2, OAS1, and OAS2 were highly expressed in LPS-treated cell lines compared to normal cell lines. The results of pathway enrichment analysis of the genes indicated that all 3 genes were enriched in the cytosolic DNA signalling and cytokine and cytokine receptor interaction signalling pathways; the results of functional enrichment analysis showed that all 3 were enriched in interferon-alpha response and interferon-gamma response functions. CONCLUSIONS: This is important for the study of the pathogenesis and objective treatment of dermatomyositis and provides important reference information for the targeted therapy of dermatomyositis.
