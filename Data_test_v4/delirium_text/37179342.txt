37179342|a|Epigenetic memory is essential for life that governs the predefined functional features of cells. Recent evidence has indicated that the epigenetic modification provides a potential link to gene expression changes that may be involved in the development of various chronic diseases, and targeting the epigenome becomes a plausible method for treating diseases. Traditional herbal medicine has gradually entered the vision of researchers due to its low toxicity and its effectiveness in treating diseases. As a matter of fact, researchers found that the possessed epigenetic modification capacity of herbal medicine had the ability to combat the progression of the disease, such as various types of cancer, diabetes, inflammation, amnesia, liver fibrosis, asthma, and hypertension-induced renal injury. Studies on the epigenetic effects of herbal medicine will provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of human diseases, which may lead to new therapeutic approaches and diagnoses. Thus, this review summarized the impact of herbal medicine and its bioactive components on disease epigenome as examples of how utilization of epigenetic plasticity could be useful as the basis for the future development of targeted therapies in chronic diseases.
