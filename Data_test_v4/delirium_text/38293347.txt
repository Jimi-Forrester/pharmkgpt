38293347|a|Background: Transient receptor potential vanilloid type1 (TRPV1) is a non-selective cation channel with multiple activation mechanisms, which has received increasing attention since it was first cloned in 1997. Methods: We used bibliometric and visualization analyses to evaluate the theme trends and knowledge structure of TRPV1 research-papers on TRPV1 from 2002 to 2022 obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection. VOSviewer and CiteSpace were used to analyze authors, institutions, countries, co-cited references, and keywords. Results: A total of 7413 papers were included. The main research area of TRPV1 was neuroscience; the most published country was the United States, and the University of California, San Francisco, had the highest centrality. Two major collaborative sub-networks were formed between the authors. The distribution of keywords shows that TRPV1 was initially studied extensively, and the recent studies focused on TRPV1 structure and diseases. "Oxidative stress," "TRPV1 structure," "cancer," and "model" have been the research hotspots in recent years. Conclusions: This research provides valuable information for the study of TRPV1. Disease research was focused on pain, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Both agonists and antagonists of TRPV1 are gradually being used in clinical practice, and acupuncture was effective in treating TRPV1-mediated inflammatory pain. TRPV1 is involved in classical endogenous cannabis system signaling, and new signaling pathways continue to be revealed.
