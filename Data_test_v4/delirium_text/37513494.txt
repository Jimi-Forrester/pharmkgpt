37513494|t|Effects of Insect Consumption on Human Health: A Systematic Review of Human Studies.
37513494|a|Insects have been consumed as food in diverse cultures worldwide, gaining recognition as a sustainable and nutritious food source. This systematic review aims to update information on the impact of insect consumption on human health based on human randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and allergenicity assessment studies. Following PRISMA guidelines, studies published in the last 10 years were analyzed. From one-thousand and sixty-three retrieved references, nine RCTs and five allergenicity studies were analyzed. Post-prandial amino acid levels increased after insect protein consumption. In comparison with other protein sources, insect protein showed no significant differences in the area under the curve (AUC) values for essential amino acids but tended to have lower peaks and peak later. In terms of muscle protein synthesis, there were no significant differences between insect protein and other protein sources. Glucose levels did not differ; however, insulin levels were lower after the consumption of insect-based products. The effects on inflammatory markers and microbiota composition were inconclusive and the studies did not show significant effects on appetite regulation. Allergenicity assessments revealed a sensitisation and cross-reactivity between insect allergens and known allergens. A partial reduction of cross-allergenicity was observed via thermal processing. Insect protein is an adequate protein source with promising health benefits; however, further research is needed to fully understand its potential and optimise its inclusion into the human diet.
