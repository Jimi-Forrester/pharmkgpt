31940305|t|Differential Influence of Location-Specific White-Matter Hyperintensities on Attention Subdomains Measured Using the Attention Network Test.
31940305|a|BACKGROUND Elderly people with white-matter hyperintensities (WMHs) typically show cognitive impairment. Attention, consisting of 3 independent component processes (alerting, orienting, and executive control), is crucial for cognitive functioning. Little is known about how WMHs interfere with these attention subdomains. In the present study, we sought to describe characteristics of attention deficits in patients with age-related WMHs and to assess whether the severity and location of lesions differentially affect specific attention subdomains using the attention network test (ANT), which is a computer-based paradigm tailored to accurately provide behavioral measures of the aforementioned subdomains. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 39 WMH patients and 39 age-, sex-, and education-matched controls underwent comprehensive neuropsychological and ANT evaluation. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to visualize severity of total and location-specific WMH lesions. Multiple linear regression analyses adjusted for possible confounders were performed. RESULTS Compared with controls, WMH patients showed pronounced deficits in orienting and executive control efficiencies (P<0.050), but not alerting efficiency (P=0.642). As total WMH severity increased, efficiencies in the impaired subdomains significantly declined (P<0.050). In terms of lesion location, fronto-parietal type of periventricular WMH (PWMH) and deep WMH (DWMH) in the parietal lobe affected orienting efficiency, while all PWMH types and DWMH in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes affected executive control efficiency (P<0.050). Additional adjustment for other MRI lesions significantly changed the impact on orienting, but not on executive control efficiency. CONCLUSIONS Our results reveal specific attention deficits in patients with age-related WMH and may help clarify how the location of lesions influences their effects on attention subdomains.
