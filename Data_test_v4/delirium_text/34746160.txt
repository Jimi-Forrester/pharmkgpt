34746160|t|Case Report: A Candida Meningitis in an Immunocompetent Patient Detected Through the Next-Generation Sequencing.
34746160|a|Background: Fungal infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are not commonly seen clinically. Clinical diagnosis of fungal infections often depend on the pathogen culture and the clinical features. This method is time-consuming and insensitive, which can lead to misdiagnosis. The authors introduce an adult patient with fungal infections diagnosed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Case: The patient was a 60-year-old male Chinese who had both hypermyotonia of the lower extremities and fever. The auxiliary examinations such as MRI, CT, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed obvious abnormalities. Because of the difficulties in diagnosis, it was hard to determine the treatment plan. The NGS detected specific sequences of Candida albicans in 3 days. The patient was then treated with liposomal amphotericin B and fluconazole. About 3 weeks later, the symptoms of the patient improved significantly and he was discharged from the hospital. Conclusion: Compared with the routine cultural method, NGS has made a huge advancement in infection diagnosis and targeting antimicrobial therapy for CNS infection.
