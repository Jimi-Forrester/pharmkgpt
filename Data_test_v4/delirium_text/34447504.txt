34447504|a|CONTEXT: Postoperative sore throat (POST) is a common annoying problem following endotracheal (ET) intubation. AIMS: Comparing the impact of low and high doses of ketamine gargle on lowering POST incidence and severity. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: 96 patients selected for septoplasty surgery under general anesthesia were investigated through a single-blind randomized controlled trial. METHODS: This study was performed on three equal groups. Group K and G gargled 50 and 100 mg ketamine, respectively, solved in normal saline and group C gargled pure normal saline for 30 s at 5 min before tracheal intubation. POST severity measured immediately after the entrance to the postanesthetic care unit (PACU) and then 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 24 h after operation. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Collected data were analyzed by the Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Friedman test using SPSS version 20. RESULTS: POST incidence and severity in group C were significantly higher than both K and G groups at all times. Although significant differences between low and high doses of ketamine were acknowledged at 8 h post-operation, 100 mg ketamine could attenuate POST severity further than 50 mg at all times. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that 100 mg outperformed 50 mg ketamine without rising complications and dissatisfaction for subjects. So, it gives us a powerful reason to suggest gargling 100 mg ketamine for lessening POST incidence and severity.
