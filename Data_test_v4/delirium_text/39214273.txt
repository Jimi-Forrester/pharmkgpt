39214273|a|The accumulation of misfolded proteins is a common pathological characteristic shared by many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The disruption of proteostasis triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, during which the unfolded protein response (UPR) is initiated by activation of protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). These three branches of UPR signals act in concert to reduce the levels of abnormal proteins and restore ER homeostasis. However, the overactivation of UPR impairs cell function and induces apoptosis, which has been implicated in neurodegeneration. Astaxanthin is a xanthophyll carotenoid which has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in both cell and animal models; however, its effects on ER stress and UPR induced by disrupted proteostasis remain unclear. In this study, the effects of astaxanthin on ER stress and cytotoxicity were investigated in N2a cells stably expressing the pro-aggregant tau repeat domain carrying FTDP-17 mutation DeltaK280 (Tau4RDDeltaK280). The results demonstrated that astaxanthin significantly inhibited Tau4RDDeltaK280-induced loss of cell viability and apoptosis, attenuating Tau4RDDeltaK280-induced caspase-3 activation and decrease of Bcl-2. Further studies revealed that astaxanthin treatment alleviated Tau4RDDeltaK280-induced ER stress and suppressed the activation of PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 signaling pathways. These findings suggested that astaxanthin might inhibit Tau4RDDeltaK280-induced cytotoxicity by attenuating UPR and ER stress. In addition, astaxanthin treatment resulted in a great reduction in the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and a significant decrease in calcium influx induced by Tau4RDDeltaK280, which also contributed to the protective effects of astaxanthin against Tau4RDDeltaK280-induced cytotoxicity.
