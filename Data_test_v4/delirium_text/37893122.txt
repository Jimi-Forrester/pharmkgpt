37893122|t|The Complicated Relationship of Short-Chain Fatty Acids and Oral Microbiome: A Narrative Review.
37893122|a|The human oral microbiome has emerged as a focal point of research due to its profound implications for human health. The involvement of short-chain fatty acids in oral microbiome composition, oral health, and chronic inflammation is gaining increasing attention. In this narrative review, the results of early in vitro, in vivo, and pilot clinical studies and research projects are presented in order to define the boundaries of this new complicated issue. According to the results, the current research data are disputable and ambiguous. When investigating the role of SCFAs in human health and disease, it is crucial to distinguish between their local GI effects and the systemic influences. Locally, SCFAs are a part of normal oral microbiota metabolism, but the increased formation of SCFAs usually attribute to dysbiosis; excess SCFAs participate in the development of local oral diseases and in oral biota gut colonization and dysbiosis. On the other hand, a number of studies have established the positive impact of SCFAs on human health as a whole, including the reduction of chronic systemic inflammation, improvement of metabolic processes, and decrease of some types of cancer incidence. Thus, a complex and sophisticated approach with consideration of origin and localization for SCFA function assessment is demanded. Therefore, more research, especially clinical research, is needed to investigate the complicated relationship of SCFAs with health and disease and their potential role in prevention and treatment.
