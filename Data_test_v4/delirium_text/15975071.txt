15975071|a|The serotonin 5-HT4 receptor mediates many physiological effects in the central nervous system. The recent molecular identification of 5-HT4 receptors and the development of selective 5-HT4 receptor ligands have led to many important new insights into the signalling pathways and the physiological roles of these G protein-coupled-receptors in neurones. With respect to neurodegenerative disorders, it is suggested that 5-HT4 agonists may represent a new avenue for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This mini-review will focus on recent in vitro and in vivo pharmacological and biochemical studies showing the involvement of 5-HT4 receptors in cognitive processes and the amyloid precursor protein processing. The potential use of 5-HT4 agonists for the treatment of AD will be discussed.
