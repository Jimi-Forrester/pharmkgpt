37550229|t|A Pilot Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Novel Markers of Metabolic Syndrome in Patients with Psoriasis.
37550229|a|BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported that psoriasis is associated with the development of metabolic syndrome. Genome-wide association studies have been used to discover gene variant markers that occur frequently in case group in relation to specific diseases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the variants of specific genes involved in metabolic syndrome associated with psoriasis. METHODS: A total of 95 psoriasis patients were recruited and divided into two groups: one with metabolic syndrome (38 patients) and the other without (57 patients). After genotyping, imputation, and quality checking, the association between the several single nucleotide polymorphisms and metabolic syndrome in psoriasis was tested, followed by gene set enrichment analysis. RESULTS: We found 76 gene polymorphisms that conferred an increased risk for metabolic syndrome in patients with psoriasis. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs17154774 of FRMD4A, rs77498336 of GPR116, rs75949580 and rs187682251 of MAPK4) showed the strongest association between metabolic syndrome and psoriasis. The epidermal growth factor receptor protein was located at the center of the protein interactions for the gene polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: This study identified several previously unknown polymorphisms associated with metabolic syndrome in psoriasis. These results highlight the potential for future genetic studies to elucidate the development, and ultimately prevent the onset, of metabolic syndrome in patients with psoriasis.
