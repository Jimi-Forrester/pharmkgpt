16890190|t|Aberrantly regulated proteins in frontotemporal dementia.
16890190|a|Non-Alzheimer's disease of the frontal type, or frontotemporal dementia (FTD), is the second most common form of dementia. Yet, a detailed characterization of the disease has been especially limiting. To identify mechanisms possibly involved in disease pathology or progression, a proteomic analysis of proteins isolated from human frontal cortex with frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) was performed. We used 2D gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF to identify a total of 24 proteins differentially expressed in FTDP-17. We identified a ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase, UCHL1, as well as several proteins involved in oxidative stress to be differentially expressed. Data presented implicate UCHL1 and ubiquitin-mediated degradation as well as oxidative stress response in disease pathology or progression.
