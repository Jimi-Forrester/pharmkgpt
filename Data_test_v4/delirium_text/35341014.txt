35341014|t|A Novel Radiomics-Based Machine Learning Framework for Prediction of Acute Kidney Injury-Related Delirium in Patients Who Underwent Cardiovascular Surgery.
35341014|a|Acute kidney injury (AKI) can be caused by multiple etiologies and is characterized by a sudden and severe decrease in kidney function. Understanding the independent risk factors associated with the development of AKI and its early detection can refine the risk management and clinical decision-making of high-risk patients after cardiovascular surgery. A retrospective analysis was performed in a single teaching hospital between December 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. The diagnostic performance of novel biomarkers was assessed using random forest, support vector machine, and multivariate logistic regression. The nomogram from multivariate analysis of risk factors associated with AKI indicated that only LVEF, red blood cell input, and ICUmvat contribute to AKI differentiation and that the difference is statistically significant (P < 0.05). Seven radiomics biomarkers were found among 65 patients to be highly correlated with AKI-associated delirium. The importance of the variables was determined using the multilayer perceptron model; fivefold cross-validation was applied to determine the most important delirium risk factors in radiomics of the hippocampus. Finally, we established a radiomics-based machine learning framework to predict AKI-induced delirium in patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery.
