14635087|a|BACKGROUND AND METHODS: In part of a quality improvement program, the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) surveyed its membership regarding their involvement in and attitudes toward the palliative care (PC) of patients with advanced cancer. RESULTS: Of 895 members who responded, 82.5% were European and 12.1% were American. Sixty-nine percent of respondents reported that patients with advanced cancer constituted a major proportion of their practice; for 22% of respondents, patients with advanced cancer constituted most of their practice. Only a minority of respondents collaborated often with a PC care specialist (35%), a palliative home care service (38%), an in-patient hospice (26%), or a psychologist (33%). In response to questions regarding specific involvement in PC clinical tasks, respondents were involved more commonly in treating physical symptoms, such as pain (93%), fatigue (84%), and nausea/emesis (84%), than in managing psychological symptoms and end-of-life care issues, such as depression/anxiety (65%), existential distress (29%), or delirium (12%). Forty-three percent of respondents reported that they directly administered end-of-life care often, and 74% reported that they derived satisfaction from their involvement in end-of-life care. Overall, 88.4% of respondents endorsed the belief that medical oncologists should coordinate the end-of-life care for their patients, but a substantial minority (42%) felt that they were trained inadequately for this task. Positive attitudes toward PC were correlated highly with the degree of direct involvement in PC practice. Practitioners in private practice or teaching hospitals had substantially more positive attitudes regarding PC compared with physicians based in comprehensive cancer centers (P < 0.05). Although most of the responding medical oncologists expressed positive views regarding their involvement in the PC of patients with advanced cancer and dying patients, 15% of respondents had pervasively negative views. CONCLUSIONS: Most ESMO oncologists recognize the importance of PC and supportive care for patients with advanced cancer. Despite this, many are prepared inadequately for these tasks, and actual participation levels commonly are suboptimal.
