32341694|t|The Role of Quantitative EEG in the Diagnosis of Neuropsychiatric Disorders.
32341694|a|Quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) is a modern type of electroencephalography (EEG) analysis that involves recording digital EEG signals which are processed, transformed, and analyzed using complex mathematical algorithms. QEEG has brought new techniques of EEG signals feature extraction: analysis of specific frequency band and signal complexity, analysis of connectivity, and network analysis. The clinical application of QEEG is extensive, including neuropsychiatric disorders, epilepsy, stroke, dementia, traumatic brain injury, mental health disorders, and many others. In this review, we talk through existing evidence on the practical applications of this clinical tool. We conclude that to date, the role of QEEG is not necessarily to pinpoint an immediate diagnosis but to provide additional insight in conjunction with other diagnostic evaluations in order to objective information necessary for obtaining a precise diagnosis, correct disease severity assessment, and specific treatment response evaluation.
