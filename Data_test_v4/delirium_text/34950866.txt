34950866|a|Gluten free (GF) products are often inferior in quality attributes, nutritional content and consumer acceptability. The use of GF by-products is a novel strategy to improve the structure and nutritional profile of these products. Sweet corn cob (SCC) is a by-product of sweet corn processing containing a considerable amount of fibre and ferulic acid. The effect of baking on ferulic acid content, colour, texture and physical characteristics on muffins incorporated with SCC flour (SCCF) as a value-added food ingredient was investigated using a GF model system. The freeze-dried SCCF, containing ferulic acid (6.02 mg g-1) was used to replace the rice flour at varying levels of 10, 20, and 30%. In general, SCCF increased dietary fibre and free ferulic acid content of muffins. Inclusion of 20% SCCF showed an increase in terms of the height of the muffin and number of air cells in the crumb, along with a decrease in the hardness of muffins. Muffins with SCCF showed higher mean overall liking scores than rice flour muffin.
