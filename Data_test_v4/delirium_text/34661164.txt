34661164|t|Alzheimer's Disease in Bilingual Latinos: Clinical Decisions for Diagnosis and Treatment Planning.
34661164|a|Early and accurate identification of cognitive and functional decline in bilingual Latino/a older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias continues to be a substantial public health concern. This paper highlights the heterogeneity in the clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease among bilingual Latino/as, the clinical decisions leading to a culturally and linguistically congruent neuropsychological assessment, and the interdisciplinary, multi-setting partnerships needed to ensure a healthy longevity post-diagnosis for the patient, the caregiver, and the family. Psychologists play an important role in advocating for the best standard of care, as the patients and families endure the long journey of care with dignity and respect.
