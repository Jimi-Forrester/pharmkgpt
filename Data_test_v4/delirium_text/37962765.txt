37962765|a|BACKGROUND: The Blue Book (2005), recommended guidelines for patients care with fragility fractures. Together with introduction of a National Hip Fracture Database Audit and Best Practice Tariff model to financially incentivise hospitals by payment of a supplement for patients whose care satisfied six clinical standards), have improved hip fracture after-care. However, there is a lack of data-driven evidence to support its effectiveness. We aimed to verify the impact of an orthogeriatric service on hospital length of stay (LOS)-duration from admission to discharge. METHODS: We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study over a 10 year period of older individuals aged >= 60 years admitted with hip fractures to a hospital. RESULTS: Altogether 2798 patients, 741 men and 2057 women (respective mean ages; 80.5 +- 10.6 and 83.2 +- 8.9 years) were admitted from their own homes with a hip fracture and survived to discharge. Compared to 2009-2014, LOS during 2015-2019, when the orthogeriatric service was fully implemented, was shorter for all discharge destinations: 10.4 vs 17.5 days (P < 0.001). Each discharge destination showed reductions: back to own homes, 9.7 vs 17.7 days (P < 0.001); to rehabilitation units: 10.8 vs 13.1 days (P < 0.001); to residential care: 15.4 vs 26.2 days (P = 0.001); or nursing care, 24.4 vs 53.1 days (P < 0.001). During 2009-2014, the risk of staying > 3 weeks in hospital was greater by six-fold and pressure ulcers by three-fold. The number of bed days for every thousand patients per year was also shortened during 2015-2019 by: 1665 days for discharge back to own homes; 469 days with transfer to rehabilitation units; 1258 days for discharge to residential care, and 5465 days to nursing care. Estimated annual savings (2017 costs) per thousand patients after complete establishment of the service was about $2.7 m. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an orthogeriatric service generated significant reductions in hospital LOS for all patients, with associated cost-savings, especially for those discharged to nursing care.
