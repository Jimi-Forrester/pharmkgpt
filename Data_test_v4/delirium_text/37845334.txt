37845334|t|A recognition test in monkeys to differentiate recollection from familiarity memory.
37845334|a|Episodic memory is memory for experiences within a specific temporal and spatial context. Episodic memories decline early in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recollection of episodic memories can fail with both AD and aging, but familiarity and recollection memory uniquely fail in AD. Finding a means to differentiate specific memory failures in animal models is critical for translational research. Four cotton top tamarins participated in an object recognition test. They were exposed to two unique objects placed in a consistent context for 5 daily sessions. Next a delay of 1 day or 1 week was imposed. Subjects' memory of the objects was tested by replacing one of the familiarized objects with a novel one. The tamarins looked longer at the novel object after both delays, an indication of remembering the familiar object. In other tests, the test pair was relocated to a new location or presented at a different time of day. With context changes, tamarins showed greater interest in the novel object after a 1-week delay but not after a 1-day delay. It seems that context changes disrupted their recollection of recent events. But the monkeys showed accurate familiarity memory across context changes with longer delays.
