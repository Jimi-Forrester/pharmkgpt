22815080|a|BACKGROUND: Although an association between the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is established, the utility of APOE genotyping in the clinical diagnosis of AD is still under investigation. METHODS: Medical records of 89 patients with cognitive impairment and APOE genotype data underwent a retrospective review. RESULTS: Comparison of age, age at onset, education, Mini-Mental State Examination, months of follow-up, and family history of dementia did not reveal statistical difference among the patients with different APOE genotypes. The APOE epsilon4 carriers had a higher percentage of AD diagnoses after a median 16 months follow-up than non-APOE epsilon4 carriers. The APOE epsilon4 designation had a high sensitivity and high positive predictive value for the diagnosis of AD but a low negative predictive value and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The APOE genotyping may be helpful in diagnosing AD especially in patients presenting with atypical features or early age of onset of dementia.
