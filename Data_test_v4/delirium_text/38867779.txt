38867779|t|Wave type fiber SPR sensor for rapid and highly sensitive detection of hyperoside.
38867779|a|The fiber surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor used for the detection of active ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine has the problems of low sensitivity and difficult specific recognition. This paper proposed a wave type fiber SPR sensor, which reduced the mode of transmitted light through a periodic wave structure and caused concentrated and total reflection of the transmitted beam at the interface between the bent peak cladding and the air. A 50 nm gold film was coated on the surface of the cladding in the wave structure area to form the SPR sensing area. By controlling the width and height of the wave structure to control the total reflection angle of the transmitted light, i.e., the SPR incidence angle, the sensitivity of the fiber SPR sensor was effectively improved to 4972 nm/RIU. Furthermore, HSP90AA protein was modified on the gold film of the sensor to achieve specific detection of hyperoside. The longest single detection time was only 3 minutes, and the detection sensitivity was 0.53 nm/(microg/ml), with a detection limit as low as 0.68microg/ml, which is comparable to liquid chromatography. The proposed wave type fiber SPR sensor is fast in production and has high structural mechanical strength, providing a new approach for the rapid, highly sensitive, and specific detection of active ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine.
