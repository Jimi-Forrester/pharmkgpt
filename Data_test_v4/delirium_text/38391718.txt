38391718|a|Both glioblastoma (GBM) and dementia are devastating diseases with limited treatments that are usually not curative. Having clinically diagnosed dementia with an associated biopsy-proven etiology and a coexisting GBM diagnosis is a rare occurrence. The relationship between the development of neurodegenerative dementia and GBM is unclear, as there are conflicting reports in the literature. We present two cases of simultaneous biopsy-proven dementia, one with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and GBM, and one with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and GBM. We discuss how these diseases may be associated. Whether one pathologic process begins first or develops concurrently is unknown, but certain molecular pathways of dementia and GBM appear directly related while others inversely related. Further investigations of these close molecular relationships between dementia and GBM could lead to development of improved diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions for both diseases.
