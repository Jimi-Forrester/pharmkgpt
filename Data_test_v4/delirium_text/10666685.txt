10666685|t|Downregulation of the transcription factor scleraxis in brain of patients with Down syndrome.
10666685|a|Performing gene hunting in fetal Down Syndrome (DS) brain, we found a downregulated sequence with 100% homology to the basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor (TF) scleraxis (Scl). It was the aim of the study to evaluate Scl-mRNA steady state levels in adult DS brain with Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathological changes, brain of patients with AD, and controls in order to find out whether Scl-downregulation is linked to DS per se or simply to neurodegeneration, common to both disorders. Determination of Scl-mRNA steady state levels was carried out by a blotting method in frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital lobe and cerebellum. We found significantly decreased Scl-transcripts in brain of DS and AD, both, when normalized versus the house-keeping gene beta actin or total RNA. We demonstrate the significant decrease of Scl-mRNA steady state levels in the pathogenesis of DS and AD suggesting a tentative role for this transcription factor in the development of the neurodegenerative processes known to occur in both disorders. More specifically, the biological meaning of the downregulation of Scl may be the involvement in the pathogenesis of impaired neuronal plasticity and wiring observed in DS and AD, phenomena regulated by the concerted action of the many transcription factors expressed in human brain.
