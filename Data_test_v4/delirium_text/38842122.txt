38842122|a|Oxidative stress (OS) plays an important role in the emergence and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated in a neuronal cell can lead to OS, producing cell injury and death. Seeking nanoantioxidants against AD-related oxidative stress has attracted a lot of attention, especially those potential antioxidant agents derived from natural polyphenols. However, the transformation of abundant plant polyphenols to antioxidative biomaterials against OS is still challenging. In this work, we report a new method to transform amorphous tannic acid (TA) into tailorable shaped ellagic acid (EA) crystalline particles without using an organic solvent. EA crystalline particles were generated from TA, which underwent a chemical transformation, in situ metal phenolic coordination and acid-induced assembly process, and the size and shape could be controlled by varying the amount of acid. As-prepared EA crystalline particles showed excellent stability in water and lysosomal mimicking fluid and possess unique fluorescence properties and a strong response in mass spectrometry, which is beneficial for their imaging analysis in cells and tissues. More importantly, EA particles have shown significant H2O2-related ROS scavenging ability, a high cellular uptake capacity, an excellent neuroprotective effect in PC12 cells, a high drug loading capacity and BBB permeability to enter the brain. Our study suggested that the EA crystalline particles show great potential for OS-mediated AD treatment.
