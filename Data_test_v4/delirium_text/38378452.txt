38378452|t|Mental Health Service Integration in Hospice Organizations: A National Survey of Hospice Clinicians and Medical Leadership.
38378452|a|Background: Unmet mental health needs are associated with a range of negative consequences for individuals at the end of life. Despite the high prevalence of mental health needs among individuals enrolled in hospice, there is a paucity of data describing mental health service integration in hospices in the United States. Objectives: 1. To identify patterns of mental health service integration in hospice organizations nationally; 2. To characterize gaps in mental health service delivery in hospice settings as perceived by hospice clinicians and medical leadership. Methods: A cross-sectional survey querying hospice clinicians and hospice medical leadership nationally. Results: A total of 279 surveys were included. Clinically significant mental health symptoms were common among hospice patients; the most frequently encountered symptom groups were depression, anxiety, dementia, and delirium. A minority of hospices maintained relationships with psychiatrists (23%, n = 60), psychiatric nurse practitioners (22%, n = 56), or psychologists (19%, n = 49). Only 38% (n = 99) of respondents were satisfied with their patients' access to services and only 45% (n = 118) were satisfied with the quality of these services. Common limitations to providing adequate mental health services included lack of specialist services, short length of stay for patients, and reluctance of patients to engage in these services. Conclusions: Significant mental health symptoms are common among hospice patients, and hospice organizations perceive these needs are not being met. Further research is needed to better understand the current treatment landscape and design interventions to address these needs.
