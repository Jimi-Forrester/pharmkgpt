22232005|a|Clearance of plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) through plasma exchange and replacement with therapeutic albumin to facilitate net Abeta efflux from the brain to plasma is a novel approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, thorough characterization of the capacity of therapeutic albumin to bind Abeta is warranted. In this study, Abeta40 and Abeta42 were quantified by commercial ELISA or Araclon ABtest  in samples of Grifols' therapeutic albumin (Albutein ) 5%, 20%, and 25%. The capacity of Albutein  to bind Abeta was assessed by: a) ELISA in serially diluted therapeutic albumin (0-45 mg/ml protein concentration) to which 80 pg/ml of synthetic Abeta peptide (sAbeta40 or sAbeta42) were added; b) ELISA in samples of the therapeutic albumin containing serially diluted sAbeta40 or sAbeta42 (60-400 pg/ml); and c) surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for sAbeta42 binding. The Abeta content in Albutein  was below the quantification threshold of the ELISA tests (<25 to <62.5 pg/ml) and ABtest  (<3.125 pg/ml). Quantification of exogenously added sAbeta42 decreased in parallel with increasing protein concentration (59-78% at 45 mg/ml albumin). Recovery of sAbeta serially diluted in Albutein  was ~60% for sAbeta40 and ~70% for sAbeta42, but was ~100% in control samples without albumin. The KD by SPR analysis for sAbeta42 interaction with Albutein  was 1.72 +- 0.24 x 10-6 M. In conclusion, Grifols' therapeutic albumin has undetectable content of Abeta40 and Abeta42. Moreover, Grifols' therapeutic albumin consistently binds peptides containing the primary sequence of human Abeta.
