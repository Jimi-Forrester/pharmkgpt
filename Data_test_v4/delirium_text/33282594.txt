33282594|a|Despite optimal local control for high-risk soft tissue sarcomas (STS) with radiation and surgery, there are no other interventions that clearly and significantly reduce the risk of distant relapse after resection. Cytotoxic chemotherapy for localized STS is controversial and is associated with significant side effects. There are significant biologic perturbations that occur at the time of operation and numerous studies have demonstrated that surgical removal of the primary tumor can accelerate the growth of subclinical metastases. While the exact etiology of this phenomenon is unknown, there is some evidence to suggest that allogeneic blood transfusion and volatile inhaled anesthetics may be associated with tumor-promoting processes. At our institution, we have utilized acute normovolemic hemodilution and total intravenous propofol-based anesthesia to avoid these potentially detrimental factors.
