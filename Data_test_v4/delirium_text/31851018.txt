31851018|a|INTRODUCTION: EEG patterns in chimeric antigen receptor T cell treatment-associated neurotoxicity (immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome) have not yet been systematically studied. We tested the hypothesis that EEG background abnormalities in immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome correlate with clinical signs of neurotoxicity. In addition, we describe ictal and interictal EEG patterns to better understand the natural history of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome-associated seizures. METHODS: EEGs were obtained in 19 of 100 subjects in a prospective cohort study of children and young adults undergoing CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy. We classified the EEG background on a severity scale of 0 to 5 during 30-minute epochs. EEG grades were compared with neurotoxicity scored by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium scores. Descriptive analysis was conducted for ictal and interictal EEG abnormalities. RESULTS: EEG background abnormality scores correlated well with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events neurotoxicity scores (P = 0.0022) and Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium scores (P = 0.0085). EEG was better able to differentiate the severity of coma patterns compared with the clinical scores. The EEG captured electroclinical seizures in 4 of 19 subjects, 3 of whom had additional electrographic-only seizures. Seizures most often arose from posterior head regions. Interictal epileptiform discharges were focal, multifocal, or lateralized periodic discharges. No seizures or interictal epileptiform abnormalities were seen in subjects without previous clinical seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous EEG monitoring is high yield for seizure detection in high-risk chimeric antigen receptor T cell patients, and electrographic-only seizures are common. Increasing severity of EEG background abnormalities correlates with increasing neurotoxicity grade.
