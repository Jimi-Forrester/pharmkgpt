33934913|t|The Significant Prognostic Factors in Prolonged Intensive/High Care Unit Stay After Living Donor Liver Transplantation.
33934913|a|BACKGROUND: Prolonged stay in an intensive/high care unit (ICU/HCU) after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is a significant event with possible mortality. METHODS: Adult-to-adult LDLTs (n = 283) were included in this study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for the factors attributed to the prolonged ICU/HCU stay after LDLT. RESULTS: Recipients who stayed in the ICU/HCU 9 days or longer were defined as the prolonged group. The prolonged group was older (P = .0010), had a higher model for end-stage liver disease scores (P < .0001), and had higher proportions of patients with preoperative hospitalization (P < .0001). Delirium (P < .0001), pulmonary complications (P < .0001), sepsis (P < .0001), reintubation or tracheostomy (P < .0001), relaparotomy due to bleeding (P = .0015) or other causes (P < .0001), and graft dysfunction (P < .0001) were associated with prolonged ICU/HCU stay. Only sepsis (P = .015) and graft dysfunction (P = .019) were associated with in-hospital mortality among patients with prolonged ICU/HCU stay or graft loss within 9 days of surgery. Among these patients, grafts from donors aged <42 years and with a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of >0.76% had significantly higher graft survival than grafts from others (P = .0013 and P < .0001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Prolonged ICU/HCU stay after LDLT was associated with worse short-term outcomes. The use of grafts of sufficient volume from younger donors might improve graft survival.
