38842100|a|INTRODUCTION: We investigated the effect vigorous physical activity (VPA) on the risk of incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable dementia among individuals with high-risk hypertension. METHODS: Baseline self-reported frequency of VPA was categorized into low VPA (<1 session/week), and high VPA (>=1 session/week). We used multivariate Cox regression analysis to examine the association of VPA categories with incident MCI and probable dementia events. RESULTS: Participants in the high VPA category, compared with low VPA, experienced lower events rates (per 1000 person-years) of MCI (13.9 vs 19.7), probable dementia (6.3 vs 9.0), and MCI/probable dementia (18.5 vs 25.8). In the multivariate Cox regression model, high VPA, compared with low VPA, was associated with lower risk of MCI, probable dementia, and MCI/probable dementia (HR [95% CI]: 0.81 [0.68-0.97], 0.80 [0.63-1.03], and 0.82 [0.70-0.96]), respectively. DISCUSSION: This study provides evidence that VPA may preserve cognitive function in high-risk patients with hypertension. HIGHLIGHTS: Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment Physical activity (PA) is associated with a lower risk of decline in cognition The effect of >=1 sessions of vigorous-intensity PA (VPA) per week was assessed This analysis included SPRINT MIND trial participants with high-risk hypertension >=1 VPA sessions/week was associated with lower risk of future cognitive impairment.
