36439371|t|Changes in trends of orthopedic services due to the COVID-19 pandemic: A review.
36439371|a|As of June 10, 2022, the World Health Organization has recorded over 532 million documented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [(Coronavirus) SARS-CoV-2] cases and almost 6.3 million deaths worldwide, which has caused strain on medical specialties globally. The aim of this review is to explore the impact that COVID-19 has had on orthopedic practices. Providers observed a rapid decline in the number of orthopedic patients' admissions due to cancellation of elective procedures; however, emergent cases still required treatment. Various observational studies, case reports, and clinical trials were collected through a PubMed database search. Additional sources were found through Google. The search was refined to publications in English and between the years of 2019 and 2021. The keywords used were "COVID-19" and/or "Orthopedic Injuries". Thirty-seven studies were retained. The pandemic brought on significant changes to the mechanism of injury, number of admissions, type of injuries, and patient outcomes. Mortality rates significantly increased particularly amongst patients with hip fractures and COVID-19. Road traffic injuries remained a common cause of injury and domestic injuries became more prevalent with lockdown. Social isolation negatively affected mental health resulting in several orthopedic injuries. Telehealth services and separation for COVID-positive and COVID-negative patients benefited both patients and providers. While hospitals and medical facilities are still facing COVID-19 case surges, it is important to understand how this pandemic has impacted preparation, care, and opportunities for prevention education and ongoing care.
