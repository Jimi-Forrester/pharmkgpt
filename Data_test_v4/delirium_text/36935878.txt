36935878|t|Genetics, Safety, Cost-Effectiveness, and Accessibility of Injectable Lipid-Lowering Agents: A Narrative Review.
36935878|a|Cardiovascular disease causes significant personal, financial, and societal burden and is a major cause of mortality and morbidity globally. Dyslipidemia has proven to be a major factor that contributes to its increased incidence; thus, since a long time, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapies have been employed to reduce coronary artery disease-associated mortality. The first-line therapy for hyperlipidemia and dyslipidemia is statins. Evidence showed that statins decrease the level of LDL-C resulting in a lower risk of CVD (20-25% for every decrease of 1 mmol/L). However, due to statin intolerance in some patients and despite using maximal doses, they have not been successful in lowering cardiovascular-associated mortality. Moreover, bococizumab was recently suspended due to its higher immunogenicity with time, resulting in less efficacy with long-term use. Alternatives to statins are PCSK9 inhibitors which are administered subcutaneously every two or four weeks. They are injectables with considerable lipid-lowering properties. This narrative review discusses their genetics, safety, tolerability, and cost-effectiveness. It also quantifies their benefit in certain subgroups by analyzing the findings from recent randomized clinical trials. Current data from phase 2 and 3 trials (ORION, ODYSSEY, and FOURIER) suggest a favorable profile for evolocumab, alirocumab, and inclisiran with minimal tolerable side effects and superior efficacy in statin-intolerant patients. Their cost-effectiveness has not yet been established clearly, but future outcomes seem promising.
