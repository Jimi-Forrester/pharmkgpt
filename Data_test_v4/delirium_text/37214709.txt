37214709|t|Appraisal of Pancreatic Lipase Inhibitory Potential of Ziziphus oenoplia (L.)Mill. Leaves by In Vitro and In Silico Approaches.
37214709|a|Pancreatic lipase is one of the crucial lipolytic enzymes of the gut that actively facilitates the digestion and absorption of the dietary triglycerides and cholesteryl esters. Although it has been deemed as one of the most reliable targets for the treatment of obesity and/or dyslipidemia, to date, orlistat is the only known FDA-approved, effective, oral pancreatic lipase inhibitor available for clinical use apart from the centrally acting antiobesity agents. However, it is known to be associated with adverse gastrointestinal and renal complications. In this study, we attempted to assess the antioxidant and porcine pancreatic lipase inhibitory potentials of Ziziphus oenoplia (L.)Mill. leaves through a systematic combination of in vitro and in silico approaches. Among the four different extracts including petroleum ether extract, ethyl acetate extract, ethanolic extract, and aqueous extract obtained through successive solvent extraction, the ethyl acetate extract has outperformed the other extracts and orderly displayed competent peroxide scavenging (IC50 value: 267.30 mug/mL) and porcine pancreatic lipase inhibitory (IC50 value: 444.44 mug/mL) potentials compared to the selected reference compounds: ascorbic acid (IC50 value: 251.50 mug/mL) and orlistat (IC50 value: 502.51 mug/mL) in the selected in vitro assay models. In addition, based on the molecular docking simulations of the six essential phytoconstituents of the leaves of Ziziphus oenoplia (L.)Mill. and their respective chemical analogues against the crystal structure of pancreatic lipase-colipase complex (PDB ID: 1LPB), four best-ranked molecules (PubChem CIDs: 15515703, 132582306, 11260294, and 44440845) have been proposed. Further, among these, the interaction potentials of the two top-ranked molecules (PubChem CIDs: 132582306 and 15515703) were analyzed through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at a trajectory of 100 ns. Finally, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) parameters were theoretically predicted for all of the molecules using Swiss ADME and ADMET lab2.0. In conclusion, Ziziphus oenoplia (L.)Mill. leaves could become a prominent source for various potent bioactive compounds that may serve as prospective leads for the development of clinically cognizable pancreatic lipase inhibitors, provided their pharmacokinetic and in particular toxicity properties are thoroughly optimized.
