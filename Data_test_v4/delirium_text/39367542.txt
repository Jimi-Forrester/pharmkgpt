39367542|t|Outcomes reported in elective colorectal cancer surgery research for older patients: A scoping review.
39367542|a|AIM: Colorectal cancer rates are increasing in older populations, who often have comorbidities and face higher surgical risks and mortality rates. Therefore, surgical outcomes, such as 5-year mortality rates, may not be appropriate, necessitating a focus on postoperative quality of life. However, determining optimal postoperative outcome measures for older colorectal cancer patients poses a challenge. This scoping review aimed to explore currently available data describing postoperative outcomes used to assess older patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery. METHOD: We conducted a comprehensive literature search of major electronic databases from inception to March 2023. Studies exploring frail or older individuals with colorectal cancer undergoing elective surgical procedures, and which reported postoperative outcomes, were included. Outcomes were categorized as surgery-specific versus person-centred and summarized using narrative synthesis. The type and rate of surgery-specific outcomes were tabulated. RESULTS: Of 1366 identified citations, 16 studies focused on person-centred outcomes and 66 reported exclusively on surgery-specific outcomes. Nine 'person-centred outcome' studies reported discharge destination, primarily home discharge. Postoperative delirium ranged from 8.2% to 18.1% in six studies. Four studies explored geriatric syndromes, three analysed activities of daily living, and three studies reported significant quality of life improvement. The 66 'surgery-specific outcome' studies assessed mortality (N = 61); length of stay (N = 40); postoperative complications (N = 47); readmission (N = 18); reoperation (N = 16); and survival (N = 42). CONCLUSION: Person-centred outcomes are underreported, but crucial for guiding patient management. Older patients require adequate information about their postoperative recovery period to enhance wellbeing. Future research must address this gap to improve care for older people undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery.
