37426210|t|Long-Term and Stable Dental Therapies via an In Situ Spontaneous Medicine Delivery System.
37426210|a|Chronic oral diseases are boring, long-term, and discomfort intense diseases, which endanger the physical and mental health of patients constantly. Traditional therapeutic methods based on medicines (including swallowing drugs, applying ointment, or injection in situ) bring much inconvenience and discomfort. A new method possessing accurate, long-term, stable, convenient, and comfortable features is in great need. In this study, we demonstrated a development of one spontaneous administration for the prevention and therapy on a series of oral diseases. By uniting dental resin and medicine-loaded mesoporous molecular sieve, nanoporous medical composite resin (NMCR) was synthesized by a simple physical mixing and light curing method. Physicochemical investigations of XRD, SEM, TEM, UV-vis, N2 adsorption, and biochemical experiments of antibacterial and pharmacodynamic evaluation on periodontitis treatment of SD rats were carried on to characterize an NMCR spontaneous medicine delivery system. Compared to existing pharmacotherapy and in situ treatments, NMCR can keep a quite long time of stable in situ medicine release during the whole therapeutic period. Taking the periodontitis treatment as an instance, the probing pocket depth value in a half-treatment time of 0.69 from NMCR@MINO was much lower than that of 1.34 from the present commercial Periocline ointment, showing an over two times effect.
