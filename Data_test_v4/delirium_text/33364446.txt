33364446|t|Amyloid fibril formation is suppressed in microgravity.
33364446|a|In the future, humans may live in space because of global pollution and weather fluctuations. In microgravity, convection does not occur, which may change the amyloidogenicity of proteins. However, the effect of gravity on amyloid fibril formation is unclear and remains to be elucidated. Here, we analyzed the effect of microgravity on amyloid fibril formation of amyloidogenic proteins including insulin, amyloid beta42 (Abeta42), and transthyretin (TTR). We produced microgravity (10-3 g) by using the gravity controller Gravite. Human insulin, Abeta42, and human wild-type TTR (TTRwt) were incubated at pH 3.0, 7.0, and 3.5 at 37  C, respectively, in 1 g on the ground or in microgravity. We measured amyloidogenicity via the thioflavin T (ThT) method and cell-based 1-fluoro-2,5-bis[(E)-3-carboxy-4-hydroxystyryl]benzene (FSB) assay. ThT fluorescence intensity and cell-based FSB assay results for human insulin samples were decreased in microgravity compared with results in 1 g. Abeta42 samples did not differ in ThT fluorescence intensity in microgravity and in 1 g on the ground. However, in the cell-based FSB assay, the staining intensity was reduced in microgravity compared with that on 1 g. Human TTRwt tended to form fewer amyloid fibrils in ThT fluorescence intensity and cell-based FSB assays in microgravity than in 1 g. Human insulin and Abeta42 showed decreased amyloid fibril formation in microgravity compared with that in 1 g. Human TTRwt tended to form fewer amyloid fibrils in microgravity. Our experiments suggest that the earth's gravity may be an accelerating factor for amyloid fibril formation.
