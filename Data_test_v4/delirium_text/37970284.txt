37970284|t|Adult Onset Episodic Encephalopathy Due to Citrin Deficiency-A Case Report.
37970284|a|Hyperammonemia is a rare cause of adult episodic encephalopathy. Citrin deficiency resulting in citrullinemia type 2 (CTLN2) can lead to recurrent delirium in adults. Here we report a case of adult onset episodic encephalopathy due to citrin deficiency. A 40 years old male presented with one-year history of episodic encephalopathy triggered by high protein and fat diet. He also had chronic pancreatitis and subacute intestinal obstruction which is a novel manifestation of CTLN2. Evaluation showed elevated blood liver enzymes, ammonia, and citrulline. MRI brain showed frontal hyperintensities and bulky basal ganglia which have not been reported. Diagnosis was confirmed by next-generation sequencing which showed a novel variant c. 1591G > A in exon15 of SLC25A13. Hyperammonemic syndromes should be considered in differential diagnosis of episodic encephalopathy in adults. This report shows novel features of subacute intestinal obstruction and MRI findings in CTLN2 expanding spectrum of manifestation.
