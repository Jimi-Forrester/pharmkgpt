39012418|a|Depression is the fourth most serious disease in the world. Left untreated, it is a cause of suicide attempts, emergence or exacerbation worsening of serious diseases, bodily and mental disorders, as well as increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, stroke, diabetes, and obesity, as well as endocrine and neurological diseases. Frequent coexistence of depression and other diseases requires the simultaneous use of several drugs from different therapeutic groups, which very often interact and intensify comorbidities, sometimes unrelated mechanisms. Sufficient awareness of potential drug interactions is critical in clinical practice, as it allows both to avoid disruption of proper pharmacotherapy and achieve substantive results. Therefore, this review aims to analyze the interactions of antidepressants with other concomitant medications. Against the backdrop of experimental research and a thorough analysis of the up-to-date literature, the authors discuss in detail the mechanisms and effects of action of individual drug interactions and adaptogens, including the latest antidepressants.
