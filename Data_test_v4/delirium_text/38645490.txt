38645490|a|Objectives: Renal and testicular disorders are primarily associated with oxidative damage and inflammation. Here, alpha-pinene (a type of monoterpene) was investigated for its effect on oxidative/nitrosative stress and the expression of inflammatory and apoptotic factors in the kidneys and testes of rats treated with CCl4. Materials and Methods: CCl4 was injected intraperitoneally (IP) at a dose of 2 ml/kg (twice a week for six weeks). Alpha-pinene (50 mg/kg/day, IP) was also treated during the same period. Results: CCl4 increased the level of malondialdehyde (P<0.01 in the kidney and P<0.001 in the testis) and nitric oxide (P<0.001 in the kidney and P<0.01 in the testis) and decreased the levels of glutathione (P<0.05) in the kidneys and testicles of rats. CCl4 also reduced the catalase enzyme activity in the kidneys (P<0.05) but did not affect its activity in the testis. In addition, CCl4 enhanced the mRNA expression of TNF-alpha (P<0.01), nuclear factor-kappaB (P<0.05), and Bax (P<0.05 in the kidney and P<0.01 in the testis) and decreased the expression of Bcl-2 (P<0.05) in both organs. Alpha-pinene prevented all the mentioned changes, but it did not influence the expression of Bcl-2 in the kidneys of rats receiving CCl4. Conclusion: Alpha-pinene may have the potential to prevent renal and testicular diseases by strengthening the antioxidant system in the kidneys and testis, and inhibiting oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis caused by CCl4.
