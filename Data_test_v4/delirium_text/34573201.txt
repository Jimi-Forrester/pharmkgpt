34573201|t|Comparing Pathological Risk Factors for Dementia between Cognitively Normal Japanese and Americans.
34573201|a|The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative showed that Japanese had significantly lower brain Abeta burden than Americans among a cognitively normal population. This cross-sectional study aimed to compare vascular disease burden, Abeta burden, and neurodegeneration between cognitively normal elderly Japanese and Americans. Japanese and American participants were matched for age (+-4-year-old), sex, and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Brain vascular disease burden and brain Abeta burden were measured using white matter lesions (WMLs) and 11C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) retention, respectively. Neurodegeneration was measured using hippocampal volumes and cortical thickness. A total of 95 Japanese and 95 Americans were recruited (50.5% men, mean age = 82). Compared to Americans, Japanese participants had larger WMLs, and a similar global Abeta standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), cortical thickness and hippocampal volumes. Japanese had significantly lower regional Abeta SUVR in the anterior ventral striatum, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus. Cognitively normal elderly Japanese and Americans had different profiles regarding vascular disease and Abeta burden. This suggests that multiple risk factors are likely to be involved in the development of dementia. Additionally, Japanese might have a lower risk of dementia due to lower Abeta burden than Americans. Longitudinal follow-up of these cohorts is warranted to ascertain the predictive accuracy of these findings.
