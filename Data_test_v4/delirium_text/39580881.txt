39580881|t|Postoperative delirium in geriatric orthopedic and trauma patients: Care begins preoperatively!
39580881|a|Delirium is a common and serious neuropsychiatric syndrome affecting older adults, particularly after surgery. It manifests in three forms: hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed, with symptoms ranging from lethargy and inattention to agitation and confusion. Delirium is often misdiagnosed or overlooked, especially in its hypoactive form, which can delay treatment and worsen patient outcomes. Distinguishing delirium from dementia is crucial, as delirium is typically reversible with prompt intervention. This article, presented in a case study format, explores the assessment and management of delirium in postoperative patients, highlighting the use of validated tools such as the Delirium Elderly at Risk (DEAR) and the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Early identification of at-risk patients and timely screening are critical for improving outcomes. Non-pharmacological interventions, including reorientation, sleep hygiene, sensory aids, early mobilization, and family involvement, play a vital role in preventing and managing delirium. The article emphasizes the importance of nurses in detecting early signs of delirium and implementing preventative measures. A multidisciplinary approach, integrating ongoing screening, patient-centered care, and non-pharmacological strategies, is essential for reducing the incidence and severity of delirium. Early detection and appropriate management can significantly improve recovery and reduce long-term complications, promoting better outcomes in older adults undergoing surgery.
