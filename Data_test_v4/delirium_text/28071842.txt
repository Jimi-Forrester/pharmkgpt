28071842|t|Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy to Distinguish Toxic Oligomers from Abeta1-42 Fibrils at the Nanometer Scale.
28071842|a|For the first time, natural Abeta1-42 fibrils (WT) implicated in Alzheimer's disease, as well as two synthetic mutants forming less toxic amyloid fibrils (L34T) and highly toxic oligomers (oG37C), are chemically characterized at the scale of a single structure using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS). While the proportion of TERS features associated with amino acid residues is similar for the three peptides, a careful examination of amide I and amide III bands allows us to clearly distinguish WT and L34T fibers organized in parallel beta-sheets from the small and more toxic oG37C oligomers organized in anti-parallel beta-sheets.
