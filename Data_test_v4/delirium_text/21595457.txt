21595457|t|Competition between Li+ and Mg2+ in metalloproteins. Implications for lithium therapy.
21595457|a|Lithium is used (in the form of soluble salts) to treat bipolar disorder and has been considered as a possible drug in treating chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. One of the proposed mechanisms of Li(+) action involves a competition between the alien Li(+) and native Mg(2+) for metal-binding sites and subsequent inhibition of key enzymes involved in specific neurotransmission pathways, but not vital Mg(2+) proteins in the cell. This raises the following intriguing questions: Why does Li(+) replace Mg(2+) only in enzymes involved in bipolar disorder, but not in Mg(2+) proteins essential to cells? In general, what factors allow monovalent Li(+) to displace divalent Mg(2+) in proteins? Specifically, how do the composition, overall charge, and solvent exposure of the metal-binding site as well as a metal-bound phosphate affect the selectivity of Li(+) over Mg(2+)? Among the many possible factors, we show that the competition between Mg(2+) and Li(+) depends on the net charge of the metal complex, which is determined by the numbers of metal cations and negatively charged ligands, as well as the relative solvent exposure of the metal cavity. The protein itself is found to select Mg(2+) over the monovalent Li(+) by providing a solvent-inaccessible Mg(2+)-binding site lined by negatively charged Asp/Glu, whereas the cell machinery was found to select Mg(2+) among other competing divalent cations in the cellular fluids such as Ca(2+) and Zn(2+) by maintaining a high concentration ratio of Mg(2+) to its biogenic competitor in various biological compartments. The calculations reveal why Li(+) replaces Mg(2+) only in enzymes that are known targets of Li(+) therapy, but not in Mg(2+) enzymes essential to cells, and also reveal features common to the former that differ from those in the latter proteins.
