37677911|a|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Previous studies have investigated whether milk consumption has a role in preventing the development of cognitive impairment, but the results were inconsistent. Importantly, most of them have disregarded the role of different types of milk. This study aimed to examine the associations between different types of milk consumption and the risk of dementia. METHODS: In this large-scale cohort study, participants without cognitive impairment at baseline were included from the UK Biobank. The type of milk mainly used was self-reported at baseline, including full-cream milk, skimmed-milk, soy milk, other milk, and no milk. The primary outcome was all-cause dementia. Secondary outcomes included Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. RESULTS: Of the 307,271 participants included in the study (mean age 56.3 [SD 8.1] years), 3789 (1.2%) incident all-cause dementia cases were observed over a median follow-up of 12.3 years. After adjustment for potential confounders, only soy milk consumers had a statistically significantly lower risk of all-cause dementia compared with no milk consumers (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.90). When compared with soy milk non-consumers consisting of full-cream milk, skimmed-milk, and other milk consumers, soy milk consumers still showed a lower risk of all-cause dementia (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.92), and there was no significant interaction with genetic risk for dementia (P for interaction = 0.15). Soy milk consumers showed a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.94; P = 0.02), while the association was not significant for vascular dementia (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.12; P = 0.14). CONCLUSIONS: The main consumption of soy milk was associated with a lower risk of dementia, particularly non-vascular dementia. Additional studies are needed to investigate how this association varies with the dose or frequency of the consumption of soy milk and to examine the generalizability of these findings in different populations.
