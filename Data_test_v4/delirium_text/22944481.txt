22944481|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is an age-associated disease characterized by amyloid deposition in cerebral and meningeal vessel walls. CAA is detected in the majority of the individuals with dementia and also in a large number of non-demented elderly individuals. In addition, CAA is strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Mechanical consequences including intra-cerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage remains CAA most feared complication, but only a small fraction of CAA results in severe bleeding. On the hand the non-mechanical consequences in cerebrovascular regulation are prevalent and may be even more deleterious. Studies of animal models have provided strong evidence linking the vasoactive Abeta 1-40, the main species found in CAA, to disturbances in endothelial-dependent factors, disrupting cerebrovascular regulation Here, we aimed to review experimental findings regarding the non-mechanical consequences of CAA for cerebrovascular regulation and discuss the implications of these results to clinical practice.
