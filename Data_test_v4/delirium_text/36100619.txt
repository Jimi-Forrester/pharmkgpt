36100619|a|In lymphedema, proinflammatory cytokine-mediated progressive cascades always occur, leading to macroscopic fibrosis. However, no methods are practically available for measuring lymphedema-induced fibrosis before its deterioration. Technically, CT can visualize fibrosis in superficial and deep locations. For standardized measurement, verification of deep learning (DL)-based recognition was performed. A cross-sectional, observational cohort trial was conducted. After narrowing window width of the absorptive values in CT images, SegNet-based semantic segmentation model of every pixel into 5 classes (air, skin, muscle/water, fat, and fibrosis) was trained (65%), validated (15%), and tested (20%). Then, 4 indices were formulated and compared with the standardized circumference difference ratio (SCDR) and bioelectrical impedance (BEI) results. In total, 2138 CT images of 27 chronic unilateral lymphedema patients were analyzed. Regarding fibrosis segmentation, the mean boundary F1 score and accuracy were 0.868 and 0.776, respectively. Among 19 subindices of the 4 indices, 73.7% were correlated with the BEI (partial correlation coefficient: 0.420-0.875), and 13.2% were correlated with the SCDR (0.406-0.460). The mean subindex of Index 2 [Formula: see text] presented the highest correlation. DL has potential applications in CT image-based lymphedema-induced fibrosis recognition. The subtraction-type formula might be the most promising estimation method.
