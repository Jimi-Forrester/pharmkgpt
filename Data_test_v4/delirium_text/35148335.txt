35148335|t|Differences in the frequency of subjective geriatric complaints along with aging and their associations with physical function, multimorbidity, and mood: A cross-sectional study.
35148335|a|BACKGROUND: In this study, we investigated subjective geriatric complaints (SGCs) as conditions regarding health concerns in community-dwelling older people and analyzed their frequencies with aging and relationships with other factors. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 10,434 older people living in a community with a representative aging population in Japan. A questionnaire was sent by mail to those who had not applied for formal care needs certification. The presence of and concern for symptoms common in old age were asked as SGCs, as were physical function levels, multimorbidity, and depression. Categorical principal component analysis (CATPCA) of the symptoms was performed, and the association between the obtained components and other factors was analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 73.7 +- 6.1 years, and 52.5% were women. On average, they had 1.72 +- 1.57 SGCs, which showed a gradual increase with age. The results of the CATPCA revealed four components: SGC1, excretory/circulatory/swallowing complaints; SGC2, audiovisual complaints; SGC3, neurological complaints; and SGC4, musculoskeletal complaints. All SGC components were independently associated with physical function, multimorbidity, and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Each SGC showed various frequencies and differences along with aging, and SGCs were classified into four components that were thought to share a common background. These findings could contribute to the planning of better health management strategies for older people.
