34389398|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a profoundly debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized most notably by progressive cognitive decline, but also agitation and behavioral disturbances that are extremely disruptive to patient and caregiver. Current pharmacological treatments for these symptoms have limited efficacy and significant side effects. We have recently reported the discovery of Compound 24, an M4 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) that is potent, highly selective, and devoid of cholinergic-like side effects in rats. In order to further evaluate the translatability of the effects of compound 24 in primates, here we describe the effect of Compound 24 on three behavioral and cognition assays in rhesus monkeys, the stimulant induced motor activity (SIMA) assay, the object retrieval detour task (ORD), and the visuo-spatial paired-associates learning (vsPAL) task. As far as we know, this is the first such characterization of an M4 PAM in non-human primate. Compound 24 and the clinical standard olanzapine attenuated amphetamine induced hyperactivity to a similar degree. In addition, Compound 24 demonstrated procognitive effects in scopolamine-impaired ORD and vsPAL, and these effects were of similar magnitude to donepezil. These findings suggest that M4 PAMs may be beneficial to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, which are marked by behavioral disturbances as well as deficits in cognitive function.
