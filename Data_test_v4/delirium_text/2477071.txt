2477071|t|CSF corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in Alzheimer's disease: its relationship to severity of dementia and monoamine metabolites.
2477071|a|The concentration of corticotropin-releasing factor-like immunoreactivity (CRF-LI) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 15 probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with mild to moderate dementia and 10 neurologically normal age-matched controls was examined. There were no significant alterations in the mean CSF CRF-LI concentration in AD compared to controls. However, in the AD group, CSF CRF-LI correlated significantly with the global neuropsychological impairment ratings, suggesting that greater cognitive impairment was associated with lower CSF CRF-LI concentrations. There was a significant reduction in the CSF concentration of homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the AD patients, and there was a positive correlation between the concentration of CRF-LI and 5-HIAA in CSF. This latter finding suggests that serotoninergic neuronal systems may interact with CRF-containing neurons.
