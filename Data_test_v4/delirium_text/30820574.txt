30820574|t|MSGP: the first database of the protein components of the mammalian stress granules.
30820574|a|In response to different stress stimuli, cells transiently form stress granules (SGs) in order to protect themselves and re-establish homeostasis. Besides these important cellular functions, SGs are now being implicated in different human diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. SGs are ribonucleoprotein granules, constituted by a variety of different types of proteins, RNAs, factors involved in translation and signaling molecules, being capable of regulating mRNA translation to facilitate stress response. However, until now a complete list of the SG components has not been available. Therefore, we aimer at identifying and linting in an open access database all the proteins described so far as components of SGs. The identification was made through an exhaustive search of studies listed in PubMed and double checked. Moreover, for each identified protein several details were also gathered from public databases, such as the molecular function, the cell types in which they were detected, the type of stress stimuli used to induce SG formation and the reference of the study describing the recruitment of the component to SGs. Expression levels in the context of different neurodegenerative diseases were also obtained and are also described in the database. The Mammalian Stress Granules Proteome is available at https://msgp.pt/, being a new and unique open access online database, the first to list all the protein components of the SGs identified so far. The database constitutes an important and valuable tool for researchers in this research area of growing interest.
