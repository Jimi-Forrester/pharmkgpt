33328613|t|VDAC1 in the diseased myocardium and the effect of VDAC1-interacting compound on atrial fibrosis induced by hyperaldosteronism.
33328613|a|The voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) is a key player in mitochondrial function. VDAC1 serves as a gatekeeper mediating the fluxes of ions, nucleotides, and other metabolites across the outer mitochondrial membrane, as well as the release of apoptogenic proteins initiating apoptotic cell death. VBIT-4, a VDAC1 oligomerization inhibitor, was recently shown to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, as validated in mouse models of lupus and type-2 diabetes. In the present study, we explored the expression of VDAC1 in the diseased myocardium of humans and rats. In addition, we evaluated the effect of VBIT-4 treatment on the atrial structural and electrical remodeling of rats exposed to excessive aldosterone levels. Immunohistochemical analysis of commercially available human cardiac tissues revealed marked overexpression of VDAC1 in post-myocardial infarction patients, as well as in patients with chronic ventricular dilatation dysfunction. In agreement, rats exposed to myocardial infarction or to excessive aldosterone had a marked increase of VDAC1 in both ventricular and atrial tissues. Immunofluorescence staining indicated a punctuated appearance typical for mitochondrial-localized VDAC1. Finally, VBIT-4 treatment attenuated the atrial fibrotic load of rats exposed to excessive aldosterone without a notable effect on the susceptibility to atrial fibrillation episodes induced by burst pacing. Our results indicate that VDAC1 overexpression is associated with myocardial abnormalities in common pathological settings. Our data also indicate that inhibition of the VDAC1 can reduce excessive fibrosis in the atrial myocardium, a finding which may have important therapeutic implications. The exact mechanism s of this beneficial effect need further studies.
