32837194|a|The outbreak of COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries is worrisome due to the social inequalities in these countries, their limited health budgets and the significant burden of other acute and chronic diseases. The leap in the number of cases in Brazil has imposed a huge strain on the healthcare system. We sought to provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges encountered by pharmacy services in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic emergency in Brazil and discuss the role of clinical pharmacists in this context. Pharmaceutical services play a key role in the emergency response to the pandemic. The pharmacy workforce has been actively working to manage drug shortages, redesign workflow, and review drug formularies/protocols to improve safety for patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). COVID-19 patients may present high risk in the use of medications and clinical pharmacists can contribute substantially as part of a multidisciplinary team to improve outcomes in drug therapy in severe and critical illness. The participation of pharmacists as members of antimicrobial stewardship programs should be enhanced to ensure appropriate and safe use of antibiotics in this context. HCPs should be encouraged to seek improvements in the performance of pharmaceutical services and innovative practices to respond to the pandemic. Further studies are needed to generate knowledge on COVID-19 to improve patient care in vulnerable populations.
