35049206|t|Severe Guillain-Barre syndrome associated with chronic hepatitis B: A case report and literature review.
35049206|a|RATIONALE: Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a postinfectious autoimmune peripheral neuropathy characterized by acute paralysis of the limbs. Clinically, extrahepatic manifestations of neurologic involvement in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are uncommon. Little attention has been paid to the relationship between GBS and CHB viral infection. PATIENT CONCERNS: We presented a severe case of a 34-year-old man with general fatigue, anorexia, jaundice, numbness, and even muscle atrophy in the limbs, and respiratory failure during an acute exacerbation of CHB. DIAGNOSES: Serological liver enzymes test confirmed an acute exacerbation of CHB. Nerve conduction studies revealed the features of acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy combined with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed albuminocytologic dissociation. Clinical manifestations and the test results were consistent with a diagnosis of severe CHB-related GBS. INTERVENTIONS: He was treated with mechanical ventilation, 2 courses of intravenous immunoglobulin, antichronic hepatitis B drugs therapy supplemented by hepatoprotection, acupuncture and rehabilitation. OUTCOMES: After 29 days of hospitalization, his neurological condition improved. At a 6-month follow-up visit, he was able to walk with the support of another person. LESSONS: The acute exacerbation of CHB may be a potential predisposing factor for the onset of GBS. This case is a reminder to clinicians that during the acute exacerbation of CHB, patients with neurological symptoms in the limbs should be considered for potential CHB-related GBS.
