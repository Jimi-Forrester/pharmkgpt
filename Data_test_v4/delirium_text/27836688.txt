27836688|t|Pathologic significance of SET/I2PP2A-mediated PP2A and non-PP2A pathways in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
27836688|a|SET (SE translocation, SET), a constitutive inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is a multifunctional oncoprotein involved in DNA replication, histone modification, nucleosome assembly, gene transcription and cell proliferation. It is widely expressed in human tissues including the gonadal system and brain. Intensive studies have shown that overexpressed SET plays an important role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and may also contribute to the malignant transformation of breast and ovarian cancers. Recent studies indicated that through interaction with PP2A, SET may upregulate androgen biosynthesis and contribute to hyperandrogenism in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. This review article summarizes data concerning the SET expression in ovaries from PCOS and normal women, and analyzes the role/regulatory mechanism of SET for androgen biosynthesis in PCOS, as well as the significance of this action in the development of PCOS. The potential value of SET-triggered pathway as a therapeutic target and the application of anti-SET reagents for treating hyperandrogenism in PCOS patients are also discussed.
