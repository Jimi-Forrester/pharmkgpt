33959691|a|The significant worldwide increase in obesity has become a major health problem. Excess adiposity has been extensively linked to inflammation. Recently, studies have shown that dietary intake and microbiota dysbiosis can affect the health of the gut and lead to low-grade systemic inflammation, worsening the state of obesity and further exacerbating inflammation. The latter is shown to decrease iron status and potentially increase the risk of anemia by inhibiting iron absorption. Hence, anemia of obesity is independent of iron intake and does not properly respond to increased iron ingestion. Therefore, countries with a high rate of obesity should assess the health impact of fortification and supplementation with iron due to their potential drawbacks. This review tries to elucidate the relation between inflammation and iron status to better understand the etiology of anemia of obesity and chronic diseases and wisely design any dietary or medical interventions for the management of anemia and/or obesity.
