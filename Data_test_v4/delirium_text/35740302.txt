35740302|t|EpisomiR, a New Family of miRNAs, and Its Possible Roles in Human Diseases.
35740302|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are synthesized through a canonical pathway and play a role in human diseases, such as cancers and cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and chronic inflammatory diseases. The development of sequencing technologies has enabled the identification of variations in noncoding miRNAs. These miRNA variants, called isomiRs, are generated through a non-canonical pathway, by several enzymes that alter the length and sequence of miRNAs. The isomiR family is, now, expanding further to include episomiRs, which are miRNAs with different modifications. Since recent findings have shown that isomiRs reflect the cell-specific biological function of miRNAs, knowledge about episomiRs and isomiRs can, possibly, contribute to the optimization of diagnosis and therapeutic technology for precision medicine.
