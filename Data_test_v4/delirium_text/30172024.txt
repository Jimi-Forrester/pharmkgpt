30172024|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is the precursor of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, whose accumulation in the brain is associated with Alzheimer's disease. APP is also expressed on the platelet surface and Abeta peptides are platelet agonists. The physiological role of APP is largely unknown. In neurons, APP acts as an adhesive receptor, facilitating integrin-mediated cell adhesion, while in platelets it regulates coagulation and venous thrombosis. In this work, we analyzed platelets from APP KO mice to investigate whether membrane APP supports platelet adhesion to physiological and pathological substrates. We found that APP-null platelets adhered and spread normally on collagen, von Willebrand Factor or fibrinogen. However, adhesion on immobilized Abeta peptides Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42 and Abeta25-35 was completely abolished in platelets lacking APP. By contrast, platelet activation and aggregation induced by Abeta peptides occurred normally in the absence of APP. Adhesion of APP-transfected HEK293 to Abeta peptides was significantly higher than that of control cells expressing low levels of APP. Co-coating of Abeta1-42 and Abeta25-35 with collagen strongly potentiated platelet adhesion when whole blood from wild type mice was perfused at arterial shear rate, but had no effects with blood from APP KO mice. These results demonstrate that APP selectively mediates platelet adhesion to Abeta under static condition but not platelet aggregation, and is responsible for Abeta-promoted potentiation of thrombus formation under flow. Therefore, APP may facilitate an early step in thrombus formation when Abeta peptides accumulate in cerebral vessel walls or atherosclerotic plaques.
