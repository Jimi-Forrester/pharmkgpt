30691166|t|Proteomic Analysis of Cyclic Ketamine Compounds Ability to Induce Neural Differentiation in Human Adult Mesenchymal Stem Cells.
30691166|a|Neural regeneration is of great interest due to its potential to treat traumatic brain injuries and diseases that impact quality of life. Growth factor mediated differentiation can take up to several weeks to months to produce the cell of interest whereas chemical stimulation may be as minimal as a few hours. The smaller time scale is of great clinical relevance. Adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) were treated for up to 24 h with a novel differentiation media containing the cyclic ketamine compounds to direct neurogenic induction. The extent of differentiation was investigated by proteome changes occurring during the process. The treatments indicated the ADSCs responded favorably to the neurogenic induction media by presenting a number of morphological cues of neuronal phenotype previously seen and a higher cell population post induction compared to previous studies. Furthermore, approximately 3500 proteins were analyzed and identified by mass spectrometric iTRAQ analyses. The bioinformatics analyses revealed hundreds of proteins whose expression level changes were statistically significant and biologically relevant to neurogenesis and annotated as being involved in neurogenic development. Complementing this, the Bioplex cytokine assay profiles present evidence of decreased panel of stress response cytokines and a relative increase in those involved in neurogenesis.
