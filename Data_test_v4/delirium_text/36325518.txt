36325518|t|Reduced Narcotic Utilization in Total Joint Arthroplasty Patients in an Urban Tertiary Care Center.
36325518|a|Background: Opioid use after total joint arthroplasty must be balanced against the risks of opioid dependence and diversion. This study sought to define the baseline patient characteristics and discharge opioid use after the initiation of a preoperative and postoperative institutional opioid prescription protocol in a population with a high prevalence of opioid dependence and substance use. Methods: Data on 1004 patients undergoing total joint arthroplasties from July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2019, were retrospectively reviewed. Demographics were collected, and data were grouped into high- and low-discharge opioid groups based on 1 standard deviation above or below the mean. Patient characteristics of the high and low groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance and Pearson chi-square test. Results: The prevalence of preoperative opioid dependence was 21.8%. The mean discharge opioid prescription was 264 morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs). The cutoffs of high- and low-use groups were above 424 MMEs and below 104.5 MMEs. The high-discharge opioid group was more likely to be male, younger, to have a history of preoperative opioid use, to undergo general anesthesia, and to be uninsured. The lower-discharge opioid group was more likely to be older, female, to have Medicare, and to stay approximately 1 day longer in the hospital. Body mass index, intraoperative opioid requirement, American Society of Anesthesiologists Classification score, race, total knee vs total hip arthroplasty, or surgical approach for total hip arthroplasty did not affect discharge opioid prescriptions. Conclusions: Reduction of opioid prescriptions at discharge in total joint arthroplasty patients may be possible with the use of preoperative and postoperative protocols, optimizing patient risk factors for opioid use and utilizing a patient-specific opioid taper regimen.
