37426775|t|Deep brain stimulation, lesioning, focused ultrasound: update on utility.
37426775|a|Procedures for neurological disorders such as Parkinsons Disease (PD), Essential Tremor (ET), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Tourette's Syndrome (TS), and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) tend to overlap. Common therapeutic procedures include deep brain stimulation (DBS), lesioning, and focused ultrasound (FUS). There has been significant change and innovation regarding targeting mechanisms and new advancements in this field allowing for better clinical outcomes in patients with severe cases of these conditions. In this review, we discuss advancements and recent discoveries regarding these three procedures and how they have led to changes in utilization in certain conditions. We further discuss the advantages and drawbacks of these treatments in certain conditions and the emerging advancements in brain-computer interface (BCI) and its utility as a therapeutic for neurological disorders.
