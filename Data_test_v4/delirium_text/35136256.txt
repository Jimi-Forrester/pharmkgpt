35136256|a|BACKGROUND: Despite coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) being a major health crisis in the current times, only a few studies have addressed its potential direct effect on mental health, especially among COVID-19 patients. AIMS: This study was conducted to assess the mental health of COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In cross sectional study, mental health status of 301 symptomatic and 200 asymptomatic COVID-19 participants was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire-28. RESULTS: Around 8.78% COVID-19 patients were found to be psychologically distressed that was predominantly higher among symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Risk of psychological distress was significantly higher in females, living in nuclear families and having a history of addiction. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients suffer from psychological distress, which needs to be addressed to cope well with this pandemic situation.
