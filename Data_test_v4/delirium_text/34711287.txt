34711287|a|BACKGROUND: Multielectrode arrays are widely used to analyze the effects of potentially toxic compounds, as well as to evaluate neuroprotective agents upon the activity of neural networks in short- and long-term cultures. Multielectrode arrays provide a way of non-destructive analysis of spontaneous and evoked neuronal activity, allowing to model neurodegenerative diseases in vitro. Here, we provide an overview on how these devices are currently used in research on the amyloid-beta peptide and its role in Alzheimer's disease, the most common neurodegenerative disorder. MAIN BODY: Most of the studies analysed here indicate fast responses of neuronal cultures towards aggregated forms of amyloid-beta, leading to increases of spike frequency and impairments of long-term potentiation. This in turn suggests that this peptide might play a crucial role in causing the typical neuronal dysfunction observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of studies using multielectrode arrays to examine the effect of the amyloid-beta peptide onto neural cultures or whole compartments is currently limited, they still show how this technique can be used to not only investigate the interneuronal communication in neural networks, but also making it possible to examine the effects onto synaptic currents. This makes multielectrode arrays a powerful tool in future research on neurodegenerative diseases.
