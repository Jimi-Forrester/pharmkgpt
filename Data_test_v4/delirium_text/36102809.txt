36102809|t|Descending thoracic aortic repair outcomes for chronic aortic dissection: a single-centre experience.
36102809|a|OBJECTIVES: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair is a widely accepted treatment for chronic aortic dissection because of good early results compared to open surgical repair. We provide early and long-term results of descending thoracic aortic repair for chronic aortic dissection. METHODS: Patients who underwent descending thoracic aortic repair for chronic aortic dissection between January 2012 and December 2020 at Kawasaki Aortic Centre were included in this analysis. RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-two patients (median age, 64 years; interquartile range, 52-75 years) were included. The median duration of follow-up was 3.2 years (interquartile range, 1.5-5.2 years). The early mortality rate was 2.0% (n = 10); strokes occurred in 17 patients (3.5%); and spinal cord injuries occurred in 30 patients (6.1%). Early major adverse events including early death, stroke, spinal cord injury, tracheostomy and haemodialysis at the time of discharge occurred in 62 patients. Multivariable analysis indicated that age > 70 years and non-elective surgery were predictors of early major adverse events. Among patients without both risk factors (i.e. low-risk patients), 1 early death (0.4%), 3 strokes (1.5%) and 1 spinal cord injury (0.4%) were observed, 2 tracheostomies were performed (0.8%) and no patients required haemodialysis at the time of hospital discharge. The 5-year survival rate was 87.2%. The cumulative incidence of chronic aortic dissection-related aortic reintervention at 5 years was 7.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Descending thoracic aortic repair for chronic aortic dissection resulted in good early and long-term results, and it can serve as the gold standard for low-risk patients.
