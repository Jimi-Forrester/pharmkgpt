37101056|a|Amongst hip fracture admissions, mortality is higher in men than in women. However, sex differences in other care-quality measures have not been well-documented. We aimed to examine sex differences in mortality as well as a wide range of underlying health indicators and clinical outcomes in adults >= 60 year of age admitted with hip fractures from their own homes to a single NHS hospital between April-2009 and June-2019. Sex differences in delirium, length of stay (LOS) and mortality in hospital, readmission, and discharge destination, were examined by logistic regression. There were 787 women and 318 men of similar mean age (+- SD): 83.1 year (+- 8.6) and 82.5 year (+- 9.0), respectively (P = 0.269). There were no sex differences in history of dementia or diabetes, anticholinergic burden, pre-fracture physical function, American Society of Anesthesiologists grades, or surgical and medical management. Stroke and ischaemic heart disease, polypharmacy, and alcohol consumption were more common in men. After adjustment for these differences and age, men had greater risk of delirium (with or without cognitive impairment) within one day of surgery: OR = 1.75 (95%CI 1.14-2.68), LOS >= 3 weeks in hospital: OR = 1.52 (1.07-2.16), mortality in hospital: OR = 2.04 (1.14-3.64), and readmission once or more after 30 days of a discharge: OR = 1.53 (1.03-2.31). Men had a lower risk of a new discharge to residential/nursing care: OR = 0.46 (0.23-0.93). The present study revealed that, in addition to a greater risk of mortality than women, men also had many other adverse health outcomes. These findings, which have not been well-documented, serve to stimulate future targeted preventive strategies and research.
