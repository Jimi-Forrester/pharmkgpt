21204347|a|It is now more than two decades since the first proposal of a  Ca<sup>2+</sup> hypothesis of aging  [1]. In its mature formulation, the hypothesis aimed to provide a working hypothesis for explaining not only the aging process but also Alzheimer s disease (AD). Drawing on many neurophysiological processes and mechanisms, the hypothesis contained six interrelated key elements [2], providing an extremely wide explanatory blanket. The exposition of these elements is worth repeating not only for historical reasons and to illustrate the breath of the proposal, but also because it still represents the source of some misunderstandings.
