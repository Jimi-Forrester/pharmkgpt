39031364|t|Amyloid-beta Pathology Is the Common Nominator Proteinopathy of the Primate Brain Aging.
39031364|a|Senile plaques, mainly diffuse, and cerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) angiopathy are prevalent in the aging brain of non-human primates, from lemurs to non-human Hominidae. Abeta but not hyper-phosphorylated tau (HPtau) pathology is the common nominator proteinopathy of non-human primate brain aging. The abundance of Abeta in the aging primate brain is well tolerated, and the impact on cognitive functions is usually limited to particular tasks. In contrast, human brain aging is characterized by the early appearance of HPtau pathology, mainly forming neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neurites of neuritic plaques, and neuropil threads, preceding Abeta deposits by several decades and by its severity progressing from selected nuclei of the brain stem, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus to the limbic system, neocortex, and other brain regions. Neurofibrillary tangles correlate with cognitive impairment and dementia in advanced cases. Abeta pathology is linked in humans to altered membrane protein and lipid composition, particularly involving lipid rafts. Although similar membrane alterations are unknown in non-human primates, membrane senescence is postulated to cause the activated beta-amyloidogenic pathway, and Abeta pathology is the prevailing signature of non-human and human primate brain aging.
