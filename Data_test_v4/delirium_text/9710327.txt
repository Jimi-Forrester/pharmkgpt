9710327|t|Alzheimer's disease as a defect of neuronal autotrophism: a hypothetical analogy with amateur radio operation.
9710327|a|Amyloid precursor protein appears to be a signaling protein that plays a role in neuronal autotrophism, indicating integrity of the nerve terminal and synapse. Analogous to amateur radio operation with a damaged antenna in which further attempts to improve signal propagation can result in damage to the radio equipment, abnormal signaling by the secreted amyloid precursor protein stimulates compensatory metabolic activity in the neuron that ultimately leads to paired helical filament formation (neurofibrillary tangles) and further neuronal dysfunction and death.
