36050603|t|Potentially inappropriate medications according to PRISCUS list and FORTA (Fit fOR The Aged) classification in geriatric psychiatry: a cross-sectional study.
36050603|a|Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) constitute a frequent cause of hospitalization in older people. The risk of ADRs is increased by the prescription of potentially inappropriate medications for older people (PIMs). The PRISCUS list and the FORTA classification represent established tools to detect PIMs. The aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence and characteristics of PIM prescriptions on the gerontopsychiatric ward of a university hospital in Germany. To this aim, medication charts of 92 patients (mean age 75.9 +- 7.7 years; 66.3% female) were analyzed on a weekly basis until patient discharge by utilization of the PRISCUS list and the FORTA classification. Overall, 335 medication reviews comprising 2363 drug prescriptions were analyzed. 3.0% of the prescribed drugs were PIMs according to the PRISCUS list, with benzodiazepines and Z-drugs accounting for nearly half (49.3%) of all PIM prescriptions. 30.4% of the patients were prescribed at least one PRISCUS-PIM, while 43.5% of the study population took at least one FORTA class D drug. A considerable proportion of gerontopsychiatric patients were affected by PIMs; however, the overall number of PIM prescriptions in the study population was low. Further improvements in the quality of prescribing should target the use of sedating agents such as benzodiazepines and Z-drugs. Physicians should be aware of discrepancies between the PRISCUS list and the FORTA classification.
