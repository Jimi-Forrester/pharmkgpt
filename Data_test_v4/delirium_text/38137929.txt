38137929|t|Pneumonectomy for Unilateral Proximal Interruption of Pulmonary Artery: A Case Series from the Literature.
38137929|a|BACKGROUND: Unilateral proximal interruption of the pulmonary artery (UPIPA) is a rare congenital disease, and its optimal management remains undefined in the existing literature. The occasional necessity for pneumonectomy is still supported by limited evidence. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using the PubMed search engine, focusing on UPIPA cases that received pneumonectomy. Thirty-one pertinent articles were selected and included in the analysis. A case reported from our institution was included in the analysis. RESULTS: We found 25 adults and seven children affected by UPIPA who received an indication for pneumonectomy, plus an additional case that was reported by our institution. Among adult patients, the predominant indication was hemoptysis (57%), followed by suspected or confirmed lung cancer (23%). Approximately 46% of surgical procedures were classified as urgent or emergent. Postoperative complications were observed in 36% of cases, with no recorded mortality. In pediatric cases, pneumonectomy was primarily a life-saving intervention, performed urgently or emergently in 75% of instances. A possible late complication in pediatric patients involves a mediastinal shift leading to respiratory distress, which may be mitigated using an inflatable prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonectomy achieves complete resolution of UPIPA symptoms. In the adult population, its primary indication is hemoptysis, with procedures conducted in both elective and urgent/emergent settings. Despite a mortality rate of zero, a notable proportion of patients may experience postoperative complications. In pediatric cases, the clinical presentation varies more extensively, and pneumonectomy is typically reserved for life-threatening situations, emphasizing the need for careful patient selection.
