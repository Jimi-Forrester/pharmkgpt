16982021|a|INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of delirium based on the CAM scale in a geriatric ward in a university hospital. This paper describes the numbers of predisposing and precipitating factors are compared with the development of delirium. Finally, we present a discussion about treatment and prophylaxis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a period of eight weeks, all newly admitted patients were interviewed and scored with CAM. The numbers of predisposing and precipitating factors were registered. Finally, the treatment was focused upon. RESULTS: 270 patients were admitted, 222 patients were interviewed and 48 patients were excluded. The prevalence of delirium was 7%. We were unable to find a correlation between risk factors or precipitating factors and delirium for this population. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of 7% is a satisfying result. There is a discrepancy between diagnosing delirium with CAM and the doctors' routine. All patients must be considered as high-risk patients. Treatment has not been completely standardised.
