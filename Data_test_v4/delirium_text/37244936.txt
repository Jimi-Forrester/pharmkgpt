37244936|a|EXecutive-functions Innovative Tool 360  (EXIT 360 ) is an original 360  instrument for an ecologically valid and multicomponent evaluation of executive functioning. This work aimed to test the diagnostic efficacy of EXIT 360  in distinguishing executive functioning between healthy controls (HC) and patients with Parkinson's Disease (PwPD), a neurodegenerative disease in which executive dysfunction is the best-defined cognitive impairment in the early stage. 36 PwPD and 44 HC underwent a one-session evaluation that involved (1) neuropsychological evaluation of executive functionality using traditional paper-and-pencil tests, (2) EXIT 360  session and (3) usability assessment. Our findings revealed that PwPD made significantly more errors in completing EXIT 360  and took longer to conclude the test. A significant correlation appeared between neuropsychological tests and EXIT 360  scores, supporting a good convergent validity. Classification analysis indicated the potential of the EXIT 360  for distinguishing between PwPD and HC in terms of executive functioning. Moreover, indices from EXIT 360  showed higher diagnostic accuracy in predicting PD group membership compared to traditional neuropsychological tests. Interestingly, EXIT 360  performance was not affected by technological usability issues. Overall, this study offers evidence that EXIT 360  can be considered an ecological tool highly sensitive to detect subtle executive deficits in PwPD since the initial phases of the disease.
