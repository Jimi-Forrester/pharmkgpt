30235816|t|Successful Aging and Chronic Osteoarthritis.
30235816|a|Background: Aging is commonly accepted as a time period of declining heath in most cases. This review aimed to examine the research base concerning the use of the term 'successful aging', a process and outcome deemed desirable, but challenging to attain. A second was to provide related information to demonstrate how health professionals as well as individuals can aim for a 'successful aging' process and outcome, despite the presence of disabling osteoarthritis. Methods: Information specifically focusing on 'successful aging' and the concept of improving opportunities for advancing 'successful aging' despite osteoarthritis was sought. Results: Among the many articles on 'successful aging', several authors highlight the need to include, a broader array of older adults into the conceptual framework. Moreover, conditions such as osteoarthritis should not necessarily preclude the individual from attaining a personally valued successful aging outcome. Conclusions: Pursuing more inclusive research and research designs, and not neglecting to include people with chronic osteoarthritis can potentially heighten the life quality of all aging individuals, while reducing pain and depression, among other adverse aging and disability correlates among those with osteoarthritis.
