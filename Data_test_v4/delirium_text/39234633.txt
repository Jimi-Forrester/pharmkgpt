39234633|a|INTRODUCTION: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele carries risk for cognitive impairment, but whether the level of circulating apoE4 protein in carriers affects cognition is unclear, as is how health and lifestyle impact circulating apoE4 levels. METHODS: We assayed apoE4 protein levels in dried blood spots of 12,532 adults aged 50+. Regression analyses tested the likelihood of cognitive impairment between groups and within those with detected apoE4 protein. Predictors of circulating apoE4 were assessed. RESULTS: We detected protein binding that indicates the presence of an APOE epsilon4 allele in 28.4% of this group. This group was more likely to have cognitive impairment, and this risk increases with age. However, higher apoE4 levels were associated with less likelihood of cognitive impairment within this group. Antihypertensive medication predicted apoE4 protein levels. DISCUSSION: The apoE4 isoform is associated with a deficient protein and worse cognition. This association is modulated by the level of circulating apoE4 protein in epsilon4 carriers. HIGHLIGHTS: An assay to quantify apoE4 levels from dried blood spot samples was applied. The apoE4 protein was detected as specific binding at >=30,000 pg/mL in 28.4% of samples. Having the apoE4 protein was associated with worse cognitive performance. Higher apoE4 protein levels in those who have it were associated with better cognition. Cardiovascular factors influenced levels of apoE4 protein.
