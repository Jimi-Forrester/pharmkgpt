35433374|t|The Predictive Power of Near-Infrared Spectroscopy in Improving Cognitive Problems in Patients Undergoing Brain Surgeries: A Systematic Review.
35433374|a|One of the main objectives in neurosurgical procedures is the prevention of cerebral ischemia and hypoxia leading to secondary brain injury. Different methods for early detection of intraoperative cerebral ischemia and hypoxia have been used. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a simple, non-invasive method for monitoring cerebral oxygenation increasingly used today. The aim of this study was to systematically review the brain monitoring with NIRS in neurosurgery. The search process resulted in the detection of 324 articles using valid keywords on the electronic databases, including Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Subsequently, the full texts of 34 studies were reviewed, and finally 11 articles (seven prospective studies, three retrospective studies, and one randomized controlled trial) published from 2005 to 2020 were identified as eligible for systematic review. Meta-analysis was not possible due to high heterogeneity in neurological and neurosurgical conditions of patients, expression of different clinical outcomes, and different standard reference tests in the studies reviewed. The results showed that NIRS is a non-invasive cerebral oximetry that provides continuous and measurable cerebral oxygenation information and can be used in a variety of clinical settings.
