3376653|t|[Microcirculation in patients with alcoholic delirium (data of conjunctival biomicroscopy)].
3376653|a|Using conjunctival microscopy the authors examined 66 males with alcoholic delirium, 25 normal subjects and 20 patients with chronic alcoholism. Examination was carried out in the acute stage of psychosis and 12-16 days after its cessation. Patients with chronic alcoholism and alcoholic delirium had marked microcirculatory disturbances. Microcirculatory disturbances tended to get more serious with prolongation of psychosis and were also more prominent in patients with alcoholic delirium versus patients with chronic alcoholism. The therapy led only to a reduction in the conjunctival index reflecting perivascular changes.
