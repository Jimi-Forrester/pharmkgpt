At the cellular level, periodic activity is controlled by the molecular machinery driving the circadian regulation of cellular homeostasis. This mechanism adapts cell function to the external environment and its crucial importance is underlined by its robustness and redundancy. The cell autonomous clock regulates cell function by the circadian modulation of mTOR, a master controller of protein synthesis. Importantly, mTOR integrates the circadian modulation with synaptic activity and extracellular signals through a complex signaling network that includes the RAS-ERK pathway. The relationship between mTOR and the circadian clock is bidirectional, since mTOR can feedback on the cellular clock to shift the cycle to maintain the alignment with the environmental conditions. The mTOR and ERK pathways are crucial determinants of synaptic plasticity and function and thus it is not surprising that alterations of the circadian clock cause defective responses to environmental challenges, as witnessed by the bi-directional relationship between brain disorders and impaired circadian regulation. In physiological conditions, the feedback between the intrinsic clock and the mTOR pathway suggests that also synaptic plasticity should undergo circadian regulation.
