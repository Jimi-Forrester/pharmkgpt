38372253|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative form of dementia characterized by the loss of synapses and a progressive decline in cognitive abilities. Among current treatments for AD, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors have efficacy limited to symptom relief, with significant side effects and poor compliance. Pharmacological agents that modulate the activity of type-2 cannabinoid receptors (CB2R) of the endocannabinoid system by activating or blocking them have also been shown to be effective against neuroinflammation. Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and pharmacological effects in vitro and in vivo of dual-acting compounds that inhibit AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and target CB2R. Within the investigated series, compound 4g proved to be the most promising. It achieved IC50 values in the low micromolar to submicromolar range against both human cholinesterase isoforms while antagonizing CB2R with Ki of 31 nM. Interestingly, 4g showed neuroprotective effects on the SH-SY5Y cell line thanks to its ability to prevent oxidative stress-induced cell toxicity and reverse scopolamine-induced amnesia in the Y-maze forced alternation test in vivo.
