35655621|t|The Legacy of the TTASAAN Report - Premature Conclusions and Forgotten Promises About SPECT Neuroimaging: A Review of Policy and Practice Part II.
35655621|a|Brain perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans were initially developed in 1970s. A key radiopharmaceutical, hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO), was not stabilized until 1993 and most early SPECT scans were performed on single-head gamma cameras. These early scans were of inferior quality. In 1996, the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology (TTASAAN) issued a report regarding the use of SPECT in the evaluation of neurological disorders. This two-part series explores the policies and procedures related to perfusion SPECT functional neuroimaging. In Part I, the comparison between the quality of the SPECT scans and the depth of the data for key neurological and psychiatric indications at the time of the TTASAAN report vs. the intervening 25 years were presented. In Part II, the technical aspects of perfusion SPECT neuroimaging and image processing will be explored. The role of color scales will be reviewed and the process of interpreting a SPECT scan will be presented. Interpretation of a functional brain scans requires not only anatomical knowledge, but also technical understanding on correctly performing a scan, regardless of the scanning modality. Awareness of technical limitations allows the clinician to properly interpret a functional brain scan. With this foundation, four scenarios in which perfusion SPECT neuroimaging, together with other imaging modalities and testing, lead to a narrowing of the differential diagnoses and better treatment. Lastly, recommendations for the revision of current policies and practices are made.
