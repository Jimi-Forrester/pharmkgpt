33958861|t|Plasma Amyloid-beta Oligomerization Tendency Predicts Amyloid PET Positivity.
33958861|a|PURPOSE: Among other emerging amyloid-targeting blood-based biomarkers, Multimer Detection System-Oligomeric Amyloid-beta (MDS-OAbeta) measures dynamic changes in concentration of oligomeric amyloid-beta (OAbeta), which is considered the main pathogenic culprit of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in plasma after spiking with synthetic amyloid-beta (Abeta). We aimed to investigate the predictability of MDS-OAbeta on amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) positivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 96 subjects who visited Seoul National University Bundang Hospital for medical check-up complaining of cognitive decline and had undergone extensive medical assessment were recruited. Amyloid statuses were dichotomized into positive or negative based on visual assessment of amyloid PET. Plasma OAbeta concentration was measured by MDS-OAbeta. In the previous validation study, 0.78ng/mL was established as the cut-off value and the plasma OAbeta concentration higher than or equal to the cut-off value was defined as MDS-OAbeta positive. RESULTS: MDS-OAbeta positivity could discriminate amyloid PET positivity with the AUC value of 0.855 (95% CI 0.776-0.933). Adding MDS-OAbeta positivity to prediction models including age, MMSE score, and APOE epsilon4 status improved performance up to the AUC value of 0.926 (95% CI 0.871-0.980). CONCLUSION: The Abeta oligomerization tendency in plasma could predict amyloid PET positivity with high performance, and, when it is combined with age, MMSE score, and APOE epsilon4 status, predictability was improved substantially. This suggests the potential of MDS-OAbeta as a useful initial stage test in the clinical and research fields of AD.
