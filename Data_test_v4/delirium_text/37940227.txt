37940227|t|Association of Loneliness With Change in Physical and Emotional Health of Older Adults During the COVID-19 Shutdown.
37940227|a|OBJECTIVES: To examine factors influencing loneliness and the effect of loneliness on physical and emotional health, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort. SETTING: Community-dwelling participants. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults (n = 238) enrolled in a longitudinal study. MEASUREMENTS: Interviews were completed July-December 2020. Loneliness was measured with the UCLA 3-item loneliness scale. Data including age, marriage, education, cognitive functioning, functional impairment, vision or hearing impairment, depression, anxiety, medical comorbidity, social network size, technology use, and activity engagement were collected. Health outcomes included self-rated health, and physical and mental composites from the 12-item Short Form Survey. Physical function was measured by a PROMIS-scaled composite score. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (16.4%) participants reported loneliness. Vulnerability factors for loneliness included age (RR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14); impairment with instrumental activities of daily living (RR = 2.08, 95% CI 1.14-3.80); vision impairment (RR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.10-3.97); depression (RR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.25-1.43); and anxiety (RR = 1.92, 95% CI 1.55-2.39). Significant resilience factors included high cognitive functioning (RR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94); large social network size (RR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.96); technology use (RR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.73-0.90); and social and physical activity engagement (RR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.98). Interaction analyses showed that larger social network size moderated the effect of loneliness on physical function (protective interaction effect, RR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.15-1.13, p <.01), and activity engagement moderated the effect of loneliness on mental health (protective interaction effect, RR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.25-1.05, p <.001). CONCLUSIONS: Resilience factors may mitigate the adverse health outcomes associated with loneliness. Interventions to enhance resilience may help to diminish the detrimental effects of loneliness and hold great importance for vulnerable older adults.
