33672582|t|Extracellular Protein Aggregates Colocalization and Neuronal Dystrophy in Comorbid Alzheimer's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease: A Micromorphological Pilot Study on 20 Brains.
33672582|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) are both characterized by extracellular pathologically conformed aggregates of amyloid proteins-amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) and prion protein (PrPSc), respectively. To investigate the potential morphological colocalization of Abeta and PrPSc aggregates, we examined the hippocampal regions (archicortex and neocortex) of 20 subjects with confirmed comorbid AD and sCJD using neurohistopathological analyses, immunohistochemical methods, and confocal fluorescent microscopy. Our data showed that extracellular Abeta and PrPSc aggregates tended to be, in most cases, located separately, and "compound" plaques were relatively rare. We observed PrPSc plaque-like structures in the periphery of the non-compact parts of Abeta plaques, as well as in tau protein-positive dystrophic structures. The AD ABC score according to the NIA-Alzheimer's association guidelines, and prion protein subtype with codon 129 methionine-valine (M/V) polymorphisms in sCJD, while representing key characteristics of these diseases, did not correlate with the morphology of the Abeta/PrPSc co-aggregates. However, our data showed that PrPSc aggregation could dominate during co-aggregation with non-compact Abeta in the periphery of Abeta plaques.
