30740170|t|The Correlation between Malondialdehyde and Nerve Growth Factor Serum Level with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy Score.
30740170|a|AIM: This study was conducted to identify malondialdehyde (MDA) serum level, nerve growth factor (NGF) serum level, diabetic peripheral neuropathy score and the correlation between MDA and NGF serum level with diabetic peripheral neuropathy score. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to observe diabetic patients in the internal medicine department in Dr M. Djamil Hospital, Padang, Indonesia. The MDA serum level was measured using Beuge method with thiobarbituric acid. The NGF serum level was analysed using ELISA method. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy score was defined when history score in Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) >= 7 and physical assessment score in MNSI > 2. RESULTS: Thirty subjects with diabetes has diabetic peripheral neuropathy score 3.53 (+- 0.91), MDA serum level 2.16 (+- 2.89) nmol/ml, and NGF serum level 10.56 (+- 2.89) pg/dl. There were significant correlations between the MDA serum level and the diabetic peripheral neuropathy score (r = 0.364, p = 0.048), and between the NGF serum level with the diabetic peripheral neuropathy score (r = -0.59, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: There are high MDA serum level and low NGF serum level in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Low NGF serum level plays a bigger role than high MDA serum level in diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
