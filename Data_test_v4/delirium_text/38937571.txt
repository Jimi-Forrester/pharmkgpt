38937571|a|BACKGROUND: The aetiology of delirium is not known, but pre-existing cognitive impairment is a predisposing factor. Here we explore the associations between delirium and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs), proteins with important roles in both acute injury and chronic neurodegeneration. METHODS: Using a 13-plex Discovery Assay , we quantified CSF levels of 9 MMPs and 4 TIMPs in 280 hip fracture patients (140 with delirium), 107 cognitively unimpaired individuals, and 111 patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia. The two delirium-free control groups without acute trauma were included to unravel the effects of acute trauma (hip fracture), dementia, and delirium. RESULTS: Here we show that delirium is associated with higher levels of MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-10, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2; a trend suggests lower levels of TIMP-4 are also associated with delirium. Most delirium patients had pre-existing dementia and low TIMP-4 is the only marker associated with delirium in adjusted analyses. MMP-2, MMP-12, and TIMP-1 levels are clearly higher in the hip fracture patients than in both control groups and several other MMP/TIMPs are impacted by acute trauma or dementia status. CONCLUSIONS: Several CSF MMP/TIMPs are significantly associated with delirium in hip fracture patients, but alterations in most of these MMP/TIMPs could likely be explained by acute trauma and/or pre-fracture dementia. Low levels of TIMP-4 appear to be directly associated with delirium, and the role of this marker in delirium pathophysiology should be further explored.
