37734229|t|Novel insights into anticancer mechanisms of elesclomol: More than a prooxidant drug.
37734229|a|As an essential micronutrient for humans, the metabolism of copper is fine-tuned by evolutionarily conserved homeostatic mechanisms. Copper toxicity occurs when its concentration exceeds a certain threshold, which has been exploited in the development of copper ionophores, such as elesclomol, for anticancer treatment. Elesclomol has garnered recognition as a potent anticancer drug and has been evaluated in numerous clinical trials. However, the mechanisms underlying elesclomol-induced cell death remain obscure. The discovery of cuproptosis, a novel form of cell death triggered by the targeted accumulation of copper in mitochondria, redefines the significance of elesclomol in cancer therapy. Here, we provide an overview of copper homeostasis and its associated pathological disorders, especially copper metabolism in carcinogenesis. We summarize our current knowledge of the tumor suppressive mechanisms of elesclomol, with emphasis on cuproptosis. Finally, we discuss the strategies that may contribute to better application of elesclomol in cancer therapy.
