33832574|t|Probable Delirium as a Risk Factor for Adverse Surgical Outcomes in Geriatric Patients With Acute Hip Fracture: Preoperative Assessment Using a Short Screening Tool.
33832574|a|Hip fractures in geriatric patients are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality including postoperative delirium. Few data are available regarding preoperative identification of patients at risk of postoperative delirium before surgical repair of hip fracture. We used the Ultrabrief Two-Item Bedside Test, a proxy for delirium, to identify patients who are likely to have adverse outcomes postoperatively. This prospective pilot study included patients 65 years and older with an acute hip fracture. The questionnaire was administered preoperatively, and patients were followed up for 30 days postoperatively. We enrolled 30 patients, with a mean age of 78 years. The 12 patients with an abnormal test result had a significantly lower body mass index, a trend in descriptive statistics for pulmonary disease, and a higher ASA physical status. In addition, hospital stay following fracture repair was longer for patients with an abnormal test result, although not significantly (mean [SD]=8.8 [4.2] days vs 6.4 [2.0] days, median=8 vs 6 days, log-rank P=.052). A 2-item questionnaire could help identify patients who have sustained hip fracture who are likely to have a longer hospitalization. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine whether interventions can reduce risk.
