35740078|t|Changing Perspectives from Oxidative Stress to Redox Signaling-Extracellular Redox Control in Translational Medicine.
35740078|a|Extensive research has changed the understanding of oxidative stress that has been linked to every major disease. Today we distinguish oxidative eu- and distress, acknowledging that redox modifications are crucial for signal transduction in the form of specific thiol switches. Long underestimated, reactive species and redox proteins of the Thioredoxin (Trx) family are indeed essential for physiological processes. Moreover, extracellular redox proteins, low molecular weight thiols and thiol switches affect signal transduction and cell-cell communication. Here, we highlight the impact of extracellular redox regulation for health, intermediate pathophenotypes and disease. Of note, recent advances allow the analysis of redox changes in body fluids without using invasive and expensive techniques. With this new knowledge in redox biochemistry, translational strategies can lead to innovative new preventive and diagnostic tools and treatments in life sciences and medicine.
