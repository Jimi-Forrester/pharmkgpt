38025798|t|Self-Reported Neurological Symptoms Two Years After Hospital Discharge Among COVID-19 Survivors.
38025798|a|Background: The acute stage of COVID-19 often presents with neurological manifestations. Objective: This study aims to investigate the long-term neurological effects on survivors. Methods: This study recruited 1,546 COVID-19 survivors from Wuhan, including 1,119 nonsevere cases and 427 severe survivors. Participants were interviewed two years after discharge to report their neurological symptoms. The neurological symptoms of COVID-19 were compared between survivors of severe and nonsevere COVID-19. Results: Among the 1,546 COVID-19 survivors, 44.24% discovered at least one neurological symptom. The most prevalent self-reported symptom was fatigue (28.33%), memory deficit (13.26%), attention deficit (9.96%), myalgia (8.34%), dizziness (3.82%), and headache (2.52%). Severe cases had higher incidences of fatigue, myalgia, memory deficit, attention deficit than nonsevere cases. Older age, severe COVID-19, and comorbidity burden were associated with long-term neurological symptoms. Conclusion: Neurological symptoms are common among COVID-19 survivors, especially in severe cases.
