2101303|a|A review of the first 144 patients to attend a Memory Disorders Clinic found not one case of treatable dementia. The use of a routine comprehensive battery of investigations was not supported: however, computerized tomographic brain scans and electroencephalograms were moderately useful in diagnosing dementia. Clinical features and historical data did not discriminate early- from late-onset Alzheimer's disease or Alzheimer's disease from multi-infarct dementia.
