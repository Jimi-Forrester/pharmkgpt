31700642|t|Association between dexmedetomidine use for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and intensive care unit length of stay.
31700642|a|PURPOSE: Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is commonly treated in medical ICUs and typically requires high resource utilization. Dexmedetomidine for AWS has not been extensively investigated, and guidelines regarding its use are lacking. We evaluated the association between dexmedetomidine use in AWS and ICU length of stay (LOS). METHODS: We performed a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study of patients in the ICU with the primary diagnosis of AWS. ICU LOS of those treated with benzodiazepines alone vs. benzodiazepines plus dexmedetomidine was compared. Negative binomial regression was performed to test whether dexmedetomidine use was associated with increased ICU LOS after adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, and the time between hospital and ICU admission. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-eight patients from eight institutions were included. Patients treated with benzodiazepines plus dexmedetomidine had higher Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol scores at ICU admission, spent longer on the medical wards prior to ICU admission, and had longer unadjusted ICU LOS (p < 0.0001). After covariate adjustment, dexmedetomidine remained associated with longer ICU LOS (relative mean to non-dexmedetomidine group 2.14, 95% CI 1.78-2.57, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to benzodiazepines alone, dexmedetomidine for the treatment of AWS was associated with increased ICU LOS. These results provide evidence that dexmedetomidine may increase resource utilization.
