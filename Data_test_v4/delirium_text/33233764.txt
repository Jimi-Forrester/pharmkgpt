33233764|t|Short Disordered Epitope of CRTAM Ig-Like V Domain as a Potential Target for Blocking Antibodies.
33233764|a|Class-I Restricted T Cell-Associated Molecule (CRTAM) is a protein that is expressed after T cell activation. The interaction of CRTAM with its ligand, nectin-like 2 (Necl2), is required for the efficient production of IL-17, IL-22, and IFNgamma by murine CD4 T cells, and it plays a role in optimal CD8 T and NK cell cytotoxicity. CRTAM promotes the pro-inflammatory cytokine profile; therefore, it may take part in the immunopathology of autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type 1 or colitis. Thus, antibodies that block the interaction between CRTAM and Necl2 would be useful for controlling the production of these inflammatory cytokines. In this work, using bioinformatics predictions, we identified three short disordered epitopes (sDE1-3) that are located in the Ig-like domains of murine CRTAM and are conserved in mammalian species. We performed a structural analysis by molecular dynamics simulations of sDE1 (QHPALKSSKY, Ig-like V), sDE2 (QRNGEKSVVK, Ig-like C1), and sDE3 (CSTERSKKPPPQI, Ig-like C1). sDE1, which is located within a loop of the contact interface of the heterotypic interaction with Nectl2, undergoes an order-disorder transition. On the contrary, even though sDE2 and sDE3 are flexible and also located within loops, they do not undergo order-disorder transitions. We evaluated the immunogenicity of sDE1 and sDE3 through the expression of these epitopes in chimeric L1 virus-like particles. We confirmed that sDE1 induces polyclonal antibodies that recognize the native folding of CRTAM expressed in activated murine CD4 T cells. In contrast, sDE3 induces polyclonal antibodies that recognize the recombinant protein hCRTAM-Fc, but not the native CRTAM. Thus, in this study, an exposed disordered epitope in the Ig-like V domain of CRTAM was identified as a potential site for therapeutic antibodies.
