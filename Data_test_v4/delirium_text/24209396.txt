24209396|t|Neuroimaging studies in Alzheimer's disease. A review.
24209396|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with memory loss and gradual behavioral, functional and cognitive impairment. Conventional imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance or computed tomography have played a secondary role in AD diagnosis: While other causes of memory loss and cognitive deficit can be evaluated by these imaging methods, AD structural changes are not detected until very late in the course of the disease. Recent and more precise techniques have been developed to detect subtle changes not visualized with those imaging methods. This article presents a review of the neuroimaging techniques used as a diagnostic aid for AD.
