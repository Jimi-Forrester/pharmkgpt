8173019|t|Platelet membrane fluidity and plasma malondialdehyde levels in Alzheimer's demented patients with and without family history of dementia.
8173019|a|Platelet membrane fluidity (PMF) was measured with three different fluorescent probes, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH), 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMA-DPH), 3-(p-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatrienyl)phenyl-propionic acid (DPH-PA), which labeled different parts of the bilayer (the hydrophobic core and the positively and negatively charged regions, respectively) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with and without a family history of dementia, and in a control group. In support of earlier findings in the literature, significantly increased PMF was found by the application of DPH in both groups with AD. The use of the fluorescence probe TMA-DPH, however, revealed no differences between the groups. In contrast, significant rigidification was observed with DPH-PA, but only in the AD group with a positive family history of dementia. The plasma malondialdehyde levels appeared to be similar in each group. Our findings are discussed in light of the controversies regarding the value of PMF measurements in AD.
