28069007|a|BACKGROUND: Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. They increase vital monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain. However, there is a need for safer natural reversible MAO inhibitors with MAO-B selectivity. Our previous studies showed that Psoralea corylifolia seeds (PCS) extract contains compounds that inhibit monoamine oxidase-B. METHODS: In this study, six of PCS constituents sharing a benzopyrone structure were investigated. The compounds Biochanin-A (BIO-A), isopsoralen, 6-prenylnaringenin, neobavaisoflavone, psoralen, and psoralidin, were tested for their ability to inhibit recombinant human MAO-A and B (hMAO-A and hMAO-B) isozymes. The ability of these compounds to inhibit MAO-A and MAO-B were compared to that of PCS ethanolic extract (PCSEE) using spectrophotometric assays and confirmed by luminescence assays. The highly potent and selective MAO-B inhibitor, BIO-A, was further investigated for both isozymes reversibility and enzyme kinetics. Molecular docking studies were used to predict the bioactive conformation and molecular interactions of BIO-A with both isozymes. RESULTS: The data obtained indicate that benzopyrones inhibited hMAO-A and hMAO-B with different degrees as confirmed with the luminescence assay. BIO-A inhibited hMAO-B with high potency and selectivity in the present study (IC50 = 0.003 mug/mL) and showing 38-fold more selectivity than PCSEE (hMAO-B IC50 = 3.03 mug/mL, 17-fold selectivity) without affecting hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, BIO-A reversibly and competitively inhibited both hMAOs with significantly lower inhibitory constant (Ki) in hMAO-B (3.8 nM) than hMAO-A (99.3 nM). Our docking studies indicated that the H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions at the human MAO-A and MAO-B active sites contributed to the reversibility and selectivity of BIO-A. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained indicate that BIO-A is a potent, reversible and selective MAO-B inhibitor and may be recommended for further investigation in its possible use in the therapeutic management of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.
