28202482|a|Intra-articular administration of corticosteroids is a commonly used treatment for osteoarthritis as well as other inflammatory disorders of the joints. It is well known that delirium and psychosis can arise following the administration of oral corticosteroids but there are few documented cases of the development of acute hyperactive delirium with psychosis following intra-articular administration. We describe a case of an 82-year-old female patient with moderate dementia who developed a delirium with psychosis which responded well to a first-generation antipsychotic.
