33673200|t|Metabolic Alterations in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 and Their Correlation with Lipin.
33673200|a|Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant hereditary and multisystemic disease, characterized by progressive distal muscle weakness and myotonia. Despite huge efforts, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying DM1 remain elusive. In this review, the metabolic alterations observed in patients with DM1 and their connection with lipin proteins are discussed. We start by briefly describing the epidemiology, the physiopathological and systemic features of DM1. The molecular mechanisms proposed for DM1 are explored and summarized. An overview of metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and the summary of metabolic alterations observed in patients with DM1 are presented. Patients with DM1 present clinical evidence of metabolic alterations, namely increased levels of triacylglycerol and low-density lipoprotein, increased insulin and glucose levels, increased abdominal obesity, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein. These metabolic alterations may be associated with lipins, which are phosphatidate phosphatase enzymes that regulates the triacylglycerol levels, phospholipids, lipid signaling pathways, and are transcriptional co-activators. Furthermore, lipins are also important for autophagy, inflammasome activation and lipoproteins synthesis. We demonstrate the association of lipin with the metabolic alterations in patients with DM1, which supports further clinical studies and a proper exploration of lipin proteins as therapeutic targets for metabolic syndrome, which is important for controlling many diseases including DM1.
