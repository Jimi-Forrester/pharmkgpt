38541161|t|Apraxia Patterns for the Differentiation between Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia Variants.
38541161|a|Background and Objectives: Despite the increasing use of biomarkers, differentiation between Alzheimer's disease (AD), behavioral variant Frontotemporal Dementia (bvFTD), and Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) remains a challenge. Apraxia is a supportive feature for diagnosing AD but is underrepresented in other dementia types. Herein, we investigated the presence and characteristic profiles of limb, verbal, and non-verbal apraxia in three major dementia types. Materials and Methods: Test for Upper Limb Apraxia (TULIA) and Apraxia Battery for Adults-2 (ABA-2) were administered in patients with AD (n = 22), bvFTD (n = 41), and PPA (n = 22), with 20 individuals serving as healthy controls (HC). Composite and subdomain scores were compared between each patient group and the HC. Praxis profiles indicative of each dementia type and a possible predictive value were sought. Results: Apraxia provided high diagnostic accuracy for detecting dementia compared with HC (sensitivity: 63.6-100%, specificity: 79.2-100%). Patients with AD performed worse when imitating intransitive gestures as well as pantomiming transitive gestures (mean differences: 2.10 and 3.12, respectively), compared with bvFTD. PPA patients, compared with bvFTD, had comparable results in limb, verbal, and non-verbal praxis assessments, despite the greater deterioration in the outcome. Compared with patients with AD, PPA had increased pathological outcomes in verbal (86.4% vs. 40.9%) and non-verbal apraxia (31.8% vs. 0%), while bvFTD had increased pathological outcomes in verbal apraxia (85.4% vs. 44.5%). Finally, apraxia is correlated with cognitive decline. Conclusions: Apraxia profile evaluation could contribute to the differentiation between AD and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Both TULIA and ABA-2 are reliable tools that can be performed as bed-side tests in clinical practice.
