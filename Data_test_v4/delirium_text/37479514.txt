37479514|t|Usability and feasibility of a digital cognitive screening tool measuring older adults' early postoperative neurocognitive recovery: a protocol for a pilot study.
37479514|a|INTRODUCTION: Delayed neurocognitive recovery, also identified as early postoperative cognitive decline (POCD), is a common complication after surgery, with advanced age being the most important risk factor. As the geriatric population is increasing worldwide, and number of older adults undergoing surgery continues to rise, so will the incidence of POCD. Only a small proportion use digital cognitive tests for measuring postoperative neurocognitive performance compared with analogue tests. This study aims to evaluate a digital cognitive screening tool, Mindmore Postoperative version (Mindmore-P), in a perioperative setting to determine its feasibility and usability, and to compare preoperative cognition with early postoperative neurocognitive performance. Further, to determine associations between neurocognitive performance and perioperative factors as well as to explore patients' experiences of early neurocognitive recovery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will include 50 patients (aged >=60 years) undergoing elective abdominal surgery under general anaesthesia. Cognitive functions will be measured with Mindmore-P preoperatively and on postoperative day (POD) 1 or 2 as well as 2-3 weeks after surgery. Preoperatively, frailty, (Clinical Frailty Scale), depression (Geriatric Depression Scale-15), functional status (12-item WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0) and pre-recovery status (Swedish web version Quality of Recovery Scale, SwQoR) will be measured. Delirium will be assessed by Nu-DESC (Nursing Delirium Screening Scale) twice a day, with start on POD 1 and until the patient is discharged from the hospital. Outcomes at 2-3 weeks postoperatively are postoperative recovery (SwQoR), depression, functional status and usability (System Usability Scale) of Mindmore-P. Postoperative recovery will also be measured POD 1 or 2. We will also explore feasibility and experience of early postoperative neurocognitive recovery with interviews approximately 1 month after surgery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (REC Reference: 2022-03593-01) and will follow the principles outlined in the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. Results from this study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, scientific conferences and in social media. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05564195.
