37240765|t|Nutritional Factors: Benefits in Glaucoma and Ophthalmologic Pathologies.
37240765|a|Glaucoma is a chronic optic neuropathy that can lead to irreversible functional and morphological damage if left untreated. The gold standard therapeutic approaches in managing patients with glaucoma and limiting progression include local drops, laser, and/or surgery, which are all geared at reducing intraocular pressure (IOP). Nutrients, antioxidants, vitamins, organic compounds, and micronutrients have been gaining increasing interest in the past decade as integrative IOP-independent strategies to delay or halt glaucomatous retinal ganglion cell degeneration. In our minireview, we examine the various nutrients and compounds proposed in the current literature for the management of ophthalmology diseases, especially for glaucoma. With respect to each substance considered, this minireview reports the molecular and biological characteristics, neuroprotective activities, antioxidant properties, beneficial mechanisms, and clinical studies published in the past decade in the field of general medicine. This study highlights the potential benefits of these substances in glaucoma and other ophthalmologic pathologies. Nutritional supplementation can thus be useful as integrative IOP-independent strategies in the management of glaucoma and in other ophthalmologic pathologies. Large multicenter clinical trials based on functional and morphologic data collected over long follow-up periods in patients with IOP-independent treatments can pave the way for alternative and/or coadjutant therapeutic options in the management of glaucoma and other ocular pathologies.
