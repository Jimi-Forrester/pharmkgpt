8618662|a|We made follow-up observations on 1,036 Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) enrolled in 21 university medical centers in the United States. Evaluations were scheduled annually for as long as 7 years; at the time of analysis, there were 332 deaths. The median duration of survival from time of entry into CERAD was 5.9 years (95% CI; 5.6 to 6.4 years). Factors independently affecting survival were sex, age, and severity of dementia as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating scale and the Blessed Scale for activities of daily living. The median survival after entry was 5.7 years for men, compared with 7.2 years for women. For men age 70, 75, and 80 years, median survival times were 6.5, 5.5, and 4.4 years, values notably less than those for the general population. Neither race, education, nor marital status significantly affect survival. This large nationwide study confirms the fact that AD is associated with shorter survival, particularly in men, subjects age 70 or older, patients with greater impairment in daily activities of living, and those with more severe dementia.
