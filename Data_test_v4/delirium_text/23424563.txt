23424563|t|4-[5-(4-Chloro-phen-yl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]benzene-sulfonamide.
23424563|a|In the title compound, C(16)H(14)ClN(3)O(2)S, the dihedral angle between the benzene and pyrazole rings is 52.75 (2) , while that between the pyrazole and 4-chloro-phenyl rings is 54.0 (3) . The terminal sulfonamide group adopts an approximately tetra-hedral geometry about the S atom with a C-S-N angle of 108.33 (10) . In the crystal, pairs of N-H N hydrogen bonds lead to the formation of inversion dimers. These dimers are linked via a second pair of N-H N hydrogen bonds and C-H O interactions, forming a two-dimensional network lying parallel to the bc plane. The two-dimensional networks are linked via C-H Cl interactions, forming a three-dimensional structure.
