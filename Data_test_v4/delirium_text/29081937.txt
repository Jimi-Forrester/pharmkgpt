29081937|t|Measurements of Corneal Thickness in Eyes with Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome: Comparative Study of Different Image Processing Protocols.
29081937|a|PURPOSE: Comparative analysis of central and peripheral corneal thickness in PEX patients using three different imaging systems: Pentacam-Scheimpflug device, time-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) Visante, and swept-source OCT Casia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 128 eyes of 80 patients with diagnosed PEX were examined and compared with 112 normal, non-PEX eyes of 72 cataract patients. The study parameters included 5 measured zones: central and 4 peripheral (superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal). RESULTS: The mean CCT in eyes with PEX syndrome measured with all three instruments was thicker than that in normal eyes. Corneal thickness measurements in the PEX group were statistically significantly different between Pentacam and OCT Casia: central corneal thickness (p = 0.04), inferior corneal zone (p = 0.01), and nasal and temporal corneal zones (p < 0.01). Between Pentacam and OCT Visante inferior, nasal and temporal corneal zones were statistically significantly different (p < 0.01). Between OCT Casia and OCT Visante, there were no statistically significant differences in measured parameters values. CONCLUSION: The central corneal thickness in eyes with PEX syndrome measured with three different independent methods is higher than that in the non-PEX group, and despite variable peripheral corneal thickness, this one parameter is still crucial in intraocular pressure measurements.
