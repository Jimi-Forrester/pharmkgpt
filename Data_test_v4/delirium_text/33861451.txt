33861451|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most important causes of dementia, especially in the elderlies. Due to the failures of recent clinical trials in finding effective medications, it appears the use of complementary therapies such as Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) and the rich sources of effective herbs as well as their constituents for improving memory function could be beneficial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the recommended natural remedies in the TPM and examine their pharmacological properties. For this purpose, the data were collected by searching the recommended prescriptions of the seminal TPM textbooks. Then, the names of the most freuqently mentioned plants were extracted from the natural remedies and evaluated for their pharmacological properties. The sources included recently published articles cited in the major scientific databases. A total of 262 plants were identified in 96 evaluated prescriptions; 20 plants were identified with the most frequency of report (i.e. more than 10 times). Their neuroprotective effects, antioxidant features, and anti-AD properties were discussed. Based on our results, TPM has introduced many effective treatments for AD. Hence, more clinical studies are warranted to verify their efficacy and safety.
