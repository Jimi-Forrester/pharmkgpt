35594943|a|OBJECTIVES: This paper uses deep (machine) learning techniques to develop and test how motor behaviors, derived from location and movement sensor tracking data, may be associated with falls, delirium, and urinary tract infections (UTIs) in long-term care (LTC) residents. DESIGN: Longitudinal observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 23 LTC residents (81,323 observations) with cognitive impairment or dementia in 2 northeast Department of Veterans Affairs LTC facilities. METHODS: More than 18 months of continuous (24/7) monitoring of motor behavior and activity levels used objective radiofrequency identification sensor data to track and record movement data. Occurrence of acute events was recorded each week. Unsupervised deep learning models were used to classify motor behaviors into 5 clusters; supervised decision tree algorithms used these clusters to predict acute health events (falls, delirium, and UTIs) the week before the week of the event. RESULTS: Motor behaviors were classified into 5 categories (Silhouette score = 0.67), and these were significantly different from each other. Motor behavior classifications were sensitive and specific to falls, delirium, and UTI predictions 1 week before the week of the event (sensitivity range = 0.88-0.91; specificity range = 0.71-0.88). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Intraindividual changes in motor behaviors predict some of the most common and detrimental acute events in LTC populations. Study findings suggest real-time locating system sensor data and machine learning techniques may be used in clinical applications to effectively prevent falls and lead to the earlier recognition of risk for delirium and UTIs in this vulnerable population.
