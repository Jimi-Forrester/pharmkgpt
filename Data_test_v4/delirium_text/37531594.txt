37531594|a|BACKGROUND: There is increasing awareness of the potential for positive impacts on student learning from involving people with dementia and family carers within undergraduate teaching. However, research on the experience of people with dementia and their family carers is sparse. This study aimed to evaluate the satisfaction and views of families (people with dementia and their family carers) who volunteered in Time for Dementia (TFD); an educational programme where undergraduate healthcare students visit families at home over a 2-year period. METHODS: Families taking part in TFD completed a satisfaction survey after taking part in the programme (n = 803). Frequencies of satisfaction survey items were summarised and multiple linear regression models for factors associated with total satisfaction scores were produced. Open text responses were analysed using thematic framework analysis as to the most favourable aspects of the programme and areas requiring improvement. RESULTS: Overall satisfaction was high for taking part in TFD, with a perception of contribution, and being of value. There was strong evidence that families enjoyed the experience and would recommend participation to others. Higher numbers of student visits were significantly associated with greater satisfaction. Families identified aspects of the programme that benefited them, with social interaction rating highly. Improvements suggested by the families included increased visit structure and organisational improvements. CONCLUSIONS: This study has sought to evaluate at scale the satisfaction of families taking part in a dementia education programme. It is positive that families report high satisfaction in the programme and identify perceived value for themselves as well as students, suggesting reciprocal benefits. This study contributes to the broader understanding of what Experts by Experience value when taking part in educational interventions.
