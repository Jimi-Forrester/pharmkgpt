17306357|t|Vitamin E and neurodegenerative diseases.
17306357|a|Vitamin E is essential for neurological function. This fact, together with a growing body of evidence indicating that neurodegenerative processes are associated with oxidative stress, lead to the convincing idea that several neurological disorders may be prevented and/or cured by the antioxidant properties of vitamin E. In this review, some aspects related to the role of vitamin E against Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and ataxia with vitamin E deficiency will be presented.
