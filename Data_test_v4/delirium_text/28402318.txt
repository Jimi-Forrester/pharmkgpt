28402318|a|Memory loss characterizes several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibition of type 4 phosphodiesterase (PDE4) and elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach to treat cognitive deficits. However, PDE4 exists in several isoforms and pan inhibitors cannot be used in humans due to severe emesis. Here, we present GEBR-32a, a new PDE4D full inhibitor that has been characterized both in vitro and in vivo using biochemical, electrophysiological and behavioural analyses. GEBR-32a efficiently enhances cAMP in neuronal cultures and hippocampal slices. In vivo pharmacokinetic analysis shows that GEBR-32a is rapidly distributed within the central nervous system with a very favourable brain/blood ratio. Specific behavioural tests (object location and Y-maze continuous alternation tasks) demonstrate that this PDE4D inhibitor is able to enhance memory in AD transgenic mice and concomitantly rescues their hippocampal long-term potentiation deficit. Of great relevance, our preliminary toxicological analysis indicates that GEBR-32a is not cytotoxic and genotoxic, and does not seem to possess emetic-like side effects. In conclusion, GEBR-32a could represent a very promising cognitive-enhancing drug with a great potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
