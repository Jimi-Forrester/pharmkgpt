38895550|a|Background and Aims: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a widespread condition in older individuals, posing significant risk of dementia. However, limited research has been conducted to explore effective interventions and clarify their impact at the neural level. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of computerized cognitive training (CCT) and explore the associated neural mechanisms in preventing dementia in older individuals with MCI, with a view to inform future intervention efforts. Methods: We reviewed the effects of CCT on biomarker outcomes in older adults with MCI. The search was conducted for studies published between 2010 and May 10, 2023, using three search engines: PubMed, Scopus, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. The inclusion criteria were as follows: studies that involved participants diagnosed with MCI, included CCT, included quantitative assessment of biomarker results, and conducted randomized controlled trials. Results: Sixteen studies that used biomarkers, including magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and blood or salivary biomarkers, were extracted. The results showed that CCT caused changes in structure and function within the main brain network, including the default mode network, and decreased both theta rhythm activity on EEG and prefrontal activity on fNIRS, with improvement in cognitive function. Furthermore, CCT combined with physical exercise showed more significant structural and functional changes in extensive brain regions compared with CCT alone. Virtual reality-based cognitive training improved not only executive function but also instrumental activities of daily living. Conclusion: CCT causes functional and structural changes in extensive brain regions and improves cognitive function in older adults with MCI. Our findings highlight the potential of individualized intervention methods and biomarker assessment according to the specific causes of MCI. Future research should aim to optimize these personalized therapeutic strategies to maximize the benefits of CCT in older adults with MCI.
