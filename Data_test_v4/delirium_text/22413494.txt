22413494|a|Antipsychotic drugs have been widely used in the treatment of organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders. The guidelines for the treatment of delirium suggest using atypical antipsychotic drugs for the patients with excitement. Atypical antipsychotic drugs show higher affinity for 5-HT2A receptor than D2 receptor. The extrapyramidal side effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs are less than of conventional antipsychotic drugs, so they can be used more safely in the medication for elderly patients. However, we must pay attention to the risk of hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis and sudden cardiac death. Because of off-label use, well informed consents about effectiveness and safety are necessary.
