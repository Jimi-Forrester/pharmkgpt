36768261|a|The glycosylation of proteins plays an important role in neurological development and disease. Glycoproteomic studies on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are a valuable tool to gain insight into brain glycosylation and its changes in disease. However, it is important to consider that most proteins in CSFs originate from the blood and enter the CSF across the blood-CSF barrier, thus not reflecting the glycosylation status of the brain. Here, we apply a glycoproteomics method to human CSF, focusing on differences between brain- and blood-derived proteins. To facilitate the analysis of the glycan site occupancy, we refrain from glycopeptide enrichment. In healthy individuals, we describe the presence of heterogeneous brain-type N-glycans on prostaglandin H2-D isomerase alongside the dominant plasma-type N-glycans for proteins such as transferrin or haptoglobin, showing the tissue specificity of protein glycosylation. We apply our methodology to patients diagnosed with various genetic glycosylation disorders who have neurological impairments. In patients with severe glycosylation alterations, we observe that heavily truncated glycans and a complete loss of glycans are more pronounced in brain-derived proteins. We speculate that a similar effect can be observed in other neurological diseases where a focus on brain-derived proteins in the CSF could be similarly beneficial to gain insight into disease-related changes.
