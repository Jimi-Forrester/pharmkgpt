38437884|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a rapidly growing global concern due to a consistent rise of the prevalence of dementia which is mainly caused by the aging population worldwide. An early diagnosis of AD remains important as interventions are plausibly more effective when started at the earliest stages. Recent developments in clinical research have focused on the use of blood-based biomarkers for improve diagnosis/prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD. Unlike invasive cerebrospinal fluid tests, circulating biomarkers are less invasive and will become increasingly cheaper and simple to use in larger number of patients with mild symptoms or at risk of dementia. In addition to AD-specific markers, there is growing interest in biomarkers of inflammaging/neuro-inflammaging, an age-related chronic low-grade inflammatory condition increasingly recognized as one of the main risk factor for almost all age-related diseases, including AD. Several inflammatory markers have been associated with cognitive performance and AD development and progression. The presence of senescent cells, a key driver of inflammaging, has also been linked to AD pathogenesis, and senolytic therapy is emerging as a potential treatment strategy. Here, we describe blood-based biomarkers clinically relevant for AD diagnosis/prognosis and biomarkers of inflammaging associated with AD. Through a systematic review approach, we propose that a combination of circulating neurodegeneration and inflammatory biomarkers may contribute to improving early diagnosis and prognosis, as well as providing valuable insights into the trajectory of cognitive decline and dementia in the aging population.
