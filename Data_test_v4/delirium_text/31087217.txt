31087217|a|One of the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorders is Alzheimer's disease which globally threatening the health of elderly people. Although there are several pharmacological and non- pharmacological treatments for Alzheimer's disease, they can just decrease the symptoms in these diseases. In this context, cell therapy and regenerative medicine approach as the novel therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases would be important. Based on scientific research principles, using any novel therapeutic approaches before the run in clinical trials need to take preclinical (animal study) stapes. Accordingly, an animal study can improve our understanding of biological mechanisms of diseases and as an important step should adhering to ethical guidelines and standards. On the other hand, to gain suitable outcomes, it is important to check the appropriate validation of animal models. In this regard, the present review would discuss about the development and validation of appropriate AD animal models in the field of regenerative medicine.
