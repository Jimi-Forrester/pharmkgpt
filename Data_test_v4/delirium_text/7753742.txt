7753742|t|Behavioral problems in nursing home residents. Safe ways to manage dementia.
7753742|a|Behavioral problems in nursing home residents are already common and are likely to increase in number with the "graying" of the population. Effective treatment is available, and a structured and logical approach to management is needed. Patients should be assessed to differentiate delirium from dementia, and possible precipitants of disturbed behavior should be investigated. The best treatment of dementia-related behavioral problems includes nonpharmacologic measures (eg, environmental changes) and appropriate choice, dosing, and monitoring of pharmacologic agents. Long-term success with demented patients may depend on realistic expectations.
