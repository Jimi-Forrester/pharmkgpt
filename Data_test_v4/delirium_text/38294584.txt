38294584|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the correlation between preoperative frailty and the risk of postoperative delirium (POD) in older patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. METHODS: In total, 148 patients with hip fractures who were admitted to Tsinghua Changgung Hospital (Beijing, China) between January 2022 and January 2023 were involved in this study. Preoperative frailty scales were assessed, of which the CAM scale was postoperatively administered every morning and evening on days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the correlation between preoperative frailty and the risk of POD. RESULTS: Among 148 older patients with hip fractures, 71 (48.0%) were identified as preoperative frail and 77 (52.0%) as non-frail. The overall incidence of POD on day 7 was 24.3% (36/148), and preoperative frailty was associated with a significantly higher risk of POD compared with non-frailty (42.3% vs. 7.8%, P < 0.001). The binary logistic regression analysis revealed that preoperative frailty was noted as an independent risk factor for the risk of POD in older patients undergoing hip fracture surgery (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Preoperative frailty increased the risk of POD in older patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. DISCUSSION: Preoperative assessment of frailty in geriatric hip surgery can timely identify potential risks and provide interventions targeting frailty factors to reduce the incidence of POD in older patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. The findings suggested that preoperative frailty could increase the risk of POD in older patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. Further research is necessary to determine whether perioperative interventions aimed at enhancing frailty can mitigate the risk of POD and improve prognosis in older patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.
