38998664|a|In this study, the whey protein isolate-high-methoxyl pectin (WPI-HMP) complex prepared by electrostatic interaction was utilized as an emulsifier in the preparation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) algal oils in order to improve their physicochemical properties and oxidation stability. The results showed that the emulsions stabilized using the WPI-HMP complex across varying oil-phase volume fractions (30-70%) exhibited consistent particle size and enhanced stability compared to emulsions stabilized solely using WPI or HMP at different ionic concentrations and heating temperatures. Furthermore, DHA algal oil emulsions stabilized using the WPI-HMP complex also showed superior storage stability, as they exhibited no discernible emulsification or oil droplet overflow and the particle size variation remained relatively minor throughout the storage at 25  C for 30 days. The accelerated oxidation of the emulsions was assessed by measuring the rate of DHA loss, lipid hydroperoxide levels, and malondialdehyde levels. Emulsions stabilized using the WPI-HMP complex exhibited a lower rate of DHA loss and reduced levels of lipid hydroperoxides and malondialdehyde. This indicated that WPI-HMP-stabilized Pickering emulsions exhibit a greater rate of DHA retention. The excellent stability of these emulsions could prove valuable in food processing for DHA nutritional enhancement.
