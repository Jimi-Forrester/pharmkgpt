37406595|a|BACKGROUND: Brain metabolite abnormalities measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provide insight into pathological processes in schizophrenia. Prior meta-analyses have not yet answered important questions about the influence of clinical and technical factors on neurometabolite abnormalities and brain region differences. To address these gaps, we performed an updated meta-analysis of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline, and creatine levels in patients with schizophrenia and assessed the moderating effects of medication status, echo time, measurement quality, and other factors. METHODS: We searched citations from three earlier meta-analyses and the PubMed database after the most recent meta-analysis to identify studies for screening. In total, 113 publications reporting 366 regional metabolite datasets met our inclusion criteria and reported findings in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, frontal white matter, hippocampus, thalamus, and basal ganglia from a total of 4445 patient and 3944 control observations. RESULTS: Patients with schizophrenia had reduced NAA in five of the six brain regions, with a statistically significant sparing of the basal ganglia. Patients had elevated choline in the basal ganglia and both prefrontal cortical regions. Patient creatine levels were normal in all six regions. In some regions, the NAA and choline differences were greater in studies enrolling predominantly medicated patients compared to studies enrolling predominantly unmedicated patients. Patient NAA levels were more reduced in hippocampus and frontal white matter in studies using longer echo times than those using shorter echo times. MPFC choline and NAA abnormalities were greater in studies reporting better metabolite measurement quality. CONCLUSIONS: Choline is elevated in the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortical regions, suggesting regionally increased membrane turnover or glial activation in schizophrenia. The basal ganglia are significantly spared from the well-established widespread reduction of NAA in schizophrenia suggesting a regional difference in disease-associated factors affecting NAA. The echo time findings agree with prior reports and suggest microstructural changes cause faster NAA T2 relaxation in hippocampus and frontal white matter in schizophrenia. Separating the effects of medication status and illness chronicity on NAA and choline abnormalities will require further patient-level studies. Metabolite measurement quality was shown to be a critical factor in MRS studies of schizophrenia.
