36431161|t|Promising Advances in Pharmacotherapy for Patients with Spinal Cord Injury-A Review of Studies Performed In Vivo with Modern Drugs.
36431161|a|Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a pathological neurological condition that leads to significant motor dysfunction. It is a condition that occurs as a result of tragic accidents, violent acts, or as a consequence of chronic diseases or degenerative changes. The current treatments for patients with SCI have moderate efficacy. They improve the quality of life of patients, but they are still doomed to long-term disability. In response to the modern directions of research on possible therapeutic methods that allow for the recovery of patients with SCI, a scientific review publication is needed to summarize the recent developments in this topic. The following review is focused on the available pharmacological treatments for SCIs and the problems that patients face depending on the location of the injury. In the following review, the research team describes problems related to spasticity and neuropathic pain; possible therapeutic pathways are also described for neuroprotection and the improvement of neurotransmission within the injured spinal cord, and the review focuses on issues related to oxidative stress.
