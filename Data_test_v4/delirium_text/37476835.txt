37476835|a|Objective: Prior research has shown mixed results regarding the effectiveness of combining donepezil and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to treat mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In light of this, our study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of this treatment approach for patients with MCI. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search of various databases, including Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, and Wanfang Database from their inception to November 16, 2022. The selection of studies, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction were carried out independently by two authors. The statistical analysis was performed using STATA. Results: Our meta-analysis included a total of 35 studies with 2,833 patients, published between 2008 and 2022, with intervention durations ranging from 4 weeks to 12 months. However, most of the studies had a high risk of detection bias. Our findings indicated that the combination of donepezil and TCM significantly improved the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 2.79, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.82 to 3.75) and the Barthel Index score (WMD = 9.20, 95% CI: 5.39 to 13.00) compared to donepezil alone. However, subgroup analyses showed that the MoCA score did not increase significantly in patients with MCI resulting from cerebrovascular disease (WMD = 1.47, 95% CI: -0.02 to 2.96). Conclusion: The combination of donepezil and TCM may have a more positive effect on cognitive function and activities of daily living in patients with MCI compared to the use of donepezil alone. However, due to the limited quality of the studies included in our analysis, these findings should be interpreted with caution.
