32592177|a|Recent clinical trial results support the idea that treatment based on the so-called amyloid hypothesis is a promising approach in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but actually, developing effective treatments for AD remains highly challenging. The discovery that neuron-specific sodium pump activity is impaired in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease has suggested a role for the sodium pump in the pathogenesis of these diseases. This opens up new possibilities for intervention, such as inhibiting the aberrant interaction of the sodium pump with the disease-specific ligand(s) or activating the sodium pump itself or its downstream signalling. In this review article, I would like to discuss possible anti-amyloid therapies, focusing especially on our own research.
