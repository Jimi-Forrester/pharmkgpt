33776287|a|BACKGROUND: Domestic violence can result from societal, community, and relationship factors pertaining to both the perpetrator and the victims. The male perpetrators of domestic violence have rarely been the subjects of a study. AIM: To understand the factors influencing a man's risk in perpetrating domestic violence in a community setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational, exploratory study was conducted on 50 male perpetrators of domestic violence in an urban slum. A semi-structured questionnaire which incorporated Adverse Childhood Experience International Questionnaire, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, and Becks Inventory for Depression was used for assessment. RESULTS: All the respondents reported both verbal and physical violence with 26% reporting complicated physical violence. Alcohol dependence was diagnosed in 77% of respondents. Twenty-four percent had depression and 34% had anxiety. The mean number of ACEs suffered by the respondents was 4 and the range was 0-8. Substance abuse in the family (86%) and witnessing verbal/psychological abuse (82%) were the most common ACE found. Complicated domestic violence was statistically significantly associated with the presence of alcohol dependence, witnessing complicated physical abuse between the parents and parents separated due to death or divorce. Certain adversities, namely verbal punishment, physical punishment, bullying, community violence, caretaker of sibling, and household work, were strongly associated with abusers who suffered from psychiatric comorbidities. CONCLUSION: The presence and severity of alcohol dependence and the number of childhood adversities are strongly associated with complicated type of domestic violence. Those who were victims of a large number of ACEs also suffered from anxiety, depression, and alcohol dependence.
