30365231|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: An immersive virtual reality tour of the operating theater could reduce preoperative anxiety. This study was designed to determine whether a preoperative immersive virtual reality tour demonstrates a reduction in emergence delirium through reducing the preoperative anxiety in children undergoing general anesthesia. METHODS: Eighty-six children were randomly allocated into either the control or virtual reality group. The control group received conventional education regarding the perioperative process. The virtual reality group watched a 4-minute virtual reality video showing the operating theater and explaining the perioperative process. Incidence and severity of emergence delirium were the main outcomes. Secondary outcomes included preoperative anxiety using modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale and postoperative behavioral disturbance. RESULTS: Eighty children completed the final analysis (control group = 39, virtual reality group = 41). The incidence (risk ratio [95% CI]: 1.1 [0.5-2.8], P = 0.773) and severity of emergence delirium (mean difference [95% CI]: -0.2 [-2.7 to 2.2], P = 0.791) were similar in the two groups. After the intervention, children in the virtual reality group had a significantly lower modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety score than those in the control group (mean difference [95% CI]: 9.2 [0.3-18.2], P = 0.022). No difference was observed regarding postoperative behavioral disturbance between the two groups at postoperative 1 day (mean difference [95% CI]: -0.1 [-0.3 to 0.1], P = 0.671) and 14 day (mean difference [95% CI]: -0.0 [-0.1 to 0.0], P = 0.329). CONCLUSION: Preoperative immersive virtual reality tour of the operating theater did not reduce the incidence and severity of emergence delirium, although it was effective in alleviating preoperative anxiety in children.
