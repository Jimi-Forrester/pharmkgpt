8886519|a|The Squire and Zola-Morgan parallel organization model of the memory and the Tulving hierarchical model were developed mainly through the study of amnesic patients. The predictions of these two models are different, the first being more open to double dissociations and less restrictive than the second. Alzheimer's Disease is characterized by a differential impairment of the memory systems and by an interindividual variability which may take the form of dissociations between preserved and disturbed abilities in some patients. The objective of this study was to use the memory dysfunctions of patients with AD to test the validity of the two models. Analysis of the group data provided an average profile of memory disturbance consistent both with much of the data given in AD literature and with the two models. Using a multiple single-case strategy, we demonstrated several simple dissociations which are for the greater part compatible with the two models. Two of the dissociations underline the limits of the Tulving model, which otherwise accounts for a lot of results. The study supports the relevance of AD for the understanding of the cognitive architecture of the human memory.
