36436975|t|Interstitial Fluidopathy of the Central Nervous System: An Umbrella Term for Disorders with Impaired Neurofluid Dynamics.
36436975|a|Interest in interstitial fluid dynamics has increased since the proposal of the glymphatic system hypothesis. Abnormal dynamics of the interstitial fluid have been pointed out to be an important factor in various pathological statuses. In this article, we propose the concept of central nervous system interstitial fluidopathy as a disease or condition in which abnormal interstitial fluid dynamics is one of the important factors for the development of a pathological condition. We discuss the aspects of interstitial fluidopathy in various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and cerebral small vessel disease. We also discuss a method called "diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space" using MR diffusion images, which is used to evaluate the degree of interstitial fluidopathy or the activity of the glymphatic system.
