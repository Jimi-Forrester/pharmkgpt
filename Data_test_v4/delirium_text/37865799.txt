37865799|a|OBJECTIVE: This study compared remimazolam tosylate with propofol or midazolam to assess its safety and effectiveness for long-term sedation of intensive care unit (ICU) patients requiring mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Adult patients in the ICU receiving sedation and mechanical ventilation for longer than 24 h were included in this single-center, prospective, observational study. Depending on the sedatives they were given, they were split into two groups (midazolam or propofol group; remimazolam group). ICU mortality was the main result. Laboratory tests, adverse events, and the length of ICU stay were considered secondary outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were involved (46 received propofol or midazolam versus 60 received remimazolam). Age (P = 0.182), gender (P = 0.325), and the amount of time between being admitted to the ICU and receiving medication infusion (P = 0.770) did not substantially differ between the two groups. Multivariate analysis revealed no statistically significant difference in ICU mortality between the two groups. The remimazolam group showed less variability in heart rate (P = 0.0021), pH (P = 0.048), bicarbonate (P = 0.0133), lactate (P = 0.0002), arterial blood gas analyses, liver, and kidney function. The Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale scores, length of ICU stay, and occurrence of adverse events did not exhibit significant differences between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Remimazolam tosylate did not increase the total inpatient cost, the incidence of adverse events, and ICU mortality in patients with mechanical ventilation. These findings suggest that remimazolam may represent a promising alternative for sedation in the ICU setting.
