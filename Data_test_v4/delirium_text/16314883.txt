16314883|t|Ionotropic glutamate receptor gene GRIK3 SER310ALA functional polymorphism is related to delirium tremens in alcoholics.
16314883|a|Upregulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission resulting from chronic ethanol intoxication may cause a hyperexcitable state during alcohol withdrawal, which may lead to seizures and delirium tremens. The aim of our study was to evaluate the association between a history of alcohol withdrawal-induced seizures and delirium tremens, and a functional polymorphism (Ser310Ala) of the GRIK3 gene coding for the glutamatergic kainate receptor subunit GlurR7 in a sample of well-characterized alcoholics compared to controls. In total, 233 patients meeting DSM-IV alcohol dependence criteria and 309 controls, all of German descent, were investigated. GRIK3 functional polymorphism was determined using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) of lymphocyte DNA. History of alcohol withdrawal-induced delirium tremens and seizures were obtained using the SSAGA (Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism). Data were cross-checked with in-patients' clinical files. While a significant relationship between history of delirium tremens and the Ser310 allele was detected, no significant results were obtained for alcohol withdrawal-related seizures. Although this result is suggestive for a significant role of this polymorphism in the pathogenesis of delirium tremens in alcohol-dependent individuals, further investigation and confirmation are warranted.
