36593668|a|BACKGROUND: Operative management of craniovertebral junction (CVJ) osteomyelitis has traditionally been extracranial and focused on debriding the infection. In select patients, the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) with a focus on additional resection versus debridement may be preferred. The goal of this study is to present the authors' experience with the EEA with gross or subtotal resection for the treatment of osteomyelitis at the CVJ and describe their technique in the context of the literature. OBSERVATIONS: Two patients of the authors' and 6 detailed case reports in the literature were identified with a mean age of 58.9 years. Most patients (n = 5; 62.5%) underwent skull base surgery and debridement (n = 5; 62.5%). Although more common, debridement was inferior to resection in terms of neurological improvement (66.7% vs. 100.0%) postoperatively. The majority (n = 7; 87.5%) of patients underwent occipitocervical fusion. LESSONS: Osteomyelitis is an exceedingly rare lesion of the CVJ. Despite the region's delicate biomechanical stability, resection of infected bone may be superior to debridement alone in terms of clinical outcome. Given how well established the safety of the EEA is to this region, further study of outcomes with resection is warranted.
