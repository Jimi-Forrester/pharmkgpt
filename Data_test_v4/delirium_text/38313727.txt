38313727|t|Hippocampal volume and recovery profile following propofol sedation in children undergoing magnetic resonance imaging: An exploratory study.
38313727|a|Background: Reduction in the hippocampal volume may contribute to agitated and delayed emergence after anesthesia in epilepsy surgery. We hypothesized that hippocampal volume and the duration of various recovery parameters after a short duration of sedation may be correlated. The primary objective was to evaluate the correlation between hippocampal volumes with time to recovery after the stoppage of propofol infusion. Methods: After obtaining Institute Ethical Clearance, we included all children of the age group 5-17 years, who needed sedation for brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for at least 20-60 minutes for the evaluation of epilepsy. The hippocampal volume was estimated bilaterally in the pre-contrast volumetric magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) brain imaging by the radiologist using statistical parametric mapping. The correlation of hippocampal volume with recovery and time to discharge (assessed by the modified Aldrete score (MAS)) was obtained using Spearman's correlation coefficient (rho). A rho > +- 0.5 was considered a good correlation between the variables. Results: Data on a total of 18 children (10 males and 8 females) who required sedation for an MRI were studied over a period of six months. The correlation coefficients of right and left corrected hippocampal volumes with time to spontaneous eye opening were -0.052 and -0.195, respectively. The correlation coefficients of right and left corrected hippocampal volumes with time to respond to oral commands were -0.017 and -0.219, respectively. Conclusion: There was a weak negative correlation between hippocampal volumes and recovery parameters after a short duration of sedation with propofol in children.
