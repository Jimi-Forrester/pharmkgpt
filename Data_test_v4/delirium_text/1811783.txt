1811783|t|Psychosocial and management aspects of delirium.
1811783|a|Data to demonstrate that psychosocial factors, sensory deprivation, or sleep deprivation alone can cause delirium are few. Nonetheless, these factors or conditions may contribute to the development or symptom presentation of a delirium when other metabolic or toxic etiologies are present. There is likewise little research on the appropriate treatment of the delirious patient. Clinical experience suggests that attention to the patient's psychological state through frequent orientation, emotional support, and frequent explanation can help. Low-dose neuroleptic drugs are occasionally useful and necessary.
