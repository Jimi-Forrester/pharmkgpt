38523957|t|The Top 50 Articles and Authors of the New Millennium in Psychiatry: A Bibliometric Analysis.
38523957|a|The field of psychiatry faces significant challenges in the new millennium, marked by a surge in mental health diagnoses coupled with barriers to accessing adequate care. Despite obstacles, notable advancements have been achieved throughout the field, including the release of DSM-5, the introduction of esketamine, and the development of innovative assessment tools. This study aims to comprehensively analyze recent advances in psychiatry by examining the top 50 most cited articles and authors since 2000, addressing a gap in the literature left by previous subfield-focused bibliometric studies. Utilizing the Web of Science (WOS) database, this bibliometric analysis examined all publications in psychiatric journals from January 1, 2000, to September 18, 2022. The top 50 most cited articles and authors were identified and characterized based on various metrics, including times cited, article type, and institutional affiliations. WOS extracted 699,005 articles, with authors from the United States contributing the highest number of publications. The top 50 articles spanned a variety of formats, with cross-sectional studies, new measures, literature reviews, and randomized controlled trials being the most prevalent. The American Journal of Psychiatry emerged as the leading journal, hosting eight of the top 50 articles. Among the top 50 authors, female representation was limited, comprising 24% of first authors and 22% overall. Institutional affiliations revealed a majority of top authors worked at universities affiliated with the top 40 NIH-funded departments of psychiatry, with those affiliated with Harvard University leading in authorship contributions. This study sheds light on recent advancements in psychiatry, emphasizing the underrepresentation of female authors and the prevalence of top authors affiliated with major NIH-funded programs. This bibliometric analysis provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances and the top recent contributors in the field, fostering a deeper understanding of the evolving landscape of psychiatry in the new millennium.
