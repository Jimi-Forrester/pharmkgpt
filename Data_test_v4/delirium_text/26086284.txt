26086284|t|Comparison of Enk Fibreoptic Atomizer with translaryngeal injection for topical anaesthesia for awake fibreoptic intubation in patients at risk of secondary cervical injury: A randomised controlled trial.
26086284|a|BACKGROUND: Two methods of topical anaesthesia for awake fibreoptic intubation (FOI) in patients at risk of secondary cervical injury were compared: the translaryngeal injection (TLI) technique and the Enk Fibreoptic Atomizer. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine which system of topical anaesthesia provides the fastest and most comfortable awake FOI, using the oral approach. DESIGN: A randomised controlled study. SETTING: A single centre trial between 2009 and 2011. PATIENTS: One hundred and twenty patients (63 women, 57 men) who underwent neurosurgery of the spine at Klinikum St. Georg Leipzig were randomly allocated into two groups (group TLI, 61 patients; group ENK-ATOMIZER, 59 patients). Inclusion criteria were an American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical status of 1 to 3, age 18 to 80 years, and those who met any one of three indications for FOI - cervical instability, predicted difficult airway, a BMI greater than 40 kg m(-2), and who gave written informed consent.Exclusion criteria were emergency awake FOI, mental disability/delirium, polytrauma and contraindication to TLI. INTERVENTIONS: Two anaesthesiologists experienced in both techniques performed all anaesthesia procedures within the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the timing sequence of awake FOI. The incidence of coughing/gagging, ease of tracheal tube placement, mucosal bleeding, cardiopulmonary stability and postoperative outcomes were also investigated. RESULTS: Awake FOI was significantly faster using the TLI technique (mean, 191 s; range, 123 to 447 s; SD, 83.5) than the Enk Fibreoptic Atomizer [mean, 430 s; range, 275 to 773 s; SD, 124.9; (P = 0.0001)]. Patients in group TLI exhibited significantly less gagging (P = 0.047) but more mucosal bleeding (P <  .001). CONCLUSION: Awake FOI using the TLI technique was faster and provided better topical anaesthesia with less gagging during endoscopic intubation. However, the TLI technique was also more invasive. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00948350.
