9100152|t|Delirium in geropsychiatric patients: patient characteristics and treatment outcomes.
9100152|a|The authors examined the effect of hospitalization on cognitive and behavioral symptoms in delirious elderly patients with and without dementia. Forty-four (13%) of the patients admitted to a Veterans Affairs Medical Center geropsychiatric unit were diagnosed with delirium and were administered the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Rating Scale for Side Effects, and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory. The total sample significantly improved on all measures. When patients with delirium were divided into subgroups with and without dementia, both subgroups improved similarly. Patients discharged to more restrictive environments improved significantly on the BPRS only.
