31212845|a|This study was performed to estimate the possibility of using an ethyl acetate fraction from Aruncus dioicus var. kamtschaticus (EFAD) on metabolic syndrome that is induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). It was demonstrated that EFAD suppresses lipid accumulation and improves insulin resistance (IR) caused by Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in in-vitro experiments using the 3T3-L1 cell. In in-vivo tests, C57BL/6 mice were fed EFAD at 20 and 40 mg/kg body weight (BW) for four weeks after the mice were fed HFD for 15 weeks to induce obesity. EFAD significantly suppressed the elevation of BW and improved impaired glucose tolerance in obese mice. Additionally, this study showed that EFAD has an ameliorating effect on obesity-induced cognitive disorder with behavioral tests. The effect of EFAD on peripheral-IR improvement was confirmed by serum analysis and western blotting in peripheral tissues. Additionally, EFAD showed an ameliorating effect on HFD-induced oxidative stress, impaired cholinergic system and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are interrelated symptoms of neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease and central nervous system (CNS)-IR in brain tissue. Furthermore, we confirmed that EFAD improves CNS-IR by confirming the IR-related factors in brain tissue. Consequently, this study suggests the possibility of using EFAD for the prevention of neurodegeneration by improving metabolic syndrome that is caused by HFD.
