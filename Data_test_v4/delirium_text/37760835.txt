37760835|t|Continuous Fentanyl Infusion in Newborns with Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy Treated with Therapeutic Hypothermia: Background, Aims, and Study Protocol for Time-Concentration Profiles.
37760835|a|Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is the standard of care for newborns with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Discomfort and pain during treatment are common and may affect the therapeutic efficacy of TH. Opioid sedation and analgesia (SA) are generally used in clinical practice, and fentanyl is one of the most frequently administered drugs. However, although fentanyl's pharmacokinetics (PKs) may be altered by hypothermic treatment, the PK behavior of this opioid drug in cooled newborns with HIE has been poorly investigated. The aim of this phase 1 study protocol (Trial ID: FentanylTH; EUDRACT number: 2020-000836-23) is to evaluate the fentanyl time-concentration profiles of full-term newborns with HIE who have been treated with TH. Newborns undergoing TH receive a standard fentanyl regimen (2 mcg/Kg of fentanyl as a loading dose, followed by a continuous infusion-1 mcg/kg/h-during the 72 h of TH and subsequent rewarming). Fentanyl plasma concentrations before bolus administration, at the end of the loading dose, and 24-48-72-96 h after infusion are measured. The median, maximum, and minimum plasma concentrations, together with drug clearance, are determined. This study will explore the fentanyl time-concentration profiles of cooled, full-term newborns with HIE, thereby helping to optimize the fentanyl SA dosing regimen during TH.
