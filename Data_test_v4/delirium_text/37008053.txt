37008053|t|Toward the Identification of Neurophysiological Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome: A Potential Role for Cross-Frequency Phase-Amplitude Coupling Analysis.
37008053|a|Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) mechanisms play a central role in brain activity. Pathophysiological mechanisms leading to many brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), may produce unique patterns of brain activity detectable by electroencephalography (EEG). Identifying biomarkers for AD diagnosis is also an ambition among research teams working in Down syndrome (DS), given the increased susceptibility of people with DS to develop early-onset AD (DS-AD). Here, we review accumulating evidence that altered theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) may be one of the earliest EEG signatures of AD, and therefore may serve as an adjuvant tool for detecting cognitive decline in DS-AD. We suggest that this field of research could potentially provide clues to the biophysical mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in DS-AD and generate opportunities for identifying EEG-based biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic utility in DS-AD.
