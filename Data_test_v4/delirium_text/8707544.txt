8707544|t|Affiliated-individuation in caregivers of adults with dementia.
8707544|a|The purpose of this study was to test the effect of a theory-based support group intervention on affiliated-individuation in caregivers of adults with dementia. Modeling and Role-Modeling, a theory and paradigm for nursing, provided the framework for intervention. The sample of 26 caregivers attended biweekly support groups for 12 months. Quantitative data, collected at baseline and at 6 and 12 months, were analyzed using MANOVA to assess within-subject variance. Results of data analysis indicated that levels of affiliated individuation did not decrease in the subjects in spite of their continued caregiving of persons who had Alzheimer's disease. Qualitative data collected 1-2 months after 12 months of interventions supported the quantitative findings. They also described a process that parallels the theoretical definition of affiliated-individuation.
