36554101|t|The Analysis of Blood Inflammation Markers as Prognostic Factors in Parkinson's Disease.
36554101|a|Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive, and neurodegenerative disease, and yet with an imprecise etiopathogenesis. Although neuroinflammation was initially thought to be a secondary condition, it is now believed that microglia-induced inflammation could also contribute to the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway. Here, we aimed to establish the feasibility of basic inflammatory biomarkers as prognostic factors in PD. The study was based on retrospective analyses of blood samples taken from patients diagnosed with PD, as well as from healthy subjects. Complete medical records, total leukocyte count with subpopulations, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were analyzed. We calculated the serum neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio (NLR) and platelet-to lymphocytes ratio (PLR), and also compared the laboratory data between the PD group and the control group. Only PLR and NLR showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.001 and 0.04, respectively). In our study, ESR did not show statistically significant correlations with motor score or with disability. In our research, ESR was correlated with the disease duration (p = 0.04), and PLR showed a significant correlation with disease stage (p = 0.027) and disease duration (p = 0.001), but not with motor state. These biomarkers could prove to be effective tools for a primary evaluation of inflammation in PD, but further tests are required to properly investigate the neuroinflammatory status of these patients.
