36156682|t|Functional Decline in COVID-19 Older Survivors Compared to Other Pneumonia Patients, a Case Control Study.
36156682|a|OBJECTIVES: Among patients over 75 years, little is known about functional decline due to COVID-19. The aim of this study was to explore this functional decline, compare to other infectious pneumonia. DESIGN AND SETTING: This case-control study included all COVID-19 patients hospitalized from March to December 2020 in Acute Geriatric Ward in Nantes University Hospital matched 1/1 with patients with pneumonia hospitalized in geriatric department between March 2017 and March 2019 (controls) on sex, age. Functional decline was assessed at 3 month follow up as it is routinely done after hospitalization in geriatric ward. We performed multivariable analyses to compare clinical outcomes between patients with COVID-19 vs controls. RESULTS: 132 pairs were matched on age (mean: 87 y-o), and sex (61% of women). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, there were no statistical significant association between COVID-19 infection and functional decline (OR=0.89 p=0.72). A statistical significant association was found between functional decline and Charlson comorbidity index (OR=1.17, p=0.039); prior fall (OR=2.08, p=0.012); malnutrition (OR=1.97, p=0.018); length of hospital stay (OR=1.05, p=0.002) and preadmission ADL(OR=1.25, p=0.049). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 does not seem to be responsible for a more frequent or severe functional decline than other infectious pneumonia in older and comorbid population after 3 month follow up. In this population, pneumonia is associated with functional decline in almost 1 in 2 cases. The individual preadmission frailty seems to be a more important predictor of functional decline, encouraging multidimensional care management for this population.
