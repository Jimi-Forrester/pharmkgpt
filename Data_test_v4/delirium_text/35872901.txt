35872901|t|Immune Response at the Crossroads of Atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's Disease.
35872901|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are pathologies that are characterized by common signatures of vascular dysfunction and chronic inflammation that are accelerated with aging. Importantly, epidemiological studies report an independent interaction between AD and CVD and data suggest that chronic inflammation in CVD may accelerate AD development. Atherosclerosis affects most large to medium sized arteries including those supplying the cerebral circulation. Vascular dysfunction caused by atherosclerosis results in blood brain barrier breakdown, inflammation, an impaired clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta), and finally ends with neurovascular dysfunction. Numerous data indicate that innate and adaptive immune responses shape atherogenesis and increasing evidence suggests an implication of the immune response in AD progression. Currently, mechanisms by which these two diseases are interconnected with each other are not well-defined. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in our understanding of the intertwined role of the immune response in atherosclerosis and AD and the implications of these findings for human health.
