38236019|t|Deciphering ApoE Genotype-Driven Proteomic and Lipidomic Alterations in Alzheimer's Disease Across Distinct Brain Regions.
38236019|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a complex etiology influenced by confounding factors such as genetic polymorphisms, age, sex, and race. Traditionally, AD research has not prioritized these influences, resulting in dramatically skewed cohorts such as three times the number of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4-allele carriers in AD relative to healthy cohorts. Thus, the resulting molecular changes in AD have previously been complicated by the influence of apolipoprotein E disparities. To explore how apolipoprotein E polymorphism influences AD progression, 62 post-mortem patients consisting of 33 AD and 29 controls (Ctrl) were studied to balance the number of epsilon4-allele carriers and facilitate a molecular comparison of the apolipoprotein E genotype. Lipid and protein perturbations were assessed across AD diagnosed brains compared to Ctrl brains, epsilon4 allele carriers (APOE4+ for those carrying 1 or 2 epsilon4s and APOE4- for non-epsilon4 carriers), and differences in epsilon3epsilon3 and epsilon3epsilon4 Ctrl brains across two brain regions (frontal cortex (FCX) and cerebellum (CBM)). The region-specific influences of apolipoprotein E on AD mechanisms showcased mitochondrial dysfunction and cell proteostasis at the core of AD pathophysiology in the post-mortem brains, indicating these two processes may be influenced by genotypic differences and brain morphology.
