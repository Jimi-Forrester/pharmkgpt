23706516|t|The epsilon4 genotype of apolipoprotein E and white matter integrity in Alzheimer's disease.
23706516|a|BACKGROUND: In this multicenter study, we investigated a possible association between the APOE epsilon4 allele and white matter (WM) integrity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS: We analyzed fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) as indices of WM integrity in 70 AD patients (35 APOE epsilon4 carriers, 35 noncarriers) and 56 healthy control (HC) subjects (28 APOE epsilon4 carriers, 28 noncarriers). APOE epsilon4 carriers and noncarriers were matched for age and gender within each diagnostic group. RESULTS: We found significant effects of diagnosis (Pcorrected < .05 [FWE]; i.e., smaller FA values and larger MD values in AD patients compared with HCs) and significant effects (P < .001) of APOE epsilon4 carrier status on MD in HCs but not in AD subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that APOE epsilon4 has a moderate effect on WM integrity in HCs, but no effect on WM integrity in manifest AD.
