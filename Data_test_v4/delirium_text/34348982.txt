34348982|t|A scoping review of palliative care outcome measures in interstitial lung disease.
34348982|a|Interstitial lung disease (ILD) confers a high mortality and symptom burden, substantially impacting quality of life. Studies evaluating palliative care in ILD are rapidly expanding. Uniform outcome measures are crucial to assessing the impact of palliative care in ILD. This scoping review evaluates existing outcome measures in general health-related quality of life (HRQoL), physical health, mental health, social health and advance care planning (ACP) domains in patients with ILD. Articles in English with quantitative assessment of at least one measure of general HRQoL, physical health, mental health, social health or ACP in patients with ILD were included. Searches across three databases yielded 3488 non-duplicate articles. 23 met eligibility criteria and included three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or secondary analysis of an RCT (13%), three cross-sectional studies or secondary analysis of cross-sectional study (13%), one prospective study (4%) and 16 retrospective studies (70%). Among eligible articles, 25 distinct instruments were identified. Six studies assessed general HRQoL (26%), 16 assessed physical health (70%), 11 assessed mental health (48%), six assessed social health (26%) and 16 assessed ACP (70%). The ability to compare results across studies remains challenging given the heterogeneity in outcome measures. Future work is needed to develop core palliative care outcome measures in ILD.
