35349761|t|Case report: A novel cause of acute liver failure in children: A combination of human herpesvirus-6 infection and homozygous mutation in NBAS gene.
35349761|a|Etiologies of acute liver failure in children can be multiple factors including virus infection, drug-induced damage, and different pathogens. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an emerging method for pan-pathogen screening. Here we reported a case of acute liver failure in a 15-month-old male, using NGS and gene sequencing to determine the cause of acute liver failure may be caused by pathogens, drug-induction and pathogenic variant gene.
