2661443|t|[L-tryptophan in pre-delirium and delirium conditions].
2661443|a|The effect of the serotonin precursor l-tryptophan on delirium and pre-delirium states was studied in a prospective study on 32 patients. Patients were given 3 infusions each containing 2.5 g l-tryptophan, a day for at least 7 days. The status of the patients was examined with the Mini Mental State Examination, the SCAG (Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric Scale) and a sleep/awake observation sheet. These showed that the patients experienced significant trends toward improvement. Relevant side effects and interactions were not observed. The application of supplemental tranquilizers could be reduced and in 5 cases it was not necessary at all. It was only necessary to apply l-tryptophan for longer than 7 days in 4 of 32 patients. Furthermore, under this medication no patient in a state of predelirium at delivery into the hospital developed full delirium tremens.
