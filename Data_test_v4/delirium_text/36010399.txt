36010399|t|Future of Structured Lipids: Enzymatic Synthesis and Their New Applications in Food Systems.
36010399|a|Structured lipids (SLs) refer to a new type of functional lipid obtained by modifying natural triacylglycerol (TAG) through the restructuring of fatty acids, thereby altering the composition, structure, and distribution of fatty acids attached to the glycerol backbones. Due to the unique functional characteristics of SLs (easy to absorb, low in calories, reduced serum TAG, etc.), there is increasing interest in the research and application of SLs. SLs were initially prepared using chemical methods. With the wide application of enzymes in industries and the advantages of enzymatic synthesis (mild reaction conditions, high catalytic efficiency, environmental friendliness, etc.), synthesis of SLs using lipase has aroused great interest. This review summarizes the reaction system of SL production and introduces the enzymatic synthesis and application of some of the latest SLs discussed/developed in recent years, including medium- to long-chain triacylglycerol (MLCT), diacylglycerol (DAG), EPA- and DHA-enriched TAG, human milk fat substitutes, and esterified propoxylated glycerol (EPG). Lastly, several new ways of applying SLs (powdered oil, DAG plastic fat, inert gas spray oil, and emulsion) in the future food industry are also highlighted.
