39357500|a|Oxidative stress, or the chronic generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is thought to contribute to the progression of aging and aging related diseases. However, low degree of ROS generation has repeatedly been shown to be associated with beneficial outcomes via activation of protective signaling pathways. Berberine, a natural alkaloid isolated from Rhizomacoptidis, has a long history of medicinal use in both Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine, which possesses anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and anti-neurodegenerative properties. In this study, we utilize Caenorhabditis elegans to examine the mechanisms by which berberine influences healthspan and neurodegenerative diseases. We find that 10 muM berberine significantly extends healthy lifespan in wild type C. elegans. We further show that berberine generates ROS, which is followed by activation of PMK-1/SKN-1 to extend healthspan. Intriguingly, berberine also delays neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and polyglutamine diseases in a PMK-1/SKN-1dependent manner. Our work suggests that berberine may be a viable candidate for the prevention and treatment of aging and aging related diseases.
