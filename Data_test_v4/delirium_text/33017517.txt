33017517|t|Funduscopy: Yes or no? Hypertensive emergencies and retinopathy in the emergency care setting; a retrospective cohort study.
33017517|a|According to international guidelines, patients with a suspected hypertensive emergency (HE) admitted to the emergency department (ED) should undergo comprehensive evaluation including funduscopic examination. However, funduscopy is not always readily available and little is known about the prevalence of retinopathy among these patients in the ED setting. In order to characterize patients who should undergo funduscopy, we studied the prevalence, characteristics and clinical outcome in patients with a suspected HE and retinopathy grade III/IV. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with severe elevation of blood pressure (BP) admitted to the ED between 2012 and 2015. Patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) >=180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >=120 mm Hg at time of presentation were included. A total of 271 patients were included, of whom 18 (6.6%; 95%CI 3.9-10.5) had a HE. In 121 patients (44.6%; 95%CI 37.1-53.3), funduscopy was performed, of whom 17 (14.0%; 95%CI 8.2-22.5) had retinopathy grade III/IV. Mean SBP and DBP were significantly higher in patients with retinopathy (P < .001). However, retinopathy was also seen in patients with lower BP (SBP < 200 mm Hg and DBP < 120 mm Hg). No differences in other clinical characteristics, including visual disturbances, were found. One patient with retinopathy suffered an ischemic stroke after taking oral medication. The prevalence of retinopathy is high among examined patients. Except for higher BP, no clinical signs or symptoms are associated with the presence of retinopathy grade III/IV. We therefore conclude that funduscopic examination should be performed in every patient with a suspected HE.
