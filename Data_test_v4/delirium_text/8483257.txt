8483257|a|In the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, free radicals might play a role. Fat-soluble vitamins are a kind of anti-oxidative substance. Therefore, fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin E, may be useful in treatment of Parkinson's disease and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. However, it is still unclear whether the concentration of vitamin E in the blood or in the brain tissue, in patients with Parkinson's disease or with of the senile dementia Alzheimer type, is higher than or the same as that in normal subjects. Furthermore, although the effectiveness of vitamin E in the treatment of Parkinson's disease has been reported, the usefulness of vitamin E is still obscure. Further study will be necessary, in order to clarify the role of fat-soluble vitamins in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.
