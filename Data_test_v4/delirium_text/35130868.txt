In this study, we explored the impact of providing dementia care during COVID-19 on caregivers involved in dementia care. METHODS: This is an exploratory qualitative case study. The participants were family members living with older people with dementia, care managers, and the medical and long-term care facility staff. Data were collected from 46 caregivers via face-to-face and semi-structured interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The interviews identified 22 themes related to the impact of COVID-19 on different positions of the caregivers involved in dementia care and their collaboration, and we categorized them into six categories. The core themes were "re-acknowledgement of care priorities" and "rebuilding of relationships." When caregivers' perceptions were aligned in the decision-making processes regarding care priorities, "reaffirmation of trust" and "strengthening of intimate relationships" emerged as positive changes in their relationships. Furthermore, the differences in the ability of each caregiver to access and select correct and appropriate information about COVID-19, and the extent of infection spread in the region were related to "anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic" and caused a "gap in perception" regarding infection control. CONCLUSIONS: The present study clarified that the process of aligning the perceptions of caregivers to the objectives and priorities of care for older people with dementia during COVID-19 pandemic strengthened the relationships among caregivers. The findings of this study are useful for caregivers involved in person-centered dementia care.
