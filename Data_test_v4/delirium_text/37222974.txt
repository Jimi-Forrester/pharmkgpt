37222974|a|Background: Platelets contain high levels of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides and have been suggested to participate in the deposition of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Objectives: This study aimed to determine whether human platelets release pathogenic Abeta peptides Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 and to characterise the mechanisms regulating this phenomenon. Methods and Results: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) revealed that the haemostatic stimulus thrombin and the pro-inflammatory molecule lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce platelet release of both Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40. Notably, LPS preferentially induced the release of Abeta1-42, which was potentiated by the reduction of oxygen from atmospheric levels to physiological hypoxia. The selective beta secretase (BACE) inhibitor LY2886721 showed no effect on the release of either Abeta1-40 or Abeta1-42 in our ELISA experiments. This suggested a store-and-release mechanism that was confirmed in immunostaining experiments showing co-localisation of cleaved Abeta peptides with platelet alpha granules. Conclusions: Taken together, our data suggest that human platelets release pathogenic Abeta peptides as a result of a store-and-release mechanism rather than a de novo proteolytic event. Although further studies are required to fully characterise this phenomenon, we suggest the possibility of a role for platelets in the deposition of Abeta peptides and the formation of amyloid plaques. Interestingly, the combination of hypoxia and inflammation that we simulated in vitro with reduced oxygen tension and LPS may increase the release of fibrillogenic Abeta1-42 and, consequently, exacerbate amyloid plaque deposition in the brain of AD patients.
