22516219|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the phenomenology, etiology and outcome of delirium in children and adolescents (8-18 years of age) seen in a consultation-liaison psychiatric service in India. Additionally, an attempt was made to compare the phenomenology with adult and elderly patients with delirium. METHOD: Thirty children and adolescents (age 8-18 years) diagnosed with delirium by the consultation-liaison psychiatry team were rated on the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R-98) and compared with DRS-R-98 data on 120 adults and 109 elderly patients. RESULTS: The commonly observed symptoms in children and adolescents with delirium were disturbance in attention, orientation, sleep-wake cycle disturbances, fluctuation of symptoms, disturbance of short-term memory and motor agitation. The least commonly seen symptoms included delusions and motor retardation. Compared to adults, children and adolescents had lower frequency of long-term memory and visuospatial disturbances. Compared to the elderly, children and adolescents had higher frequency of lability of affect. For severity of symptoms, compared to adults, the children and adolescents had lower severity of sleep-wake disturbances, abnormality of thought, motor agitation, orientation, attention, short-term memory, long-term memory and visuospatial abilities. When compared to elderly patients, children and adolescents had higher severity of lability of affect and lower severity of language disturbances, short-term memory and visuospatial abilities. CONCLUSIONS: In general, phenomenology, of delirium in children and adolescents (age 8-18 years) is similar to that seen in adults and elderly patients.
