34345292|a|Life expectancy has increased worldwide and, along with it, a greater prevalence of age-dependent disorders, chronic illnesses and comorbidities can be observed. In 2019, in both Europe and the Americas, dementias ranked 3rd among the top 10 causes of death. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent type of neurodegenerative disease. In the last decades, globally, the number of people suffering from PD has more than doubled to over 6 million. Of all the neurological disorders, PD increased with the fastest rate. This troubling trend highlights the stringent need for accurate diagnostic biomarkers, especially in the early stages of the disease and to evaluate treatment response. To gain a broad and complex understanding of the recent advances in the '-omics' research fields, electronic databases such as PubMed, Google Academic, and Science Direct were searched for publications regarding metabolomic studies on PD to identify specific biomarkers for PD, and especially PD with associated psychiatric symptomatology. Discoveries in the fields of metagenomics, transcriptomics and proteomics, may lead to an improved comprehension of the metabolic pathways involved in disease etiology and progression and contribute to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for effective treatment options.
