37627533|t|Exploring the Antioxidant, Neuroprotective, and Anti-Inflammatory Potential of Olive Leaf Extracts from Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Italy.
37627533|a|The leaves of the olive tree (Olea europaea L.) are one of the major solid wastes from the olive industry. Globally, the European Union is the largest producer of olive by-products, with Spain, Italy, Greece, and Portugal accounting for almost the entire production. Many questions remain to be solved concerning olive leaves (OL), including those related to possible differences in composition and/or biological activities depending on their geographical origin. In the present work, OL from Spain, Italy, Greece, and Portugal have been characterized according to their phytochemical profile, antioxidant capacity, neuroprotective activity, and anti-inflammatory effects. The Spanish and Italian OL samples presented the highest antioxidant and neuroprotective activities, while the Greek OL showed the lowest. These results were strongly associated with the content of oleoside methyl ester and p-hydroxybenzoic acid for the Spanish and Italian samples, respectively, whereas the content of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid dialdehyde form (hydrated) was negatively associated with the mentioned biological activities of the Greek samples. No country-related effect was observed in the anti-inflammatory activity of OL. Comprehensively, this work could provide a useful tool for manufacturers and R&D departments in making environmentally friendly decisions on how OL can be used to generate nutraceutical products based on the composition and origin of this by-product.
