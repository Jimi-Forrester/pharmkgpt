39827439|a|BACKGROUND: Preventive medications are potential targets for deprescribing in older adults with dementia as goals of care change from preventive to palliative. Yet, prescribers lack communication guidance to address deprescribing. OBJECTIVE: Using bisphosphonates as a case example, we sought to characterize and compare communication preferences of prescribers and family/informal caregivers regarding deprescribing. METHODS: We conducted 23 semi-structured interviews with prescribers (12) and caregivers (11) of older adults with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD). Prescribers and caregivers were asked to provide their impressions of seven conversation starters for discussing deprescribing, focusing on a case example using bisphosphonates. These phrases focused on topics including life expectancy, treatment burden, adverse effects, and costs. We used a qualitative framework analysis to identify relevant themes as prescribers and caregivers discussed their general perceptions of the potential benefits and harms of bisphosphonates and experiences with deprescribing. RESULTS: Among prescribers, there were ten physicians and two nurse practitioners; most (nine) female and white. Among caregivers, eight were female, seven were white, and five were Latino/a. For both prescribers and caregivers, preferred conversation starters initiated a risk versus benefit discussion, emphasizing medication adverse effects and patient-specific factors, such as functional status and indication for treatment. While prescribers emphasized discussing common medication adverse effects, caregivers noted the importance of knowing a medication's potential impact on ADRD. The least preferred conversation starter for deprescribing among both groups focused on the extra effort and cost of continuing bisphosphonates. Discordance between caregivers and prescribers were identified in several phrases; notably, caregivers disliked statements that introduced discussions of prognosis and life expectancy. CONCLUSIONS: Deprescribing conversations may be best perceived by caregivers when introduced with a discussion of a medication's adverse effects and potential impact on cognition. In addition, deprescribing conversations should be tailored to patient-specific factors, including functional status, goals of care, and the role of their caregiver in medical decision-making. Avoiding discussions of medication cost, pill burden, and life expectancy may help reassure the caregiver that deprescribing is a form of medication optimization and not a withdrawal of care.
