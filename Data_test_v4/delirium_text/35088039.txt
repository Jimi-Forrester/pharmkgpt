35088039|t|Perspectives on the Role of APOE4 as a Therapeutic Target for Alzheimer's Disease.
35088039|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is coupled with chronic cognitive dysfunction. AD cases are mostly late onset, and genetic risk factors like the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) play a key role in this process. APOE e2, APOE e3, and APOE e4 are three key alleles in the human APOE gene. For late onset, APOE e4 has the most potent risk factor while APOE e2 plays a defensive role. Several studies suggests that APOE e4 causes AD via different processes like neurofibrillary tangle formation by amyloid-beta accumulation, exacerbated neuroinflammation, cerebrovascular disease, and synaptic loss. But the pathway is still unclear that which actions of APOE e4 lead to AD development. Since APOE was found to contribute to many AD pathways, targeting APOE e4 can lead to a hopeful plan of action in development of new drugs to target AD. In this review, we focus on recent studies and perspectives, focusing on APOE e4 as a key molecule in therapeutic strategies.
