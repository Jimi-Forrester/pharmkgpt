37764740|t|Inverse J-Shaped Relationship of Dietary Carbohydrate Intake with Serum Klotho in NHANES 2007-2016.
37764740|a|BACKGROUND: The relationship between dietary carbohydrate intake and serum Klotho levels, an aging biomarker, remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between dietary carbohydrate intake and serum Klotho levels among American adults aged 40-79. METHODS: We analyzed data from 10,669 adults aged 40-79 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007 to 2016. Trained interviewers assessed dietary carbohydrate intake using a 24 h dietary recall. Serum Klotho concentrations were measured using commercially available ELISA kits provided by IBL International, Japan, which served as the study outcome. Generalized linear models were used to assess the relationship between the carbohydrate energy percentage and serum Klotho concentration, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was employed to explore any nonlinear associations. RESULTS: After adjusting for multiple variables, we observed a nonlinear inverse J-shaped relationship (p for non-linearity < 0.001) between the carbohydrate energy percentage and serum Klotho levels. Specifically, the highest serum Klotho levels were associated with a total carbohydrate energy percentage ranging from 48.92% to 56.20% (third quartile). When the carbohydrate energy percentage was evaluated in quartiles, serum Klotho levels decreased by 5.37% (95% CI: -7.43%, -3.26%), 2.70% (95% CI: -4.51%, -0.86%), and 2.76% (95% CI: -4.86%, -0.62%) in the first quartile (<41.46%), second quartile (41.46% to 48.92%), and fourth quartile (>=56.20%), respectively, compared to the third quartile. This relationship was more pronounced in male, non-obese and non-diabetic participants under 60 years of age. CONCLUSION: A non-linear inverse J-shaped relationship exists among the general U.S. middle-aged and older population between the carbohydrate energy percentage and serum Klotho levels, with the highest levels observed at 48.92% to 56.20% carbohydrate intake.
