28674749|t|[Alzheimer dementia: course and burden on caregivers : Data over 18 months from German participants of the GERAS study].
28674749|a|The GERAS study is an international observational study with dementia patients of the Alzheimer type (AD) and their caregivers in everyday care. The 18-month data recorded in Germany are presented. Disease progression, medical and psychosocial consequences for both patients and caregivers were recorded using commonly used tests in clinical care: the mini mental status examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS-Cog14), Alzheimer's disease cooperative study activities of daily living inventory (ADCS-ADL), neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI-12), resource utilization in dementia (RUD) and the Zarit burden interview (ZBI). Definition of AD severity level (MMSE): 21-26 mild (miAD), 15-20 moderate (moAD), <15 moderately severe to severe (m/sAD). For the 550 participants (mean age: 75.2 years, SD 7.6 years), miAD (41.5%), moAD (28.4%) and m/sAD (30.2%), the MMSE worsened: in miAD by -2.4 (CI -3.1/-1.7), in moAD by -3.9 (CI -5.0/-2.8) and in m/sAD by -2.5 (CI -3.5/-1.5) at 18 months and the ADAS-Cog14 by 6.2 (miAD-CI 4.6/7.8) and 7.1 points (moAD CI 3.9/10.3). Changes in overall ADCS-ADL amounted to -8.4 (CI -10.1/-6.2) for miAD, -12.9 (CI -15.3/-10.4) for moAD and -10.2 points (CI-12.8/-7.7) for m/sAD. Caregiver burden (NPI-12) rose in miAD by 1.2 points (CI -0.2/2.2), in moAD by 3.4 (CI 1.8/5.1) and in m/sAD by 1.5 points (CI 0.2/3.3). At study start, the total time required by caregivers (RUD) was 3.1 h/day (SD 5.4 h/day) for miAD, 6.6 (SD 7.5) for moAD and 12.7 (SD 9.3) for m/sAD. With 4.4 (SD 9.4) h/day, the increase after 18 months was highest in moAD. Caregiver burden (ZBI) increased most markedly in moAD with 7.2 (CI 4.2/9.7), 90.7% of the patients received antidementia drugs, while 26.6% received psychotropic medication.
