25885833|t|Preoperative anxiolysis in pediatric population: A comparative study between oral midazolam and oral ketamine.
25885833|a|CONTEXT: Preoperative anxiety is synonymous with pediatric surgery. Anxiolysis is of crucial importance and poses a significant challenge to the pediatric anesthesiologist. Orally administered midazolam and ketamine can be used as anxiolytic premedication in children. AIM: To compare the efficacy of orally administered midazolam and ketamine for preoperative sedation and anxiolysis in children and determine the minimum interval required between premedication and parental separation. SETTING AND DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 70 children aged 2-8 years, belonging to ASA grade 1 and 2, scheduled to undergo elective infraumbilical and peripheral surgeries were randomized into two groups of 35 each to receive either midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) or ketamine (5 mg/kg) orally. They were assessed at an interval of 5 minutes up to 40 minutes, at the time of parental separation, intravenous cannulation, and application of face mask for ventilation. Sedation was noted according to Ramsay Sedation Scale and anxiolysis was noted according to Anxiolysis Scores used in previous published studies. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Skewed data between groups were analyzed by Mann Whitney U Test. Data within a group were analyzed using Friedman's Analysis of variance and a post hoc test. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in sedation and anxiolysis scores were obtained between the groups at any point of time. Maximum sedation score was achieved at 20 minutes in both the groups, with no statistically significant difference with scores obtained thereafter. Statistically significant difference occurred in anxiolysis score at study points in group receiving midazolam. CONCLUSION: The study documents the rapid achievement of preoperative sedation and anxiolysis in children with orally administered midazolam or ketamine, with the latter producing a superior quality of anxiolysis. An interval of 20 minutes is sufficient between premedication and parental separation.
