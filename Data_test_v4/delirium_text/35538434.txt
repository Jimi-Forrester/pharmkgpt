35538434|a|BACKGROUND: Several cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated leukoencephalopathy have been reported. Although most cases involve hypoxia, the pathophysiological mechanism and neurologic outcomes of COVID-19-associated leukoencephalopathy remain unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of COVID-19-associated leukoencephalopathy without severe hypoxia in a 65-year-old woman diagnosed with pyelonephritis. After the initiation of intravenous ceftriaxone, her fever resolved, but she developed an altered state of consciousness with abnormal behavior and, subsequently, a relapse fever. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and was intubated. Lung-protective ventilation with deep sedation and neuromuscular blockade were used for treatment. After cessation of sedative administration, her mental status remained at a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3. COVID-19 was assumed to have caused leukoencephalopathy due to the absence of severe hypoxia or other potential causes. She subsequently showed gradual neurologic improvement. Three months after the COVID-19 diagnosis, she regained alertness, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should consider leukoencephalopathy in the differential diagnosis of consciousness disorders in patients with severe COVID-19, even in the absence of severe hypoxia. Gradual neurologic improvement can be expected in such cases.
