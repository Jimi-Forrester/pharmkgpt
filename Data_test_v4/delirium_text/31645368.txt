31645368|t|Death by microglia.
31645368|a|The roles of microglia and ApoE in tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease, remain elusive. In this issue, Shi et al. (https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20190980) demonstrate that microglia-mediated innate immunity collaborates with ApoE to drive neurodegeneration and disease progression in a mouse model of tauopathy.
