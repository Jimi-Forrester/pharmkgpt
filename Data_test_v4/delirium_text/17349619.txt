Salidroside, a phenylpropanoid glycoside isolated from Rhodiola rosea L, shows potent antioxidant property. In this paper, the neuroprotective effects of salidroside on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells were investigated. Pretreatment with salidroside markedly attenuated H2O2-induced cell viability loss and apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner. The mechanisms by which salidroside protected neuron cells from oxidative stress included the induction of several antioxidant enzymes, thioredoxin, heme oxygenase-1, and peroxiredoxin-I; the downregulation of pro-apoptotic gene Bax and the upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L). Furthermore, salidroside dose-dependently restored H2O2-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential as well as the elevation of intracellular calcium level. These results suggest that salidroside has protective effects against oxidative stress-induced cell apoptosis, which might be a potential therapeutic agent for treating or preventing neurodegenerative diseases implicated with oxidative stress.
