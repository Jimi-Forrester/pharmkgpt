15175081|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is one of the characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and this accumulation of fibrillar amyloid-beta (Alphabeta) in the vascular wall is accompanied by marked vascular damage. In vitro, Abeta1-40 carrying the 'Dutch' mutation (DAbeta1-40) induces degeneration of cultured human brain pericytes (HBP). To identify possible intracellular mediators of Abeta-induced cell death, a comparative cDNA expression array was performed to detect differential gene expression of Abeta-treated vs. untreated HBP. Messenger RNA expression of cyclin D1, integrin beta4, defender against cell death-1, neuroleukin, thymosin beta10, and integrin alpha5 were increased in DAbeta1-40-treated HBP, whereas insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 mRNA expression was decreased. Corresponding protein expression was investigated in AD and control brains to explore a potential role for these proteins in pathological lesions of the AD brain. Cyclin D1 expression was increased in cerebral amyloid angiopathy and cells in a perivascular position, suggesting that the cell cycle may be disturbed during Abeta-mediated degeneration of cerebrovascular cells. Moreover, cyclin D1 expression, but also that of integrin beta4, defender against cell death-1, neuroleukin and thymosin beta10 was found in a subset of senile plaques, suggesting a role for these proteins in the pathogenesis of senile plaques.
