2239649|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of progressive dementia in older adults. Diagnosis is based on a careful history, a thorough physical examination and appropriate laboratory studies. Although the pathology of Alzheimer's disease is well described, the etiology remains unknown. The only well-established risk factors are advanced age and family history. Management problems frequently include depression, delirium, wandering, urinary incontinence and iatrogenic disease.
