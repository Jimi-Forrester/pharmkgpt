36233471|t|Mechanisms and Neuroimaging Patterns of Hypereosinophilia-Related Ischemic Stroke: A Narrative Review through Three Cases.
36233471|a|BACKGROUND: Hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES) are a group of relatively rare disorders in which neurological manifestations, including ischemic stroke, are common. The hypothesized pathophysiological mechanisms are hypercoagulability, cardioembolism (mainly mediated by myocardial involvement) and damage to the endothelium. A variable ischemic pattern has been described, including an association of territorial and border zone ischemic stroke. METHODS: Three patients who presented to our department with acute stroke were selected aiming to show these three different mechanisms inferred from the stroke pattern on brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and to simultaneously illustrate the three main causes of HES. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The first patient is a 55-year-old man with an abrupt onset of aphasia due to an acute ischemic stroke involving the left parietal lobule and the angular gyrus; recent lab test had shown hypereosinophilia. An extensive workup excluded primary and secondary causes of hypereosinophilia so a diagnosis of idiopathic hypereosinophilia was done and he was treated with high doses of steroids. The second patient had severe hypereosinophilia and developed multiple small, scattered ischemic lesions, mainly in border zone zones. The history of severe asthma and recurrent sinusitis supported the diagnosis of EGPA (Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis); considering the severe clinical conditions and the presumptive role of hypereosinophilia in determining her symptoms, steroid treatment was promptly started, with good clinical response. The third patient also presented with multiple metachronous ischemic lesions, both in cortical and border zone distribution and marked eosinophilia; the diagnostic work-up found an ovarian cancer. She was treated with steroids and then underwent surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: HES should be considered in stroke etiological evaluation, although it is a rare disorder, and border zones pattern without large artery steno-occlusion on neuroimaging may help to raise the suspicion in the neurovascular diagnostic pathway. A thorough research of the sources of hypereosinophilia should be performed to select the appropriate therapy.
