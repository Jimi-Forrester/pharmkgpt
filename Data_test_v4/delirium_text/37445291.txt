37445291|t|Cognitive Reserve and Its Association with Cognitive and Mental Health Status following an Acute Spinal Cord Injury.
37445291|a|BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common secondary condition associated with spinal cord injury (SCI). Cognitive reserve (CR) is believed to protect against cognitive decline and can be assessed by premorbid intelligence (pmIQ). Despite the potential utility of pmIQ as a complementary metric in the evaluation of MCI in SCI, this approach has been infrequently employed. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between MCI and pmIQ in adults with SCI with the aim of exploring the potential value of pmIQ as a marker of CR in this population. METHODS: Cognitive function was assessed on three occasions in adults with SCI over a 12-month period post-injury, and pmIQ was assessed once at baseline. Demographic and mental health measures were also collected, and logistic regression was conducted to determine the strength of association between pmIQ and MCI while adjusting for factors such as mental health and age. RESULTS: The regression analysis revealed that at the time of admission to SCI rehabilitation, the MCI assessed by a valid neurocognitive screen was strongly associated with pmIQ. That is, if a person has MCI, there was 5.4 greater odds (p < 0.01) that they will have poor pmIQ compared to a person without MCI after adjustment for age and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of CR is an important area that should be considered to improve the process of diagnosing MCI in adults with an acute SCI and potentially facilitate earlier intervention to slow or prevent cognitive decline.
