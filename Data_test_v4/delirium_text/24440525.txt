24440525|a|Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) aggregation is considered to be a critical step in the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to Abeta, many proteins aggregate into the amyloid state, in which they form elongated fibers with spines comprising stranded beta-sheets. However, the cross-seeding effects of other protein aggregates on Abeta aggregation pathways are not completely clear. To investigate the cross-seeding effects of exogenous and human non-CNS amyloidogenic proteins on Abeta aggregation pathways, we examined whether and how sonicated fibrils of casein, fibroin, sericin, actin, and islet amyloid polypeptide affected Abeta40 and Abeta42 aggregation pathways using the thioflavin T assay and electron microscopy. Interestingly, the fibrillar seeds of all amyloidogenic proteins functioned as seeds. The cross-seeding effect of actin was stronger but that of fibroin was weaker than that of other proteins. Furthermore, our nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic studies identified the binding sites of Abeta with the amyloidogenic proteins. Our results indicate that the amyloidogenic proteins, including those contained in foods and cosmetics, contribute to Abeta aggregation by binding to Abeta, suggesting their possible roles in the propagation of Abeta amyloidosis.
