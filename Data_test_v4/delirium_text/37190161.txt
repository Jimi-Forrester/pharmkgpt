37190161|t|Deep Learning Prediction Model for Patient Survival Outcomes in Palliative Care Using Actigraphy Data and Clinical Information.
37190161|a|(1) Background: Predicting the survival of patients in end-of-life care is crucial, and evaluating their performance status is a key factor in determining their likelihood of survival. However, the current traditional methods for predicting survival are limited due to their subjective nature. Wearable technology that provides continuous patient monitoring is a more favorable approach for predicting survival outcomes among palliative care patients. (2) Aims and objectives: In this study, we aimed to explore the potential of using deep learning (DL) model approaches to predict the survival outcomes of end-stage cancer patients. Furthermore, we also aimed to compare the accuracy of our proposed activity monitoring and survival prediction model with traditional prognostic tools, such as the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) and the Palliative Performance Index (PPI). (3) Method: This study recruited 78 patients from the Taipei Medical University Hospital's palliative care unit, with 66 (39 male and 27 female) patients eventually being included in our DL model for predicting their survival outcomes. (4) Results: The KPS and PPI demonstrated an overall accuracy of 0.833 and 0.615, respectively. In comparison, the actigraphy data exhibited a higher accuracy at 0.893, while the accuracy of the wearable data combined with clinical information was even better, at 0.924. (5) Conclusion: Our study highlights the significance of incorporating clinical data alongside wearable sensors to predict prognosis. Our findings suggest that 48 h of data is sufficient for accurate predictions. The integration of wearable technology and the prediction model in palliative care has the potential to improve decision making for healthcare providers and can provide better support for patients and their families. The outcomes of this study can possibly contribute to the development of personalized and patient-centered end-of-life care plans in clinical practice.
