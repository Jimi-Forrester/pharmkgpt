33494165|a|The percentage of individuals over the age of 60 is projected to reach 22% by 2050; chronic diseases associated with aging can present challenges for these individuals. Anthocyanins and the gut microbiome have each been studied as independent influencers of health. Both these factors have shown to have a positive effect on cardiovascular and bone health in individuals, as well as on the prevention or treatment of certain forms of cancers. Anthocyanins have shown to modulate the composition of the gut microbiome and may have overlapping mechanisms in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders and aging-associated bone loss. These health outcomes are responsible for the hospitalization and deaths of millions of Americans every year and they cost the United States billions of dollars each year to maintain, prevent and treat. Alternative methods of treatment and prevention are desired since conventional methods (surgical and pharmacological methods, physical therapy, etc.) can be costly and have significant side effects; evidence suggests that anthocyanins and the gut microbiome may be potential avenues for this. This review evaluates the findings of existing literature on the role of anthocyanins and the gut microbiome on health and their potential as a natural therapeutic agent or a target organ to provide an alternative to the conventional methods of disease prevention and treatment.
