21150010|a|Recent advances in molecular biology have advanced our understanding of the genetic substrate predisposing to sudden death, especially in monogenic disorders. Numerous ion channels along with membrane structural proteins have been extensively investigated for their role in the genesis of serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The complex interplay of various biological pathways culminating in the more prevalent form of sudden death due to coronary artery disease however still remains to be unraveled. The concept of multi-factorial causation of arrhythmias where a second clinical or environmental factor is necessary for expression of an underlying genetic susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias is a serious possibility. This article briefly outlines the current understanding about the role of genetics in sudden cardiac death.
