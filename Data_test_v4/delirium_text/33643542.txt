33643542|t|The Balance between Two Branches of RAS Can Protect from Severe COVID-19 Course.
33643542|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has swept the world and required the mobilization of scientists and clinicians around the world to combat this serious disease. Along with SARS-CoV-2 virology research, understanding of the fundamental physiological processes, molecular and cellular mechanisms and intracellular signaling pathways underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is important for effective therapy of this disease. The review describes in detail the interaction of the components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and receptors of end-glycosylated products (RAGE), which plays a special role in normal lung physiology and in pathological conditions in COVID-19, including the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and "cytokine storm". A separate section is devoted to the latest developments aimed at correcting the dysfunction of the RAS caused by the binding of the virus to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)- the central element of this system. Analysis of published theoretical, clinical, and experimental data indicates the need for a complex treatment to prevent a severe course of COVID-19 using MasR agonists, blockers of the AT1R and NF-kappaB signaling pathway, as well as compounds with neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects.
