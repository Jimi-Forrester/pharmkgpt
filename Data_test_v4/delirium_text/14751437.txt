14751437|a|Several lines of evidence suggest that D-serine may function as an endogenous agonist of the glycine site on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor that has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of the study was to determine whether serum levels of D- and L-serine in patients with AD are altered as compared with normal controls. Serum levels of D- and L-serine in patients of AD and age- and gender-matched normal controls were determined using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Serum levels of D-serine in the patients with AD were slightly (z=-1.77, p=0.078) lower than those of normal controls. In contrast, serum levels of L-serine in the patients were slightly (z=-1.73, p=0.083) higher than those of controls. In addition, the percentage (%) of D-serine in the total (L+D) serine in the patients was significantly (z=-2.36, p=0.018) lower than that of controls. The present study suggests that the reduced activity of serine racemase, an enzyme catalyzing the formation of D-serine from L-serine may play a role in the pathophysiology of AD.
