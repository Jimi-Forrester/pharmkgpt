19717305|t|Synthesis of organophosphates with fluorine-containing leaving groups as serine esterase inhibitors with potential for Alzheimer disease therapeutics.
19717305|a|Acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors are potential cognition enhancers in Alzheimer disease. O,O-Dialkylphosphate inhibitors with 1-substituted 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy leaving groups were synthesized by phosphonate-phosphate rearrangement. Substituents in the 1-position of the leaving group along with the O-alkyl groups modulated potency and selectivity against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and carboxylesterase.
