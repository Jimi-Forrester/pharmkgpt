36577289|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation combined with an integrated perioperative nursing program and evaluate its effects on preventing subsyndromal delirium (SSD) and postoperative delirium (POD) in older patients after joint replacement surgery. METHODS: Participants were randomly divided into two groups, the experimental group (n = 48) was given transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation combined with an integrated perioperative nursing program based on the routine care of the control group (n = 49). The incidence of SSD and POD in a week after surgery was recorded. Assessments of delirium severity, cognition, anxiety, and depression were also conducted at baseline and on postoperative day 7. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the intervention program had significant advances in alleviating the severity of delirium, cognitive impairment, anxiety, and depression but failed to reduce the incidence of SSD and POD. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that TEAS combined with an integrated perioperative nursing program has a beneficial effect on alleviating symptoms of delirium, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, and depression in older adults after joint replacement surgery.
