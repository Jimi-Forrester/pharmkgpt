30906391|t|Plasma Oligomeric Beta Amyloid in Alzheimer's Disease with History of Agent Orange Exposure.
30906391|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During the Vietnam War, many Korean soldiers were exposed to Agent Orange. Until now, there existed only limited evidence of association between exposure to Agent Orange and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main pathological feature of AD is brain amyloidosis. To explore the pathophysiological characteristic of AD with Agent Orange exposure, we compared newly developed amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomer levels in plasma between AD with Agent Orange exposure and without exposure. METHODS: We recruited 48 AD patients with Agent Orange exposure and 66 AD patients without Agent Orange. Using the Multimer Detection System technique, which was based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we measured Abeta oligomers in the plasma of study subjects. RESULTS: Compared to normal control patients, plasma Abeta oligomer levels were higher in AD patients regardless of history of Agent Orange exposure. However, AD patients with Agent Orange exposure showed higher plasma Abeta oligomer levels than AD patients without Agent Orange. DISCUSSION: This study showed higher plasma Abeta oligomer levels in AD patients with Agent Orange exposure compared to AD patients without Agent Orange. This finding suggests the possibility of a different pathophysiology of AD patients with Agent Orange exposure from AD patients without Agent Orange.
