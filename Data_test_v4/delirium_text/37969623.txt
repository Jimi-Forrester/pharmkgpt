37969623|a|Hematopoietic and lymphoid tumors are a heterogeneous group of diseases including lymphomas, multiple myeloma (MM), and leukemias. These diseases are associated with systemic involvement and various clinical presentations including acute neurological deficits. Adult patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) are at risk for developing a wide array of acute conditions involving the nervous system. HM in adults may present as tumoral masses responsible for mass effect, possibly resulting in acute neurological signs and symptoms caused by tumor growth with compression of central nervous system (CNS) structures. Moreover, as result of the hematologic disease itself or due to systemic treatments, hematologic patients are at risk for vascular pathologies, such as ischemic, thrombotic, and hemorrhagic disorders due to the abnormal coagulation status. The onset of these disorders is often with acute neurologic signs or symptoms. Lastly, it is well known that patients with HM can have impaired function of the immune system. Thus, CNS involvement due to immune-related diseases such as mycotic, parasitic, bacterial, and viral infections linked to immunodeficiency, together with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, are frequently seen in hematologic patients. Knowledge of the etiology and expected CNS imaging findings in patients with HM is of great importance to reach a fast and correct diagnosis and guide treatment choices. In this manuscript, we review the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance findings of these conditions which can be related to the disease itself and/or to their treatments.
