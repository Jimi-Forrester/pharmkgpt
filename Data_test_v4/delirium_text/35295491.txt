35295491|t|Pathological Mechanisms and Preventive Strategies of Oxaliplatin-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy.
35295491|a|Oxaliplatin, which is widely used in treating cancers such as colorectal cancer, frequently causes peripheral neuropathy. It not only significantly reduces the patient's quality of life due to physical distress but may also result in a change or discontinuation of cancer treatment. Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) is classified as acute or chronic depending on the onset time of side effects; however, the prevention and treatment of OIPN has not been established. As these peripheral neuropathies are side effects that occur due to treatment, the administration of effective prophylaxis can effectively prevent their onset. Although transient relief of symptoms such as pain and numbness enable the continuation of cancer treatment, it may result in the worsening of peripheral neuropathy. Thus, understanding the pathological mechanisms of OIPN and finding better preventative measures are important. This review focuses on animal models to address these issues, clarifies the pathological mechanisms of OIPN, and summarizes various approaches to solving OIPN, including targets for preventing OIPN.
