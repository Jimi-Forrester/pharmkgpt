21297255|t|Amyloid-beta-induced amyloid-beta secretion: a possible feed-forward mechanism in Alzheimer's Disease.
21297255|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, 36-43 amino acids in length, are produced from beta- and gamma-secretase cleavage of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP), and are one of the causative agents of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show that an ELISA can detect total rodent Abeta without interference from physiological concentrations of human Abeta. In cultured dissociated rat cortical neurons and rat and mouse hippocampal organotypic slices, we apply the assay to measure the production of Abeta in response to treatment with hydrogen peroxide, a known stimulator of Abeta secretion, or human Abeta dimer/trimer (Abetad/t), fractionated from the culture medium of 7PA2 cells. Peroxide increases Abeta secretion by about 2 fold, similar to results from previous reports that used a different assay. Of greater significance is that physiologically relevant concentrations (~250 pM) of human Abetad/t increase rodent Abeta secretion from cultured rat cortical neurons by >3 fold over 4 days. Surprisingly, neither treatment with peroxide nor human Abetad/t leads to accumulation of intracellular Abeta. Human Abetad/t increased >2 fold the Abeta secreted by organotypic hippocampal slices from tau knock-out mice whether or not they expressed a human tau transgene, suggesting tau plays no role in enhanced Abeta secretion. Together, these results support an Abeta-mediated feed-forward mechanism in AD progression.
