39090556|a|BACKGROUND: Since its discovery, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) has been characterized by rapid progression and poor prognosis, and no specific treatment is available. The aim of this study was to investigate the early warning indicators of mortality in SFTS patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study. The study subjects were patients who were admitted to the hospital with a confirmed diagnosis of SFTS from January 2023 to October 2023, and their clinical symptoms and signs at the time of admission, as well as the laboratory indexes of the first blood collection after admission were collected, grouped according to the prognosis, and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 141 patients were collected, of which 27 patients died and 114 patients were in the survival group. Through statistical analysis, patients with combined hemorrhagic manifestations, disturbance of consciousness, lymphopenia, elevated lipase, and prolonged thrombin time on admission were independent risk factors for patients' death. By plotting the working characteristic curve of the subjects, as well as calculating the area under the curve, the results showed that the AUC of lymphopenia count was 0.670, 95% CI (0.563-0.776), P = 0.006; the AUC of elevated serum lipase index was 0.789, 95% CI (0.699-0.878), p < 0.001; the AUC of prolonged thrombin time was 0.749, 95% CI (0.645-0.854), p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: Patients with hemorrhagic manifestations, disturbance of consciousness, lymphocyte reduction, elevated serum lipase, and prolonged thrombin time on admission are more worthy of the clinician's attention, and require early and effective interventions to avoid further disease progression.
