39095897|a|BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke elicits a complex and sustained immune response in the brain. Immunomodulatory treatments have long held promise for improving stroke outcomes, yet none have succeeded in the clinical setting. This lack of success is largely due to our incomplete understanding of how immune cells respond to stroke. The objective of the current study was to dissect the effect of permanent stroke on microglia, the resident immune cells within the brain parenchyma. METHODS: A permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model was used to induce ischemic stroke in young male and female mice. Microglia were sorted from fluorescence reporter mice after pMCAO or sham surgery and then subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. Various methods, including flow cytometry, RNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, whole-brain imaging, and bone marrow transplantation, were also employed to dissect the microglial response to stroke. Stroke outcomes were evaluated by infarct size and behavioral tests. RESULTS: First, we showed the morphologic and spatial changes in microglia after stroke. We then performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on microglia isolated from sham and stroke mice of both sexes. The data indicate no major sexual dimorphism in the microglial response to permanent stroke. Notably, we identified seven potential stroke-associated microglial clusters, including four major clusters characterized by a disease-associated microglia-like signature, a highly proliferative state, a macrophage-like profile, and an interferon (IFN) response signature, respectively. Importantly, we provided evidence that the macrophage-like cluster may represent the long-sought stroke-induced microglia subpopulation with increased CD45 expression. Lastly, given that the IFN-responsive subset constitutes the most prominent microglial population in the stroke brain, we used fludarabine to pharmacologically target STAT1 signaling and found that fludarabine treatment improved long-term stroke outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed new light on microglia heterogeneity in stroke pathology and underscore the potential of targeting specific microglial populations for effective stroke therapies.
