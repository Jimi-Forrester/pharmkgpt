29248481|t|Leptin and ghrelin: Sewing metabolism onto neurodegeneration.
29248481|a|Life expectancy has considerably increased over the last decades. The negative consequence of this augmented longevity has been a dramatic increase of age-related chronic neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis. Epidemiology is telling us there exists a strong correlation between the neuronal loss characterizing these disorders and metabolic dysfunction. This review aims at presenting the evidence supporting the existence of a molecular system linking metabolism with neurodegeneration, with a specific focus on the role of two hormones with a key role in the regulatory cross talk between metabolic imbalance and the damage of nervous system: leptin and ghrelin. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Metabolic Impairment as Risk Factors for Neurodegenerative Disorders.'
