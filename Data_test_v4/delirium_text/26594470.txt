26594470|t|Crystal structure of (E)-4,6-dimeth-oxy-2-(4-meth-oxy-styr-yl)-3-methyl-benzaldehyde.
26594470|a|In the title mol-ecule, C19H20O4, the central C=C double bond adopts an E configuration. The dihedral angle formed by the planes of the two benzene rings is 83.57 (12) . The three meth-oxy groups are essentially coplanar with the benzene rings to which they are attached, with C C-O-C torsion angles of -0.2 (3), -2.3 (3) and -4.1 (3) .
