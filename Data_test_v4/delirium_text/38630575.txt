38630575|t|ZCCHC17 knockdown phenocopies Alzheimer's disease-related loss of synaptic proteins and hyperexcitability.
38630575|a|ZCCHC17 is a master regulator of synaptic gene expression and has recently been shown to play a role in splicing of neuronal mRNA. We previously showed that ZCCHC17 protein declines in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue before there is significant gliosis and neuronal loss, that ZCCHC17 loss partially replicates observed splicing abnormalities in AD brain tissue, and that maintenance of ZCCHC17 levels is predicted to support cognitive resilience in AD. Here, we assessed the functional consequences of reduced ZCCHC17 expression in primary cortical neuronal cultures using siRNA knockdown. Consistent with its previously identified role in synaptic gene expression, loss of ZCCHC17 led to loss of synaptic protein expression. Patch recording of neurons shows that ZCCHC17 loss significantly disrupted the excitation/inhibition balance of neurotransmission, and favored excitatory-dominant synaptic activity as measured by an increase in spontaneous excitatory post synaptic currents and action potential firing rate, and a decrease in spontaneous inhibitory post synaptic currents. These findings are consistent with the hyperexcitable phenotype seen in AD animal models and in patients. We are the first to assess the functional consequences of ZCCHC17 knockdown in neurons and conclude that ZCCHC17 loss partially phenocopies AD-related loss of synaptic proteins and hyperexcitability.
