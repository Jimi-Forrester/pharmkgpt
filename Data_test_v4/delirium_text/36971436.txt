36971436|t|A systematic review of specialty dementia care units in long-term care settings.
36971436|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are common among nursing home residents. Yet, conclusive evidence regarding best care practices among this population is lacking. Objectives of this systematic review were to explore features of dementia specialty care units (DSCUs) in long-term care settings and examine benefits for residents, staff, families, and facilities. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, and PsychINFO were searched to identify articles involving DSCUs in long-term care settings published in English with full text available between 01.01.2008 and 06.03.2022. Articles containing empirical data about ADRD special care in long-term care settings were included in the review. Articles focused on clinic-based or out-patient dementia care programs (e.g., adult day care) were excluded. Articles were categorized based on geography (U.S. vs. international) and study design: interventions, descriptive studies, or comparison studies (traditional vs. specialty ADRD care). RESULTS: Our review included 38 U.S. articles and 54 articles from 15 international countries. In the U.S., 12 intervention, 13 descriptive, and 13 comparison studies met the inclusion criteria. Articles from international countries included 22 intervention, 20 descriptive, and 12 comparison studies. Results were mixed in terms of the efficacy of DSCUs. Promising DSCU features include small-scale settings, dementia-educated staff, and multidisciplinary approaches to care. CONCLUSION: Overall, our review did not find conclusive evidence regarding the benefits of DSCUs in long-term care settings. No rigorous study designs were found examining 'special' features of DSCUs and associations with outcomes among residents, family, staff, and the facility. Randomized clinical trials are needed to disentangle the 'special' features of DSCUs.
