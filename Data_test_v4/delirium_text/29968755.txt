29968755|t|Expression of periaxin (PRX) specifically in the human cerebrovascular system: PDZ domain-mediated strengthening of endothelial barrier function.
29968755|a|Regulation of cerebral endothelial cell function plays an essential role in changes in blood-brain barrier permeability. Proteins that are important for establishment of endothelial tight junctions have emerged as critical molecules, and PDZ domain containing-molecules are among the most important. We have discovered that the PDZ-domain containing protein periaxin (PRX) is expressed in human cerebral endothelial cells. Surprisingly, PRX protein is not detected in brain endothelium in other mammalian species, suggesting that it could confer human-specific vascular properties. In endothelial cells, PRX is predominantly localized to the nucleus and not tight junctions. Transcriptome analysis shows that PRX expression suppresses, by at least 50%, a panel of inflammatory markers, of which 70% are Type I interferon response genes; only four genes were significantly activated by PRX expression. When expressed in mouse endothelial cells, PRX strengthens barrier function, significantly increases transendothelial electrical resistance (~35%; p < 0.05), and reduces the permeability of a wide range of molecules. The PDZ domain of PRX is necessary and sufficient for its barrier enhancing properties, since a splice variant (S-PRX) that contains only the PDZ domain, also increases barrier function. PRX also attenuates the permeability enhancing effects of lipopolysaccharide. Collectively, these studies suggest that PRX could potentially regulate endothelial homeostasis in human cerebral endothelial cells by modulating inflammatory gene programs.
