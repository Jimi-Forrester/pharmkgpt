35119003|a|BACKGROUND: Exercise has proven to be a tool improving health related quality of life in people with acquired brain injury (ABI) as part of multidisciplinary team during the subacute and chronic phase. While intervention studies and revisions have been increased in recent years, there is no consensus about the type, frequency and variables of control in exercise interventions. Besides, this collective need programs that respond to different functional levels, given the heterogeneity of people with ABI, not only because of the etiology, but also because of the severity differences over their deficits. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to summarize the evidence regarding the relationship between exercise and health related quality of life in subacute and chronic phase. METHODS: A protocol of systematic review and meta-analysis will examine the benefits of physical exercise (PE) toward people with ABI will be conducted. A comprehensive search will be conducted in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, CINAHL, SportDiscus, and Web of Science from inception to July 2020. Independent review authors will evaluate the title and abstract for each trial and disagreements will be solved by discussion with a third author if necessary. Standard pairwise meta-analysis, including heterogeneity analysis, subgroup analysis, and sensitivity analysis, will be performed using the Stata software. The quality evaluation of this study will be completed using the Cochrane collaboration risk of bias tool and the risk of bias assessment will be conducted by the World Health Organization grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation. The review will be reported in accordance to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement. RESULTS AND CONCLUSSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol will provide an overview regarding the benefits of PE on functioning, social participation and quality of life toward people with ABI. The variability of outcomes across PE from the selected studies will provide important information for future trial designs. Results of the proposed review will inform practice and the design of future clinical trials. This study will summarize all the selected trials aimed at estimating the effectiveness of applying physical activity programs to ABI users.Systematic review registration number: PROSPERO CRD42020191779.
