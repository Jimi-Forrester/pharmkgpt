26639976|a|The progressive aggregation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) into senile plaques is a major pathological factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is believed to result in memory impairment. We aimed to investigate the effect of an optimized combination of ginger and peony root (OCGP), a standardized herbal mixture of ginger and peony root, on Abeta accumulation and memory impairment in amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) double-transgenic mice. In an in vitro thioflavin T fluorescence assay, 100 mug/ml OCGP inhibited Abeta accumulation to the same extent as did 10 muM curcumin. Furthermore, AbetaPP/PS1 double-transgenic mice treated with OCGP (50 or 100 mg/kg/day given orally for 14 weeks) exhibited reduced Abeta plaque accumulation in the hippocampus and lower levels of glial fibrillary acid protein and cyclooxygease-2 expression compared with vehicle-treated controls. These results suggest that OCGP may prevent memory impairment in AD by inhibiting Abeta accumulation and inflammation in the brain.
