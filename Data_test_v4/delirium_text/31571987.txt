31571987|a|BACKGROUND: This study aims to compare the efficacy and adverse reactions of bortezomib for treating newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) through two different administration methods: intravenous (IV) injection and subcutaneous (SC) injection. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in 205 patients with newly diagnosed MM, who were treated by the Department of Hematopathology, Henan Cancer Hospital, from June 2009 to December 2017. These patients were divided into two groups according to the treatment methods: IV injection group, IV injection of bortezomib; SC injection group, SC injection of bortezomib. RESULTS: After the first course of treatment, the effect of very good partial remission (VGPR) or above (>=VGPR) in the IV injection group (IV group) and SC injection group (SC group) was 31.0% and 14.3%, respectively (P=0.004), while the overall response rate (ORR) was 72.0% and 49.5%, respectively (P=0.001). From the 2nd course to the 6th course of treatment, the ORR was not statistically different between these two groups. No significant difference was found in median progression-free survival (37 vs 45 months) and overall survival (63 vs 59 months). A lower frequency of adverse events, especially Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, was observed in SC group compared with the IV group. CONCLUSION: Compared with IV administration, SC bortezomib can provide a better balance between efficacy and toxicity.
