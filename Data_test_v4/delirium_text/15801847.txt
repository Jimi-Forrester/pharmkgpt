15801847|t|N-[18F] fluoroethylpiperidin-4ylmethyl acetate, a novel lipophilic acetylcholine analogue for PET measurement of brain acetylcholinesterase activity.
15801847|a|The reduction of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the brain has been measured in dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies using (11)C-labeled acetylcholine analogues, N-[(11)C]methylpiperidin-4-yl acetate and propionate, and positron emission tomography (PET). Our aim was to develop an (18)F-labeled acetylcholine analogue useful for brain AChE mapping with PET, since (18)F, with a longer half-life, has advantages over (11)C. In a preliminary study, a series of N-[(14)C]ethylpiperidin-3-yl or -4-ylmethanol esters (acetyl and propionyl esters) were newly designed and evaluated in vitro regarding the reactivity with and specificity to AChE using purified human enzymes, leading to a novel (18)F-labeled acetylcholine analogue, N-[(18)F]fluoroethylpiperidin-4-ylmethyl acetate. In rat experiments, the (18)F-labeled candidate showed desirable properties for PET AChE measurement: high brain uptake of the authentic ester, high AChE specificity, a moderate hydrolysis rate, and low membrane permeability (metabolic trapping) of the metabolite.
