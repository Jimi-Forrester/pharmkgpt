METHODS: We recorded the EEG from 19 scalp electrodes in 10 AD patients and 8 age-matched controls and estimated the Approximate Entropy (ApEn). ApEn is a non-linear statistic that can be used to quantify the irregularity of a time series. Larger values correspond to more complexity or irregularity. A spectral analysis was also performed. RESULTS: ApEn was significantly lower in the AD patients at electrodes P3 and P4 (P < 0.01), indicating a decrease of irregularity. We obtained 70% sensitivity and 100% specificity at P3, and 80% sensitivity and 75% specificity at P4. Results seemed to be complementary to spectral analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The decreased irregularity found in the EEG of AD patients in the parietal region leads us to think that EEG analysis with ApEn could be a useful tool to increase our insight into brain dysfunction in AD. However, caution should be applied due to the small sample size. SIGNIFICANCE: This article represents a first step in demonstrating the feasibility of ApEn for recognition of EEG changes in AD.
