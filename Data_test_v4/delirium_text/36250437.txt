As well known, microRNAs (miRNAs) provide therapeutic target potentials for patients with epilepsy. miR-128-3p was previously reported to be downregulated in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients, however, its detailed function in epilepsy is unknown. METHODS: Astrocytes function in epilepsy, penicillin-induced astrocytes can be used as a model for seizures in vitro. Currently, the expression levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were determined by western blot and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analyses (RT-qPCR). The expression level of miR-128-3p was evaluated by RT-qPCR. TargetScan 7.1 and dual luciferase reporter assay were used for prediction and verification of interaction between miR-128-3p and MAPK6 3' untranslated region (UTR). Cell viability was detected by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. RESULTS: We found that penicillin-induced decrease in cell viability, and increase of TNF-alpha/IL-1beta in primary astrocytes. There were lower miR-128-3p and higher MAPK6 in penicillin-treated primary astrocytes. miR-128-3p overexpression rescued penicillin-induced reduction of cell viability, and upregulation of TNF-alpha/IL-1beta, which was partially abolished by MAPK6 overexpression. CONCLUSION: Altogether, miR-128-3p attenuates penicillin-induced cell injury and inflammation in astrocytes by targeting MAPK6, thus providing a protective role in epilepsy.
