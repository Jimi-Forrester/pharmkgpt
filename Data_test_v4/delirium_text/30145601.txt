30145601|t|Diagnostic Significance of Serum Levels of Nerve Growth Factor and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy.
30145601|a|BACKGROUND Our study aimed to explore the levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in healthy participants, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) patients in order to find their effects on DPN. MATERIAL AND METHODS The clinical data of 110 healthy participants (age: 57.3+-8.2 year, height: 165.4+-5.5 cm, weight: 64.1+-7.5 kg), 83 T2DM patients (age: 56.5+-7.9 year, height: 164.8+-6.2 cm, and weight: 63.6+-6.6 kg), and 65 DPN patients (age: 58.2+-7.3 year, height: 166.7+-6.7 cm, weight: 63.1+-5.8 kg) were observed. ELISA was applied to detect serum NGF and BDNF levels. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate diagnostic value of serum NGF and BDNF levels in DPN. Logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze risk factors for DPN. RESULTS Serum NGF and BDNF levels decreased most in DPN patients. Subsequently, we determined that serum NGF and BDNF levels were correlated with: the course of disease for patients, fasting C-peptide (FCP), 2-hour postprandial C-peptide level (2-h PCP), glycosylated hemoglobin level (HbAlc), and 24-hour urinary microalbumin excretion (24-h UME). ROC curve analysis identified high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of NGF and BDNF levels on DPN. Serum levels of NGF and BDNF, course of disease, 2-h PCP level, and postprandial blood glucose level were determined to be risk factors for DPN. CONCLUSIONS Our study highlights that serum levels of NGF and BDNF might be associated with the occurrence and development of DPN.
