38552097|t|Diagnostic criteria and scoring systems for thyroid storm: An evaluation of their utility - comparative review.
38552097|a|A thyroid storm is a life-threatening endocrine emergency characterized by severe hyperthyroidism and many systemic manifestations. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential for patient survival. This study evaluates the utility of existing diagnostic criteria and scoring systems for thyroid storm. A comprehensive literature review encompassed articles published up to December 2023. Various diagnostic criteria and scoring systems, such as the Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale and the Japanese Thyroid Association criteria, were critically assessed based on their sensitivity, specificity, and clinical applicability. Our findings reveal that existing diagnostic criteria and scoring systems, although valuable tools, exhibit limitations. They may lack sensitivity in identifying milder cases of thyroid storm or fail to differentiate it from other critical conditions. Furthermore, some criteria rely heavily on subjective clinical Judgment, which can vary among healthcare providers. Future research should focus on refining existing criteria and developing more objective and universally applicable diagnostic tools to address these limitations. Incorporating advanced laboratory markers and modern imaging techniques may enhance diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, a standardized scoring system approach could improve clinical practice consistency. In conclusion, while current diagnostic criteria and scoring systems provide a foundation for identifying thyroid storm, their utility has shortcomings. Advancements in diagnostic methods and a collaborative effort to establish standardized criteria are imperative to enhance the accuracy and reliability of thyroid storm diagnosis, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
