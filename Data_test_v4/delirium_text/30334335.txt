30334335|t|Plasma derived from human umbilical cord blood: Potential cell-additive or cell-substitute therapeutic for neurodegenerative diseases.
30334335|a|Limited efficacy of current therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative disease has led to increased interest in alternative therapies. Cord blood plasma (CBP) derived from human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) may be a potential therapeutic. Benefits of CBP injection into rodent models of aging or ischaemic stroke have been demonstrated, though how benefits are elicited is still unclear. The present study evaluated various factors within the same samples of CBP and human adult blood plasma/sera (ABP/S). Also, autologous CBP effects vs. ABP/S or foetal bovine serum supplements on mononuclear cells from hUCB (MNC hUCB) in vitro were determined. Results showed significantly low concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha) and elevated chemokine IL-8 in CBP. Significantly higher levels of VEGF, G-CSF, EGF and FGF-basic growth factors were determined in CBP vs. ABP/S. Autologous CBP media supplements significantly increased MNC hUCB viability and decreased apoptotic cell activity. We are first to demonstrate the unique CBP composition of cytokines and growth factors within the same CBP samples derived from hUCB. Also, our novel finding that autologous CBP promoted MNC hUCB viability and reduced apoptotic cell death in vitro supports CBP's potential as a sole therapeutic or cell-additive agent in developing therapies for various neurodegenerative diseases.
