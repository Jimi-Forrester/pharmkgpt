35698646|t|Prevalence and Risk Factors for Periodontal Disease Among Women Attending Antenatal Care in Public Hospitals, Southwest Ethiopia, 2022: A Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study.
35698646|a|Background: Periodontal disease is characterized by the inflammation of all tissues that surround and support the teeth, and it is the most common public health problem worldwide. It has many different contributing factors, such as poor oral hygiene, smoking, anemia, bacterial plaque, poor economic status, and nutritional deficiency. It also causes different feto-maternal complications like preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm labor, low birth weight, and early abortion. Thus, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of periodontal disease among pregnant women. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 618 women at public hospitals in the Southwest Ethiopia. Data were collected using a systematic random sampling method and a structured interviewer administered questionnaire. The data were entered into Epi-Data Manager 4.2 and then transferred to a statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 21 for analysis. The logistic regression analysis was done to see the significant association between each predictor with periodontal disease by considering a p-value of <0.05 and a CI of 95%. Results: A total of 618 women attending ANC with a 100% response rate were enrolled in this study. The mean and standard deviation of the age of the study participants was 31.07 +- 7.8 years. The periodontal disease was observed among 240 (38.8%) of the total participants with 95% C.I of (35%, 43%). Predictors like rural residency, women who could not read and write, women with poor wealth index, nutritional status of underweight, had no information about periodontal disease, depression, history of diabetes mellitus, self-perceived halitosis, no history of ANC, and lower gestational age were found to be significantly associated with periodontal disease. Conclusion: In this study, the prevalence of periodontal disease was found to be significantly higher. Therefore, in order to minimize the burden of periodontal disease among pregnant women, oral, medical, and mental health education should be promoted.
