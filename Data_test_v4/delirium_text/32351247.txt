32351247|t|Electrocardiographic changes following intracranial haemorrhage: a retrospective cohort study.
32351247|a|OBJECTIVE: To improve the understanding of the association between electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities and clinical outcomes of patients with all types of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary healthcare hospital on patients with ICH without cardiac disease or renal disease requiring dialysis. Demographic and clinical data were collected from hospital records. ECG record were obtained within 24 hours of presentation and prior to treatment. Records were interpreted for this study by a cardiologist blinded to other data. RESULTS: Assessment of 291 patients (228 adults and 63 children) showed that subdural hemorrhage was the most common type of ICH (31.6%) followed by intraparenchymal hemorrhage (23.0%). ECG records were available for 98 patients. ECG abnormalities were most commonly nonspecific ST-segment changes (32.6%). In adults, history of neurological disease was associated with atrioventricular block (p=.004) and QTc prolongation (p=.041). Pediatric patients exhibited associations between ST-segment changes (p=.045) and sinus tachycardia (p=.027) and type of ICH. However, ECG changes were not statistically associated with clinical outcomes in adults or children. CONCLUSION: Significant ECG changes frequently occurred in patients with all types of ICH but did not consistently predict the outcome in this study. Close observation of patients is still recommended to detect ECG changes that could affect the treatment.
