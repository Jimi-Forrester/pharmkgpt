31488334|t|Geriatric nurse involvement during intra-hospital transitions.
31488334|a|Geriatric nurses are skilled in the special needs of hospitalized older adults. While significant focus has been placed on improving care transitions upon discharge, less attention has been placed on intra-hospital transitions. Intra-hospital transitions represent transfers occurring between hospital units or rooms. Intra-hospital transitions challenge normal nursing workflow and require careful consideration of care coordination to prevent adverse events for older adults. Frequent changes in environment and a lack of consistency in care may support the development or prolongation of delirium as older adults are transferred between units and rooms. Additional adverse event risks include infections and falls, which also increases with each transfer. Geriatric nurse involvement can enhance communication between units as well as ensuring appropriate geriatric assessments occur. Geriatric nurses are thus well positioned to act as leaders during intra-hospital transitions, potentially reducing these and adverse events.
