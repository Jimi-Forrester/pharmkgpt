30909898|a|BACKGROUND: Antiplatelet medication has been frequently performed in elderly patients with hip fracture, because of comorbidities. This observational cohort study was to evaluate the effect of continuous perioperative antiplatelet medication on the outcomes after cephalomedullary nailing (CMN) in elderly patients with a proximal femur fracture. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-two consecutive patients aged >=70 years undergoing CMN for proximal femur fracture between January 2015 and January 2017 were recruited. Of the 162 patients, 47 (study group) taking antiplatelets preoperatively due to comorbidities were compared with 107 (control group) who were not on antiplatelets. 8 patients taking anticoagulant medication were excluded. Postoperative hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels, transfusion amount and estimated blood loss (EBL), occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and delirium, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, complications, length of hospital stay, readmission, and in-hospital and 1-year mortalities were measured and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A higher number of patients in the study group had concomitant cardiovascular (p = 0.006) and endocrinologic (p = 0.004) diseases, received perioperative transfusion (p = 0.003), and were admitted to ICU postoperatively (p = 0.014). However, there were no significant differences in postoperative Hb and Hct levels, EBL, length of hospital stay, and the incidences of VTE and delirium between the two groups. In addition, in-hospital and 1-year mortalities as well as postoperative complications showed no significant differences between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: CMN can be performed without delay in elderly patients with proximal femoral fracture receiving antiplatelet therapy prior to admission without discontinuing antiplatelets, and is as safe as in patients who are not on antiplatelet medication. However, more caution is required with respect to transfusions and ICU care after surgery in these patients.
