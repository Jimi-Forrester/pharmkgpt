33425406|t|Acute Brucellosis and Cirrhosis: The Triggering Event of Fatal Liver Decompensation.
33425406|a|Cirrhotic patients are known to be particularly susceptible to infectious complications that may vary according to regional endemic patterns. Brucellosis, a common zoonosis with worldwide distribution, exhibits a predilection for the reticuloendothelial system and thus resulting in hepatic involvement. We describe three cirrhotic patients in whom acute brucellosis and/or its treatment served as the triggering factor of hepatic decompensation, with deleterious effects. The patients suffered from alcoholic cirrhosis and culture-proven brucellosis. All patients came from an area endemic to brucellosis. The first patient exhibited a relapsing brucellosis course with progressive deterioration of his fragile liver function. The second patient progressed rapidly to jaundice, possibly partly attributed to antibiotic pharmacotoxicity, and died during liver transplantation. The third patient eventually succumbed to diffuse intravascular coagulation. Brucellosis can be a triggering event of fatal liver decompensation in cirrhotic patients. Enhancing health literacy of the patients, particularly in endemic areas, is of paramount importance for prevention of exposure to similar pathogens.
