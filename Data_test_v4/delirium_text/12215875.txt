12215875|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the morphological changes in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) revealed by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Twenty-one subjects with cognitive impairment and 22 healthy controls were compared with 12 patients suffering from mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). The volumes of the following brain structures were assessed: total intracranial compartment, cerebrospinal fluid compartment, whole brain, and medial temporal substructures (hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus). Subjects with mild cognitive impairment showed a significantly reduced volume of the right parahippocampal gyrus over healthy controls. Volumes of the other regions and structures did not differ between the MCI group and controls. The volumetric and neuropsychological findings of the present study support the hypothesis that mild cognitive impairment - at least in some of the affected individuals - can be seen as a preclinical stage of AD and that atrophy of the parahippocampal gyrus might be useful as an early marker of AD.
