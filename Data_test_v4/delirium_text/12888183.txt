12888183|a|In the present study, the effect of alpha lipoic acid, a potent free radical scavenger, was investigated against the intracerebroventricular streptozotocin model of cognitive impairment in rats, which is characterized by a progressive deterioration of memory, cerebral glucose and energy metabolism, and oxidative stress. Wistar rats were injected with intracerebroventricular streptozotocin bilaterally. The rats were treated chronically with alpha lipoic acid (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) orally for 21 days starting from day 1 of streptozotocin injection in separate groups. The learning and memory behavior was evaluated and the rats were sacrificed for estimation of oxidative stress. The intracerebroventricular streptozotocin rats treated with alpha lipoic acid (200 mg/kg, p.o.) showed significantly less cognitive impairment as compared to the vehicle treated rats. There was also an insignificant increase in oxidative stress in the alpha lipoic acid treated groups. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of alpha lipoic acid in preventing cognitive impairment and oxidative stress induced by intracerebroventricular streptozotocin and its potential in dementia associated with age and age related neurodegenerative disorders where oxidative stress is involved such as Alzheimer's disease.
