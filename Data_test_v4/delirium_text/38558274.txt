38558274|t|Assessing the Chemical Profile and Biological Potentials of Tamarix aphylla (L.) H.Karst. and Tamarix senegalensis DC. by In Vitro, In Silico, and Network Methodologies.
38558274|a|The present study aimed to investigate the chemical profile, antioxidant, and enzyme inhibition properties of extracts from fruits and aerial parts (leaves and twigs) of Tamarix aphylla and T. senegalensis. Hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and methanol extracts were prepared sequentially by maceration. Results revealed that EtOAc extracts of T. senegalensis and T. aphylla fruits contained the highest total phenolic content (113.74 and 111.21 mg GAE/g) while that of T. senegalensis (38.47 mg RE/g) recorded the highest total flavonoids content. Among the quantified compounds; ellagic, gallic, 3-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, syringic, p-coumaric acids, isorhamnetin, procyanidin B2, and kaempferol were the most abundant compounds in the two species. EtOAc extracts of the two organs of T. senegalensis in addition to MeOH extract of T. aphylla aerial parts displayed the highest chelating power (21.00-21.30 mg EDTAE/g, p > 0.05). The highest anti-AChE (3.11 mg GALAE/g) and anti-BChE (3.62 mg GALAE/g) activities were recorded from the hexane and EtOAc extracts of T. senegalensis aerial parts and fruits, respectively. EtOAc extracts of the fruits of the two species exerted the highest anti-tyrosinase (anti-Tyr) activity (99.44 and 98.65 mg KAE/g, p > 0.05). Also, the EtOAc extracts of the both organs of the two species exhibited highest anti-glucosidase activity (0.88-0.90 mmol ACAE/g, p > 0.05) while the best anti-alpha-amylase activity was recorded from the dichloromethane extract of T. senegalensis fruits (0.74 mmol ACAE/g). In this study, network pharmacology was employed to examine the connection between compounds from Tamarix and their potential effectiveness against Alzheimer's disease. The compounds demonstrated potential interactions with pivotal genes including APP, GSK3B, and CDK5, indicating a therapeutic potential. Molecular docking was carried out to understand the binding mode and interaction of the compounds with the target enzymes. Key interactions observed, such as H-bonds, promoted the binding, and weaker ones, such as van der Waals attractions, reinforced it. These findings suggest that these two Tamarix species possess bioactive properties with health-promoting effects.
