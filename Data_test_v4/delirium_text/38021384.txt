38021384|t|Prevalence of Persisting and New Symptoms Following Recovery from COVID-19 in the Jordanian Population.
38021384|a|Background: Many patients do not have a clear idea about the recovery from COVID-19 infection. This study focuses on the prevalence of persistent symptoms of COVID-19 infection as well as new symptoms that appear after recovery, and it aids in determining the relationships between these symptoms and a variety of variables. Methods: An online observational study was conducted between April and June 2022. It consisted of a self-administered web-based questionnaire conducted using social media platforms. Inclusion criteria were residency in Jordan, being 18 years of age or older, having recovered from COVID-19 for at least 90 days, and giving consent to participate. Participants whose infection was not confirmed by a positive PCR were excluded. Results: The most common persistent symptoms were loss of smell (34.7%), fatigue (34.6%), loss of taste (29.5%), myalgia (26.3%), and headache (25.9%), while the most common newly appearing symptoms after recovery were smell hallucinations (15.8%), fatigue (15.5%), taste hallucinations (14.9%), and focus impairment (12.9%) and smell impairment (12.8%). The symptoms persisted more in females, non-smokers, and those who needed medical care sor oxygesnation and with increased infection duration. Conclusion: The study about persistent and new symptoms after COVID-19 among Jordanians found a greater prevalence of symptoms related to the sense of smell. There is no association between persistent and new symptoms after COVID-19 recovery with comorbidities or oxygen therapy during illness. We recommend studying the effect of COVID-19 mutants and vaccination on the persistence of symptoms after recovery.
