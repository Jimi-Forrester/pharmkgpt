38559401|a|Objective: To examine the relationship between current and former smoking and the occurrence of delirium in surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. Methods: We conducted a single center, case-control study involving 244 delirious and 251 non-delirious patients that were admitted to our ICU between 2018 and 2022. Using propensity score analysis, we obtained 115 pairs of delirious and non-delirious patients matched for age and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II). Both groups of patients were further stratified into non-smokers, active smokers and former smokers, and logistic regression was performed to further investigate potential confounders. Results: Our study revealed a significant association between former smoking and the incidence of delirium in ICU patients, both in unmatched (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-2.83) and matched cohorts (OR: 3.0, CI: 1.53-5.89). Active smoking did not demonstrate a significant difference in delirium incidence compared to non-smokers (unmatched OR = 0.98, CI: 0.62-1.53, matched OR = 1.05, CI: 0.55-2.0). Logistic regression analysis of the matched group confirmed former smoking as an independent risk factor for delirium, irrespective of other variables like surgical history (p = 0.010). Notably, also respiratory and vascular surgeries were associated with increased odds of delirium (respiratory: OR: 4.13, CI: 1.73-9.83; vascular: OR: 2.18, CI: 1.03-4.59). Medication analysis showed that while Ketamine and Midazolam usage did not significantly correlate with delirium, Morphine use was linked to a decreased likelihood (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13-0.55). Discussion: Nicotine's complex neuropharmacological impact on the brain is still not fully understood, especially its short-term and long-term implications for critically ill patients. Although our retrospective study cannot establish causality, our findings suggest that smoking may induce structural changes in the brain, potentially heightening the risk of postoperative delirium. Intriguingly, this effect seems to be obscured in active smokers, potentially due to the recognized neuroprotective properties of nicotine. Our results motivate future prospective studies, the results of which hold the potential to substantially impact risk assessment procedures for surgeries.
