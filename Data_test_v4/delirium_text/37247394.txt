37247394|t|Quality of Life Ratings and Proxy Bias in Primary Progressive Aphasia: Two Sides to the Story?
37247394|a|A valid measure of quality of life is important for clinical goal setting and for evaluating interventions. In the amnestic dementias, proxy-raters (e.g. friends, families, clinicians) typically rate quality of life lower than the self-ratings given by the person with dementia - a proxy bias. This study investigated whether the same proxy bias occurs in Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA), a language-led dementia.Quality of life was measured in 18 individuals with PPA using self-ratings, and proxy-ratings by their main communication partner, using the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease Scale.There was no strong evidence for proxy bias at a group level, with no consistent pattern across dyads, where proxy- and self-ratings did not show good levels of agreement. We suggest that self-ratings and proxy-ratings of quality of life in PPA are not interchangeable. Higher-powered investigation of the patterns observed here is warranted in future studies.
