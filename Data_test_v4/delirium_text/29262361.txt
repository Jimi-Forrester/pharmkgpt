29262361|t|Atomistic Insights into Structural Differences between E3 and E4 Isoforms of Apolipoprotein E.
29262361|a|Among various isoforms of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), the E4 isoform (ApoE4) is considered to be the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, whereas the E3 isoform (ApoE3) is neutral to the disease. Interestingly, the sequence of ApoE4 differs from its wild-type ApoE3 by a single amino acid C112R in the 299-amino-acid-long sequence. Hence, the puzzle remains: how a single-amino-acid difference between the ApoE3 and ApoE4 sequences can give rise to structural dissimilarities between the two isoforms, which can potentially lead to functional differences with significant pathological consequences. The major obstacle in addressing this question has been the lack of a 3D atomistic structure of ApoE4 to date. In this work, we resolve the issue by computationally modeling a plausible atomistic 3D structure of ApoE4. Our microsecond-long atomistic simulations elucidate key structural differences between monomeric ApoE3 and ApoE4, which renders ApoE4 thermodynamically less stable, less structured, and topologically less rigid compared to ApoE3. Consistent with an experimental report of the molten globule state of ApoE4, simulations identify multiple partially folded intermediates for ApoE4, which are implicated in the stronger aggregation propensity of ApoE4.
