21143566|a|AIM: To determine whether vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia affect the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We followed up 150 consecutive outpatients with probable AD for 24-60 months. Severity of cognitive impairment was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). We investigated the influence of vascular risk factors and other demographic and clinical conditions (including age, sex, education, initial MMSE score and follow-up time) on annual MMSE score changes. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis revealed that age, education and hypertension were significant variables associated with annual MMSE score changes. Younger, more educated patients with hypertension showed greater decline in annual MMSE scores. There were no significant correlations of annual MMSE score changes with other vascular factors or demographics, including sex, initial MMSE score, diabetes or hypercholesterolemia. CONCLUSION: Younger, more educated patients are more likely to have faster cognitive decline. In addition, hypertension may also be associated with a greater rate of disease progression. Our results suggest the importance of prevention and treatment for hypertension in patients with AD.
