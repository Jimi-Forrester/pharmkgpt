39807511|t|Novel insights into mechanisms and therapeutics for presbycusis.
39807511|a|Presbycusis, also referred to as age-related hearing loss, poses a substantial burden on both individuals and society. The hallmark of presbycusis is a progressive decrease in auditory sensitivity. Irreversible hearing loss occurs due to the limited regenerative capacity of spiral neurons and peripheral cochlear hair cells (HCs). Although hearing aids and cochlear implantations (CIs) are established approaches for alleviating symptoms of presbycusis, there are currently no preventive or curative measures available. This article provides a comprehensive discussion on the research progress pertaining to the classification, molecular mechanism, genetic susceptibility, as well as the applications and prospects of diverse therapeutic interventions of presbycusis. Building upon these discussions, promising interventions like gene therapy and stem cell (SC) therapy are proposed for their potential value in restoring cochlear function; thus aiming to pave new avenues for prevention and cure of presbycusis.
