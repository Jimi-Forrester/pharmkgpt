38018199|t|Recent Updates on the Development of Therapeutics for the Targeted Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
38018199|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complicated, multifaceted, irreversible, and incurable neurotoxic old age illness. Although NMDA (N-methyl D-aspartate)-receptor antagonists, cholinesterase repressors, and their pairings have been approved for the treatment, they are useful for short symptomatic relief. Researchers throughout the globe have been constantly working to uncover the therapy of Alzheimer's disease as new candidates must be determined, and newer treatment medicines must be developed. The aim of this review is to address recent advances in medication research along with new Alzheimer's disease therapy for diverse targets. Information was gathered utilizing a variety of internet resources as well as websites, such as ALZFORUM (alzforum.org) and clinicaltrials.gov. In contrast to other domains, the proposed medicines target amyloids (secretases, A42 generation, neuroinflammation, amyloid precipitation, and immunization), tau proteins (tau phosphorylation/aggregation and immunotherapy), and amyloid deposition. Despite tremendous advancement in our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) only approved aducanumab for diagnosis and treatment in 2003. Hence, novel treatment tactics are needed to find and develop therapeutic medicines to combat Alzheimer's disease.
