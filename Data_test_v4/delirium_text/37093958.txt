37093958|a|Multifunctionalized Chitosan-based polymeric micelles were used to deliver pVGF to the brain. VGF (non-acronymic) plays significant roles in neurogenesis and learning as well as synaptic and cognitive functions. Therefore, VGF gene therapy could be a better approach in developing effective therapeutics against Alzheimer's disease. Multifunctionalized chitosan polymeric micelles were developed by grafting oleic acid (OA) on the chitosan (CS) skeleton followed by penetratin (PEN) and mannose (MAN) conjugation. The OA-g-CS-PEN-MAN graft polymer formed cationic nanomicelles in an aqueous medium and polyplexed with pVGF. The polymeric micelles were nontoxic and cationic in charge and had an average hydrodynamic diameter of 199.8 +- 15.73 nm. Qualitative in vitro transfection efficiency of OA-g-CS-PEN-MAN/pGFP polyplex was investigated in bEnd.3, primary neurons, and astrocyte cells. In vivo transfection efficiency of OA-g-CS-PEN-MAN/pVGF polyplexes was analyzed in C57BL6/J mice after intranasal administration for 7 days. The VGF expression levels in primary astrocytes and neurons after OA-g-CS-PEN-MAN/pVGF treatment were 2.4 +- 0.24 and 1.49 +- 0.02 pg/mug of protein, respectively. The VGF expression in the OA-g-CS-PEN-MAN/pVGF polyplex-treated animal group was 64.9 +- 12.7 pg/mg of protein, significantly higher (p < 0.01) than that of the unmodified polymeric micelles. The in vivo transfection outcomes revealed that the developed multifunctionalized OA-g-CS-PEN-MAN polymeric micelles could effectively deliver pVGF to the brain, transfect brain cells, and express VGF in the brain after noninvasive intranasal administration.
