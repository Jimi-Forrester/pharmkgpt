30700961|t|Correlation between Dermatoglyphics, Dental Caries and Salivary pH: An Invivo Study.
30700961|a|BACKGROUND: Dermatoglyphic patterns that are often utilized in judicial and legal investigations are valuable in diagnosis of many diseases related to genetic disorders. Caries, being infectious in origin, might be related to genetics as well. Hence, these patterns are of significance in predicting caries development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DMFT (decayed, missing, filled teeth) score of 300 female subjects within the age group 0f 18-25 years were recorded and accordingly divided into 3 groups of 100 each; group 1 (DMFT score=0), group 2 (DMFT score < 5) and group 3 (DMFT score >= 5). Dermatoglyphic patterns were recorded using Cummins and Midlo method. pH meter was used for recording salivary pH accurately. Fingerprint patterns and salivary pH recorded were correlated with DMFT scores of subject and control groups. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Chi-square tests (P < 0.05). RESULTS: The mean salivary pH was least in group 3. The predominant dermatoglyphic pattern observed in groups 1 and 2 was loop pattern whereas, in group 3, whorl pattern was predominant. The TFRC (total finger ridge count) was higher in group 3 compared to the other two groups. CONCLUSION: Caries-free people showed inflated frequency of loops, whereas subjects with high decay score had additional share of whorls. The TFRC was higher in individuals with high DMFT score, and salivary pH was inversely proportional to the DMFT score.
