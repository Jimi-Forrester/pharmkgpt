36984831|a|The seed extract of Foeniculum vulgare (FV) was used for the preparation of a nanosuspension (NS) with an enhanced bioavailability of phytoconstituents. Subsequently, it was employed as a potent source of polyphenols, such as quercetin and kaempferol, to accelerate the regeneration and recovery of motor and sensory function in injured nerves. The NS was administered through daily gauging as NS1 (0.5 mg/mL) and NS2 (15 mg/mL), at a dose rate of 2 g/kg body weight until the end of the study. The NS-mediated retrieval of motor functions was studied by evaluating muscle grip strength and the sciatic functional index. The recovery of sensory functions was assessed by the hotplate test. Several well-integrated biochemical pathways mediate the recovery of function and the regeneration of nerves under controlled blood glucose and oxidative stress. Consequently, the NS-treated groups were screened for blood glucose, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total oxidant status (TOS) compared to the control. The NS administration showed a significant potential to enhance the recuperation of motor and sensory functions. Moreover, the oxidative stress was kept under check as a result of NS treatments to facilitate neuronal generation. Thus, the nanoformulation of FV with polyphenolic contents accelerated the reclamation of motor and sensory function after nerve lesion.
