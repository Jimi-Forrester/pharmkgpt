6671858|t|Neuropsychiatric aspects of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
6671858|a|Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is a newly described, highly virulent, idiopathic syndrome characterized by lymphocyte dysfunction, multiple opportunistic infections and lymphoma, which primarily affects previously healthy, promiscuous homosexual males. Dementia and delirium due to infection and/or disseminated lymphoma may frequently occur in these patients, especially as the illness progresses. Consulting and liaison psychiatrists must be particularly alert to the possibility of organicity in these patients, in addition to the psychological distress caused by the AIDS syndrome itself.
