33834065|t|Sirt-1 Regulates Physiological Process and Exerts Protective Effects against Oxidative Stress.
33834065|a|BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest a correlation between the reduced Sirt-1 expression with Alzheimer's diseases (AD) and depression, respectively, suggesting a possible pathogenic role of the altered Sirt-1 expression in neuronal degenerative diseases, such as AD and depression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying how Sirt-1 reduction impairs neuronal functions remain unknown. METHODS: We used the SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells to study the role of Sirt-1 expression on physiological roles in neuronal cells. Gain of Sirt-1 was achieved by transiently transfecting Sirt-1 expression plasmid. Sirt-1-specific shRNA was used to elucidate the role of Sirt-1 loss of function. CCK-8 (Cell Counting Kit-8) assay and flow cytometry were used to evaluate cell proliferation. Semiquantitative western blotting was used to detect relative protein levels. A further luciferase reporter gene assay was employed to examine the effect of Sirt-1 expression on the transcriptional activity of p53. RT-qPCR was used to determine the mRNA levels of p21, Bax, and Bcl-2, which were the downstream target genes of p53. RESULTS: Sirt-1 suppressed the p53 downstream gene p21 transcription, while shRNA-mediated Sirt-1 knockdown resulted in a significant increase in p21 expression, implying a possibility that Sirt-1 promotes neuron proliferation through suppressing p53 transcriptional activity. The mRNA and protein levels of p53 were not affected by the altered Sirt-1 expression, suggesting that Sirt-1 regulates the transcriptional regulatory activity of p53 rather than p53 expression. Indeed, we further confirmed that Sirt-1 appeared to inhibit p53 transcriptional activity by attenuating its acetylation and resulted in a decrease of p53's binding to the p21 promoter. Overexpressed Sirt-1 scavenged reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in SK-N-SH with H2O2. Knockdown of Sirt-1 presented opposite effect; the addition of EX527 (Sirt-1 inhibitor) increased ROS accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative stress induces Sirt-1 in neuron cells, and Sirt-1 promotes proliferation in SK-N-SH cells, which protects them from oxidative stress-induced cell death, potentially via suppressing the transcriptional activity of p53. These results provide a molecular explanation underlying how the reduced Sirt-1 potentially causes the AD and depression-related diseases, supporting the idea that Sirt-1 can possibly be used as a diagnostic biomarker and/or therapeutic drug target for the AD and depression-related diseases.
