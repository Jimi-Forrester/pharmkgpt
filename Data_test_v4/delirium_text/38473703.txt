38473703|t|Siponimod Attenuates Neuronal Cell Death Triggered by Neuroinflammation via NFkappaB and Mitochondrial Pathways.
38473703|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), consisting of heterogeneous clinical courses varying from relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), in which disability is linked to bouts of inflammation, to progressive disease such as primary progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS), in which neurological disability is thought to be linked to neurodegeneration. As a result, successful therapeutics for progressive MS likely need to have both anti-inflammatory and direct neuroprotective properties. The modulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors has been implicated in neuroprotection in preclinical animal models. Siponimod/BAF312, the first oral treatment approved for SPMS, may have direct neuroprotective benefits mediated by its activity as a selective (S1P receptor 1) S1P1 and (S1P receptor 5) S1P5 modulator. We showed that S1P1 was mainly present in cortical neurons in lesioned areas of the MS brain. To gain a better understanding of the neuroprotective effects of siponimod in MS, we used both rat neurons and human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons treated with the neuroinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Cell survival/apoptotic assays using flow cytometry and IncuCyte live cell analyses showed that siponimod decreased TNF-alpha induced neuronal cell apoptosis in both rat and human iPSCs. Importantly, a transcriptomic analysis revealed that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, NFkappaB and cytokine signaling pathways contributed to siponimod's neuroprotective effects. Our data suggest that the neuroprotection of siponimod/BAF312 likely involves the relief of oxidative stress in neuronal cells. Further studies are needed to explore the molecular mechanisms of such interactions to determine the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration.
