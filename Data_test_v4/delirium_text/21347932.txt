21347932|a|Clinicians experience great pressures to provide timely, effective, and evidence-based medical care. Educators can aid these clinicians through the development of new tools that can facilitate timely completion of clinical tasks. These tools should summarize evidence-based information in a convenient format that allows easy use. This article describes one process in which a group of Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center educators identified an area where important new information accrued, their development of a new clinical and teaching tool for imparting the new information, the initial dissemination of the tool to a preliminary target audience, and the initial evaluation of the new tool to determine how to improve its distribution and use beyond the original target audience.
