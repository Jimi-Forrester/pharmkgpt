30868446|t|A Novel PEGylated Block Copolymer in New Age Therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease.
30868446|a|The amyloid cascade hypothesis dealing with the senile plaques is until date thought to be one of the causative pathways leading to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Though many aggregation inhibitors of misfolded amyloid beta (Abeta42) peptide have failed in clinical trials, there are some positive aspects of the designed therapeutic peptides for diseases involving proteinaceous aggregation. Here, we evaluated a smart design of side chain tripeptide (Leu-Val-Phe)-based polymeric inhibitor addressing the fundamental hydrophobic amino acid stretch "Lys-Leu-Val-Phe-Phe-Ala" (KLVFFA) of the Abeta42 peptide. The in vitro analyses performed through the thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay, infrared spectroscopy, isothermal calorimetry, cytotoxicity experiments, and so on evinced a promising path towards the development of new age AD therapeutics targeting the inhibition of misfolded Abeta42 peptide fibrillization. The in silico simulations done contoured the mechanism of drug action of the present block copolymer as the competitive inhibition of aggregate-prone hydrophobic stretch of Abeta42. Graphical abstract The production of misfolded Abeta42 peptide from amyloid precursor protein initiates amyloidosis pathway which ends with the deposition of fibrils via the oligomerization and aggregation of Abeta42 monomers. The side chain tripeptide-based PEGylated polymer targets these Abeta42 monomers and oligomers inhibiting their aggregation. This block copolymer also binds and helps degrading the preformed fibrils of Abeta42.
