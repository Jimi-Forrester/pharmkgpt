39860493|t|Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19-Related Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome: A Systematic Review of Case Series.
39860493|a|Background and Objectives: Although reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is a rare disease, the condition may occur with COVID-19 infection. We aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of RCVS through a systematic review of case reports and case series that reported on COVID-19-related RCVS. Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed (MEDLINE), SCOPUS, and Web of Science. The search was confined to articles published between 17 November 2019 and 14 August 2024. The search terms were ("COVID-19" OR "SARS CoV-2") AND ("RCVS" OR "Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome"). The search protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024491818). A total of twenty-four cases were included, nine case series consisting of nineteen cases and five cases from our hospital. Clinical characteristics were investigated, including risk factors, symptoms, brain and angiographic findings, treatment options, and prognoses. Results: The average age was 37.1 years, and females comprised 70.8% of the cohort. COVID-19 vaccination was administered in five cases. Vasoconstriction was most frequently noted in middle cerebral arteries (90.9%). Among the included patients, 12 (50.0%) experienced strokes as a complication of RCVS, and the mortality rate was 9.1%. Follow-up imaging findings were available for 14 of the 24 cases (58.3%). Among these, vasoconstriction was fully improved in 64.3%, partially improved in 28.6%, and aggravated in 7.1%. Conclusions: While the recovery rate of vasoconstriction on brain angiographic findings was not uncommon, our systematic review indicates a potential for a relatively poor neurological prognosis in COVID-19-related RCVS.
