37144044|t|Clinical Values of Serum Uric Acid Levels in the Occurrence of Cognitive Impairment in Alcohol-Dependent Patients.
37144044|a|Objective: Studies have confirmed that uric acid is involved in the regulation of cognitive function. This study aimed to investigate the expression of serum uric acid in alcohol-dependent patients and evaluate its clinical diagnostic value for cognitive impairment. Methods: Blood sample was collected for assessment of serum uric acid levels. Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale scores were obtained to assess cognitive function. Anxiety and depression scores on the Symptom Check List 90 scale were used to assess mental health status. The alcohol-dependent patients were divided into non-cognitive impairment and cognitive impairment groups according to Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale score, and the serum uric acid levels of these groups were analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic curve evaluated the diagnostic value of serum uric acid in cognitive impairment patients. Pearson correlation coefficient evaluated the correlation between uric acid and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale score, anxiety score, and depression score. Multivariate logistic regression analyzed the association between each index and cognitive impairment in patients. Results: Serum uric acid was higher in patients than in controls (P < .001). Uric acid was significantly increased in cognitive impairment patients than in non-cognitive impairment patients (P < .001). Serum uric acid has certain diagnostic value in patients with cognitive impairment. Anxiety score and depression score were positively correlated with uric acid level, while Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale score was negatively correlated with uric acid. Additionally, serum uric acid, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale score, and anxiety and depression scores were the risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients (P < .05). Conclusion: The abnormal expression of uric acid has a high diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing cognitive impairment from non-cognitive impairment.
