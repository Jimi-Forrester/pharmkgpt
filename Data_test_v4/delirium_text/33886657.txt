33886657|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Although some medications have been reported as risk factors for delirium, their impact on patients with ADHF is still unclear. This study aimed to determine the association of specific medication use with delirium and their additive predictive value in models based on conventional risk factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this single-center, retrospective study, 650 patients treated for ADHF were included. Fifty-nine patients (9.1%) had delirium. In multivariate analysis, anxiolytic benzodiazepines [odds ratio (OR): 6.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.8-15], mechanical ventilation or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (OR: 6.0, 95% CI: 2.9-12), depression (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.5-6.5), intensive care or high care unit admission (OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.5-5.6), male sex (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1-3.7), and age (OR: 1.1, 95% CI: 1-1.1) were independently associated with severe delirium. The predictive model that included anxiolytic benzodiazepines had a significantly better discriminatory ability for the incidence of severe delirium than the conventional model. CONCLUSIONS: The use of anxiolytic benzodiazepines was independently correlated with severe delirium, and their use in models based on conventional risk factors had an additive value for predicting delirium in patients with ADHF.
