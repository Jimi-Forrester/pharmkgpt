29893668|t|Direct Cannulation of Ascending Aorta versus Standard Femoral Artery Cannulation in Acute Aortic Dissection Type A.
29893668|a|BACKGROUND: During surgery for ascending aortic dissection, the dissected ascending aorta itself has traditionally been rejected as a cannulation option. The purpose of this study is to prove that direct cannulation of the ascending aorta in patients operated for acute aortic dissection type A (AADA) is at least as effective and safe as classic femoral cannulation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between September 2008 and January 2015, we operated on 117 patients with AADA through median sternotomy. Cannulation was accomplished in 32 cases (27%) through the femoral artery (group A), and in 85 patients (73%) through the dissected ascending aorta (group B). Moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest with bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion was used in 108 patients (92%). The mean time of circulatory arrest was 17 minutes (range: 9-52 minutes). The 30-day mortality rate was 22% (7 patients) in group A, and 18% (15 patients) in group B (P = not significant). Temporary neurologic dysfunction (TND) including postoperative confusion, delirium, or agitation occurred in four patients (13%) in group A, and four patients (5%) in group B (P = not significant). The incidence of permanent neurologic dysfunction (stroke) was 9% (3 patients) in group A and 3% (3 patients) in group B. CONCLUSIONS: The direct cannulation of the ascending aorta is a safe alternative for patients with AADA, offering the opportunity for antegrade cerebral perfusion. It is easy to perform, reliable, and associated with acceptable early results.
