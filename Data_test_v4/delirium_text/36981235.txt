36981235|t|Relationship between Dietary Polyphenols and Gut Microbiota: New Clues to Improve Cognitive Disorders, Mood Disorders and Circadian Rhythms.
36981235|a|Cognitive, mood and sleep disorders are common and intractable disorders of the central nervous system, causing great inconvenience to the lives of those affected. The gut-brain axis plays a vital role in studying neurological disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases by acting as a channel for a bidirectional information exchange between the gut microbiota and the nervous system. Dietary polyphenols have received widespread attention because of their excellent biological activity and their wide range of sources, structural diversity and low toxicity. Dietary intervention through the increased intake of dietary polyphenols is an emerging strategy for improving circadian rhythms and treating metabolic disorders. Dietary polyphenols have been shown to play an essential role in regulating intestinal flora, mainly by maintaining the balance of the intestinal flora and enhancing host immunity, thereby suppressing neurodegenerative pathologies. This paper reviewed the bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiota and the brain and their effects on the central nervous system, focusing on dietary polyphenols that regulate circadian rhythms and maintain the health of the central nervous system through the gut-brain axis.
