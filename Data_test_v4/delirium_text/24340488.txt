24340488|t|Neuroscience research involving older persons in Canada: some legal and neuroethical concerns.
24340488|a|In this paper, I will examine some legal and ethical issues that arise in relation to neuroscience research involving older persons in Canada. Such research includes research relating to dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Dementias such as Alzheimer's are organic diseases affecting mainly older persons. They adversely affect mental acuity. There is still much that is unknown about such illnesses, making research on these diseases particularly necessary. In this paper, I will identify and focus on particular concerns with respect to the participation of older persons in research. These concerns are: Inclusion in and Access to Research; Informed Consent; Incidental Findings; and Advance Directives. I will discuss each of these concerns in the context of Canadian research ethics policy and law. The aim of this paper is not to provide an exhaustive discussion of these issues, each of which may rightfully demand a full paper. The aim of this paper is to identify and paint a canvass of these particularly relevant issues, discuss the policy and law on them, identify any existing gaps and propose some solutions to remedy these gaps and protect older persons who participate in research.
