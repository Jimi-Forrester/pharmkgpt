34062770|t|Post-Acute COVID-19 Neurological Syndrome: A New Medical Challenge.
34062770|a|In December 2019, in Wuhan (China), a highly pathogenic coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, dramatically emerged. This new virus, which causes severe pneumonia, is rapidly spreading around the world, hence it provoked the COVID-19 pandemic. This emergency launched by SARS-CoV-2 also had, and still has, devastating socio-economic aspects. Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable groups of people is crucial for the adaptation of governments' responses. Growing scientific evidence suggests that it is essential to keep the attention on people after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection; indeed, some clinical manifestations are frequently present even after recovery. There is consensus on the need to define which symptoms persist after the infection and which disabilities may arise after COVID-19. Recent reviews, case reports, and original contributions suggest that various organs may be affected, and neurological symptoms are present in about one third of patients with COVID-19. Neurological complications after severe COVID-19 infection might include delirium, brain inflammation, stroke, and nerve damage. In the recent pandemic, neurologists and neurobiologists have a chance to study key features of infection neurology. Furthermore, the psychological impact of the pandemic should not be underestimated, although there is currently no definition for this condition.
