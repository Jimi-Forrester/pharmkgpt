23220565|t|Perioperative delirium and its relationship to dementia.
23220565|a|A number of serious clinical cognitive syndromes occur following surgery and anesthesia. Postoperative delirium is a behavioral syndrome that occurs in the perioperative period. It is diagnosed through observation and characterized by a fluctuating loss of orientation and confusion. A distinct syndrome that requires formalized neurocognitive testing is frequently referred to as postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). There are serious concerns as to whether either postoperative delirium or postoperative cognitive dysfunction leads to dementia. These concerns are reviewed in this article.
