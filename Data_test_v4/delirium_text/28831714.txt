28831714|a|Studies have shown that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are associated with brain, cardiovascular, and immune function, as well as physical performance and bone health in older adults. So far, few studies have investigated the associations between PUFA status and performance-based tests of physical function. The objective of this study was to investigate the associations between the omega-3 PUFA levels (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) in red blood cell (RBC) membranes and physical performance, in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. This is a longitudinal observational study using data from the Multidomain Alzheimer's Disease Trial (MAPT), a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Four hundred participants from MAPT placebo group with available PUFA data were included. Omega-3 PUFA levels in RBC membranes were measured at baseline, and their percentage of total RBC membrane fatty acid content was calculated. We dichotomized the standardized omega-3 PUFA levels in RBC membranes as low (lowest quartile) vs. high (three upper quartiles). Gait speed (in m/s) and short physical performance battery (SPPB) score (range from 0 to 12, higher is better) were used to assess physical performance at baseline and after 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Participants were 75.2 (+- 4.3) years old and 68% were female. Bivariate analyses found that the characteristic of the participants in the lowest quartile of omega-3 PUFA levels (Q1) and those in the three upper quartiles (Q2-Q4) was not different at baseline; only those in Q1 were slightly older. In an unadjusted model, the difference in gait speed after 3 years of follow-up was significant (- 0.09 +- 0.03 m/s; p = 0.008) between participants in Q1 and those in Q2-Q4. In a model adjusted for age, gender, educational level, cognitive function, depressive status, body mass index, physical activity, grip strength, and their time interaction, this difference remained clinically relevant (- 0.07 +- 0.04 m/s; p = 0.075). No difference between the two groups was found for the SPPB score development over 3 years. Older adults with subjective memory complaints and in the lower quartile of omega-3 have a faster decline on gait speed compared to people in the three upper quartiles. Other longitudinal studies are needed to explore this association and to examine mechanisms.
