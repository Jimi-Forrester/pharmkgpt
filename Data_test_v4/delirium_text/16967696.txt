16967696|a|Comprehensive geriatric assessment during hospitalization, taking into account the specificity of geriatric patients could be used both in acute and long-term care. We analyzed 63 patients aged at least 80 years, born on odd days and hospitalized at the Department of Internal Medicine and Geriatrics, University Hospital, Krakow. We examined patients using Geriatric Assessment Chart which consisted of Barthel Index (used to determinate motor activity), MMSE, GDS (Geriatric Depression Scale), abbreviated Tinetti Test, Waterlow Index (used to determine the risk of pressure sore development), delirium risk factors scale, and social evaluation. The data were analyzed according to sex, marital status, level of mood, and residence status (free living or institutionalized). The mean age of 47 women and 16 men was 85.0 +/- 4.34 years. Dementia was been found in 60% of examined patients. Depression (usually mild) was encountered in 55.4%. Motor activity was moderately to severely impaired in the entire group, with high level of risk of falls and development of pressure sores. Thirteen per cent of the patients have been admitted with already developed ulcers. The results suggest the need for the comprehensive geriatric assessment both in hospitalized patients and in post-hospital phase of care.
