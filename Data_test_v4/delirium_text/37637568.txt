37637568|t|The Application of Deep Learning to Electroencephalograms, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Implants for the Detection of Epileptic Seizures: A Narrative Review.
37637568|a|Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures affecting millions worldwide. Medically intractable seizures in epilepsy patients are not only detrimental to the quality of life but also pose a significant threat to their safety. Outcomes of epilepsy therapy can be improved by early detection and intervention during the interictal window period. Electroencephalography is the primary diagnostic tool for epilepsy, but accurate interpretation of seizure activity is challenging and highly time-consuming. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms enable us to analyze complex EEG data, which can not only help us diagnose but also locate epileptogenic zones and predict medical and surgical treatment outcomes. DL models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), inspired by visual processing, can be used to classify EEG activity. By applying preprocessing techniques, signal quality can be enhanced by denoising and artifact removal. DL can also be incorporated into the analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which can help in the localization of epileptogenic zones in the brain. Proper detection of these zones can help in good neurosurgical outcomes. Recent advancements in DL have facilitated the implementation of these systems in neural implants and wearable devices, allowing for real-time seizure detection. This has the potential to transform the management of drug-refractory epilepsy. This review explores the application of ML and DL techniques to Electroencephalograms (EEGs), MRI, and wearable devices for epileptic seizure detection. This review briefly explains the fundamentals of both artificial intelligence (AI) and DL, highlighting these systems' potential advantages and undeniable limitations.
