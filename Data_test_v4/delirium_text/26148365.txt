26148365|a|Delirium in the intensive care unit is a frequent and serious complication, significantly worsens the prognosis of the underlying disease. Diagnoses that assign patients with delirium include an acute encephalopathy toxic encephalopathy, resuscitation psychosis, and this is an incomplete list. Thus, delirium is apparently not a separate disease, is more likely that this is a symptom of central nervous system polyethiological inherently. Currently only two methods for the diagnosis of delirium are recommended: the assessment of confusion for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and a checklist for the assessment of delirium in the ICU (ICDSC). There are no specific methods for the prevention of delirium, but the observance of some simple rules can prevent its development. We should treat the disease, which has led to the appearance of delirium symptoms. For relief discussed the state recommended that a mild sedative non-benzodiazepine drugs (dexmedetomidine better) with a daily assessment of the level of consciousness.
