29167985|a|PURPOSE: Cystectomy for bladder cancer is associated with a high risk of postoperative complications. Standardized perioperative protocols, such as enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols, aim to improve postoperative outcome. Postoperative feeding strategies are an important part of these protocols. In this two-centre study, we compared complications and length of hospital stay (LOS) between an ERAS protocol with early oral nutrition and a protocol with early enteral feeding with a Bengmark nasojejunal tube. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 154 consecutive patients who underwent cystectomy for bladder cancer in two hospitals (Hospital A and B) between 2014 and 2016. Hospital A uses an ERAS protocol (n = 45), which encourages early introduction of an oral diet. Hospital B uses a fast-track protocol comprising feeding with a Bengmark nasojejunal tube (Bengmark-protocol, n = 109). LOS and complications according to Clavien classification were compared between protocols. RESULTS: Overall 30-day complication rates in the ERAS and Bengmark protocol were similar (64.4 and 67.0%, respectively; p = 0.463). The rate of postoperative ileus (POI) was significantly lower in the Bengmark protocol (11.9% vs. 34.4% in the ERAS protocol, p = 0.009). This association remained significant after adjustment for other variables (odds ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.11-0.96; p = 0.042). Median LOS did not differ significantly between protocols (10 days vs. 11 days in the ERAS and Bengmark protocols, respectively; p = 0.861). CONCLUSIONS: Early oral nutrition in Hospital A was well tolerated. However, the Bengmark protocol was superior with respect to occurrence of POI. A prospective study may clarify whether the lower rate of POI was due to the use of early nasojejunal tube feeding or other reasons.
