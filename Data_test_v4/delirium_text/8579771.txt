8579771|t|kappa-1 Opioid receptors of the temporal cortex are preserved in Alzheimer's disease.
8579771|a|The binding of [3H]-U-69593 and [3H]-CI-977 to kappa-1 opioid receptors has been examined in the temporal cortex of postmortem brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease and age-matched controls using quantitative autoradiography. There was no significant difference between Alzheimer and control subjects in the level of [3H]-U-69593 and [3H]-CI-977 binding, but ChAT activity was markedly reduced (by 73% compared to controls). These results are not consistent with a presynaptic localisation of kappa-1 receptors on cholinergic terminals in human temporal cortex.
