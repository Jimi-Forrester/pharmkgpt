30036464|a|Abeta peptide and hyper-phosphorylated microtubule associated protein (Tau) aggregation causes severe damage to both the neuron membrane and key signal processing microfilament (microtubule) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. To date, the key challenge is to develop nontoxic, proteolytically stable amyloid inhibitors, which can simultaneously target multiple pathways involved in AD. Various attempts have been made in this direction; however, clinical outcomes of those attempts have been reported to be poor. Thus, we choose development of peptoid (N-substituted glycine oligomers)-based leads as potential AD therapeutics, which are easy to synthesize, found to be proteolytically stable, and exhibit excellent bioavailability. In this paper, we have designed and synthesized a new short peptoid for amyloid inhibition from 30-34 hydrophobic pocket of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide. The peptoid selectively binds with 17-21 hydrophobic region of Abeta and inhibits Abeta fibril formation. Various in vitro assays suggested that our AI peptoid binds with tubulin/microtubule and promotes its polymerization and stability. This peptoid also inhibits AChE-induced Abeta fibril formation and provides significant neuroprotection against toxicity generated by nerve growth factor (NGF) deprived neurons derived from rat adrenal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line. Moreover, this peptoid shows serum stability and is noncytotoxic to primary rat cortical neurons.
