3948697|t|[Rhabdomyolysis as a complication of chronic alcoholism. Observations in 19 cases].
3948697|a|In 19 chronic alcoholics with rhabdomyolysis the clinical picture demonstrated markedly different degrees of severity of myolysis. Muscle pain, muscle swellings and brown-coloured urine were rare. But symptoms of delirium, at times with cerebral seizures, were frequent at the onset. Renal failure of different degrees was common; five patients had to be dialysed. Two patients died in irreversible shock. Respiratory insufficiency and hypercalcaemia were other complications. Early recognition of the disease is important, because early treatment can prevent acute "myoglobinuric" renal failure.
