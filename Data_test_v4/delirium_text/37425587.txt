37425587|a|PURPOSE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effect of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on post-surgical pain in patients undergoing a total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR). METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A search of multiple databases, including PubMed and EMBASE, was performed for studies from database inception through March 2nd, 2022. Data were extracted, and pooled estimates of standardized mean differences in pain scores were calculated using a random effects model and inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: Two randomized control trials were eligible for inclusion (299 patients). The average ages of participants in each study were similar at 65.5 and 64.8 years, and both studies were predominantly female at 72.4% and 61.9%. The mindfulness intervention ranged from an eight-week program to a 20-minute session. Both individual studies reported statistically significant reductions in postoperative pain for MBI groups. The pooled standardized mean difference in pain scores for the MBI groups compared to the control groups was -1.94 (-3.39; -0.48). CONCLUSIONS: There exists preliminary evidence for the beneficial effect of MBIs on reducing the postoperative pain experience in this patient population. Given the significant consequences of postoperative pain and the necessity for non-opioid forms of analgesia, this topic represents a promising area of research that warrants future randomized control trials to better understand the role of MBIs for postoperative analgesia.
