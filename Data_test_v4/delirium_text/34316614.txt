34316614|a|Treatment of dystonia and tics continues to evolve. In dystonia, while oral agents such as benzodiazepines, baclofen and anticholinergics remain in use, botulinum toxin (BoNT) continues to be regarded as the treatment of choice for focal and segmental dystonia, but new preparations are being studied. While deep brain stimulation (DBS) has typically focused on targeting the globus pallidus internus (GPi) when treating dystonia, more recent research has expanded the targets to include subthalamic nucleus (STN) and other targets. In addition to DBS, thalamotomies continue to show therapeutic benefit in focal hand dystonias. Treatment of tics includes a growing armamentarium of options besides the three FDA-approved drugs, all dopamine receptor blockers (haloperidol, pimozide and aripiprazole). Because of lower risk of adverse effects, dopamine depleters (e.g. tetrabebazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine), along with novel D1 receptor antagonists, are currently studied as treatment alternatives in patients with tics. Practice guidelines for the treatment of tics and Tourette syndrome have been recently updated. Data regarding the use of DBS in treatment of tics remains relatively sparse, but international registries have expanded our understanding of the effect of stimulation at several targets.
