37225683|t|The causal involvement of the BDNF-TrkB pathway in dentate gyrus in early-life stress-induced cognitive deficits in male mice.
37225683|a|Cognitive dysfunction is a significant, untreated clinical need in patients with psychiatric disorders, for which preclinical studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and to identify potential therapeutic targets. Early-life stress (ELS) leads to long-lasting deficits of hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in adult mice, which may be associated with the hypofunction of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high-affinity receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). In this study, we carried out eight experiments using male mice to examine the causal involvement of the BDNF-TrkB pathway in dentate gyrus (DG) and the therapeutic effects of the TrkB agonist (7,8-DHF) in ELS-induced cognitive deficits. Adopting the limited nesting and bedding material paradigm, we first demonstrated that ELS impaired spatial memory, suppressed BDNF expression and neurogenesis in the DG in adult mice. Downregulating BDNF expression (conditional BDNF knockdown) or inhibition of the TrkB receptor (using its antagonist ANA-12) in the DG mimicked the cognitive deficits of ELS. Acute upregulation of BDNF (exogenous human recombinant BDNF microinjection) levels or activation of TrkB receptor (using its agonist, 7,8-DHF) in the DG restored ELS-induced spatial memory loss. Finally, acute and subchronic systemic administration of 7,8-DHF successfully restored spatial memory loss in stressed mice. Subchronic 7,8-DHF treatment also reversed ELS-induced neurogenesis reduction. Our findings highlight BDNF-TrkB system as the molecular target of ELS-induced spatial memory deficits and provide translational evidence for the intervention at this system in the treatment of cognitive deficits in stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder.
