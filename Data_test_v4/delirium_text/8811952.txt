8811952|t|On the nature of naming errors in aging and dementia: a study of semantic relatedness.
8811952|a|This study investigated the nature of naming errors produced on the Boston Naming Test by patients with mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and elderly and young controls, using a newly devised scoring system. This new approach involved ratings of error responses on a scale of semantic relatedness to the target name. Error responses of both mild and moderate AD subjects were no less semantically related to target names than were responses of age- and education-matched controls. We conclude that some available evidence of semantic loss in AD may be an artifact of the methodology chosen for evaluating naming errors.
