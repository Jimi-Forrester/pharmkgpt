26388316|t|Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta40 is similarly reduced in patients with Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease.
26388316|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have been increasingly studied for dementia diagnosis, however the accuracy to distinguish between different forms of dementia is still unsatisfactory. In this study, the added value of another CSF Abeta-peptide (Abeta40), along with the core CSF markers t-Tau, p-Tau, and Abeta42, in the discrimination between two large dementia groups of Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD; n=107), Alzheimer's Disease (AD; n=107) and non-demented subjects (n=33) was evaluated. In FTLD, t-Tau and p-Tau were significantly increased in relation to controls, but lower than in AD, while Abeta42 was similar in FTLD and controls, but higher than in AD. Equally reduced Abeta40 levels were seen in both dementia groups, and therefore the combination of Abeta40 with core CSF biomarkers optimally discriminated FTLD and AD patients from controls. Abeta42 and t-Tau were selected as the best biomarker subset to differentiate FTLD from AD, with no added value of Abeta40 to the model. Diagnostic accuracy between FTLD and AD was still sub-optimal, with a significant percentage (23%) of FTLD patients, in particularly women, carrying an ApoE-epsilon4 allele, showing a CSF-AD biomarkers profile. Although CSF Abeta40 does not appear to have an additional value in the distinction between FTLD and AD, it increases the discrimination between subjects with dementia from controls. A CSF-AD biomarker profile can be seen in patients with a clinical phenotype of FTLD, reinforcing the need for autopsy confirmation.
