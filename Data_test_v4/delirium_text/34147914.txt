Such a characteristic makes immune system as an attractive candidate for resolution of inflammatory disease followed by tissue repair. As first responder cells, neutrophils direct immune response playing key role in tissue remodeling. Previous studies revealed that sperm attracts neutrophils and promotes uterine remodeling suitable for fetus growth. Accordingly, sperm and more efficiently sperm head had remodeling effects on damaged brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model. To further reveal the mechanism, two kinds of in vivo study, including kinetic study and inhibition of neutrophil phagocytosis on AD model, as well as in vitro study using co-culture of neutrophil and sperm head were performed. Kinetic study revealed that sperm head recruited neutrophil to nasal mucosa similar to that of uterus and sperm head-phagocytizing neutrophils acquired new activation status comparing to control. In vitro study also demonstrated that sperm head-phagocytizing neutrophils acquire new activation status and express coding RNAs of sperm head. Accordingly, inhibition of neutrophil phagocytic activity abrogated therapeutic effects of sperm head. Neutrophils activation status is important in the fate of inflammatory process. Modulation but not suppression of neutrophils helps remodeling and repair of damaged tissue. Sperm head is an intelligent cell and not just a simple particle to remove by phagocytosis but instead can program neutrophils and consequently immune response into reparative mode after phagocytosis.
