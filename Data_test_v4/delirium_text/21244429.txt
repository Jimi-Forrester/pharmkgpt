21244429|t|Low-n oligomers as therapeutic targets of Alzheimer's disease.
21244429|a|The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease involves the progressive accumulation of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). Recent studies using synthetic Abeta peptides, a cell culture model, Abeta precursor protein transgenic mice models suggest that pre-fibrillar forms of Abeta are more deleterious than extracellular fibril forms. Recent findings obtained using synthetic Abeta peptides and human samples indicated that low-n oligomers (from dimers to octamers) may be proximate toxins for neuron and synapse. Here, we review the recent studies on the soluble oligomers, especially low-n oligomers in Alzheimer's disease.
