37118846|a|BACKGROUND: Preemptive intercostal nerve block (pre-ICNB) achieves the same analgesic effects as postoperative ICNB (post-ICNB) remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of preemptive ICNB on perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). METHODS: This was a randomized, open-label study (ChiCTR2200055667) from August 1, 2021, to December 30, 2021. Eligible patients scheduled for lobectomy for lung cancer were allocated into the pre-ICNB group and the post-ICNB group. The postoperative pain evaluation, patient rehabilitation, and opioid consumption were observed. RESULTS: A total of 81 patients were included. When compared with the post-ICNB group, the pre-ICNB group had a lower proportion of hypertension comorbidity (P = 0.023), significantly lower total consumption of morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) (P = 0.016), shorter extubation time (P = 0.019). The pre-ICNB group has similar Numeric Rating Scales (NRS) scores of dynamic pain in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), postoperative 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h (P > 0.05), and had simialr scores of Bruggrmann Comfort Scale (BCS) in postoperative 6 h, 12 h, 24 and 48 h (P > 0.05). The scores of the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Ramsay in the pre-ICNB group were comparable to those in the post-ICNB group, except the scores of MMSE and Ramsay in postoperative 6 h were lower (P = 0.048 and P = 0.019). The pain evaluation in the 1-month follow-up was comparable with that in the post-ICBN group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pre- ICNB is equally efficacious in perioperative pain management as post-ICNB, and pre-ICNB significantly reduces intra-operative opioid consumption, providing faster recovery in PACU. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Register (ChiCTR2200055667).
