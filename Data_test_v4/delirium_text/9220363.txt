9220363|t|Profiles of cognitive functioning in subjects with neurological disorders.
9220363|a|This report completes a four-year funded project designed to develop a data bank of Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examinations (NCSE) profiles of patients with neurological based disorders. Seven facilities participated in the study. Twenty categories of neurological/ psychological disorders were obtained from the NCSE profiles of 804 patients. Four categories had a sample large enough to permit inferences about the cognitive deficits related to the specific neurologic diagnosis. Including all diagnoses, the major areas of cognitive decline were auditory memory, visual memory and construction. Subjects with dementia had similar profiles but the severity varied depending upon the diagnoses of multi-infarct dementia, dementia of unknown origin or Alzheimer's disease. Profiles of cognitive functioning appear to differ among patients with different neurological/psychological disorders. The study also illustrated unique cognitive deficits that occur with different neurologic disorders, and how NCSE profiles were able to identify specific areas of cognitive deficits in population of patients with similar neurologic insults.
