33157991|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of combined intravenous-inhalation anesthesia (CIVIA) on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after laparoscopic radical resection of cervical cancer. METHODS: By using a predefined standardized study protocol, we conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with meta-analysis, searching the following data bases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. RESULTS: This systematic review evaluated the effect of CIVIA on POCD after laparoscopic radical resection of cervical cancer. CONCLUSION: This systematic review provided up-to-date evidence to evaluate the effect of CIVIA on POCD after laparoscopic radical resection of cervical cancer.
