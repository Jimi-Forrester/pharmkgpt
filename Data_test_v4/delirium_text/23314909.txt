23314909|a|Hypercholesterolemia is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD).             In the present study, we investigated whether diet-induced hypercholesterolemia             affects AD-like pathologies such as amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) deposition, tau pathology,             inflammation and cognitive impairment, using an Abeta25-35-injected AD-like pathological             mouse model. Hypercholesterolemia was induced by providing apolipoprotein E knock             out (Apo E KO) mice with a high-fat diet for 4 weeks prior to Abeta25-35 injection             and for 4 weeks following Abeta25-35 injection, for a total of 8 weeks of treatment.             Our data showed that intracerebroventricular injection of C57BL/6J mice with Abeta25-35             resulted in increased immunoreactivity of Abeta and phosphorylated-tau (p-tau), which             was accompanied by enhanced microglial CD11b-like immunoreactivity in the brain.             Moreover, hypercholesterolemia slightly increased Abeta and p-tau levels and microglial             activation in the vehicle group, while further increasing the Abeta and p-tau levels             and microglial activation in Abeta25-35-injected mice. Consistent with the neuropathological             analysis, hypercholesterolemia resulted in significant spatial learning and memory             deficits in Abeta25-35-injected mice as revealed by water maze testing. Collectively,             these findings demonstrated that hypercholesterolemia accelerated Abeta accumulation             and tau pathology, which was accompanied by microglial activation and subsequent             aggravation of memory impairment induced by Abeta25-35. Thus, we suggest that the             modulation of cholesterol can be used to reduce the risk of developing AD.
