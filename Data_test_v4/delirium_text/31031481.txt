31031481|t|Dexmedetomidine as Bolus or Low-dose Infusion for the Prevention of Emergence Agitation with Sevoflurane Anesthesia in Pediatric Patients.
31031481|a|BACKGROUND: This study was designed to compare the prevention of emergence agitation (EA) of sevoflurane anesthesia by an intraoperative bolus or low-dose infusion of dexmedetomidine in pediatric patients undergoing lower abdominal surgeries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients, aged 2-12 years, undergoing lower abdominal surgeries with sevoflurane anesthesia were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous bolus over 10 min. 0.4 mug/kg dexmedetomidine (Group I, n = 24) or low-dose infusion 0.4 mug/kg/h of dexmedetomidine (Group II, n = 24) after intubation. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were recorded before induction, at induction and every 5 min after induction. Observational pain scores (OPS), pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) scores, and Ramsay sedation scores (RSS) were recorded on arrival to the postanesthesia care unit and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60 min thereafter. Extubation time, emergence time, and time to reach Aldrete score >=9 were recorded. RESULTS: OPS and PAED scores and percentage of patients with OPS >=4 or PAED scale >=10 were significantly higher in Group II as compared to Group I. RSS score, extubation time, emergence time, and time to reach Aldrete score >=9 did not show any significant difference. CONCLUSION: Both bolus or low-dose infusion of dexmedetomidine was effective for the prevention of EA with sevoflurane anesthesia, but bolus dose of dexmedetomidine was more effective.
