9572587|t|Expression of ced-3 and ced-9 homologs in Alzheimer's disease cerebral cortex.
9572587|a|In order to characterize cell death mechanisms involved in Alzheimer disease (AD), we quantitated the expression of ced-3 and ced-9 homologs in AD frontal cortex. Positive (ICE, ICErel-II, ICErel-III, Ich-1L, CPP32, mch2, mch3, bcl-xS, bax and bak) and negative (bcl-2, bcl-xL, MCL1 and Ich-1S) regulators of apoptosis were successively examined using a semi-quantitative technique of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Total RNA was extracted from postmortem frontal cortex of AD patients (n = 7) and controls (n = 7) matched for age and autolysis time. Baseline levels of message were detected for 3 ced-3 (CPP32, Ich-1 and ICE) and 4 ced-9 homologs (bcl-x, MCL1, bcl-2 and bax) in the frontal cortex. There was an overexpression of the ICEalpha cDNA in AD patients as compared with age-matched controls (P = 0.03). Our results indicate that several ced-3 and ced-9 homologs are expressed in the adult human brain, and suggest that neuronal cell death in AD might involve an aberrant expression of ICEalpha.
