37807536|t|H - 51 Neuropsychological Evaluation of Non-Fluent English Speakers: a Case Study.
37807536|a|OBJECTIVE: Sometimes patients are referred for neuropsychological evaluation who do not speak English as their first language. In many cases, we have declined evaluating patients who were not fluent in English, and when we have evaluated bilingual patients, have qualified the limitations of our interpretations. However, there are no neuropsychologists providing services in languages besides English in the state of Oklahoma, and most patients never received services. METHOD: Patient is 83-year-old woman with five years of progressive decline in memory, unable to manage instrumental activities of daily living, presenting with family history of Alzheimer's disease, and neuroimaging negative for atrophy or cerebrovascular disease. Patient was not fluent in English. Efforts to find a neuropsychologist able to evaluate in Spanish were unsuccessful, so testing was modified, and measures were administered by a bilingual psychometrist. RESULTS: Attention, orientation, and memory were impaired (MMSE = 14). Verbal fluency was intact in Spanish. Auditory memory was not assessed due to unavailability of Spanish measures. Visual memory was impaired, consistent with figure copy. WAIS-IV was administered in English, with instructions in Spanish. CONCLUSIONS: Patient was diagnosed with possible Alzheimer's disease. Recommended PET scan or spinal tap for Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and reevaluation in Spanish in one year. Since neuropsychological evaluation is not available in every language, evaluation in English and highlighting the limitations of our findings may meet the ethical principle of beneficence, if we consider the impact of language and additional sources of data, such as collateral report of the patient's caregivers, and medical tests.
