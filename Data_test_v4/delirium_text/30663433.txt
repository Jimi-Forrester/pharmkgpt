30663433|t|Prediction of Alzheimer's disease with serum lipid levels in Asian individuals: a meta-analysis.
30663433|a|Background: The serum lipid profile has become a routine clinical test and used as an important predictor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), although its predictive value remains undetermined. Objective: To evaluate the role of serum lipid levels in predicting the risk of AD. Methods: Meta-analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-analyses (CMA) software to investigate the association between four conventional serum lipid profile parameters and the risk of AD, focused on samples from Asian. Results: In total, 3423 AD patients and 6127 healthy participants were involved. The results demonstrated that AD patients showed higher LDL-C and TC levels (SMD = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.04-0.51, p = 0.02 for LDL-C; SMD = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.05-0.46, p = 0.02 for TC) compared with those of healthy controls. People with higher LDL-C and/or TC levels had an increased risk of AD (OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.07-2.51 for LDL-C and OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.10-2.92 for TC). Conclusions: This study provided evidence that serum LDL-C and TC levels were associated with the risk of AD in Asian individuals. The routine lipid profile may be useful for AD diagnosis, monitoring and treatment.
