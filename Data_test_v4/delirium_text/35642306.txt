35642306|t|How Placenta Promotes the Successful Reproduction in High-Altitude Populations: A Transcriptome Comparison between Adaptation and Acclimatization.
35642306|a|As the best adapted high altitude population, Tibetans feature a relatively high offspring survival rate. Genome-wide studies have identified hundreds of candidate SNPs related to high altitude adaptation of Tibetans, although most of them have unknown functional relevance. To explore the mechanisms behind successful reproduction at high altitudes, we compared the placental transcriptomes of Tibetans, sea level Hans (SLHan), and Han immigrants (ImHan). Among the three populations, placentas from ImHan showed a hyperactive gene expression pattern. Their increased activation demonstrates a hypoxic stress response similar to sea level individuals experiencing hypoxic conditions. Unlike ImHan, Tibetan placentas were characterized by the significant up-regulation of placenta-specific genes, and the activation of autophagy and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Certain conserved hypoxia response functions, including the antioxidant system and angiogenesis, were activated in both ImHan and Tibetans, but mediated by different genes. The coherence of specific transcriptome features linked to possible genetic contribution was observed in Tibetans. Furthermore, we identified a novel Tibetan-specific EPAS1 isoform with a partial deletion at exon six, which may be involved in the adaption to hypoxia through the EPAS1-centred gene network in the placenta. Overall, our results show that the placenta grants successful pregnancies in Tibetans by strengthening the natural functions of the placenta itself. On the other hand, the placenta of ImHan was in an inhabiting time-dependent acclimatization process representing a common hypoxic stress response pattern.
