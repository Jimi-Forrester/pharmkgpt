38350432|a|Myelin plays a pivotal role in the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Disruptions in myelin integrity are associated with numerous neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis. In the central nervous system (CNS), myelin is formed by oligodendrocytes. Remyelination refers to the re-formation of the damaged myelin sheath by newly formed oligodendrocytes. Steroids have gained attention for their potential modulatory effects on myelin in both health and disease. Steroids are traditionally associated with endocrine functions, but their local synthesis within the nervous system has generated significant interest. The term "neuroactive steroids" refers to steroids that can act on cells of the nervous system. In the healthy state, neuroactive steroids promote myelin formation, maintenance, and repair by enhancing oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation. In pathological conditions, such as demyelination injury, multiple neuroactive steroids have shown promise in promoting remyelination. Understanding the effects of neuroactive steroids on myelin could lead to novel therapeutic approaches for demyelinating diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. This review highlights the potential therapeutic significance of neuroactive steroids in myelin-related health and diseases. We review the synthesis of steroids by neurons and glial cells and discuss the roles of neuroactive steroids on myelin structure and function in health and disease. We emphasize the potential pro-myelinating effects of the varying levels of neuroactive steroids during different female physiological states such as the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, lactation, and post-menopause.
