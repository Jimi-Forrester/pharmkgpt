31202840|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a dementia and neurodegenerative disease, is mostly prevalent among people more than 65 years. AD is mostly manifested in the form of degraded mental function, such as losing memory and impaired cognitive function. Due to inefficiency of traditional pharmacological therapeutic approaches with no long-term cure, cell therapy can be considered as a capable approach in AD management. Therapies based on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have provided hopeful results in experimental models regarding several disorders. MSCs enhance the levels of functional recoveries in pathologic experimental models of central nervous system (CNS) and are being investigated in clinical trials in neurological disorders. However, there is limited knowledge on the protective capabilities of MSCs in AD management. Almost, several experiments have suggested positive effects of MSCs and helped to better understand of AD-related dementia mechanism. MSCs have the potential to be used in AD treatment through amyloid-beta peptide (AB), Tau protein and cholinergic system. This review aimed to clarify the promising perspective of MSCs in the context of AD.
