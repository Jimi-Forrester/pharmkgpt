33459655|a|BACKGROUND: Deficits in odor detection and discrimination are premature symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that correlate with pathological signs in the olfactory bulb (OB) and piriform cortex (PCx). Similar olfactory dysfunction has been characterized in AD transgenic mice that overproduce amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), which can be prevented by reducing Abeta levels by immunological and pharmacological means, suggesting that olfactory dysfunction depends on Abeta accumulation and Abeta-driven alterations in the OB and/or PCx, as well as on their activation. However, this possibility needs further exploration. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the effects of Abeta on OB and PCx excitability/coupling and on olfaction. METHODS: Abeta oligomerized solution (containing oligomers, monomers, and protofibrils) or its vehicle were intracerebroventricularlly injected two weeks before OB and PCx excitability and synchrony were evaluated through field recordings in vivo and in brain slices. Synaptic transmission from the OB to the PCx was also evaluated in slices. Olfaction was assessed through the habituation/dishabituation test. RESULTS: Abeta did not affect lateral olfactory tract transmission into the PCx but reduced odor habituation and cross-habituation. This olfactory dysfunction was related to a reduction of PCx and OB network activity power in vivo. Moreover, the coherence between PCx-OB activities was also reduced by Abeta. Finally, Abeta treatment exacerbated the 4-aminopyridine-induced excitation in the PCx in slices. CONCLUSION: Our results show that Abeta-induced olfactory dysfunction involves a complex set of pathological changes at different levels of the olfactory pathway including alterations in PCx excitability and its coupling with the OB. These pathological changes might contribute to hyposmia in AD.
