27386324|a|INTRODUCTION: Gitelman syndrome(GS) is a rare inherited tubular disorder which is characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria. Here, we report a case of schizophrenia-like psychosis concomitant with GS and related literatures are reviewed. CASE DESCRIPTION: An 18-year-old male patient with 1-week history of auditory hallucinations, sense of insecurity, delusions of reference and feelings of being followed and controlled by others unknown, insomnia was admitted to Psychiatry department in December, 2013. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia were noted. He was diagnosed as schizophrenia-like psychosis. Treatment with paliperidone at the dose of 6 mg/day and magnesium and potassium supplementations was commenced. However, electrolyte disturbances failed to improve following psychosis remission. Therefore, other underlying diseases resulting in electrolyte disturbances were suspected. Along with hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, additional investigation showing metabolic alkalosis, hypocalciuria, renal loss of potassium, were consistent with GS. Gene analysis revealed this patient carried out c. 2687 G > A homozygous mutation of exon 23 in the SLC12A3 gene which led to p.Arg896Gln. Eventually, GS was identified. Thus, additional spironolactone (40 mg/day) combined with increased doses of oral potassium chloride sustained-release tablets (3.0 g/day) and potassium magnesium aspartate (0.3 g/day) were administered. During next half a year, fatigue resolved, paliperidone gradually tapered and eventually discontinued while psychosis maintained complete remission. His serum potassium was near normal (3.2-3.5 mmol/L), hypomagnesemia significantly improved (0.57-0.67 mmol/L). DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: Electrolyte abnormalities secondary to GS might cause or contribute to development of neuropsychiatric symptoms. In turn, hypokalemia was common among acute psychiatric inpatients. As a consequence, when concomitant with psychosis, GS was readily concealed. CONCLUSION: Electrolyte disturbances are common in acute psychiatric patients. However, when electrolyte disturbances are not improved following psychosis remission, other underlying diseases such as GS should be considered.
