35903646|t|A Pilot Mitochondrial Genome-Wide Association on Migraine Among Saudi Arabians.
35903646|a|Background: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations have been reported in multiple neurological diseases and helped to explain the pathophysiology of these diseases. Similarly, variations in mtDNA might exist in migraine and can explain the effect of low ATP production in the neurons on the initiation of migraine attack. Therefore, in the current study we aim to explore the association of mtDNA mutations on migraine in the Saudi population. Subjects and Methods: Over 1950 young Saudi female students were screened for migraine, among that a total of 103 satisfied the ICHD-3 criteria. However,  20 migraine cases confirmed in the neurology clinic and gave consent to participate in the study. Another 20 age-matched healthy controls were also recruited. Mitochondrial sequence variations were filtered from exome sequencing using NCBI GenBank Reference Sequence: NC_012920.1 and analysed using MITOMAP. Genes with significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were investigated by the gene functional classification tool DAVID and functional enrichment analysis of protein-protein interaction networks through STRING 11.5 for the most significant associated genes. Results: Genome wide analysis of the mitochondrial sequence variations between the patients with migraine and control revealed the association of 30 SNPs (p < 0.05) in the mitochondrial genome. The highest significance (p = 0.001033) was observed in a coding SNP (rs1603225278) in the CYTB gene and rs386829281 in the region of origin of replication. Twenty-four significant SNPs were in the coding region of nine (ND5, ND4, COX2, COX1, ND3, CYTB, COX3, ND2 and ND1) genes. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate the association of mtDNA variations with migraine in the Saudi population. The current findings will help to highlight the significance of mtDNA mutations to migraine pathophysiology and will serve as a reference data for larger national and international studies.
