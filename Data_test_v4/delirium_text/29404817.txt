29404817|a|Structure of amyloid beta (Abeta) fibrils is rigidly stacked by beta-sheet conformation, and the fibril state of Abeta is profoundly related to pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although mid-infrared light has been used for various biological researches, it has not yet been known whether the infrared light changes the fibril structure of Abeta. In this study, we tested the effect of irradiation of intense mid-infrared light from a free-electron laser (FEL) targeting the amide bond on the reduction of beta-sheet content in Abeta fibrils. The FEL reduced entire contents of proteins exhibiting beta-sheet structure in brain sections from AD model mice, as shown by synchrotron-radiation infrared microscopy analysis. Since Abeta1-42 fibril absorbed a considerable FEL energy at amide I band (6.17 mum), we irradiated the FEL at 6.17 mum and found that beta-sheet content of naked Abeta1-42 fibril was decreased using infrared microscopic analysis. Consistent with the decrease in the beta-sheet content, Congo-red signal is decreased after the irradiation to Abeta1-42 fibril. Furthermore, electron microscopy analysis revealed that morphologies of the fibril and proto-fibril were largely changed after the irradiation. Thus, mid-infrared light dissociates beta-sheet structure of Abeta fibrils, which justifies exploration of possible laser-based therapy for AD.
