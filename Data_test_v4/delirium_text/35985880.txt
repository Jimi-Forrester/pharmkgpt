35985880|t|Delirium Development After Lung Transplantation: An Intraoperative Assessment.
35985880|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between intraoperative hemodynamic and laboratory parameters with postoperative delirium development after lung transplantation. METHODS: A total of 77 patients who underwent lung transplantation in a single center were included in the study. Demographic and clinical data recorded at critical intraoperative stages (after induction [T1], after bilateral lungs are dissected [T2], while the patient is ventilated for 1 lung [T3], while the unilateral transplanted lung is ventilated [T4], while bilateral transplanted lungs are ventilated [T5], and after the thorax is closed [T6]), postoperative complications, mechanical ventilation duration, intensive care, and hospitalization durations and mortality rates were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 83.1% of the 77 patients were male, and the mean (SD) age was 47.56 (12.95) years. The mean body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 23.30 (3.99), and the median Charles Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 1. The diagnosis of 36.4% of the patients was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Delirium was seen in 51.9% of the patients. Age, CCI, intraoperative mean arterial pressure changes, lactate levels, mechanical ventilation duration, and hospital stay were all associated with delirium development. CONCLUSION: Age, CCI, duration of mechanical ventilation, and hospital stay were independent predictors of postoperative delirium development. We believe that our study will be a guide for future prospective randomized controlled studies.
