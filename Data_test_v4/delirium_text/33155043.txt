33155043|a|The aetiology of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases is largely unknown. Here we investigated whether de novo somatic variants for semantic dementia can be detected, thereby arguing for a more general role of somatic variants in neurodegenerative disease. Semantic dementia is characterized by a non-familial occurrence, early onset (<65 years), focal temporal atrophy and TDP-43 pathology. To test whether somatic variants in neural progenitor cells during brain development might lead to semantic dementia, we compared deep exome sequencing data of DNA derived from brain and blood of 16 semantic dementia cases. Somatic variants observed in brain tissue and absent in blood were validated using amplicon sequencing and digital PCR. We identified two variants in exon one of the TARDBP gene (L41F and R42H) at low level (1-3%) in cortical regions and in dentate gyrus in two semantic dementia brains, respectively. The pathogenicity of both variants is supported by demonstrating impaired splicing regulation of TDP-43 and by altered subcellular localization of the mutant TDP-43 protein. These findings indicate that somatic variants may cause semantic dementia as a non-hereditary neurodegenerative disease, which might be exemplary for other late-onset neurodegenerative disorders.
