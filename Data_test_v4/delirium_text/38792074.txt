38792074|a|The research on new compounds against plant pathogens is still socially and economically important. It results from the increasing resistance of pests to plant protection products and the need to maintain high yields of crops, particularly oilseed crops used to manufacture edible and industrial oils and biofuels. We tested thirty-five semi-synthetic hydrazide-hydrazones with aromatic fragments of natural origin against phytopathogenic laccase-producing fungi such as Botrytis cinerea, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and Cerrena unicolor. Among the investigated molecules previously identified as potent laccase inhibitors were also strong antifungal agents against the fungal species tested. The highest antifungal activity showed derivatives of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and salicylic aldehydes with 3-tert-butyl, phenyl, or isopropyl substituents. S. sclerotiorum appeared to be the most susceptible to the tested compounds, with the lowest IC50 values between 0.5 and 1.8 microg/mL. We applied two variants of phytotoxicity tests for representative crop seeds and selected hydrazide-hydrazones. Most tested molecules show no or low phytotoxic effect for flax and sunflower seeds. Moreover, a positive impact on seed germination infected with fungi was observed. With the potential for application, the cytotoxicity of the hydrazide-hydrazones of choice toward MCF-10A and BALB/3T3 cell lines was lower than that of the azoxystrobin fungicide tested.
