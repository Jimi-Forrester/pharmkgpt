29171502|t|[Memantine: from the original brand to generics].
29171502|a|Memantine is the first clinically available glutamate antagonist, with an antagonist action at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the brain, for correction of cognitive and behavioral functions in neurodegenerative disorders. Glutamate mediated excitotoxic neuronal damage has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other parkinsonism-related dementias and, therefore, memantine represents a novel mode of action to counteract the glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. In moderate to severe AD, 20 mg of memantine shows a positive effect on cognition, mood, behavior and the ability to perform activities of daily living. Long-term studies show good tolerability of memantine with an acceptable side-effect profile. In recent years, there have been a proliferation of a number of companies producing generic memantine with different trade names. In Russia, the first memantine generic drug noojerone was approved in 2010 and its use has since been supported by a growing evidence base of efficacy in real-life clinical practice. Postmarketing studies show that noojerone provides long-term and effective therapy in patients with moderate and severe Alzheimer's dementia. This observation is supported by the clinically significant therapeutic effect of noojerone on cognitive and daily functioning, behavioral and psychotic symptoms of dementia and a reduction of the burden on caregivers. This generic version of memantine is affordable and, therefore, reduces financial burden on patients and improves compliance with treatment.
