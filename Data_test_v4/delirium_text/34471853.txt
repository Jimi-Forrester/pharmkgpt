34471853|t|Toward Closed-Loop Electrical Stimulation of Neuronal Systems: A Review.
34471853|a|Biological neuronal cells communicate using neurochemistry and electrical signals. The same phenomena also allow us to probe and manipulate neuronal systems and communicate with them. Neuronal system malfunctions cause a multitude of symptoms and functional deficiencies that can be assessed and sometimes alleviated by electrical stimulation. Our working hypothesis is that real-time closed-loop full-duplex measurement and stimulation paradigms can provide more in-depth insight into neuronal networks and enhance our capability to control diseases of the nervous system. In this study, we review extracellular electrical stimulation methods used in in vivo, in vitro, and in silico neuroscience research and in the clinic (excluding methods mainly aimed at neuronal growth and other similar effects) and highlight the potential of closed-loop measurement and stimulation systems. A multitude of electrical stimulation and measurement-based methods are widely used in research and the clinic. Closed-loop methods have been proposed, and some are used in the clinic. However, closed-loop systems utilizing more complex measurement analysis and adaptive stimulation systems, such as artificial intelligence systems connected to biological neuronal systems, do not yet exist. Our review promotes the research and development of intelligent paradigms aimed at meaningful communications between neuronal and information and communications technology systems, "dialogical paradigms," which have the potential to take neuroscience and clinical methods to a new level.
