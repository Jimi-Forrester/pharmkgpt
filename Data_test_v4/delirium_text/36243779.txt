36243779|a|The relationship between fluid management and the severity of illness, duration of treatment, and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not fully understood. This study aimed to evaluate whether weight change during hospitalization was associated with COVID-19 severity, length of hospital stay, and route of admission. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of fluid restriction management in patients with severe COVID-19. COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital between July 2020 and October 2021 were analyzed. Patients were treated with standard drug therapy based on the Japanese guidelines and respiratory support according to the severity of the disease. Early enteral nutrition, defecation management, and anticoagulation therapy were also administered. Fluid restriction management was performed using furosemide and continuous renal replacement therapy as needed unless hemodynamic instability or hyperlactatemia was present. Patient background, route of admission (ambulance, A; transfer, T), weight at admission and discharge, the severity of illness (oxygen therapy, G1; mechanical ventilation, G2; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, G3), in-hospital mortality, and length of hospital stay were analyzed. There were 116 subjects: G1 (n = 48), G2 (n = 43), and G3 (n = 25), with ages (median [IQR]) of 58 (47-70), 65 (53-71.5), 56 (51-62) years, 40 (83.3%), 31 (72.1%), and 19 (76.0%) males, respectively. Hospital stays were 4.5 (2-7), 10 (7-16), and 18 (15-26) days, and the in-hospital mortality rates were 0 (0%), 7 (16.3%), and 8 (32%), respectively. Body mass index on admission was 26 (23.1-30.2), 27.1 (22.7-31.1), and 31.5 (27.1-33.1) kg/m2, and weight loss during admission was 1.1 (0-2.9), 4.6 (2.3-5.7), 9.2 (5.6-10.5) kg (P < 0.001, Jonckheere-Terpstra test. Weight loss in the severe group (G2 + G3) was 3.4 (0.5-5.8) kg [A, n = 12] and 5.6 (4.4-9) kg [T, n = 43] [P = 0.026, Mann-Whitney U test]. The lengths of hospital stay were 5 (2-7), 9 (7-15), and 18 (12-26) days [P < 0.001, Jonckheere-Terpstra test]. In our fluid restriction management, patients with severe COVID-19 had significant longer hospital length of stay, weight loss, especially those who were transferred to the hospital.
