36482590|a|This study used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) to assess glymphatic system function in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to healthy controls. Patients with ASD may have glymphatic system dysfunction, which is related to age. We retrospectively included 30 children with ASD and 25 healthy controls in this study. 3T magnetic resonance imaging scanner was used to perform DTI magnetic resonance imaging on all participants, and the DTI-ALPS index was calculated from the DTI data. Additionally, we evaluated how the DTI-ALPS index differed between the 2 groups. Moreover, we examined the relationships between the bilateral DTI-ALPS index and the age of the participants. The DTI-ALPS index considerably differed between groups. In the left index (1.02 +- 0.12 vs. 1.27 +- 0.25, P < .001) and in the right index (1.03 +- 0.12 vs. 1.32 +- 0.20, P < .001), the DTI-ALPS in ASD patients was significantly lower than that in healthy controls. Furthermore, the DTI-ALPS index was strongly and positively associated with age. In patients with ASD, there is a glymphatic system dysfunction. This is intimately correlated to age. Our findings suggest the importance of the DTI-ALPS approach in assessing the function of the glymphatic system in ASD.
