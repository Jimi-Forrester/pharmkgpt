31868202|t|STAT3-induced up-regulation of lncRNA NEAT1 as a ceRNA facilitates abdominal aortic aneurysm formation by elevating TULP3.
31868202|a|Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were viewed as crucial participants in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). LncRNA NEAT1 was recognized as an oncogenic gene in various diseases. However, its function and mechanism in AAA were not precisely documented. Here, we explored the functional role and molecular mechanism of NEAT1 in AAA. Functionally, the effect of NEAT1 on the proliferation was assessed by CCK-8 and EdU assay, while its impact on the apoptosis was evaluated through caspase-3/9 activity and TUNEL assays. As a result, we found that NEAT1 knockdown enhanced the proliferation and impaired the apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Reversely, overexpressed NEAT1 exerted anti-proliferation and pro-apoptosis effects in VSMCs. Mechanically, we found that STAT3 acted as a transcription factor and contributed to NEAT1 transcription by ChIP and luciferase reporter assays. In addition, NEAT1 was confirmed as a sponge of miR-4688 and thereby increase the expression of TULP3 in VSMCs via RIP assay and RNA pull-down assay. Rescue experiments indicted that TULP3 overexpressing countervailed the impact of NEAT1 depletion on AAA biological processes. Conclusively, lncRNA NEAT1 induced by STAT3 was identified as a ceRNA and facilitated AAA formation by targeting miR-4688/TULP3 axis.
