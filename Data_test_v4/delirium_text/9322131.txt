9322131|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common cause of functional decline in Down syndrome (DS) adults. Acquired cognitive deficits may be difficult to evaluate in the context of baseline impairments. Behavioral symptoms are also common and may represent the effects of depression, AD, or both. Therefore, the objective of this study was to report a clinical case series of selected adults with DS and behavioral change who responded to treatment with selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication. Six patients, aged 23 to 63 years, 5 women and 1 man, with the clinical diagnosis of DS presented for diagnosis and treatment of functional decline in adult life. Noncognitive symptoms were prominent and included aggression, social withdrawal, and compulsive behaviors. Memory dysfunction was reported in varying degrees. Treatment with SSRI antidepressants was instituted for depressive, apathetic, and compulsive behaviors. Treated patients showed improvement in behaviors as reported by caregivers, and on objective measures, such as workplace productivity. Noncognitive symptoms are a cardinal feature of functional decline in adults with DS and may represent either depression or AD. In some patients, the symptoms respond well to SSRI agents with concomitant improvement in daily function. Treatment trials with SSRIs may, therefore, be warranted in such cases.
