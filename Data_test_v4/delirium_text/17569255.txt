17569255|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the influential factors leading to postoperative delirium in elderly patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia(BPH). METHODS: For 198 elderly postoperative BPH patients in our hospital, the clinical parameters including age, hypoxemia, postoperative pain, and sleep reduction were investigated, and the data were processed by chi2 test. RESULTS: Of the total number of patients, 13 (6.5%) experienced postoperation delirium. Many factors were significantly correlated with the problem in these elderly BPH patients, such as advanced age (> or =70), postoperative pain and sleep reduction (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Advanced age, postoperative pain and sleep problem were important factors for delirium, and therefore postoperative analgesia and good sleep may help to prevent postoperative delirium.
