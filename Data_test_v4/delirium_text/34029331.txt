34029331|a|The dendritic cell (DC)-derived cytokine profile contributes to naive T cell differentiation, thereby directing the immune response. IL-37 is a cytokine with anti-inflammatory characteristics that has been demonstrated to induce tolerogenic properties in DC. In this study we aimed to evaluate the influence of IL-37 on DC-T cell interaction, with a special focus on the role of the chemokine CXCL1. DC were cultured from bone marrow of human IL-37 transgenic (hIL-37Tg) or WT mice. The phenotype of unstimulated and LPS-stimulated DC was analyzed (co-stimulatory molecules and MHCII by flow cytometry, cytokine profile by RT-PCR and ELISA), and T cell stimulatory capacity was assessed in mixed lymphocyte reaction. The role of CXCL1 in T cell activation was analyzed in T cell stimulation assays with anti-CD3 or allogeneic DC. The expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86, and of MHCII in LPS-stimulated DC was not affected by endogenous expression of IL-37, whereas LPS-stimulated hIL-37Tg DC produced less CXCL1 compared to LPS-stimulated WT DC. T cell stimulatory capacity of LPS-matured hIL-37Tg DC was comparable to that of WT DC. Recombinant mouse CXCL1 did not increase T cell proliferation either alone or in combination with anti-CD3 or allogeneic DC, nor did CXCL1 affect the T cell production of interferon-gamma and IL-17. Endogenous IL-37 expression does not affect mouse DC phenotype or subsequent T cell stimulatory capacity, despite a reduced CXCL1 production. In addition, we did not observe an effect of CXCL1 in T cell proliferation or differentiation.
