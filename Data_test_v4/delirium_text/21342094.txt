21342094|a|Recent studies have been supporting that the generation of Abeta42 oligomers is responsible for Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, those peptides which bind to Abeta42 are scientifically interesting and can be possible candidates for the diagnosis and therapy of Alzheimer's disease. A systemic in vitro evolution, developed recently and the designated progressive library method (PLM), was applied to obtain Ab42-binding aptamers peptides. As a result, high affinity peptide aptamers made of 8 or 9 amino acids could be identified by this approach, endorsing the methodological effectiveness. Namely, the selection products from the secondary library of diversified peptides, which was constructed based on the information obtained from the primary library selection, were confirmed to be superior to those selected from the primary library as had been reported previously. The affinities of those peptides measured by SPR (surface plasmon resonance) were comparable to or higher than that of those peptides so far reported (K(d) of 10-7). The other peptides selected were confirmed of their binding by a novel mode of gel shift assay (fluorescence enhancement caused by the binding). Thus, novel Abeta42-binding peptides with high affinity were provided for the future Alzheimer's disease study. The demonstration of the effectiveness of the systemic in vitro evolution of PLM is very encouraging for the study of identifying novel functional peptides.
