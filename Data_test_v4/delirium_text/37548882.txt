37548882|t|Association of spermidine blood levels with microstructure of sleep-implications from a population-based study.
37548882|a|Deteriorations in slow wave sleep (SWS) have been linked to brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), possibly due to its key role in clearance of amyloid-beta and tau (Ass/tau), two pathogenic hallmarks of AD. Spermidine administration has been shown to improve sleep quality in animal models. So far, the association between spermidine levels in humans and parameters of SWS physiology are unknown but may be valuable for therapeutic strategies. Data from 216 participants (age range 50-81 years) of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania TREND were included in our analysis. We investigated associations between spermidine plasma levels, key parameters of sleep macroarchitecture and microarchitecture that were previously associated with AD pathology, and brain health measured via a marker of structural brain atrophy (AD score). Higher spermidine levels were significantly associated with lower coupling between slow oscillations and spindle activity. No association was evident for SWS, slow oscillatory, and spindle activity throughout non-rapid eye movement sleep. Furthermore, elevated spermidine blood levels were significantly associated with a higher AD score, while sleep markers revealed no association with AD score. The association between higher spermidine levels and brain health was not mediated by coupling between slow oscillations and spindle activity. We report that higher spermidine blood levels are associated not only with deteriorated brain health but also with less advantageous markers of sleep quality in older adults. Future studies need to evaluate whether sleep, spermidine, and Ass/tau deposition are interrelated and whether sleep may play a mediating role.
