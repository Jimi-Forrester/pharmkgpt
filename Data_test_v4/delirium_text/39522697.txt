39522697|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington disease (HD), and Multiple sclerosis (MS), pose a significant global health challenge due to their intricate pathology and limited therapeutic interventions. Natural products represent invaluable reservoirs for combating these neurodegenerative diseases by targeting key pathological hallmarks such as protein aggregation, synaptic dysfunction, aberrant proteostasis, cytoskeletal abnormalities, altered energy homeostasis, inflammation, and neuronal cell death. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms and therapeutic targets of natural products for their neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, it elucidates the current progress of clinical trials investigating the potential of natural products in delaying neurodegeneration. The objective of this review is to enhance the comprehension of natural products in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, offering new insights and potential avenues for future pharmaceutical research.
