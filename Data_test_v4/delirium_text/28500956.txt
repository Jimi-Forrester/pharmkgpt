28500956|a|Based on the broad spectrum of biological activities associated with organophosphates, a novel type of this class of compounds was synthesized, bearing a nitrile group, from the sodium alkoxide-catalyzed reaction of dialkylphosphites with gamma-ketonitriles at 80 C under solvent-free conditions. A reaction mechanism involving a phospha-Brook type rearrangement is proposed. Eight title compounds were investigated for their in vitro inhibitory potency and selectivity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) using Ellman's spectrophotometric method. The synthesized derivatives exhibited mostly a moderate activity against both cholinesterases. The IC50 values for BChE were in a smaller concentration range (5.96-23.35microM) compared to those for AChE inhibition (9.61-53.74microM). The diethyl-3-cyano-1-p-tolylpropylphosphate which displayed the higher dual inhibitory potency towards both cholinesterases could be considered as a potential candidate for developing new drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease.
