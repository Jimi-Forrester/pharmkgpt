36133506|t|Scrub Typhus Meningoencephalitis: An Overlooked Entity.
36133506|a|Scrub typhus is common in rural parts of Nepal, but its diagnosis remains difficult due to a lack of clinical suspicion and poor diagnostic resources. The absence of common clinical features further complicates this problem. Acute kidney injury (AKI), myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, hepatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and meningoencephalitis are complications of the disease associated with high mortality. Overlap findings can be noted in scrub typhus meningoencephalitis and other tropical infections. This makes diagnosing the disease more challenging, especially in areas where the burden of infectious diseases is high. We report three cases of scrub typhus meningoencephalitis. All three patients were treated successfully with doxycycline. Because patients with scrub typhus have an excellent response to treatment, delay in treatment and rate of complications can be prevented with high clinical suspicion of the condition.
