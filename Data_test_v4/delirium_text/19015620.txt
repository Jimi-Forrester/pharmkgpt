19015620|t|Radical scavenging and reducing power of Salvia mirzayanii subfractions.
19015620|a|In this research, the radical scavenging activity and reducing power of the ethyl acetate fraction and subfractions of Salvia mirzayanii (SM) have been investigated. The plant material was initially extracted with ethanol. The fractionation was carried out using liquid-liquid extraction, then the ethyl acetate fraction, which showed the greatest antioxidant activity, was selected. This fraction was submitted to column chromatography on a Sephadex LH 20 column eluted with pure MeOH to obtain subfractions A-G. No significant differences exist between the IC(50) of Salvia mirzayanii ethyl acetate subfraction C (IC(50) = 37.9 +/- 0.85), F (IC(50) = 40.05 +/- 1.4) and quercetin (38.84 +/- 0.86), (P > 0.05), indicating that the radical scavenging capacity of these two subfractions and quercetin (antioxidant standard) were similar. The reducing power of the ethyl acetate fraction was less than that of all subfractions, except for subfraction A. The greatest amount of phenolic compounds was found in subfraction E (55.23 +/- 4.2) and the lowest in subfraction F (5.23 +/- 0.18). The greatest total flavonoid content was established in subfraction D (1.84 +/- 0.01) and the lowest was in subfraction A (0.108 +/- 0.007).
