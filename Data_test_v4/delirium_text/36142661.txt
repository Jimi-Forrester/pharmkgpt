36142661|t|Rodent Models of Post-Stroke Dementia.
36142661|a|Post-stroke cognitive impairment is one of the most common complications in stroke survivors. Concomitant vascular risk factors, including aging, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or underlying pathologic conditions, such as chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, white matter hyperintensities, or Alzheimer's disease pathology, can predispose patients to develop post-stroke dementia (PSD). Given the various clinical conditions associated with PSD, a single animal model for PSD is not possible. Animal models of PSD that consider these diverse clinical situations have not been well-studied. In this literature review, diverse rodent models that simulate the various clinical conditions of PSD have been evaluated. Heterogeneous rodent models of PSD are classified into the following categories: surgical technique, special structure, and comorbid condition. The characteristics of individual models and their clinical significance are discussed in detail. Diverse rodent models mimicking the specific pathomechanisms of PSD could provide effective animal platforms for future studies investigating the characteristics and pathophysiology of PSD.
