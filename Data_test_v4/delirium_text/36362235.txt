36362235|t|Leukocyte Telomere Length as Potential Biomarker of HD Progression: A Follow-Up Study.
36362235|a|The identification of biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease (HD) is crucial for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic trial outcomes, especially in the pre-manifest disease stage (pre-HD). In a previous study, we observed that leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was strongly correlated with the estimated time to clinical onset in pre-HD subjects. To validate this hypothesis, we designed a follow-up study in which we analyzed LTL in 45 pre-HD stage subjects at baseline (T0) and then again after clinical onset at follow-up (T1); the follow-up interval was about 3 years, and the CAG range was 39-51 repeats; 90 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples (PBMCs) were obtained from the Enroll-HD biorepository. In pre-HD subjects at T0, LTL was significantly reduced by 22% compared to the controls and by 14% from T0 at T1. No relationship was observed between the LTL and CAG numbers in subjects carrying different CAG repeats at T0 and at T1, suggesting that LTL reduction occurs independently of CAG number in pre-HD subjects. ROC curve analysis was used to test the validity of LTL as a potential biomarker of HD progression and showed that LTL measurement is extremely accurate in discriminating pre-HD subjects from the controls and even pre-HD from manifest HD, thus yielding a robust prognostic value in pre-HD subjects.
