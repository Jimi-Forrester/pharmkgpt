19280873|t|[Topographical disorientation: viewpoints from behavioral neurology].
19280873|a|To navigate freely and safely in familiar environments is essential for humans in everyday life. This ability, however, can be deprived of after a focal cerebral damage or degenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease. In this article, the author introduces the concept of way finding behavior from animals to humans, and its dysfunction or topographical disorientation (TD) in humans which develops after focal cerebral damage and dementing illnesses. The author also links the neuro-anatomical structures, the cognitive functions related to way finding and the clinical manifestations of TD, with an attempt to clarify the brain-behavioral relationship. For neurologists, the awareness of TD and its knowledge is helpful to make a correct diagnosis and to improve the quality of life of their patients.
