26780457|t|Perforin Promotes Amyloid Beta Internalisation in Neurons.
26780457|a|Studies on the mechanisms of neuronal amyloid-beta (Abeta) internalisation are crucial for understanding the neuropathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We here investigated how extracellular Abeta peptides are internalised and focused on three different pathways: (i) via endocytic mechanisms, (ii) via the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and (iii) via the pore-forming protein perforin. Both Abeta40 and Abeta42 were internalised in retinoic acid differentiated neuroblastoma (RA-SH-SY5Y) cells. A higher concentration was required for Abeta40 (250 nM) compared with Abeta42 (100 nM). The internalised Abeta40 showed a dot-like pattern of distribution whereas Abeta42 accumulated in larger and distinct formations. By confocal microscopy, we showed that Abeta40 and Abeta42 co-localised with mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomes. Abeta treatment of human primary cortical neurons (hPCN) confirmed our findings in RA-SH-SY5Y cells, but hPCN were less sensitive to Abeta; therefore, a 20 (Abeta40) and 50 (Abeta42) times higher concentration was needed for inducing uptake. The blocking of endocytosis completely inhibited the internalisation of Abeta peptides in RA-SH-SY5Y cells and hPCN, indicating that this is a major pathway by which Abeta enters the cells. In addition, the internalisation of Abeta42, but not Abeta40, was reduced by 55 % by blocking RAGE. Finally, for the first time we showed that pore formation in cell membranes by perforin led to Abeta internalisation in hPCN. Understanding how Abeta is internalised sheds light on the pathological role of Abeta and provides further ideas of inhibitory strategies for preventing Abeta internalisation and the spreading of neurodegeneration in AD.
