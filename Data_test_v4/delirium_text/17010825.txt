17010825|t|Outcomes of antipsychotic drug use in community-dwelling elders with dementia.
17010825|a|This study used administrative data from a large health care insurer in the southeast United States to describe the utilization pattern and health care outcomes of antipsychotic drug use in community-dwelling elders with dementia. Claims data from 959 unique cases were analyzed to address research aims. Overall, 27% of the sample was dispensed antipsychotic drugs, with the most prevalent type being atypical antipsychotic drugs. Individuals on any type of antipsychotic drug experienced more delirium, depression, hip fracture, falls, and syncope than those not on these drugs, even after controlling for age, sex, comorbidity, and number of other drugs prescribed. Implications for practice are discussed.
