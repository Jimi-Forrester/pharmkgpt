OBJECTIVE: To quantify the changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and iron deposition during progression of AD. METHODS: 94 subjects underwent brain imaging on a 3.0-T MRI scanner with techniques of three-dimensional arterial spin labeling (3D-ASL) and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). The subjects included 22 patients with probable AD, 22 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 25 patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and 25 normal controls (NC). The CBF and QSM values were obtained using a standardized brain region method based on the Brainnetome Atlas. The differences in CBF and QSM values were analyzed between and within groups using variance analysis and correlation analysis. RESULTS: CBF and QSM identified several abnormal brain regions of interest (ROIs) at different stages of AD (p < 0.05). Regionally, the CBF values in several ROIs of the AD and MCI subjects were lower than for NC subjects (p < 0.001). Higher QSM values were observed in the globus pallidus. The CBF and QSM values in multiple ROI were negatively correlated, while the putamen was the common ROI of the three study groups (p < 0.05). The CBF and QSM values in hippocampus were cross-correlated with scale scores during the progression of AD (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Iron deposition in the basal ganglia and reduction in blood perfusion in multiple regions existed during the progression of AD. The QSM values in putamen can be used as an imaging biomarker for early diagnosis of AD.
