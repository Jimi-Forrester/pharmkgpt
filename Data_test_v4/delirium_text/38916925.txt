38916925|t|Relationship of Curcumin with Aging and Alzheimer and Parkinson Disease, the Most Prevalent Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Narrative Review.
38916925|a|The elderly population is increasing worldwide every day. Age is a significant factor in the progression of neurological diseases, which can also cause cognitive decline and memory disorders. Inflammation and oxidative stress are primary drivers of senescence and disorders, particularly those associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Bioactive phytochemicals are considered a promising therapeutic strategy in combating aging and age-related pathological conditions. One of the phytochemicals with diverse biological properties encompassing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer, antifungal, antidepressant, anti-allergic, and anti-aging properties is curcumin. Curcumin, a polyphenolic structure with a distinct orange hue and unique chemical properties, is derived from the roots of Curcuma longa, a member of the Zingiberaceae family, commonly known as turmeric. It has been noted that the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is low in societies that consume curcumin widely. Therefore, this review investigates the effect of curcumin on aging and Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, which are the most prevalent age-related neurodegenerative diseases.
