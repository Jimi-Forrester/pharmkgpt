31696209|t|Adaptation of the Gut Microbiota to Modern Dietary Sugars and Sweeteners.
31696209|a|The consumption of sugar has become central to the Western diet. Cost and health concerns associated with sucrose spurred the development and consumption of other sugars and sweeteners, with the average American consuming 10 times more sugar than 100 y ago. In this review, we discuss how gut microbes are affected by changes in the consumption of sugars and other sweeteners through transcriptional, abundance, and genetic adaptations. We propose that these adaptations result in microbes taking on different metabolic, ecological, and genetic profiles along the intestinal tract. We suggest novel approaches to assess the consequences of these changes on host-microbe interactions to determine the safety of novel sugars and sweeteners.
