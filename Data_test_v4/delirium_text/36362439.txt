36362439|t|Activity-Dependent Neuroprotective Protein (ADNP): An Overview of Its Role in the Eye.
36362439|a|Vision is one of the dominant senses in humans and eye health is essential to ensure a good quality of life. Therefore, there is an urgent necessity to identify effective therapeutic candidates to reverse the progression of different ocular pathologies. Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is a protein involved in the physio-pathological processes of the eye. Noteworthy, is the small peptide derived from ADNP, known as NAP, which shows protective, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. Herein, we review the current state of knowledge concerning the role of ADNP in ocular pathologies, while providing an overview of eye anatomy.
