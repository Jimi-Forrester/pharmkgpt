37448137|a|Aim of this research was to examine the impact of paeoniflorin (Pae) in suppressing the occurrence of ferroptosis in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study utilized APP/PS1 mice with AD as the experimental subjects. Following the administration of Pae, the cognitive behaviors of mice were evaluated and the key indexes of ferroptosis were measured, as well as levels of oxidative stress (OS). For in-vitro experiments, Erastin was adopted for inducing the ferroptosis of PC12 cells, and the level of cell ferroptosis was detected after Pae treatment. Pae improved the cognitive ability of AD mice, reduced the level of ferroptosis, decreased the iron ion and MAD levels in brain tissues, and increased SOD expression. In PC12 cells, Pae suppressed the Erastin-induced ferroptosis, mitigated oxidative damage, and reduced the level of ROS. Based on the findings from our research, it was observed that Pae exhibited a specific binding affinity to P53, leading to the suppression of ferroptosis. This mechanism ultimately resulted in the improvement of nerve injury in mice with AD.
