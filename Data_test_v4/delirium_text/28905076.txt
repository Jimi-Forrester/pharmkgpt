28905076|a|Patients who survive acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) often suffer from long-term physical and psychological sequelae. Lung function is commonly only mildly reduced, whereas general physical activity and walking distance are often compromised. Most markedly, these patients have a high incidence of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The rate of cognitive dysfunction is as high as 70-100% at the time of hospital discharge, and remains 46-80% and 20% one year and five years post discharge, respectively. The possibility of returning to work is markedly limited. Because of these outcomes, preventative strategies must be identified to reduce the high prevalence of physical and psychological morbidity. Prevention and treatment of delirium as well as early and consequent mobilization and intensive care unit diaries are potentially beneficial.
