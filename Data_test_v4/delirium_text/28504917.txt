28504917|t|Modulating 5-HT4 and 5-HT6 receptors in Alzheimer's disease treatment.
28504917|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia affecting millions of patients worldwide which can only be treated with symptomatic drugs. Among the numbers of biological targets which are today explored in order to prevent or limit the progression of AD, the modulation of 5-HT6R and 5-HT4R appeared to be promising. This modulation has been proved to enhance the cognition in AD through modulation of the neurotransmitter system but could also be beneficial in order to limit the amyloid pathology. This review will describe recent advances in the understanding of this modulation as well as the medicinal chemistry of 5-HT6R or 5-HT4R ligands from synthesis to ongoing clinical trials.
