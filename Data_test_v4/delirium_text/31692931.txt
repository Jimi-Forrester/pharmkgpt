31692931|t|A Study in Nucleated Polymerization Models of Protein Aggregation.
31692931|a|The nucleated polymerization model is a mathematical framework that has been applied to aggregation and fragmentation processes in both the discrete and continuous setting. In particular, this model has been the canonical framework for analyzing the dynamics of protein aggregates arising in prion and amyloid diseases such as as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. We present an explicit steady-state solution to the aggregate size distribution governed by the discrete nucleated polymerization equations. Steady-state solutions have been previously obtained under the assumption of continuous aggregate sizes; however, the discrete solution allows for direct computation and parameter inference, as well as facilitates estimates on the accuracy of the continuous approximation.
