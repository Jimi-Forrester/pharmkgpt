36949988|a|Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) occurs when there is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid due to impeded flow or excess production, resulting in gait and memory impairment and urinary incontinence. The authors present the case of a 67-year-old male, who had symptoms for a year prior to being diagnosed. His neurological exam was significant for a slow, and unsteady wide-based gait. No underlying cause for his NPH was found. He underwent a shunt procedure following which he made a complete recovery.
