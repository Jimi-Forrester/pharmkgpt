39800748|t|Cyclin-dependent protein kinases and cell cycle regulation in biology and disease.
39800748|a|Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDKs) are closely connected to the regulation of cell cycle progression, having been first identified as the kinases able to drive cell division. In reality, the human genome contains 20 different CDKs, which can be divided in at least three different sub-family with different functions, mechanisms of regulation, expression patterns and subcellular localization. Most of these kinases play fundamental roles the normal physiology of eucaryotic cells; therefore, their deregulation is associated with the onset and/or progression of multiple human disease including but not limited to neoplastic and neurodegenerative conditions. Here, we describe the functions of CDKs, categorized into the three main functional groups in which they are classified, highlighting the most relevant pathways that drive their expression and functions. We then discuss the potential roles and deregulation of CDKs in human pathologies, with a particular focus on cancer, the human disease in which CDKs have been most extensively studied and explored as therapeutic targets. Finally, we discuss how CDKs inhibitors have become standard therapies in selected human cancers and propose novel ways of investigation to export their targeting from cancer to other relevant chronic diseases. We hope that the effort we made in collecting all available information on both the prominent and lesser-known CDK family members will help in identify and develop novel areas of research to improve the lives of patients affected by debilitating chronic diseases.
