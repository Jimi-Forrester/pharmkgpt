METHODS: 108 ICU patients admitted to our hospital from January 2020 to June 2020 were recruited as the study cohort and randomly divided into a control group and an observation group, with 54 cases in each group. The patients in the control group underwent routine nursing intervention, and the patients in the observation group underwent evidence-based cluster nursing intervention. The incidences of delirium, the durations of the mechanical ventilation, the ICU hospitalization durations, as well as the satisfaction levels in the two groups of patients were compared. RESULT: The incidences of delirium in the observation group were conspicuously lower than they were in the control group (14.81%, 40.74%, X 2 = 9.0462, P = 0.0026). The duration of the delirium in the observation group was conspicuously lower than it was in the control group (2.87 +- 1.28), (5.21 +- 1.33), t = 9.3155, P = 0.0000. The durations of the mechanical ventilation and the ICU hospitalizations in the observation group were conspicuously shorter than they were in the control group. The differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The nursing satisfaction levels in the observation group were conspicuously higher than they were in the control group (94.44%, 72.22%, X 2 = 9.6000, P = 0.0019). There was no significant difference in the in-hospital mortality between the two groups (X2 = 2.1862, 0.1393). CONCLUSION: Evidence-based cluster nursing intervention can conspicuously reduce the incidences of delirium, shorten the durations of the mechanical ventilation and the ICU stays, and improve patient prognosis, so it is worthy of clinical application.
