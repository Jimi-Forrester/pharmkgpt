35211870|a|The increasing longevity of the population has resulted in dementia becoming a leading cause of both death and disability. Dementia is not a single disease. Studies of rare Mendelian disorders have documented that Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia, is associated with a long incubation period from amyloid deposition to neurodegeneration to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. There are three broad hypotheses related to the causes of Alzheimer's dementia: (1) an aging process; (2) brain vascular disease; and (3) metabolic abnormalities associated with either increased production of amyloid-beta or decreased clearance from the brain. Therefore, research on the early stages of the dementia process are of high priority. This paper reports that higher energy intake in both the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study is associated with very early symptoms that lead to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. The results are very interesting but hard to interpret because they also show that higher energy intake is not related to body mass index, a very unusual observation. A likely hypothesis is that there is an association between reporting of dietary intake and subjective symptoms, i.e. reporting bias, accounting for their results.
