10891097|t|A mass spectrometry screening method for antiaggregatory activity of proteins covalently modified by combinatorial library members: application to sickle hemoglobin.
10891097|a|A homogeneous assay, based on electrospray mass spectrometry, is described for identifying compounds in a combinatorial library that covalently modify a protein and thereby enhance its solubility. The technique is based on measuring the distribution of modified proteins in the supernatant versus aggregate. Compounds having the greatest anti-aggregatory activity are those with the highest supernatant/aggregate ratio. Mass is used as a marker to identify which covalent modifier in the library is involved. An exploratory study is presented which demonstrates that the antisickling activity of a family of isothiocyanates, as measured by the standard C(sat) assay, correlates well (r(2) = 0.98) with the mass spectrometry analysis of the supernatant/aggregate distribution. The technique has potential for screening libraries capable of covalently modifying other proteins of clinical interest, e.g., Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and various prion related diseases.
