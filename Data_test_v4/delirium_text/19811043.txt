19811043|t|IM olanzapine in the treatment of agitation and aggression.
19811043|a|Agitation or aggressive behaviors are frequently associated with an acute psychotic episode. Patients experiencing severe auditory hallucinations, paranoia or acute mania are particularly prone to agitation. In the elderly, agitation and aggression are often associated with delirium, dementia or various medical illnesses. Agitated patients urgently require rapid control of symptoms. Traditionally, treatment has included administration of iv. or im. benzodiazepines or neuroleptics. However, each of these is associated with adverse effects that may be serious in nature. An injectable formulation of a novel antipsychotic may effectively treat agitation and aggression while placing the patient at a lower risk for more serious side effects frequently associated with parenteral neuroleptics.
