35299943|t|Mild Cognitive Impairment Subtypes Are Associated With Peculiar Gait Patterns in Parkinson's Disease.
35299943|a|Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is frequent in Parkinson's disease (PD) and represents a risk factor for the development of dementia associated with PD (PDD). Since PDD has been associated with disability, caregiver burden, and an increase in health-related costs, early detection of MCI associated with PD (PD-MCI) and its biomarkers is crucial. Objective: Given that gait is considered a surrogate marker for cognitive decline in PD, the aim of this study was to compare gait patterns in PD-MCI subtypes in order to verify the existence of an association between specific gait features and particular MCI subtypes. Methods: A total of 67 patients with PD were consecutively enrolled and assessed by an extensive clinical and cognitive examination. Based on the neuropsychological examination, patients were diagnosed as patients with MCI (PD-MCI) and without MCI (no-PD-MCI) and categorized in MCI subtypes. All patients were evaluated using a motion capture system of a BTS Bioengineering equipped with six IR digital cameras. Gait of the patients was assessed in the ON-state under three different tasks (a single task and two dual tasks). Statistical analysis included the t-test, the Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc analysis, and the exploratory correlation analysis. Results: Gait pattern was poorer in PD-MCI vs. no-PD-MCI in all tasks. Among PD-MCI subtypes, multiple-domain PD-MCI and amnestic PD-MCI were coupled with worse gait patterns, notably in the dual task. Conclusion: Both the magnitude of cognitive impairment and the presence of memory dysfunction are associated with increased measures of dynamic unbalance, especially in dual-task conditions, likely mirroring the progressive involvement of posterior cortical networks.
