8295656|a|We review current understanding of the clinical and pathologic information needed for the determination of optimal brain tissue samples for the conduct of studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Characteristics that may distinguish AD from other dementing disorders are discussed. Selected considerations in the conduct of basic neurobiological studies are also outlined. Although the 28 NIA-funded Alzheimer's Centers can provide excellent clinical and neuropathological data, studies conducted outside these centers should also strive to gather the information suggested here. Clinical and neuropathological data should be used not only to classify subjects as control or AD, but also as variables that may significantly contribute to the analysis of neurobiological data obtained in the laboratory.
