39993119|a|To analyze the influencing factors of postoperative complications in elderly patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, in order to provide reference for clinical prevention in advance. A total of 280 elderly patients with lumbar spinal stenosis were selected from December 2022 to 2023. The clinical data and postoperative complications were collected from the electronic medical records of the hospital. The clinical characteristics were analyzed, and the risk factors related to surgical complications were analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression model. A total of 46 patients had different degrees of postoperative complications, the incidence of complications was 16.43%. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed: surgical approach (odds ratio [OR]: 1.184, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.046-1.340, P = .007), surgical segments (3 segments or more) (OR: 7.049, 95% CI: 1.592-31.205, P = .010), operation duration (OR: 2.507, 95% CI: 1.078-5.832, P = .033), and age (OR: 2.321, 95% CI: 1.589-3.390, P < .001) were independent risk factors for postoperative complications. In conclusion, surgical approach, surgical segments, operation duration, and age are independent risk factors for postoperative complications in elderly patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. Clinical intervention of these risk factors should be carried out as early as possible to reduce the occurrence of postoperative complications.
