36618525|t|Perioperative Management for Non-Thyroidal Surgery in Thyroid Dysfunction.
36618525|a|Thyroid hormone exerts effects across all organ systems. Hence, patients with thyroid dysfunction are at a risk of numerous complications. The stresses encountered during the perioperative period may exacerbate underlying thyroid disorders, potentially precipitating decompensation, and even death. Thus, it is of the utmost importance for the clinician to comprehend the mechanisms by which thyroid disease may complicate surgery and postoperative recovery and to optimize the status of thyrotoxic and hypothyroid patients. This article describes the adverse effects of thyroid dysfunction in patients undergoing nonthyroid surgery and recommends treatment approaches aimed at appropriate build-up to decrease perioperative risk.
