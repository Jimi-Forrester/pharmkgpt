7666067|a|In acute care setting, patients with cardiovascular disease are at risk for changes in cognition caused by both disease and treatments. Cognitive impairment can result in a number of problems, such as communication difficulties, compromised safety, self-care deficits, and behavioral problems. This article reviews the role of the nurse in cognitive assessment, the incidence of cognitive complications in the cardiovascular patient population, the disorders of delirium and dementia, suggestions for and components of a cognitive assessment, and standardized tools for cognitive assessment.
