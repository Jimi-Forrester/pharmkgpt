35244671|a|OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association of pre-operative and early postoperative inflammatory parameters with postoperative delirium in patients operated on for coronary artery bypass grafting. METHODS: The data of 1 279 cardiac surgery patients operated on between June 2014 and March 2020 were analysed retrospectively. Among these, 777 (61.2%) patients operated on for isolated coronary artery bypass grafting surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled. Two groups were formed. The patients who developed postoperative delirium were placed in group 1 (n = 187) and the patients with uneventful postoperative follow up (n = 590) were enrolled in group 2. RESULTS: Pre- and early postoperative mean platelet volume, C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, platelet- to-lymphocyte ratio and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were elevated in group 1 (p = 0.0001). The APACHE II score and duration of hospital and intensive care unit stay were significantly elevated in group 1 (p < 0.05). An early-stage neurological event was observed in eight patients (4.3%) in group 1 and 12 patients (2%) in group 2, which was not statistically significantly different between the groups (p = 0.09). In-hospital mortality was observed in three patients (1.6%) in group 1 and five patients (0.8%) in group 2, which did not show a statistically significant difference (p > 0.05). In univariate and multivariate regression analysis, the pre-operative platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.013), mean platelet volume (p = 0.0001) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p = 0.002) were determined as independent risk factors for the occurrence of delirium in the early postoperative period. Also, the postoperative platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.0001), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.0001) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p = 0.0001) were determined as independent risk factors for the occurrence of delirium in the early postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS: Pre- and early postoperative inflammatory parameters were observed to be predictors of postoperative delirium in patients operated on for coronary artery bypass grafting.
