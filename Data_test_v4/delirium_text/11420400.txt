11420400|t|Spontaneous and induced chromosome damage in somatic cells of sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease patients.
11420400|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the elderly with a complex etiology due to the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. At least 15% of cases are inherited as an autosomal dominant mutation, but the majority are sporadic. We evaluated cytogenetic alterations, both spontaneous and chemical-induced [aluminium (Al) and griseofulvin (GF)], by means of the micronucleus (MN) test in lymphocytes or skin fibroblasts of 14 patients with sporadic and eight with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), respectively. The spontaneous MN frequencies of sporadic (20.8 +/- 9.2) and familial (20.7 +/- 4.6) AD patients are significantly higher than those of the respective control groups (9.0 +/- 6.8 and 6.7 +/- 3.4). In all AD patients, GF significantly increased the spontaneous MN frequency of somatic cells to a lesser extent (P < 0.05) as compared with the control group. Al treatment did not induce MN in AD patients. The results of the present study indicate that different types of somatic cells from sporadic and familial AD patients show comparable levels of spontaneous cytogenetic anomalies, and MN induction is partially reduced or lacking according to the type of chemical treatments.
