37008050|t|Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2A Plays a Central Role in the Regulatory Networks of Cellular Physiopathology.
37008050|a|Cell regulatory networks are the determinants of cellular homeostasis. Any alteration to these networks results in the disturbance of cellular homeostasis and induces cells towards different fates. Myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) is one of four members of the MEF2 family of transcription factors (MEF2A-D). MEF2A is highly expressed in all tissues and is involved in many cell regulatory networks including growth, differentiation, survival and death. It is also necessary for heart development, myogenesis, neuronal development and differentiation. In addition, many other important functions of MEF2A have been reported. Recent studies have shown that MEF2A can regulate different, and sometimes even mutually exclusive cellular events. How MEF2A regulates opposing cellular life processes is an interesting topic and worthy of further exploration. Here, we reviewed almost all MEF2A research papers published in English and summarized them into three main sections: 1) the association of genetic variants in MEF2A with cardiovascular disease, 2) the physiopathological functions of MEF2A, and 3) the regulation of MEF2A activity and its regulatory targets. In summary, multiple regulatory patterns for MEF2A activity and a variety of co-factors cause its transcriptional activity to switch to different target genes, thereby regulating opposing cell life processes. The association of MEF2A with numerous signaling molecules establishes a central role for MEF2A in the regulatory network of cellular physiopathology.
