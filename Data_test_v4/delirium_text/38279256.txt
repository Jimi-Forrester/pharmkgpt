38279256|a|Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an immune-mediated disorder affecting the peripheral nervous system. Despite the established diagnostic criteria, monitoring disease activity and treatment remains challenging. To address this limitation, we investigated serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) and serum free light chains (sFLCs) as potential biomarkers. A total of 32 CIDP patients undergoing immunoglobulin therapy and 32 healthy controls enrolled in the present study, and agreed to have their blood plasma sNfL and sFLCs analyzed, while CIDP severity was assessed through the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS). In line with the immunoglobulin treatment aimed at limiting neuronal damage administered to the majority of patients, sNfL levels did not exhibit significant differences between the two groups. However, CIDP patients showed significantly elevated sFLC and sFLC ratios, while the marker levels did not correlate with the clinical scores. The study confirms the potential of sFLCs as a sensitive biomarker of inflammatory processes in CIDP. Additionally, the present study results regarding neurofilaments strengthen the role of sNfL in monitoring CIDP treatments, confirming the effectiveness of immunoglobulin therapy. Overall, our results demonstrate how combining these markers can lead to better patient characterization for improved treatment.
