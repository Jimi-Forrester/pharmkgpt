33061569|a|Intestinal flora is an important component in the human body, which have been reported to be involved in the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Indeed, changes in the intestinal flora in CRC patients compared to those in control subjects have been reported. Several bacterial species have been shown to exhibit the pro-inflammatory and pro-carcinogenic properties, which could consequently have an impact on colorectal carcinogenesis. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the potential links between the intestinal microbiota and CRC. We illustrated the mechanisms by which intestinal flora imbalance affects CRC, mainly focusing on inflammation, microbial metabolites, and specific bacteria species. In addition, we discuss how a diet exhibits a strong impact on microbial composition and provides risks for developing CRC. Finally, we describe the potential future directions that are based on intestinal microbiota manipulation for CRC diagnosis and treatment.
