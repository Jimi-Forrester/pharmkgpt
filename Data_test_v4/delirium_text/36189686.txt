36189686|a|Circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) is a potential risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanistic link between CRD and AD is still not fully understood. CRD may lead to intestinal barrier impairment. Several studies in animals and humans suggest a connection between gut microbiota disturbance, intestinal barrier damage and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the effect of CRD on cognition in mice and explored the role of intestinal barrier and inflammatory responses in this process. CRD modulates the composition of gut microbiota, impairs intestinal barrier integrity, and induces both peripheral and central inflammation and cognitive impairment in mice. Rifaximin, a non-absorbable antibiotic which modulates the gut microbial composition and increases intestinal barrier integrity, effectively suppresses inflammatory responses, and rescues cognitive impairment induced by CRD. Furthermore, the impairment in hippocampal neurogenesis, tau hyperphosphorylation, and loss in synaptic proteins in CRD mice is also reversed by Rifaximin. These data identify that the impaired intestinal barrier integrity related to gut microbiota disturbance plays a key role in CRD-induced inflammatory responses and cognitive impairments in mice, and Rifaximin is effective in preventing CRD-induced cognitive deficit through protecting the gut barrier and ameliorating neuroinflammation.
