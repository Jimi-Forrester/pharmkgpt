27276031|a|Folate deficiency is generally accepted as a potential direct or indirect risk factor for diseases including spina bifida, coronary heart diseases, malfunctions of the central nervous system, and cancer. The direct inclusion of folates in the methylation cycle, including the remethylation of homocysteine and regeneration of S-adenosylmethionine, underlines the importance of these vitamins and other components of one-carbon metabolism. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to develop a multiple stable isotope dilution assay (SIDA) for the respective analytes in plasma and tissue samples to allow for a closer look at the interaction between a severe folate deficiency and local folate status, as well as further interactions with circulating S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, and homocysteine. The analytical methods were based on SIDAs coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis using the deuterated folates [2H4]-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, [2H4]-5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid, [2H4]-tetrahydrofolic acid, [2H4]-10-formylfolic acid, and [2H4]-folic acid and the deuterated one-carbon metabolites [2H4]-homocysteine, [2H4]-S-adenosylhomocysteine, and [2H3]-S-adenosylmethionine as internal standards. Three analytical methods have been developed for the analysis of homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, and six folate vitamers. Validation data for the analysis of C1-metabolites in plasma and tissue samples or folate analysis in tissue samples revealed excellent sensitivity, precision, and recovery for all analytes studied. The miniaturized methods using sample volumes as low as 50 muL and weighed portions of 5-25 mg will allow the assessment of the status of folates and additional biomarkers of impaired one-carbon metabolism during folate deficiency.
