39120452|t|Delirium: Where Are We Now?
39120452|a|Delirium has long been recognized within the adult intensive care world, but it is only within the past decade that its presence and prevalence in the context of pediatric intensive care has been studied. There is now a greater understanding of risk factors for delirium, a better selection of methods to recognize it, and treatment specifically directed to pediatric patients. An understanding of delirium is also relevant to pediatricians practicing outside of the intensive care unit, as delirium can present in other care environments, where it remains under-recognized. The purpose of this article is to review pediatric delirium by discussing its pathophysiology, the tools available to screen patients, and current prevention and management approaches.
