We conducted this prospective study to establish the deep learning-based pain classifier based on facial expressions. Methods: We enrolled critically ill patients during 2020-2021 at a tertiary hospital in central Taiwan and recorded video clips with labeled pain scores based on facial expressions, such as relaxed (0), tense (1), and grimacing (2). We established both image- and video-based pain classifiers through using convolutional neural network (CNN) models, such as Resnet34, VGG16, and InceptionV1 and bidirectional long short-term memory networks (BiLSTM). The performance of classifiers in the test dataset was determined by accuracy, sensitivity, and F1-score. Results: A total of 63 participants with 746 video clips were eligible for analysis. The accuracy of using Resnet34 in the polychromous image-based classifier for pain scores 0, 1, 2 was merely 0.5589, and the accuracy of dichotomous pain classifiers between 0 vs. 1/2 and 0 vs. 2 were 0.7668 and 0.8593, respectively. Similar accuracy of image-based pain classifier was found using VGG16 and InceptionV1. The accuracy of the video-based pain classifier to classify 0 vs. 1/2 and 0 vs. 2 was approximately 0.81 and 0.88, respectively. We further tested the performance of established classifiers without reference, mimicking clinical scenarios with a new patient, and found the performance remained high. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates the practical application of deep learning-based automated pain assessment in critically ill patients, and more studies are warranted to validate our findings.
