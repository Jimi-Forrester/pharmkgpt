38314277|a|Ferroptosis is a newly discovered non-apoptotic and iron-dependent type of cell death. Ferroptosis mainly takes place owing to the imbalance of anti-oxidation and oxidation in the body. It is regulated via a number of factors and pathways both inside and outside the cell. Ferroptosis is closely linked with brain and various neurological disorders (NDs). In the human body, the brain contains the highest levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are known as lipid peroxide precursors. In addition, there is also a connection of glutathione depletion and lipid peroxidation with NDs. There is growing evidence regarding the possible link between neuroinflammation and multiple NDs, such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and stroke. Recent studies have demonstrated that disruptions of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutamate excitatory toxicity, iron homeostasis, and various other manifestations linked with ferroptosis can be identified in various neuroinflammation-mediated NDs. It has also been reported that damage-associated molecular pattern molecules including ROS are generated during the events of ferroptosis and can cause glial activation via activating neuroimmune pathways, which subsequently leads to the generation of various inflammatory factors that play a role in various NDs. This review summarizes the regulation pathways of ferroptosis, the link between ferroptosis as well as inflammation in NDs, and the potential of a range of therapeutic agents that can be used to target ferroptosis and inflammation in the treatment of neurological disorders.
