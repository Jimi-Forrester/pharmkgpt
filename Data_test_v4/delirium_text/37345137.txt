37345137|t|The MAL Family of Proteins: Normal Function, Expression in Cancer, and Potential Use as Cancer Biomarkers.
37345137|a|The MAL family of integral membrane proteins consists of MAL, MAL2, MALL, PLLP, CMTM8, MYADM, and MYADML2. The best characterized members are elements of the machinery that controls specialized pathways of membrane traffic and cell signaling. This review aims to help answer the following questions about the MAL-family genes: (i) is their expression regulated in cancer and, if so, how? (ii) What role do they play in cancer? (iii) Might they have biomedical applications? Analysis of large-scale gene expression datasets indicated altered levels of MAL-family transcripts in specific cancer types. A comprehensive literature search provides evidence of MAL-family gene dysregulation and protein function repurposing in cancer. For MAL, and probably for other genes of the family, dysregulation is primarily a consequence of gene methylation, although copy number alterations also contribute to varying degrees. The scrutiny of the two sources of information, datasets and published studies, reveals potential prognostic applications of MAL-family members as cancer biomarkers-for instance, MAL2 in breast cancer, MAL2 and MALL in pancreatic cancer, and MAL and MYADM in lung cancer-and other biomedical uses. The availability of validated antibodies to some MAL-family proteins sanctions their use as cancer biomarkers in routine clinical practice.
