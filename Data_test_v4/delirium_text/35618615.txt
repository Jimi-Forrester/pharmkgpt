35618615|t|Comparison of Intravenous and Inhalational Anesthetic on Postoperative Cognitive Outcomes in Elderly Patients Undergoing Cancer Surgery: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
35618615|a|PURPOSE: Previous studies have documented consistent findings on the long-term cognitive effects such as postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), delirium and delayed recovery among elderly undergoing cancer surgery. This review was conducted to compare the effect of intravenous and inhalational anesthetic on the postoperative cognitive outcomes among elderly patients undergoing cancer surgery. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, PubMed Central, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Cochrane library from inception until May 2021. We carried out a meta-analysis with a random-effects model and reported pooled risk ratio (RR) or standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) depending on the type of outcome. FINDINGS: In total, we analyzed 10 studies including 2,333 participants. Half of the studies had high risk of bias. For the cognitive score, the pooled SMD was -0.87 [95% CI: -3.97 to 2.24] indicating no statistically significant difference between inhalational and intravenous anesthetic. For POCD, the pooled RR was 1.24 (95% CI: 0.83-1.84); for postoperative delirium, the pooled RR was 2.26 (95% CI: 0.79-6.44); for delayed neurocognitive recovery, the pooled RR was 1.49 (95% CI: 1.09-2.03). CONCLUSION: Inhalational anesthetics did not show a significant difference in postoperative cognitive outcomes, except delayed neurocognitive recovery, compared to intravenous anesthetic following cancer surgery.
