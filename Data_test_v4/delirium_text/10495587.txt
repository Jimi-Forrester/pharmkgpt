10495587|a|The Memory and Aging Project Satellite (MAPS) of the Washington University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center was developed to meet the medical, social, and housing needs of minority and medically underserved elders with cognitive impairments. MAPS is located in the offices of the St. Louis Area Agency on Aging (AAA). This program provides multidisciplinary outreach, as well as home-based diagnosis, treatment, and case management. It differs from most other satellite programs in that it seeks to provide service to individuals who do not voluntarily seek help for dementia. Cognitively impaired clients had numerous, unmanaged medical conditions and social problems. Few clients were adequately served by health and social service systems. Despite recent contact, only 10% of clients received a formal diagnosis of dementia from a physician. Treatment was hampered by the absence or limitations of caregivers. Despite the complexities of these cases, the MAPS staff have been generally successful in addressing client problems.
