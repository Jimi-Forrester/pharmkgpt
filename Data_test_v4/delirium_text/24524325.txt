24524325|t|Diels-Alder construction of regiodifferentiated meta-amino phenols and derivatives.
24524325|a|Synthetic access to regiodifferentiated meta-amino phenols is described. The strategy relies upon distinct deprotonation conditions to afford regioisomeric thermodynamic and kinetic dienes that undergo a tandem Diels-Alder and retro-Diels-Alder sequence with assorted acetylenic dienophiles to afford a range of aromatic products.
