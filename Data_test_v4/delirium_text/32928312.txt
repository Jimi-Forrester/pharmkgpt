32928312|a|BACKGROUND: The impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is a representative prediabetes characterized by defective glucose homeostasis, and palmatine (PAL) is a natural isoquinoline alkaloid with multiple pharmacological effects. Our study aims to investigate the therapeutic effect of PAL on the impaired glucose tolerance. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish an IGT model with high fat diet (HFD). Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and further biochemical analysis were conducted to determine the effect of PAL on glucose intolerance in vivo. Molecular details were clarified in a cellular model of IGT induced by Palmitate (PA) on INS-1 cells. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated a relief of IGT with improved insulin resistance in HFD induced rats after PAL treatment. Besides, promoted pancreas islets function was validated with significantly increased beta cell mass after the treatment of PAL. We further found out that PAL could alleviate the beta cell apoptosis that accounts for beta cell mass loss in IGT model. Moreover, MAPK signaling was investigated in vivo and vitro with the discovery that PAL regulated the MAPK signaling by restricting the ERK and JNK cascades. The insulin secretion assay indicated that PAL significantly promoted the defective insulin secretion in PA-induced INS-1 cells via JNK rather than ERK signaling. Furthermore, PAL treatment was determined to significantly suppress beta cell apoptosis in PA-induced cells. We thus thought that PAL promoted the PA-induced impaired insulin release by inhibiting the beta cell apoptosis and JNK signaling in vitro. CONCLUSION: In summary, PAL ameliorates HFD-induced IGT with novel mechanisms.
