32698051|t|Results from the first inpatient alcohol withdrawal management program in Iran: An observational study.
32698051|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The consumption of alcohol is prohibited in Iran; however, concerns regarding alcohol-related harm have led to the development of national policies supporting the establishment of officially endorsed alcohol treatment settings. As a part of these policies, the Iranian Ministry of Health supported the establishment of the first alcohol withdrawal management unit in the psychosomatic unit of Taleghani Hospital in 2015. The purpose of this study is to report on this pilot project. METHODS: This was an observational and descriptive study, conducted on 83 patients with alcohol use disorder based on DSM 5 who were consecutively admitted to the unit for alcohol withdrawal management, from March 2017 to March 2018. The demographic data, alcohol use history, comorbid physical and psychiatric conditions, completion of inpatient treatment, length of hospital stay, and adverse events were extracted from the patients' records using a checklist developed by the authors. RESULTS: 95.2% of the patients were male. The mean age was 45.3 (+-12.2) years. Study participants reported using 38.7 (+-29.6) standard drinks in a drinking day during the last year. Mean length of stay was 9.01 (+-6.8) days. 81.7% of patients completed the inpatient treatment episode. Six patients (7.2%) had a complicated withdrawal (delirium), and no incidents of a withdrawal seizure were reported during the period of this study. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study providing preliminary results on the safety and effectiveness of symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal management in Iran. The clinical and policy level implications of these findings have been discussed.
