2812225|t|NGF and Alzheimer's disease--considerations and caveats.
2812225|a|The proposed use of NGF in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease is based on recent experimental evidence suggesting that NGF is a neurotrophic factor for basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. Although potentially efficacious, the effects of NGF in the setting of Alzheimer's disease have not been determined. A cause for concern is the recently demonstrated effect of NGF on amyloid synthesis raising the possibility that NGF could exacerbate the underlying pathology. Several issues relevant to the design of a clinical trial for NGF in Alzheimer's disease are addressed.
