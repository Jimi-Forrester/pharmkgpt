34511117|t|Enhanced recovery after surgery for hip fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
34511117|a|BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs have achieved promising results in many surgical specialties. However, uncertainty still remains regarding the effect of ERAS on hip fractures. The objective of this review was to investigate the clinical prognosis of ERAS programs in terms of (1) hospital-related endpoints (time to surgery [TTS], length of stay [LOS]), (2) readmission rate, (3) complications, and (4) mortality. METHODS: Published literature was searched in the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. All of the included studies met the inclusion criteria. The primary outcomes were TTS and LOS. The secondary outcomes included the 30-day readmission rate, overall complication rate, specific complication rate (delirium and urinary tract infection), and 30-day and 1-year mortality. Language was restricted to English. The data analysis was carried out by Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS: A total of 7 published studies (9869 patients) were finally included, and these were all cohort studies. The meta-analysis showed that the TTS, LOS, and overall complication rate were significantly reduced in the ERAS group compared with the control group (p < 0.01). Moreover, no significant change was found in the 30-day readmission rate or 30-day and 1-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS: ERAS significantly decreases the TTS, LOS, and complication rate without increasing readmission rate and mortality, which adds to the evidence that the implementation of ERAS is beneficial to patients undergoing hip fracture repair surgeries.
