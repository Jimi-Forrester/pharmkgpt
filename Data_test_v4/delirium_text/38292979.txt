38292979|t|Navigating the Crossroads: Understanding the Link Between Chronic Kidney Disease and Cardiovascular Health.
38292979|a|Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) has emerged as a global healthcare challenge affecting a significant portion of the world's population. This comprehensive narrative review delves into the intricate relationship between CKD and cardiovascular disease (CVD). CKD is characterized by kidney damage persisting for at least three months, often with or without a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It is closely linked with CVD, as individuals with CKD face a high risk of cardiovascular events, making cardiovascular-associated mortality a significant concern in advanced CKD stages. The review emphasizes the importance of precise risk assessment using biomarkers, advanced imaging, and tailored medication strategies to mitigate cardiovascular risks in CKD patients. Lifestyle modifications, early intervention, and patient-centered care are crucial in managing both conditions. Challenges in awareness and recognition of CKD and the need for comprehensive interdisciplinary care are highlighted. Recent advances in research offer promising therapies, such as SGLT2 inhibitors, MRAs, GLP-1R agonists, and selective endothelin receptor antagonists. Stem cell-based therapies, gene editing, and regenerative approaches are under investigation. Patient-physician "risk discussions" and tailored risk assessments are essential for improving patient outcomes. In conclusion, the review underscores the complexity of the interconnected CKD and cardiovascular health domains. Ongoing research, innovative therapies, and personalized healthcare will be instrumental in addressing the challenges, reducing the disease burden, and enhancing well-being for individuals facing CKD and cardiovascular issues. Recognizing the intricate connections between these conditions is imperative for healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers as they seek to improve the quality of care and outcomes for affected individuals.
