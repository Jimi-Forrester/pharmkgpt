32629636|a|A new method of diagnosing fat embolism (FE) at the molecular level was proposed, and the diagnostic value of adipocyte-specific protein fatty acid-binding protein 4 (Homo sapiens [human]) gene ID = 2167 (FABP4) for FE was preliminarily explored. Eight joint replacement patients, 5 internal medicine patients, and 6 healthy persons were recruited. Serum of internal medicine patients, healthy people, and patients before and 24 hours after joint replacement were taken as study samples. Subcutaneous adipose, intra-articular adipose and intramedullary yellow bone marrow of patients undergoing joint replacement were taken as study samples. The level of FABP4 in the above samples was detected by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Normal distribution was tested. Paired sample T test was used for self-control. Univariate analysis of variance was used for multigroup comparison.There was no significant difference in serum FABP4 level between healthy persons, medical patients, and preoperative patients. The FABP4 level in yellow bone marrow and subcutaneous adipose was significantly higher than that in serum of healthy people, medical patients, and preoperative patients. FABP4 level in the serum after joint replacement was significantly higher than that before joint replacement. FABP4 may be a specific indicator of FE diagnosis, but further studies are needed to confirm its clinical value.
