38256958|t|Promising Effects of Montelukast for Critically Ill Asthma Patients via a Reduction in Delirium.
38256958|a|Background: Montelukast (MTK), a potent antagonist of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1, has shown therapeutic promise for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Delirium, a common complication in critically ill patients, lacks effective treatment. This study aims to explore the impact of pre-intensive care unit (ICU) MTK use on in-hospital delirium incidence and, subsequent, prognosis in critically ill patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort study (n = 6344) was conducted using the MIMIC-IV database. After propensity score matching, logistic/Cox regression, E-value sensitivity analysis, and causal mediation analysis were performed to assess associations between pre-ICU MTK exposure and delirium and prognosis in critically ill patients. Results: Pre-ICU MTK use was significantly associated with reduced in-hospital delirium (OR: 0.705; 95% CI 0.497-0.999; p = 0.049) and 90-day mortality (OR: 0.554; 95% CI 0.366-0.840; p = 0.005). The association was more significant in patients without myocardial infarction (OR: 0.856; 95% CI 0.383-0.896; p = 0.014) and could be increased by extending the duration of use. Causal mediation analysis showed that the reduction in delirium partially mediated the association between MTK and 90-day mortality (ACME: -0.053; 95% CI -0.0142 to 0.0002; p = 0.020). Conclusions: In critically ill patients, MTK has shown promising therapeutic benefits by reducing the incidence of delirium and 90-day mortality. This study highlights the potential of MTK, beyond its traditional use in respiratory disease, and may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for delirium.
