17262992|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a gradual and hierarchical decline in cognition that is essentially connected with the functional properties of brain areas with the highest degree of plasticity. Corresponding brain regions are mostly affected by histological determinants of AD. Crucial pathways involved in maintaining the neural plasticity were also shown to be impaired in AD. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) seems to be one of the crucial factors connected with the majority of cognitive and plasticity deficits observed in AD. Recent studies indeed confirm that BDNF is severely disturbed in AD and form an important signaling pathway influencing neural plasticity and neural network status in general. Recently, several behavioral interventions including physical and mental activity or training programs, environmental factors during the early development, and dietary restriction were shown to enhance BDNF levels, neurogenesis, neural cell survival and plasticity and thus improve cognitive properties of the brain. Described behavioral interventions could form a promising approach for AD prevention and treatment programs for prophylactic purposes or in the early stages of AD (Ref 106).
