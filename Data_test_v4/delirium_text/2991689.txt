2991689|a|In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the central nervous system effects of an ACTH4-9 analog, Org2766 (40 mg/day), in Alzheimer's disease were assessed by measuring cerebrospinal fluid parameters during 6 months' treatment. Somatostatin-like immunoreactivity and cholinesterase activity, which are known to be reduced in cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer patients compared with controls, did not change during treatment. As a marker of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems, we measured dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and homovanillic acid, but both levels were static. These results suggest that Org2766 did not interact with the transmitter systems, which are thought to be disturbed in Alzheimer's disease.
