38792524|t|Association between Female Reproductive Factors and Risk of Dementia.
38792524|a|Women have an over 50% greater risk of dementia than men, which is a main topic of much research. This review aims to investigate the impact of a woman's reproductive history on dementia risk. The consequences of stillbirth are long-term health and psychosocial problems for women. Because of the awareness of an endangered pregnancy, many parents experience deep anxiety and stress in subsequent pregnancies. There are contradictory conclusions from research about abortion and the risk of dementia correlation. When it comes to the late age of first birth, which is said to be above 35 years old, it was observed that older mothers have a decreased risk of dementia compared to those who gave birth in their 20s; however, being a child of the older mother is connected with a higher risk of developing dementia. Using hormonal contraception can result in decreased risk of dementia as estrogen stimulates microglia-related Abeta removal and reduces tau hyperphosphorylation. The influence of postmenopausal hormonal therapy and the duration of the reproductive period on developing dementia remains unclear. Although female disorders like endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome are reported to increase the risk of dementia, the research on this topic is very limited, especially when it comes to endometriosis, and needs further investigation. Interestingly, there is no conclusion on whether hypertensive disorders of pregnancy increase the risk of dementia, but most articles seem to confirm this theory.
