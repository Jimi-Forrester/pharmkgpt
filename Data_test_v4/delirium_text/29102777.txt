29102777|a|Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. Methods to study cells of the BBB in vivo would facilitate analyses of neurovascular damage in early AD. Thus, we conducted a pilot study to investigate if brain-derived endothelial cells (BDCECs) could be identified from a cell population of circulating endothelial cells (CECs). Peripheral blood was sampled from early AD patients (n = 9), patients with vascular diseases (myocardial infarction (n = 8) and ischemic stroke (n = 8)), and healthy controls (n = 8). We enumerated CD34+/CD146+/CD45- cells (CECs) and Glucose transporter-1 (Glut1+ CECs (BDCECs)) by flow cytometry. We found that BDCECs formed a separate, aggregate cell population. Glut1 expression on BDCECs, measured by the median fluorescence intensity, was significantly decreased in patients with AD compared to both the healthy controls and patients with myocardial infarction ((p < .05, Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn's post hoc test). We found no significant differences in cell numbers. Our study shows that isolation of BDCECs offers a promising non-invasive tool to investigate cells derived from the BBB. Downregulation of Glut1 at the mild stages of AD suggests that agents that increase Glut1 levels may be therapeutic candidates to improve energy availability to the brain.
