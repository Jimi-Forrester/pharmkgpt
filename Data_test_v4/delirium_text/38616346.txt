38616346|t|Molecular insights into the potential effects of selective estrogen receptor beta agonists in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
38616346|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative disorders. Pathologically, AD and PD are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Hence, they are also called as proteinopathy diseases. Gender is considered as one of the risk factors in both diseases. Estrogens are widely accepted to be neuroprotective in several neurodegenerative disorders. Estrogens can be produced in the central nervous system, where they are called as neurosteroids. Estrogens mediate their neuroprotective action mainly through their actions on estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta). However, ERalpha is mainly involved in the growth and development of the primary and secondary sexual organs in females. Hence, the activation of ERalpha is associated with undesired side effects such as gynecomastia and increase in the risk of breast cancer, thromboembolism, and feminization. Therefore, selective activation of ERbeta is often considered to be safer. In this review, we explore the role of ERbeta in regulating the expression and functions of AD- and PD-associated genes. Additionally, we discuss the association of these genes with the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and alpha-synuclein mediated toxicity. Ultimately, we established a correlation between the importance of ERbeta activation and the process underlying ERbeta's neuroprotective mechanisms in AD and PD.
