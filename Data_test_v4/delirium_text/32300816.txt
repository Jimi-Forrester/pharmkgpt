32300816|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by cognitive deficits but essentially preserved competence in activities of daily living. It is a risk factor for the development of dementia and can reflect a prodromal predementia state of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pathology of AD is defined by cerebral deposition of amyloid-beta-1-42 protein and aggregation of phosphorylated tau protein, which can be identified in vivo by biomarkers for these alterations. As a result of advances in the field of biomarker-based early detection of AD, it is possible to differentiate between MCI patients with and without a pathological AD condition and therefore, between patients with a low and those with a high risk for the development of dementia. At present there are no specific guideline recommendations in Germany for the diagnostic use of biomarkers in predementia detection of AD and for dementia risk assessment in patients with MCI. This article summarizes the current recommendations of a European expert consensus publication and a multidisciplinary working group of the Alzheimer's Association on the clinical application of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for the diagnostics of AD in patients with MCI. If the clinical diagnostic criteria for MCI are fulfilled according to the medical history and neuropsychological testing, it is recommended to carry out further diagnostics (blood test, brain imaging) in order to more precisely define the differential diagnostic classification. Counseling on the potential benefits, limits and risks of biomarker testing for early AD detection and dementia risk prediction should always precede assessment of CSF biomarkers. Information about the individual risk of developing dementia has potential consequences for the psychological well-being and life planning; therefore, clinical follow-up visits are recommended.
