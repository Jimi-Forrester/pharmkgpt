36979749|t|Unexpected Classes of Aquaporin Channels Detected by Transcriptomic Analysis in Human Brain Are Associated with Both Patient Age and Alzheimer's Disease Status.
36979749|a|The altered expression of known brain Aquaporin (AQP) channels 1, 4 and 9 has been correlated with neuropathological AD progression, but possible roles of other AQP classes in neurological disease remain understudied. The levels of transcripts of all thirteen human AQP subtypes were compared in healthy and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains by statistical analyses of microarray RNAseq expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas database. Previously unreported, AQPs 0, 6 and 10, are present in human brains at the transcript level. Three AD-affected brain regions, hippocampus (HIP), parietal cortex (PCx) and temporal cortex (TCx), were assessed in three subgroups: young controls (n = 6, aged 24-57); aged controls (n = 26, aged 78-99); and an AD cohort (n = 12, aged 79-99). A significant positive correlation (p < 10-10) was seen for AQP transcript levels as a function of the subject's age in years. Differential expressions correlated with brain region, age, and AD diagnosis, particularly between the HIP and cortical regions. Interestingly, three classes of AQPs (0, 6 and 8) upregulated in AD compared to young controls are permeable to H2O2. Of these, AQPs 0 and 8 were increased in TCx and AQP6 in HIP, suggesting a role of AQPs in AD-related oxidative stress. The outcomes here are the first to demonstrate that the expression profile of AQP channels in the human brain is more diverse than previously thought, and transcript levels are influenced by both age and AD status. Associations between reactive oxygen stress and neurodegenerative disease risk highlight AQPs 0, 6, 8 and 10 as potential therapeutic targets.
