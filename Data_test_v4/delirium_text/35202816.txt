35202816|t|Examining a role for the retrosplenial cortex in age-related memory impairment.
35202816|a|Aging is often characterized by changes in the ability to form and accurately recall episodic memories, and this is especially evident in neuropsychiatric conditions including Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Memory impairments and cognitive decline associated with aging mirror the impairments observed following damage to the retrosplenial cortex, suggesting that this region might be important for continued cognitive function throughout the lifespan. Here, we review lines of evidence demonstrating that degeneration of the retrosplenial cortex is critically involved in age-related memory impairment and suggest that preservation of function in this region as part of a larger circuit that supports memory maintenance will decrease the deleterious effects of aging on memory processing.
