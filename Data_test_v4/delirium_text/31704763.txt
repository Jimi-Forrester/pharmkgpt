31704763|a|Despite recent setbacks, disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for Alzheimer disease (AD) might become available within a few years. These DMTs are likely to be used in the early stages of AD to avoid the progression to manifest dementia, which implies that a large reservoir of prevalent cases would need to be evaluated when DMTs first become available. Primary care providers (PCPs) would play a vital role in managing the patient flow to specialty care. We review the literature on diagnostic tests that could be used by PCPs and estimate the impact of different testing approaches on demand for specialty care.While many tests have been evaluated, only the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) perform acceptably for detection of early-stage cognitive decline with sensitivities and specificities of 55% to 82% and 72% to 84%, respectively, for the MMSE; and 77% to 96% and 73% to 95%, respectively, for the MoCA. However, neither test is sufficiently specific for the AD pathology and would result in 4 to 5 false positives for each true positive. Blood-based tests for AD biomarkers may soon become available for clinical use. A plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) test has been shown to have a sensitivity of up to 97% and specificity of up to 81%. Adding this test to the MMSE or MoCA could reduce false positives by approximately 80%.These findings suggest a combination of brief cognitive tests and blood-based biomarker tests will allow PCPs to identify patients with potential early stage AD efficiently and triage them for further evaluation.
