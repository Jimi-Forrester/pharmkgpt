39584950|t|Mortality in Newly Admitted Nursing Home Older Adults with Dementia in France: A Post Hoc Analysis from an Observational Study in the Bordeaux Region.
39584950|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: A significant proportion of older adults with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders live in a long-term care facility. This study aimed to determine the time delay between admission and death for older adults with dementia. METHODS: A post hoc analysis was conducted using data from a French observational cohort, identifying older adults with dementia who were admitted to nursing homes. This study assessed median survival times after admission to care facilities by using Kaplan-Meier models and evaluated factors potentially associated with the time until death by using Cox models. RESULTS: A total of 201 individuals were included. The median survival time from admission to a nursing home to death was 39 months. Being male, an older age, and having higher cognitive impairment and comorbidities were associated with decreased survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides survival results for institutionalised older adults with dementia in France and provides elements for the definition of future public policies.
