Estimated intake of vitamin B6, B12, and folate was regressed onto neural network functional connectivity in five resting-state neural networks. Linear mixed models tested coenzyme main effects and interactions with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors. RESULTS: Increased B6 and B12 estimated intake were linked with less functional connectivity in most networks, including the posterior portion of the Default Mode Network. Conversely, higher folate was related to more connectivity in similar networks. AD family history modulated these associations: Increased estimated intake was positively associated with stronger connectivity in the Primary Visual Network and Posterior Default Mode Network in participants with an AD family history. In contrast, increased vitamin B12 estimated intake was associated with less connectivity in the Primary Visual Network and the Cerebello-Thalamo-Cortical Network in those without an AD family history. CONCLUSIONS: The differential patterns of association between B vitamins and resting-state brain activity may be important in understanding AD-related changes in the brain. Notably, AD family history appears to play a key role in modulating these relationships.
