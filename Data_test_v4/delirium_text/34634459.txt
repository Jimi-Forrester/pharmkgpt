34634459|a|Over the years, genetic studies have identified multiple genetic risk variants associated with neurodegenerative disorders and helped reveal new biological pathways and genes of interest. However, genetic risk variants commonly reside in non-coding regions and may regulate distant genes rather than the nearest gene, as well as a gene's interaction partners in biological networks. Systems biology and functional genomics approaches provide the framework to unravel the functional significance of genetic risk variants in disease. In this review, we summarize the genetic and transcriptomic studies of Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies and focus on the advantages of performing systems-level analyses to interrogate the biological pathways underlying neurodegeneration. Finally, we highlight new avenues of multi-omics analysis with single-cell approaches, which provide unparalleled opportunities to systematically explore cellular heterogeneity, and present an example of how to integrate publicly available single-cell datasets. Systems-level analysis has illuminated the function of many disease risk genes, but much work remains to study tauopathies and to understand spatiotemporal gene expression changes of specific cell types.
