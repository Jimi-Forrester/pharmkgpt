38942198|a|Dementia, a prevalent condition in the United States, affecting millions of individuals and their families, underscores the importance of healthy cognitive ageing, which involves maintaining cognitive function and mental wellness as individuals grow older, promoting overall well-being and quality of life. Our original research study investigates the correlation between lifestyle factors and brain atrophy in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as healthy older adults. Conducted over six months in West Texas, the research involved 20 participants aged 62-87. Findings reveal that sleep deprivation in MCI subjects and AD patients correlate with posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampal atrophy and total brain volume, while both groups exhibit age-related hippocampal volume reduction. Notably, fruit/vegetable intake negatively correlates with certain brain regions' volume, emphasizing the importance of diet. Lack of exercise is associated with reduced brain volume and hippocampal atrophy, underlining the cognitive benefits of physical activity. The study underscores lifestyle's significant impact on cognitive health, advocating interventions to promote brain health and disease prevention, particularly in MCI/AD cases. While blood profile data showed no significant results regarding cognitive decline, the study underscores the importance of lifestyle modifications in preserving cognitive function.
