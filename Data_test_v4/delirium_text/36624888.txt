36624888|t|Associations of subjective and objective cognitive functioning after COVID-19: A six-month follow-up of ICU, ward, and home-isolated patients.
36624888|a|Background: Subjective and objective cognitive dysfunction are reported after COVID-19 but with limited data on their congruence and associations with the severity of the acute disease. The aim of this cohort study is to describe the prevalence of subjective and objective cognitive dysfunction at three and six months after COVID-19 and the associations of subjective cognitive symptoms and psychological and disease-related factors. Methods: We assessed a cohort of 184 patients at three and six months after COVID-19: 82 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 53 admitted to regular hospital wards, and 49 isolated at home. A non-COVID control group of 53 individuals was included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Subjective cognitive symptoms, objective cognitive impairment, and depressive and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were assessed. Results: At six months, subjective cognitive impairment was reported by 32.3% of ICU-treated, 37.3% of ward-treated, and 33.3% of home-isolated patients and objective cognitive impairment was observed in 36.1% of ICU-treated, 34.7% of ward-treated, and 8.9% of home-isolated patients. Subjective cognitive symptoms were associated with depressive and PTSD symptoms and female sex, but not with objective cognitive assessment or hospital metrics. Conclusions: One-third of COVID-19 patients, regardless of the acute disease severity, reported high levels of subjective cognitive dysfunction which was not associated with results from objective cognitive screening but with psychological and demographic factors. Our study stresses the importance of thorough assessment of patients reporting long-term subjective symptoms, screening for underlying mental health related factors such as PTSD or depression.
