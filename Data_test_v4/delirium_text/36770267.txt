36770267|t|Electrophoretic Deposition of Co3O4 Particles/Reduced Graphene Oxide Composites for Efficient Non-Enzymatic H2O2 Sensing.
36770267|a|In this work, the facile fabrication of Co3O4 particles/reduced graphene oxide (Co3O4/rGO) composites on Indium tin oxide (ITO) slide was achieved by an electrophoretic deposition and annealing process. The deposition time and ratio of the precursors were optimized. Structural characterization and chemical composition investigation indicated successful loading of Co3O4 particles on graphene sheets. When applied as a non-enzymatic H2O2 sensor, Co3O4/rGO showed significant electrocatalytic activity, with a wide linear range (0.1-19.5 mM) and high sensitivity (0.2247 mA mM-1 cm-2). The good anti-interference ability, reproducibility, and long-term stability of the constructed sensor were also presented. The application of Co3O4/rGO in real sample analysis was evaluated in human urine sample with satisfactory results, indicating the feasibility of the sensor in physiological and medical applications.
