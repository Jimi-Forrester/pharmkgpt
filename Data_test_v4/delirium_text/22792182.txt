22792182|t|Alzheimer's-related peptide amyloid-beta plays a conserved role in angiogenesis.
22792182|a|Alzheimer's disease research has been at an impasse in recent years with lingering questions about the involvement of Amyloid-beta (Abeta). Early versions of the amyloid hypothesis considered Abeta something of an undesirable byproduct of APP processing that wreaks havoc on the human neocortex, yet evolutionary conservation--over three hundred million years--indicates this peptide plays an important biological role in survival and reproductive fitness. Here we describe how Abeta regulates blood vessel branching in tissues as varied as human umbilical vein and zebrafish hindbrain. High physiological concentrations of Abeta monomer induced angiogenesis by a conserved mechanism that blocks gamma-secretase processing of a Notch intermediate, NEXT, and reduces the expression of downstream Notch target genes. Our findings allude to an integration of signaling pathways that utilize gamma-secretase activity, which may have significant implications for our understanding of Alzheimer's pathogenesis vis-a-vis vascular changes that set the stage for ensuing neurodegeneration.
