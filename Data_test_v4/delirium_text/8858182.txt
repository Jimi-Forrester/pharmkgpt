8858182|a|Rapid advances are being made in our understanding of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly those in which specific DNA mutations have been identified. beta-amyloid has been shown to induce free radical formation both directly and via an effect on endothelial function. There is presuasive evidence for cytochrome oxidase dysfunction with oxidative stress and damage in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The confirmation of the complex II inhibitor 3-nitropropionic acid as a toxin model for Huntington's disease, together with the demonstration of reduced mitochondrial function in Huntington's disease caudate, supports the proposition that mutant huntingtin may exert its effect through an abnormality of energy metabolism.
