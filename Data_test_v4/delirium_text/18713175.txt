18713175|t|Clinical practice guidelines for the management of delirium in older people in Australia.
18713175|a|Delirium is a common and serious condition which is often overlooked or misdiagnosed in older people. In 2006, the first set of national clinical practice guidelines for the management of delirium in older people were developed. This paper provides an abbreviated version of the guideline document which includes recommendations for the detection of delirium (diagnosis and screening), assessment and prediction of risk factors for delirium, prevention of delirium and interventions to manage people with delirium. The guidelines reflect the available evidence base and highlight the limited high level research in delirium care, particularly in the areas of symptom management and screening for delirium.
