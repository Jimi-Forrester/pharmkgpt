23143901|a|OBJECTIVES: Long-term chemoprophylaxis using neuraminidase inhibitors may be needed during influenza epidemics but safety data are limited to several weeks. We sought to assess the tolerability of oseltamivir and zanamivir as primary prophylaxis over 16 weeks. METHODS: We conducted a parallel group, double blind, 2 (active drug) :1 (placebo) randomized trial of oral oseltamivir/placebo or inhaled zanamivir/placebo over 16 weeks in healthy, Thai hospital professionals at two Bangkok hospitals. The primary endpoint was study withdrawal due to drug-related (possibly, probably, definitely) serious or adverse events (AEs) graded >= 2. RESULTS: Recruited subjects numbered 129 oseltamivir/65 placebo and 131 zanamivir/65 placebo. A total of 102 grade >= 2 AEs were reported or detected in 69 subjects: 23/129 (17.8%) versus 15/65 (23.1%) (P=0.26), and 23/131 (17.6%) versus 8/65 (12.3%) (P=0.28). Intercurrent infections/fevers [26/102 (25.5%)], abnormal biochemistry [25/102 (24.5%)] and gastrointestinal symptoms [18/102 (17.6%)] were the most frequently reported AEs. There were no drug-related study withdrawals. Eight serious AEs were all due to intercurrent illnesses. Laboratory, lung function and ECG parameters were similar between drugs and placebos. CONCLUSIONS: Oseltamivir and zanamivir were well tolerated in healthy hospital professionals. Both drugs can be recommended for primary influenza prophylaxis for up to 16 weeks.
