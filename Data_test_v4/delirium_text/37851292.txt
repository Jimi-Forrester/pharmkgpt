37851292|t|Five-year stroke prognosis. Influence of post-stroke delirium and post-stroke dementia on mortality and disability (Research Study - Part of the PROPOLIS Study).
37851292|a|INTRODUCTION: With increasing life expectancy and the rising incidence of stroke in young adults, it is important to know the long-term prognosis of this condition. Post-stroke delirium and post-stroke dementia are common complications of stroke that negatively affect prognosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate five-year mortality from stroke and to assess the influence of post-stroke delirium and post-stroke dementia on mortality and disability over the five-year period. METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted to the stroke unit for acute stroke or transient ischemic attacks were screened for in-hospital delirium. At the three- and twelve-month follow-up, the same patients underwent neurocognitive testing. Diagnoses of in-hospital delirium and dementia after three and twelve months based on DSM-5 criteria. Five years after stroke surviving patients were reevaluated. Outcome assessment included place of stay, current functional status assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), or death. RESULTS: At the five-years of follow-up, data were collected from 575 of 750 patients originally included in the study (76.67%). The mortality rate was 51.65%. In-hospital post-stroke delirium and post-stroke dementia diagnosed three and twelve months after stroke were independent risk factors for death and an increase in mRS score of >= 1 or >= 2 points. There was no significant association with institutionalization rate. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of post-stroke patients die within five years of follow-up. Post-stroke delirium and post-stroke dementia are associated with an increased risk of death and disability.
