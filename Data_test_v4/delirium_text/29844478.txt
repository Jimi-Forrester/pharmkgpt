29844478|a|Despite the possible role of impaired cerebral tissue oxygenation in age-related cognition decline, much is still unknown about the changes in brain tissue pO2 with age. Using a detailed investigation of the age-related changes in cerebral tissue oxygenation in the barrel cortex of healthy, awake aged mice, we demonstrate decreased arteriolar and tissue pO2 with age. These changes are exacerbated after middle-age. We further uncovered evidence of the presence of hypoxic micro-pockets in the cortex of awake old mice. Our data suggests that from young to middle-age, a well-regulated capillary oxygen supply maintains the oxygen availability in cerebral tissue, despite decreased tissue pO2 next to arterioles. After middle-age, due to decreased hematocrit, reduced capillary density and higher capillary transit time heterogeneity, the capillary network fails to compensate for larger decreases in arterial pO2. The substantial decrease in brain tissue pO2, and the presence of hypoxic micro-pockets after middle-age are of significant importance, as these factors may be related to cognitive decline in elderly people.
