39250257|t|Caring for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease during a Pandemic: An Integrative Literature Review.
39250257|a|The population experiencing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their caregivers have been tremendously impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Outpatient services became less accessible during the pandemic lockdown which caused increased caregiver burden more than usual. Further examination discovered that caregivers were unable to properly take care of themselves because of the need to provide around-the-clock care to loved ones, who pre-pandemic were able to receive supplemental caregiving services. The purpose of this integrative review was to provide a synthesis of information regarding caregiver experiences, during a time of limited resources, such as with the COVID-19 global pandemic. A comprehensive search of the literature databases Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Medline was completed yielding qualitative and mixed-methods studies. The literature search yielded 14 articles which met the criteria. Three themes emerged during this review. They include: Deprivation of self-care and social connectedness, Fragmented care and resources, and Improved policy development. Multiple gaps in caregiver needs have been identified throughout the literature. Outpatient services, home health aides, and respite care remain necessary elements of care for those with AD and for the relief of the caregiver. Forward planning should include government policies to support caregiving of those with AD, especially in the light of service restrictions or unavailable services.
