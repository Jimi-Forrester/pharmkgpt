30775981|t|Cognitive Reserve in Midlife is not Associated with Amyloid-beta Deposition in Late-Life.
30775981|a|We examined associations between cognitive reserve and late-life amyloid-beta deposition using florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET). We used data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) and ARIC-PET Study. 330 dementia-free participants underwent PET scans. Mean global cortical standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) >1.2 was defined as elevated. Midlife cognition was significantly associated with late-life cognition, but not with late-life elevated SUVR; education was not associated with late-life SUVR, but was strongly associated with late-life cognition. Cognitive reserve may reduce dementia risk by mitigating the impact of Alzheimer's disease pathology on the clinical expression of dementia, rather than by altering its pathogenesis.
