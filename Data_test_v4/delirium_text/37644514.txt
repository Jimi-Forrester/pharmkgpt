37644514|a|BACKGROUND: Aberrant DNA methylation occurs commonly during pathogenesis of neuroimmunological diseases and is of clinical value in various encephalitis subtypes. However, knowledge of the impact of DNA methylation changes on pathogenesis of leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) antibody encephalitis remains limited. METHODS: A total of 44 cytokines and 10 immune checkpoint moleculars (ICMs) in the serum of patients with LGI1 encephalitis and healthy donors (HDs) were measured to evaluate the association of them with clinical parameters. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from LGI1 encephalitis patients and HDs using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and validated for the methylation status by pyrosequencing. MicroRNA profiles were acquired in serum exosome by small RNA sequencing. Targeted cytokines expression was assessed at the presence or absence of miR-2467-5p in PBMCs and the culture media, and the binding of miR-2467-5p and its targeted genes was validated by luciferase assay. RESULTS: There existed significant difference in 22 cytokines/chemokines and 6 ICMs between LGI1 encephalitis patients and HDs. Decreased PDCD1 with increased ICAM1 could predict unfavorable prognosis in one-year follow-up for LGI1 encephalitis patients. Fifteen of cytokines/chemokines and ICMs presented DNA-methylated changes in the promoter and gene body using RRBS in which five were verified as methylation status by pyrosequencing, and the methylation level of CSF3, CCL2, and ICAM1 was conversely associated with their expression in PBMCs. By combining RRBS data with exosome-derived microRNA sequencing, we found that hypomethylated-driven hsa-miR-2467-5p presented elevated expression in serum exosomes and PBMCs in LGI1 encephalitis. Mechanically, miR-2467-5p significantly induced reduced expression of CSF3 and PDCD1 by binding with their 3`UTR while enhanced CCL15 expression, but not significantly correlated with peripheral blood CD19 + B cell proportion of LGI1 encephalitis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provided convincing evidence for DNA methylation changes, microRNA profiles in serum exosome for LGI1 encephalitis, and we also identified several novel cytokines related to clinical features in which some represented epigenetic modification of methylated-driven pattern and microRNA modulation. Our study contributed to develop treatment for epigenetic pathogenesis in LGI1 encephalitis.
