32637737|a|PURPOSE: To present a case of suspected systemic uptake of chlorpromazine after a patient underwent retrobulbar injection for a blind painful eye. OBSERVATIONS: The patient is a 63-year-old Hispanic female who presented to the surgery center with neovascular glaucoma and uncontrolled intraocular pressure of her right eye. Immediately following retrobulbar injection of chlorpromazine, the patient became very sedate and difficult to arouse and blood pressure recordings fell. After 4.5 hours, her symptoms improved, and the patient was discharged. There were no further systemic symptoms reported on follow up. CONCLUSION AND IMPORTANCE: Systemic uptake of chlorpromazine following retrobulbar injection is a risk that should be considered when managing blind painful eyes. Ophthalmologists should practice caution with this technique and educate patients and staff on potential risks.
