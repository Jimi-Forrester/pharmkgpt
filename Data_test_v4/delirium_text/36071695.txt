36071695|t|The emerging multifaceted role of PINK1 in cancer biology.
36071695|a|For its various important functions in cells, phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) has drawn considerable attention for the role it plays in early-onset Parkinson's disease. In recent years, emerging evidence has supported the hypothesis that PINK1 plays a part in regulating many physiological and pathophysiological processes in cancer cells, including cytoplasmic homeostasis, cell survival, and cell death. According to the findings of these studies, PINK1 can function as a tumor promoter or suppressor, showing a duality that is dependent on the context. In this study we review the mechanistic characters relating to PINK1 based on available published data from peer-reviewed articles, The Cancer Genome Atlas data mining, and cell-based assays. This mini review focuses on some of the interplays between PINK1 and the context and recent developments in the field, including its growing involvement in mitophagy and its nonmitophagy organelles-related function. This review aims to help readers better grasp how PINK1 is functioning in cell physiological and pathophysiological processes, especially in cancer biology.
