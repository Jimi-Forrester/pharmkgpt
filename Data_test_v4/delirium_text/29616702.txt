29616702|t|Identifying Better Outcome Measures to Improve Treatment of Agitation in Dementia: A Report from the EU/US/CTAD Task Force.
29616702|a|For the second time in the past 3 years, the EU-US CTAD Task Force addressed challenges related to designing clinical trials for agitation in dementia, which is one of the most disruptive aspects of the condition for both patients and caregivers. Six recommendations emerged from the Task Force meeting: 1 - Operationalizing agitation criteria established by the IPA; 2 - Combining clinician- and caregiver-derived outcomes as primary outcome measures; 3 - Using global ratings to define clinically meaningful effects and power studies; 4 - Improving the accuracy of caregiver reports by better training and education of caregivers; 5 - Employing emerging technologies to collect near real-time behavioral data; and 6 - Utilizing innovative trial designs and increasing the use of biomarkers to maximize the productivity of clinical trials for neuropsychiatric symptoms.
