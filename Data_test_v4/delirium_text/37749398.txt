37749398|a|OBJECTIVE: High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique used to improve cognitive deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of HF-rTMS in improving global cognitive function rehabilitation in elderly patients with mild to moderate AD. METHODS: A detailed literature search of publications using ten databases (Chinese: Wanfang, VIP Periodical, SinoMed, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure; English: PubMed, Embase, OVID, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and EBSCOhost) was performed to identify English and Chinese language articles published up to December 2022. We only included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluate the effect of HF-rTMS on elderly patients with mild to moderate AD. The retrieved studies were carefully reviewed, extracted data, and assessed quality. RESULTS: Seventeen studies, including 1161 elderly patients with mild to moderate AD, were included in this meta-analysis. Compared to the control group, HF-rTMS could increase MMSE (mean difference [MD] = 3.64; 95%CI 1.86-5.42; P < 0.0001), MoCA (MD = 3.69; 95%CI 1.84-5.54; P < 0.0001), P300 amplitude (MD = 1.09; 95%CI 0.45-1.72; P = 0.0008), and total effective rate scores (MD = 3.64; 95% CI 2.14-6.18; P < 0.00001) while decreasing ADAS-Cog (MD =  - 3.53; 95%CI - 4.91- - 2.15; P < 0.00001) and P300 latency scores (MD =  - 38.32; 95%CI - 72.40- - 4.24; P = 0.03). Our study showed that HF-rTMS could improve the global cognitive function of elderly patients with mild to moderate AD. CONCLUSION: HF-rTMS can improve global cognitive function in elderly patients with mild to moderate AD, which is an effective and safe rehabilitation treatment tool for AD patients.
