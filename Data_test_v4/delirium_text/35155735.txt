35155735|a|INTRODUCTION: Slower mobility is associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. We examined the interaction of endurance with gait speed on prevalent MCI and dementia. METHODS: Cross-sectional multinomial regression in the ARIC cohort (n = 2844 participants; 71 to 94 years; 44% men; 18% Black persons) with cognitive status (normal/MCI/dementia), 4 m gait speed, and endurance (2 minute walk [2MW]). RESULTS: Faster gait speed (up to but not above 1 m/s) and better 2MW were separately associated with lower dementia risk. Good performance in both (2MW = 200 m, gait speed = 1.2 m/s) was associated with 99% lower dementia (Relative Prevalence Ratio [RPR] = 0.01 [95% CI: 0.0 to 0.06]) and 73% lower MCI, RPR = 0.27 (0.15 to 0.48) compared to poor performance in both (2MW = 100 m, gait speed = 0.8 m/s). Models incorporating a gait speed-by-2MW interaction term outperformed gait speed-only models (P < .001). DISCUSSION: Gait speed relationships with dementia diminish at faster gait speeds. Combining endurance with gait speed may yield more sensitive markers of MCI and dementia than gait speed alone.
