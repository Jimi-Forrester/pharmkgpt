15686958|a|Accumulation of mitochondrial defects is hypothesised to play a role in the complex pathophysiology of the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease (SAD). Changes in expression of mtDNA encoded genes have been reported in SAD. However no conclusive results were obtained by using different methodologies and analysing distinct transcripts in a variety of brain areas. Here, we measured the expression of five mitochondrial-encoded genes in three brain areas and in lymphocytes from patients and controls by performing reverse transcription followed by quantitative real-time PCR. The analysis of gene expression was also performed by carrying out classic dot-blot experiments to evaluate the two techniques. SAD and control samples showed similar gene expression levels. Estimation of the transcription rate was also measured. No differences were observed when comparing patients and controls. Selective differences in transcription rates were observed only when samples were pooled by tissue, lymphocytes being the tissue with the highest rates.
