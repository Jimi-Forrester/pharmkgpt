30851736|t|Relative cerebral hyperperfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with risk for postoperative delirium: a cross-sectional cohort study.
30851736|a|BACKGROUND: Our objective was to evaluate if changes in on-pump cerebral blood flow, relative to the pre-bypass baseline, are associated with the risk for postoperative delirium (POD) following cardiac surgery. METHODS: In 47 consecutive adult patients, right middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAV) was assessed using transcranial Doppler sonography. Individual values, measured during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), were normalized to the pre-bypass baseline value and termed MCAVrel. An MCAVrel > 100% was defined as cerebral hyperperfusion. Prevalence of POD was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of POD was 27%. In the subgroup without POD, 32% of patients had experienced relative cerebral hyperperfusion during CPB, compared to 67% in the subgroup with POD (p < 0.05). The mean averaged MCAVrel was 90 (+-21) % in the no-POD group vs. 112 (+-32) % in the POD group (p < 0.05), and patients developing delirium experienced cerebral hyperperfusion during CPB for about 39 (+-35) min, compared to 6 (+-11) min in the group without POD (p < 0.001). In a subcohort with pre-bypass baseline MCAV (MCAVbas) below the median MCAVbas of the whole cohort, prevalence of POD was 17% when MCAVrel during CPB was kept below 100%, but increased to 53% when these patients actually experienced relative cerebral hyperperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a critical role for cerebral hyperperfusion in the pathogenesis of POD following on-pump open-heart surgery, recommending a more individualized hemodynamic management, especially in the population at risk.
