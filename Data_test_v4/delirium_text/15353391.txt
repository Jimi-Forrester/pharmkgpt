15353391|a|OBJECTIVE: Anemia is common in developing countries, where populations are aging rapidly. The authors explored the cross-sectional relationship between hemoglobin concentration and Alzheimer disease (AD) in a rural elderly sample in Ballabgarh, India. METHODS: A clinical diagnostic evaluation for dementia and a hemoglobin estimation were performed in 605 persons selected by screening a larger community-based sample age 55+ years. Twenty-six participants met criteria for AD. RESULTS: Hemoglobin was inversely associated with AD after adjustment for age, sex, and literacy. CONCLUSION: Low hemoglobin is associated with AD and should be investigated further as a modifiable risk factor.
