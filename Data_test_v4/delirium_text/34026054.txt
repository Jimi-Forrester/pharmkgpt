34026054|a|The health benefits and promising medical treatment potential of total flavonoids from Eupatorium lindleyanum DC. (TFELDC) have been recognized. The process parameters of extracting total flavonoids from Eupatorium lindleyanum DC. by ultrasonic-microwave synergistic extraction (UMSE) were optimized, and they were purified by AB-8 macroporous resin in the current study. In addition, the antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities of the purified TFELDC (PTFELDC) were evaluated. The results showed that the optimal parameters of UMSE were as follows: ethanol volume fraction 71.5%, L/S ratio 12.2 ml/g, microwave power 318 W, and extraction time 143 s. After TFELDC were purified by AB-8 macroporous resin, the total flavonoid contents of PTFELDC increased from 208.18 +- 1.60 to 511.19 +- 3.21 mg RE/g FDS. Compared with TFELDC, the content of total flavonoids in PTFELDC was increased by 2.46 times. The antioxidant activities of PTFELDC were assessed using DPPH radical, superoxide anion radical, reducing power, and ferric reducing antioxidant power assays, and the IC50 values were found to be 37.13, 19.62, 81.22, and 24.72 mug/ml, respectively. The enzyme inhibitory activities of PTFELDC were measured using lipase, alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and acetylcholinesterase assays with the IC50 values 1.38, 2.08, 1.63, and 0.58 mg/ml, respectively. By comparing with their positive controls, it was found that PTFELDC had good antioxidant activities, and lipase, alpha-amylase, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities, However, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity was relatively weaker. These results suggested that PTFELDC have a promising potential as natural antioxidant, antilipidemic, and hypoglycemic drugs used in functional foods or pharmaceuticals.
