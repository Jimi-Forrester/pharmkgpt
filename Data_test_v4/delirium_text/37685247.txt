37685247|t|Effects of Fermentation on Bioactivity and the Composition of Polyphenols Contained in Polyphenol-Rich Foods: A Review.
37685247|a|Polyphenols, as common components with various functional activities in plants, have become a research hotspot. However, researchers have found that the bioavailability and bioactivity of plant polyphenols is generally low because they are usually in the form of tannins, anthocyanins and glycosides. Polyphenol-rich fermented foods (PFFs) are reported to have better bioavailability and bioactivity than polyphenol-rich foods, because polyphenols are used as substrates during food fermentation and are hydrolyzed into smaller phenolic compounds (such as quercetin, kaempferol, gallic acid, ellagic acid, etc.) with higher bioactivity and bioavailability by polyphenol-associated enzymes (PAEs, e.g., tannases, esterases, phenolic acid decarboxylases and glycosidases). Biotransformation pathways of different polyphenols by PAEs secreted by different microorganisms are different. Meanwhile, polyphenols could also promote the growth of beneficial bacteria during the fermentation process while inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, during the fermentation of PFFs, there must be an interactive relationship between polyphenols and microorganisms. The present study is an integration and analysis of the interaction mechanism between PFFs and microorganisms and is systematically elaborated. The present study will provide some new insights to explore the bioavailability and bioactivity of polyphenol-rich foods and greater exploitation of the availability of functional components (such as polyphenols) in plant-derived foods.
