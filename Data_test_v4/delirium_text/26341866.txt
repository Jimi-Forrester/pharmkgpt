26341866|a|OBJECTIVE: Genetic disorders enter the differential diagnosis of common neurologic diseases, but their overall prevalence is not known. We set out to determine their minimum prevalence. METHODS: Meta-analysis of epidemiologic data gathered from the same geographic region in the North of England. RESULTS: Monogenic neurologic disorders affect at least 90.9/100,000 (95% confidence interval 87.6-94.3), or 1 in 1,100 of the population in Northern England. CONCLUSION: As a group, neurogenetic disorders are not rare. These findings have implications for clinical service delivery.
