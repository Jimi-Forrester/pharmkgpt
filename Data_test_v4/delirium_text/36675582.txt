36675582|a|Psychotic episodes represent one of the most complex manifestations of various mental illnesses, and these encompass a wide variety of clinical manifestations that together lead to high morbidity in the general population. Various mental illnesses are associated with psychotic episodes; in addition, although their incidence and prevalence rates have been widely described in the general population, their correct identification and treatment is a challenge for health professionals in relation to pregnancy. In pregnant women, psychotic episodes can be the consequence of the manifestation of a previous psychiatric illness or may begin during the pregnancy itself, placing not only the mother, but also the fetus at risk during the psychotic episode. In addition, we cannot forget that both pharmacological and nonpharmacological management are complex given the different teratogenic effects of various neuroleptic drugs or mood stabilizers; moreover, the recommendation is that patients should be followed together with different specialists to maintain close contact during puerperium given the high incidence of recurrence of psychotic episodes. In addition, we cannot forget that a large portion of these patients for whom the onset times of such episodes are during pregnancy have a greater probability of an unpredictable psychiatric illness that requires a postpartum follow up, in addition to the postpartum psychotic episodes, at some point in their lives. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize the epidemiology of psychotic breaks during pregnancy related to the main mental illnesses that affect this population and to summarize the main pharmacological treatments available for their clinical management.
