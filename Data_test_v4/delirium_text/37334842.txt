37334842|a|There are many cellular mechanisms implicated in the initiation and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. However, age and the accumulation of unwanted cellular products are a common theme underlying many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Niemann-Pick type C. Autophagy has been studied extensively in these diseases and various genetic risk factors have implicated disruption in autophagy homoeostasis as a major pathogenic mechanism. Autophagy is essential in the maintenance of neuronal homeostasis, as their postmitotic nature makes them particularly susceptible to the damage caused by accumulation of defective or misfolded proteins, disease-prone aggregates, and damaged organelles. Recently, autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER-phagy) has been identified as a novel cellular mechanism for regulating ER morphology and response to cellular stress. As neurodegenerative diseases are generally precipitated by cellular stressors such as protein accumulation and environmental toxin exposure the role of ER-phagy has begun to be investigated. In this review we discuss the current research in ER-phagy and its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases.
