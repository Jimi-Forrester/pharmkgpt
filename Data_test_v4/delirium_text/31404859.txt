31404859|a|The discovery and development of multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) is a promising strategy to find new therapeutic solutions for neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), in particular for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently approved drugs for the clinical management of AD are based on a single-target strategy and focus on restoring neurotransmitter homeostasis. Finding disease-modifying therapies AD and other NDs remains an urgent unmet clinical need. The growing consensus that AD is a multifactorial disease, with several interconnected and deregulated pathological pathways, boosted an intensive research in the design of MTDLs. Due to this scientific boom, the knowledge behind the development of MTDLs remains diffuse and lacks balanced guidelines. To rationalize the large amount of data obtained in this field, we herein revise the progress made over the last 5 years on the development of MTDLs inspired by drugs approved for AD. Due to their putative therapeutic benefit in AD, MTDLs based on MAO-B inhibitors will also be discussed in this review.
