11029577|a|One of the major clinical features of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques that are associated with glycosaminoglycan-containing proteoglycans. It has been proposed that proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans facilitate amyloid fibril formation and/or stabilize these aggregates. Characterization of proteoglycan-protein interactions has suggested that basic amino acids in a specific conformation are necessary for glycosaminoglycan binding. Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has a cluster of basic amino acids at the N-terminus (residues 13-16, His-His-Gln-Lys), which are considered critical for glycosaminoglycan interactions. To understand the molecular recognition of glycosaminoglycans by Abeta, we have examined a series of synthetic peptides with systematic alanine substitutions. These include: His13-->Ala, His14-->Ala, Lys16-->Ala, His13His14Lys16-->Ala and Arg5His6-->Ala. Alanine substitutions result in differences in both the secondary and fibrous structure of Abeta1-28 as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The results demonstrate that the His-His-Gln-Lys region of Abeta, and in particular His13, is an important structural domain, as Ala substitution produces a dysfunctional folding mutant. Interaction of the substituted peptides with heparin and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans demonstrate that although electrostatic interactions contribute to binding, nonionic interactions such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals packing play a role in glycosaminoglycan-induced Abeta folding and aggregation.
