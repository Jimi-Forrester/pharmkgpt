Studies examining serum levels of C-reactive protein in relation to dementia yielded conflicting results. Since serum levels of C-reactive protein are partly determined by genetic factors, we examined the association between genetic variation in the C-reactive protein gene with dementia and AD. METHODS: This study was performed in the Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective cohort study among elderly. Polymorphisms in the C-reactive protein gene (1184C>T, 2042C>T and 2911C>G) tagging the common haplotypes were genotyped and haplotypes were constructed. During follow-up (mean 9.2 years) 607 dementia cases were identified. We estimated the association between polymorphisms and haplotypes with dementia and AD with Cox' proportional hazard models. RESULTS: The T allele of the C-reactive protein 2042C>T polymorphism, related to lower serum levels of C-reactive protein, was associated with a lower risk of dementia and AD. This association was strongest in APOE epsilon4 allele carriers. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that C-reactive protein plays a role in development of dementia.
