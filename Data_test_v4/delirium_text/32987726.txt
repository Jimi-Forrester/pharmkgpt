32987726|t|Behavioral Factors Related to the Incidence of Frailty in Older Adults.
32987726|a|Frailty is a widely prevalent geriatric condition whereby individuals experience age-related functional declines. This study aimed to identify behavioral factors related to the incidence of frailty in older adults. Participants were 2631 older adults (average age: 71) without physical frailty at a baseline assessment in 2011-2012 who took part in a second-wave assessment in 2015-2016. Physical frailty was defined as having limitations in at least three of the following domains: weight loss, low physical activity, exhaustion, slow walking speed, and muscle weakness. Participants completed a 16-item questionnaire examining cognitive, social, and productive activity as well as instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) as varying dimensions of lifestyle activity. During the follow-up period, 172 participants (6.5%) converted from nonfrail to frail. Logistic regression showed that the odds ratios (ORs) for conversion were significantly lower in the participants who had high IADL scores (OR: 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64-0.96), cognitive activity (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.62-0.89), social activity (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.43-0.63), and total activity (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.75-0.87). There was no significant association between frailty and productive activity. Health care providers should recommend an active lifestyle to prevent frailty in older adults.
