36445634|t|The Key Drivers of Brain Injury by Systemic Inflammatory Responses after Sepsis: Microglia and Neuroinflammation.
36445634|a|Sepsis is a leading cause of intensive care unit admission and death worldwide. Most surviving patients show acute or chronic mental disorders, which are known as sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Although accumulating studies in the past two decades focused on the pathogenesis of SAE, a systematic review of retrospective studies which exclusively focuses on the inflammatory mechanisms of SAE has been lacking yet. This review summarizes the recent advance in the field of neuroinflammation and sheds light on the activation of microglia in SAE. Activation of microglia predominates neuroinflammation. As the gene expression profile changes, microglia show heterogeneous characterizations throughout all stages of SAE. Here, we summarize the systemic inflammation following sepsis and also the relationship of microglial diversity and neuroinflammation. Moreover, a collection of neuroinflammation-related dysfunction has also been reviewed to illustrate the possible mechanisms for SAE. In addition, promising pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies, especially those which target neuroinflammation or microglia, are also concluded in the final part of this review. Collectively, clarification of the vital relationship between neuroinflammation and SAE-related mental disorders would significantly improve our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in SAE and therefore provide potential targets for therapies of SAE aimed at inhibiting neuroinflammation.
