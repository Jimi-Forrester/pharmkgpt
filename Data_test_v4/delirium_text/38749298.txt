38749298|t|Toxoplasma gondii infection positively associated with schizophrenia: Evidences from UK Biobank cohort and case-controlled studies.
38749298|a|Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an opportunistic pathogen affecting about 1/3 of world population. While often asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals, it can lead to severe toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients. Recent research has unveiled a potential link between T. gondii infection and neuropsychiatric diseases. We implemented both a cohort study and a case control study to further identify this association. In the cohort study, we analyzed data from the UK Biobank database, which included 8814 individuals tested for T. gondii SAG1 antibodies and free of neuropsychiatric disorders at baseline. Among them, 22.52% (n = 1985) tested positive for SAG1 antibody. Over an average follow-up period of 12.26 years, Cox proportional hazards models and logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between the SAG1 seropositivity at baseline and the incidence of schizophrenia (HR: 5.89; 95% CI: 1.69-20.53). In our case-control study, 239 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 455 healthy individuals were involved. Using the modified agglutination test (MAT) to detect T. gondii antibodies, logistic regression analysis showed a higher prevalence of T. gondii infection among schizophrenia patients (10.04%) compared to healthy controls (3.74%). T. gondii infection emerged as a significant risk factor for schizophrenia (OR: 3.33; 95% CI: 1.68-6.61). However, our investigations did not reveal a robust association between T. gondii infection and other neuropsychiatric conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, dementia, anxiety, depression, neurodegenerative disorders, and peripheral neurological disorders such as neurological and plexus disorders.
