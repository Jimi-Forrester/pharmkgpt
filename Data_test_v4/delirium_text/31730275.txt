31730275|t|MiR-485-3p modulates neural stem cell differentiation and proliferation via regulating TRIP6 expression.
31730275|a|Recent references have showed crucial roles of several miRNAs in neural stem cell differentiation and proliferation. However, the expression and role of miR-485-3p remains unknown. In our reference, we indicated that miR-485-3p expression was down-regulated during NSCs differentiation to neural and astrocytes cell. In addition, the TRIP6 expression was up-regulated during NSCs differentiation to neural and astrocytes cell. We carried out the dual-luciferase reporter and found that overexpression of miR-485-3p decreased the luciferase activity of pmirGLO-TRIP6-wt but not the pmirGLO-TRIP6-mut. Ectopic expression of miR-485-3p decreased the expression of TRIP6 in NSC. Ectopic miR-485-3p expression suppressed the cell growth of NSCs and inhibited nestin expression of NSCs. Moreover, elevated expression of miR-485-3p decreased the ki-67 and cyclin D1 expression in NSCs. Furthermore, we indicated that miR-485-3p reduced proliferation and induced differentiation of NSCs via targeting TRIP6 expression. These data suggested that a crucial role of miR-485-3p in self-proliferation and differentiation of NSCs. Thus, altering miR-485-3p and TRIP6 modulation may be one promising therapy for treating with neurodegenerative and neurogenesis diseases.
