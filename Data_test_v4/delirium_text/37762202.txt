37762202|a|The aim of the present study was to examine the association between miRNA levels in extracellular vesicles (EVs) from serum and the severity of Major Depression (MD). Patient sera from 16 MD cases were collected at our university hospital. The miRNAs contained in EVs were extracted using a nanofiltration method, and their expression levels were analyzed using miRNA microarrays. Intergroup comparisons were performed to validate the diagnostic performance of miRNAs in EVs. Furthermore, candidate miRNAs in EVs were added to neural progenitor cells, astrocytes, and microglial cells in vitro, and the predicted target genes of the candidate miRNAs were extracted. The predicted target genes underwent enrichment analysis. The expression levels of hsa-miR-6813-3p and hsa-miR-2277-3p were significantly downregulated with increasing depression severity of MD. The pathway enrichment analysis suggests that hsa-miR-6813-3p may be involved in glucocorticoid receptor and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor signaling. Additionally, hsa-miR-2277-3p was found to be involved in the dopaminergic neural pathway. The analysis of serum miRNAs in EVs suggests that hsa-miR-6813-3p and hsa-miR-2277-3p could serve as novel biomarkers for MD, reflecting its severity. Moreover, these miRNAs in EVs could help understand MD pathophysiology.
