32466196|a|Background: Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease. It is still not known which of the risk factors have the greatest impact on osteoporosis development. The study aimed to determine how the selected osteoporosis risk factors contribute to the development of the disease and to assess the risk of osteoporotic fractures in older women. Methods: A cohort of 99 older females was divided into two groups (with and without osteoporosis). The risk of osteoporosis was determined using assessment forms and bone densitometry data subjected to logistic regression. The risk of osteoporotic fractures was assessed by the FRAX tool (FRAX, Center for Metabolic Bone Diseases, University of Sheffield, UK). Results: The logistic regression analysis showed that the highest risk of developing osteoporosis associated with lifestyle, mainly cigarette smoking (odds ratio: OR = 2.12), past gynecological operations (OR = 1.46), corticosteroid therapies (OR = 1.38). More than half of participants were at a medium risk of femoral neck fractures (over 90% in the osteoporotic group). Conclusion: Most of the Polish women living in care facilities are at medium risk of low-energy fractures. Smoking appeared to have the strongest effect on osteoporosis among analyzed risk factors. The results may contribute to the creation of more appropriate prevention strategies.
