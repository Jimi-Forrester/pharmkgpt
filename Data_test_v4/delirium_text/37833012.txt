37833012|a|Nicotine abuse is frequent worldwide leading to about 8 millions people die every year due to tobacco related diseases. Military personnel often use nicotine smoking that is about 12.8% higher than civilian populations. Nicotine smoking triggers oxidative stress and are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Nicotine neurotoxicity induces significant depression and oxidative stress in the brain leading to neurovascular damages and brain pathology. Thus, details of nicotine neurotoxicity and factors influencing them require additional investigations. In this review, effects of engineered nanoparticles from metals Ag and Cu (50-60 nm) on nicotine neurotoxicity are discussed with regard to nicotine smoking. Military personnel often work in the environment where chances of nanoparticles exposure are quite common. In our earlier studies, we have shown that nanoparticles alone induces breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and exacerbates brain pathology in animal models. In present investigation, nicotine exposure in with Ag or Cu nanoparticles intoxicated group exacerbated BBB breakdown, induce oxidative stress and aggravate brain pathology. Treatment with nanowired H-290/51 a potent chain-breaking antioxidant together with nanowired ondansetron, a potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist significantly reduced oxidative stress, BBB breakdown and brain pathology in nicotine exposure associated with Ag or Cu nanoparticles intoxication. The functional significance of this findings and possible mechanisms of nicotine neurotoxicity are discussed based on current literature.
