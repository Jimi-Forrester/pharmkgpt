25134358|a|In this paper the concept of homeostenosis (progressive reduction of ability to adapt producing loss of effectiveness) of the immune system is presented as a cause of the system ageing. In particular, the progression of immune system homeostenosis was shown to be associated with previous or ongoing chronic inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and Alzheimer's disease.
