38254591|a|Using clarifying agents is essential in the production of fruit juice. This study utilized gelatin and bentonite as clarifying agents to improve the quality and shelf-life of Indian gooseberry juice (IGBJ). Different treatments were prepared using varying levels of gelatin and bentonite alone or in combination (1.5-2 mg/mL and 1-2 mg/mL, respectively). The untreated IGBJ was used as a control. The results showed the combined treatment of 1.5 mg/mL gelatin and 1 mg/mL bentonite significantly (p <= 0.05) improved the transmittance,  E value, total acidity, vitamin C, and antioxidant activity of the IGBJ sample. During storage for 49 days at 4  C, the quality changes in the IGBJ were minimal with the use of 1.5 mg/mL gelatin and 1 mg/mL bentonite compared to the control (p > 0.05). The treated samples showed no signs of spoilage bacteria, yeast, or mold during cold storage. The combined use of gelatin and bentonite (1.5 mg/mL gelatin and 1 mg/mL bentonite) was found to effectively preserve the sensory quality, bioactivity, and color properties of IGBJ, thereby extending its shelf-life. Thus, gelatin and bentonite can be used as preferred filtering aids for quality and shelf-life extension in the food industry, as they have synergistic effects.
