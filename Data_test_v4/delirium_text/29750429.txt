29750429|t|Computer-aided diagnosis with radiogenomics: analysis of the relationship between genotype and morphological changes of the brain magnetic resonance images.
29750429|a|In the post-genome era, a novel research field, 'radiomics' has been developed to offer a new viewpoint for the use of genotypes in radiology and medicine research which have traditionally focused on the analysis of imaging phenotypes. The present study analyzed brain morphological changes related to the individual's genotype. Our data consisted of magnetic resonance (MR) images of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as their apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes. First, statistical parametric mapping (SPM) 12 was used for three-dimensional anatomical standardization of the brain MR images. A total of 30 normal images were used to create a standard normal brain image. Z-score maps were generated to identify the differences between an abnormal image and the standard normal brain. Our experimental results revealed that cerebral atrophies, depending on genotypes, can occur in different locations and that morphological changes may differ between MCI and AD. Using a classifier to characterize cerebral atrophies related to an individual's genotype, we developed a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme to identify the disease. For the early detection of cerebral diseases, a screening system using MR images, called Brain Check-up, is widely performed in Japan. Therefore, our proposed CAD scheme would be used in Brain Check-up.
