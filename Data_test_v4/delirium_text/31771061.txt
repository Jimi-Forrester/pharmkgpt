31771061|a|The course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) varies between individuals, and the relationship between cognitive and functional decline and the deterioration of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) is still poorly understood. Until recently, it was challenging to monitor subsequent changes in these symptoms because there was no single composite scale available that could simultaneously evaluate activities of daily living (ADL), BPSD, and cognitive function (CF) states. The present authors developed a new, brief assessment scale, the "ABC Dementia Scale" (ABC-DS), which is based on item response theory and facilitates concurrent measurement of ADL, BPSD, and CF states. We previously presented the reliability, construct validity, concurrent validity, and responsiveness of the ABC-DS. We obtained the evidence through three clinical trials featuring 1,400 subjects in total. In the present study, we performed a secondary analysis of the data obtained in the previous study. We conducted hierarchical cluster analyses that allowed us to classify 197 AD patients in terms of similarities regarding ADL, BPSD, and CF domain scores, as measured by the ABC-DS. Consequently, the scale identified subgroups of patients with global clinical dementia ratings of 1, 2, and 3. Considering our results in conjunction with the clinical experiences of the AD expert among the present authors regarding longitudinal changes in ADL, BPSD, and CF, we were able to propose potential progression pathways of AD in the form of a hypothetical roadmap.
