38342131|t|Lateral wall thickness is not associated with revision risk of medially stable intertrochanteric fractures fixed with a sliding hip screw.
38342131|a|Aims: This study aimed to determine whether lateral femoral wall thickness (LWT) < 20.5 mm was associated with increased revision risk of intertrochanteric fracture (ITF) of the hip following sliding hip screw (SHS) fixation when the medial calcar was intact. Additionally, the study assessed the association between LWT and patient mortality. Methods: This retrospective study included ITF patients aged 50 years and over treated with SHS fixation between 2019 and 2021 at a major trauma centre. Demographic information, fracture type, delirium status, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, and length of stay were collected. LWT and tip apex distance were measured. Revision surgery and mortality were recorded at a mean follow-up of 19.5 months (1.6 to 48). Cox regression was performed to evaluate independent risk factors associated with revision surgery and mortality. Results: The cohort consisted of 890 patients with a mean age of 82 years (SD 10.2). Mean LWT was 27.0 mm (SD 8.6), and there were 213 patients (23.9%) with LWT < 20.5 mm. Overall, 20 patients (2.2%) underwent a revision surgery following SHS fixation. Adjusting for covariates, LWT < 20.5 mm was not independently associated with an increased revision or mortality risk. However, factors that were significantly more prevalent in LWT < 20.5 mm group, which included residence in care home (hazard ratio (HR) 1.84; p < 0.001) or hospital (HR 1.65; p = 0.005), and delirium (HR 1.32; p = 0.026), were independently associated with an increased mortality risk. The only independent factor associated with increased risk of revision was older age (HR 1.07; p = 0.030). Conclusion: LWT was not associated with risk of revision surgery in patients with an ITF fixed with a SHS when the calcar was intact, after adjusting for the independent effect of age. Although LWT < 20.5 mm was not an independent risk factor for mortality, patients with LWT < 20.5 mm were more likely to be from care home or hospital and have delirium on admission, which were associated with a higher mortality rate.
