1914872|t|Alcohol problems in the general hospital.
1914872|a|Patients with acute alcohol-related problems are commonly encountered in hospital. All hospital doctors, as well as GPs, should be looking out for them to prevent or anticipate complications. Alcohol withdrawal ranges from an insignificant upset to a life-threatening syndrome with delirium, fits and serious neurological complications. Strong vitamins B and C injection deserves routine use in those at risk and is essential to treat such complications of withdrawal. Chlordiazepoxide is commonly used to attenuate the withdrawal syndrome; chlormethiazole is an alternative drug, for use only in hospital. After discharge from hospital a coordinated and integrated approach to management by the GP is essential: continued care and effective follow up are vital.
