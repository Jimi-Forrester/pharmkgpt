34887502|a|Regular physical activity reduces age-related metabolic and functional decline. The energy stored in adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, and AMP) is essential to enable multiple vital functions of erythrocytes and body tissues. Our study aimed to predict the rate of age-related changes in erythrocyte adenylate energetics in athletes and untrained controls. The erythrocyte concentration of adenylates was measured in 68 elite endurance runners (EN, 20-81 years), 58 elite sprinters (SP, 21-90 years), and 62 untrained individuals (CO, 20-68 years). Resting concentrations of ATP, total adenine nucleotide pool, and ADP/AMP ratio were lowest in the CO group and highest in the SP group. The concentration of erythrocyte ADP and AMP was lowest in the EN group and highest in the CO group. In all studied groups, we found a significant increase in the concentration of most erythrocyte adenylate metabolites with age. For ADP and AMP, the trend was also significant but decreasing. Our study strongly suggests that lifelong sports and physical activity participation supports erythrocyte energetics preservation. Although the direction and the predicted rates of change are similar regardless of the training status, the concentrations of particular metabolites are more advantageous in highly trained athletes than in less active controls. Of the two analyzed types of physical training, sprint-oriented training seems to be more efficient in enhancing erythrocyte metabolism throughout adulthood and old age than endurance training.
