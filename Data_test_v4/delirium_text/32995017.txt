32995017|t|Activities of daily living status and psychiatric symptoms after discharge from an intensive care unit: a single-center 12-month longitudinal prospective study.
32995017|a|AIM: In post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), long-term survivors of critical illness present various physical and mental symptoms that can persist for years after discharge. Post-intensive care syndrome in Japan has not been well described, so this study aims to elucidate its epidemiology. METHODS: We undertook a single-center prospective longitudinal cohort study in a mixed intensive care unit (ICU) in a Japanese tertiary hospital. Adult patients emergently admitted to the ICU were eligible for inclusion in the study. To assess activity of daily living (ADL) status and psychiatric symptoms, we posted a questionnaire at 3 and 12 months after discharge from the ICU. We evaluated ADL status, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms using the Barthel index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Impact of Event Scale - Revised, respectively. RESULTS: Enrolled in this study were 204 patients. We received responses from 117/147 (80%) and 74/98 (76%) patients at 3 and 12 months, respectively. At 3 months, the prevalence of ADL disability, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms was 32%, 42%, 48%, and 20%, respectively. At 12 months, the prevalence was 22%, 33%, 39%, and 21%, respectively. The prevalence of any symptoms was 66% at 3 months and 55% at 12 months. Barthel index score at 12 months was improved significantly from that at 3 months. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Impact of Event Scale - Revised scores at 12 months showed no improvement. CONCLUSIONS: At 3 and 12 months after ICU discharge, over half of our Japanese patients suffered ADL disability and/or psychiatric symptoms. The ADL disability improved at 1 year, but psychiatric symptoms did not.
