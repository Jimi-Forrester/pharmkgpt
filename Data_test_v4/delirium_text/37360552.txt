37360552|a|The synthesis of secondary metabolites is a constantly functioning metabolic pathway in all living systems. Secondary metabolites can be broken down into numerous classes, including alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, lignans, saponins, terpenes, quinones, xanthones, and others. However, animals lack the routes of synthesis of these compounds, while plants, fungi, and bacteria all synthesize them. The primary function of bioactive metabolites (BM) synthesized from endophytic fungi (EF) is to make the host plants resistant to pathogens. EF is a group of fungal communities that colonize host tissues' intracellular or intercellular spaces. EF serves as a storehouse of the above-mentioned bioactive metabolites, providing beneficial effects to their hosts. BM of EF could be promising candidates for anti-cancer, anti-malarial, anti-tuberculosis, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, etc. because EF is regarded as an unexploited and untapped source of novel BM for effective drug candidates. Due to the emergence of drug resistance, there is an urgent need to search for new bioactive compounds that combat resistance. This article summarizes the production of BM from EF, high throughput methods for analysis, and their pharmaceutical application. The emphasis is on the diversity of metabolic products from EF, yield, method of purification/characterization, and various functions/activities of EF. Discussed information led to the development of new drugs and food additives that were more effective in the treatment of disease. This review shed light on the pharmacological potential of the fungal bioactive metabolites and emphasizes to exploit them in the future for therapeutic purposes.
