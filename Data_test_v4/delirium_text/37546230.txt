37546230|t|Characteristics and Outcomes of Tracheostomized Patients With and Without COVID-19.
37546230|a|Outcomes of tracheostomized patients with COVID-19 are seldomly investigated with conflicting evidence from the existing literature. OBJECTIVES: To create a study evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on tracheostomized patients by comparing clinical outcomes and weaning parameters in COVID-19 positive and negative cohorts. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective observational cohort study of 604 tracheostomized patients hospitalized in 16 ICUs in New York City between March 9, 2020, and September 8, 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patients were stratified into two cohorts: 398 COVID-19 negative (COVID-ve) and 206 COVID-19 positive (COVID+ve) patients. Clinical characteristics, outcomes, and weaning parameters (first pressure support [PS], tracheostomy collar [TC], speech valve placement, and decannulation) were analyzed. RESULTS: COVID+ve had fewer comorbidities including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, malignancy, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and HIV (p < 0.05). Higher Fio2 (53% vs 44%), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (7.15 vs 5.69), Pco2 (45.8 vs 38.2), and lower pH (7.41 vs 7.43) were observed at the time of tracheostomy in COVID+ve (p < 0.005). There was no statistical difference in post-tracheostomy complication rates. Longer time from intubation to tracheostomy (15.90 vs 13.60 d; p = 0.002), tracheostomy to first PS (2.87 vs 1.80 d; p = 0.005), and TC placement (11.07 vs 4.46 d; p < 0.001) were seen in COVID+ve. However, similar time to speech valve placement, decannulation, and significantly lower 1-year mortality (23.3% vs 36.7%; p = 0.001) with higher number of discharges to long-term acute care hospital (LTACH) (23.8% vs 13.6%; p = 0.015) were seen in COVID+ve. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with COVID-19 required higher Fio2 and PEEP ventilatory support at the time of tracheostomy, with no observed change in complication rates. Despite longer initial weaning period with PS or TC, similar time to speech valve placement or decannulation with significantly lower mortality and higher LTACH discharges suggest favorable outcome in COVID-19 positive patients. Higher ventilatory support requirements and prolonged weaning should not be a deterrent to pursuing a tracheostomy.
