33352735|a|Frailty in middle-aged and older adults is associated with diabetes-related complications. The impact of and interaction between diabetes and frailty on psychosocial wellbeing and mortality in Ireland for adults aged >=50 years were assessed using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. Measures included diabetes status (self-reported), frailty phenotype (>=3/5 criteria), low self-rated health ("fair" or "poor"), depression screening (EURO-D index score >=4), and low quality of life (QoL) (CASP-12 index score < 35). Among the 970 participants, those with diabetes (n = 87) were more likely to be frail (23% vs. 8%; p < 0.001), have low self-rated health (46% vs. 19%; p < 0.001), depression (25% vs. 17%; p = 0.070), and low QoL (25% vs. 18%, p = 0.085). Adjusting for diabetes, age and sex, frailty independently predicted low self-rated health (OR: 9.79 (5.85-16.36)), depression (9.82 (5.93-16.25)), and low QoL (8.52 (5.19-13.97)). Adjusting for frailty, age and sex, diabetes independently predicted low self-rated health (2.70 (1.63-4.47)). The age-sex adjusted mortality hazard ratio was highest for frailty with diabetes (4.67 (1.08-20.15)), followed by frailty without diabetes (2.86 (1.17-6.99)) and being non-frail with diabetes (1.76 (0.59-5.22)). Frailty independently predicts lower self-reported wellbeing and is associated with reduced survival, underpinning its role as an integral part of holistic diabetes care.
