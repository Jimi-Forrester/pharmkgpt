38612442|t|Arginine Supplementation in MELAS Syndrome: What Do We Know about the Mechanisms?
38612442|a|MELAS syndrome, characterized by mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes, represents a devastating mitochondrial disease, with the stroke-like episodes being its primary manifestation. Arginine supplementation has been used and recommended as a treatment for these acute attacks; however, insufficient evidence exists to support this treatment for MELAS. The mechanisms underlying the effect of arginine on MELAS pathophysiology remain unclear, although it is hypothesized that arginine could increase nitric oxide availability and, consequently, enhance blood supply to the brain. A more comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms is necessary to improve treatment strategies, such as dose and regimen adjustments; identify which patients could benefit the most; and establish potential markers for follow-up. This review aims to analyze the existing evidence concerning the mechanisms through which arginine supplementation impacts MELAS pathophysiology and provide the current scenario and perspectives for future investigations.
