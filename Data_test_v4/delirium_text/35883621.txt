35883621|t|MiRNAs as Promising Translational Strategies for Neuronal Repair and Regeneration in Spinal Cord Injury.
35883621|a|Spinal cord injury (SCI) represents a devastating injury to the central nervous system (CNS) that is responsible for impaired mobility and sensory function in SCI patients. The hallmarks of SCI include neuroinflammation, axonal degeneration, neuronal loss, and reactive gliosis. Current strategies, including stem cell transplantation, have not led to successful clinical therapy. MiRNAs are crucial for the differentiation of neural cell types during CNS development, as well as for pathological processes after neural injury including SCI. This makes them ideal candidates for therapy in this condition. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated the involvement of miRNAs that are expressed differently in CNS injury. In this context, the purpose of the review is to provide an overview of the pre-clinical evidence evaluating the use of miRNA therapy in SCI. Specifically, we have focused our attention on miRNAs that are widely associated with neuronal and axon regeneration. "MiRNA replacement therapy" aims to transfer miRNAs to diseased cells and improve targeting efficacy in the cells, and this new therapeutic tool could provide a promising technique to promote SCI repair and reduce functional deficits.
