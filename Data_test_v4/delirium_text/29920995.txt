29920995|t|Redox-Activated Near-Infrared-Responsive Polyoxometalates Used for Photothermal Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
29920995|a|Adjustable structure, excellent physiochemical properties, and good biocompatibility render polyoxometalates (POMs) as a suitable drug agent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, previous works using POMs against AD just focus on the inhibition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) monomer aggregation. In consideration that both Abeta fibrils and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are closely associated with clinical development of AD symptoms, it would be more effective if POMs can disaggregate Abeta fibrils and eliminate ROS as well. Herein, a redox-activated near-infrared (NIR) responsive POMs-based nanoplaform (rPOMs@MSNs@copolymer) is developed with high photothermal effect and antioxidant activity. The rPOMs@MSNs@copolymer can generate local hyperthermia to disaggregate Abeta fibrils under NIR laser irradiation because of POMs (rPOMs) with strong NIR absorption. Furthermore, Abeta-induced ROS can be scavenged by the antioxidant activity of rPOMs. To the authors' knowledge, there is no report of using rPOMs for NIR photothermal treatment of AD. This work may promote the development of multifunctional inorganic agents for biomedical applications.
