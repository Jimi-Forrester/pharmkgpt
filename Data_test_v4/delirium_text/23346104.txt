23346104|a|Cirrhotic patients exhibit disturbed melatonin homeostasis, which may lead to sleep disturbances, but an influence on the hepatic encephalopathy has not been elucidated. Aim. In the present study, the association of melatonin levels in serum and ascitic fluid and ammonia concentration related to the intensity of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) was investigated. Material and Methods. The study included 90 alcoholic patients with hepatic encephalopathy and 30 healthy volunteers (C). Patients were divided in three groups according to 0-4 West-Haven Score: HE(1) (n = 28), HE(2) (n = 30), and HE(3) (n = 32). Melatonin was measured by radioimmune assay. Results. In fasting patients with hepatic encephalopathy we noted higher melatonin serum levels [pg/mL] than in healthy subjects groups: C-11.3 +- 3.9, HE(1) - 34.3 +- 12.2 (P < 0.01), HE(2)-54.8 +- 23.9, and HE(3)-119.8 +- 96.4 (P < 0.001). No correlation between melatonin and ammonia levels was found. Melatonin was detected in ascetic fluid in 24 patients of group HE(2) and 27 patients of group HE(2) of hepatic encephalopathy. Conclusions. Our results suggest that high blood levels of melatonin in cirrhotic liver patients may account for some of the clinical manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy, for example, daytime sleepiness, fatigue.
