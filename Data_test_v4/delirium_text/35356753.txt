35356753|a|Background: Impaired cognitive function of bladder cancer patients plays a role in coping with the kind of urinary diversion and may impact perioperative morbidity. In this study we therefore aimed to assess the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment in patients undergoing radical cystectomy. Secondary objectives included correlation of common cognition tests, assessment of the admitting physician, and perioperative complication rates. Methods: Patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer were prospectively screened by neuropsychological tests including cognition tests [DemTect (Dementia Detection test), MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination), clock drawing test] prior to surgery. Besides, clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were documented. Frequency of mild cognitive impairment as assessed by DemTect was correlated with the results of MMSE and clock drawing test, the occurrence of anxiety and depression, the assessment of the admitting physician, and perioperative complication rates as calculated by Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Comparative analysis (parametric and nonparametric) of patient characteristics (nonpathological versus pathological DemTect suggestive of mild cognitive impairment) was performed. Results: A total of 51 patients (80% male, median age 69 years) were analyzed. DemTect was suspicious of mild cognitive impairment in 27% (14/51) of patients, whereas MMSE and clock drawing test showed pathological results only in 10/51 and 6/51 patients, respectively. We found no correlation between mild cognitive impairment and anxiety/depression status. In all, 5/20 patients (25%) with suspicious DemTect results were considered suitable for a continent diversion neobladder by the admitting physician. Suspicious DemTect results were predictive for higher perioperative complication rates (29% versus 5%). Study limitations include small sample size and missing long-term follow-up. Conclusions: Mild cognitive impairment was observed in more than a quarter of radical cystectomy patients prior to surgery. Preoperative assessment should be supplemented by neuropsychological testing such as the DemTect as mild cognitive impairment is often underestimated and associated with significantly higher perioperative complication rates.
