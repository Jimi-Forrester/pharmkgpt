17119288|t|Experimental approaches to assess metallotoxicity and ageing in models of Alzheimer's disease.
17119288|a|This review highlights advantages and disadvantages of experimental procedures (chemical, cellular, physiological, histochemical and epidemiological) that have been used to identify Alzheimer- and dementia-related targets for exogenous toxins, and discusses how neuronal function can be assessed experimentally, based on the evidence obtained for the neurotoxin aluminium.
