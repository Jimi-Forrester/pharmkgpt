39214523|a|Dementia is a leading cause of disability, and as the population ages, there will be a greater need for friends and family to care for people with Dementia. Unfortunately, informal care for a person with dementia is associated with poor psychological and physical health and lower quality of life of the caregiver. The aim of the present study was to understand how to best support caregivers within their communities by examining their experience of loneliness, isolation, and their relationship with well-being. The study used a representative sample of the New Zealand population in terms of ethnicity, age, gender, education, and income and asked people if they were a primary caregiver of a person with Alzheimer's Disease or related disorder. Both loneliness and isolation were linked to overall well-being; however, loneliness was a stronger predictor of satisfaction with relationships and feeling part of one's community. The findings highlight the importance of examining the multi-factorial constructs of social connectedness and question research attributing loneliness solely to reduced social involvement. As such, interventions for caregivers of a person with dementia need to target feelings of loneliness as well as their social isolation.
