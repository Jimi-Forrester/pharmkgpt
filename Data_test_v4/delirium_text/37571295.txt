37571295|t|The Disease with a Thousand Faces and the Human Microbiome-A Physiopathogenic Intercorrelation in Pediatric Practice.
37571295|a|Numerous interrelationships are known in the literature that have the final effect of unmasking or influencing various pathologies. Among these, the present article aims to discuss the connection between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the human microbiome. The main purpose of this work is to popularize information about the impact of dysbiosis on the pathogenesis and evolutionary course of pediatric patients with SLE. Added to this is the interest in knowledge and awareness of adjunctive therapeutic means that has the ultimate goal of increasing the quality of life. The means by which this can be achieved can be briefly divided into prophylactic or curative, depending on the phase of the condition in which the patient is. We thus reiterate the importance of the clinician acquiring an overview of SLE and the human microbiome, doubled by in-depth knowledge of the physio-pathogenic interactions between the two (in part achieved through the much-studied gut-target organ axes-brain, heart, lung, skin), with the target objective being that of obtaining individualized, multimodal and efficient management for each individual patient.
