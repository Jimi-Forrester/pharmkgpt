34219671|a|The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to help diagnose and manage disease is of increasing interest to researchers and clinicians. Volumes of health data are generated from smartphones and ubiquitous inexpensive sensors. By using these data, AI can offer otherwise unobtainable insights about disease burden and patient status in a free-living environment. Moreover, from clinical datasets AI can improve patient symptom monitoring and global epidemiologic efforts. While these applications are exciting, it is necessary to examine both the utility and limitations of these novel analytic methods. The most promising uses of AI remain aspirational. For example, defining the molecular subtypes of Parkinson's disease will be assisted by future applications of AI to relevant datasets. This will allow clinicians to match patients to molecular therapies and will thus help launch precision medicine. Until AI proves its potential in pushing the frontier of precision medicine, its utility will primarily remain in individualized monitoring, complementing but not replacing movement disorders specialists.
