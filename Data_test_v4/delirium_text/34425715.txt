34425715|t|Structure-activity relationship, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of novel dienyl sulphonyl fluorides as selective BuChE inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
34425715|a|To discover novel scaffolds as leads against dementia, a series of delta-aryl-1,3-dienesulfonyl fluorides with alpha-halo, alpha-aryl and alpha-alkynyl were assayed for ChE inhibitory activity, in which compound A10 was identified as a selective BuChE inhibitor (IC50 = 0.021 muM for eqBChE, 3.62 muM for hBuChE). SAR of BuChE inhibition showed: (i) o- > m- > p-; -OCH3 > -CH3 > -Cl (-Br) for delta-aryl; (ii) alpha-Br > alpha-Cl, alpha-I. Compound A10 exhibited neuroprotective, BBB penetration, mixed competitive inhibitory effect on BuChE (Ki = 29 nM), and benign neural and hepatic safety. Treatment with A10 could almost entirely recover the Abeta1-42-induced cognitive dysfunction to the normal level, and the assessment of total amount of Abeta1-42 confirmed its anti-amyloidogenic profile. Therefore, the potential BuChE inhibitor A10 is a promising effective lead for the treatment of AD.
