32273047|a|PURPOSE: Valproic acid has been proposed as an alternative agent for treatment of agitation and delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU). Clinical data to support the use of valproic acid for this indication are limited. The objective of this analysis was to assess the efficacy and safety associated with the use of valproic acid for the management of agitation and delirium in the ICU. METHODS: This retrospective descriptive analysis included patients who were prescribed valproic acid for a minimum of 3 days for the treatment of agitation and/or delirium in the cardiac, surgical, or medical ICU from May 31, 2015 to December 31, 2017. The prevalence of agitation and delirium was assessed during valproic acid therapy for up to 7 days. Additional data analyzed included opioid, sedative, and antipsychotic requirements and safety outcomes. FINDINGS: A total of 47 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was an observed downward trend in the prevalence of agitation (47.8% vs 16.7%) and delirium (84.8% vs. 63.3%) throughout valproic acid therapy. In addition, the proportion of patients who required dexmedetomidine, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and opioids decreased while patients were taking valproic acid. No adverse effects attributed to valproic acid occurred in this patient population. IMPLICATIONS: Valproic acid may be an alternative option to assist in the management of agitation and delirium in the ICU. Additional prospective data are needed to validate the use of this agent for the treatment of agitation and delirium in critically ill patients.
