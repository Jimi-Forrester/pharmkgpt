33859276|a|Recurrent deletions and duplications of chromosome 7q11.23 copy number variants (CNVs) are associated with several psychiatric disorders. Although phenotypic abnormalities have been observed in patients, causal genes responsible for CNV-associated diagnoses and traits are still poorly understood. Furthermore, the targeted human brain regions, developmental stages, protein networks, and signaling pathways, influenced by this CNV remain unclear. Previous works showed GTF2I involved in Williams-Beuren syndrome, but pathways affected by GTF2I are indistinct. We first constructed dynamic spatiotemporal networks of 7q11.23 genes by combining data from the brain developmental transcriptome with physical interactions of 7q11.23 proteins. Topological changes were observed in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks throughout different stages of brain development. Early and late fetal periods of development in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and amygdale were observed as the vital periods and regions for 7q11.23 CNV proteins. CNV proteins and their partners are significantly enriched in DNA repair pathway. As a driver gene, GTF2I interacted with PRKDC and BRCA1 to involve in DNA repair pathway. The physical interaction between GTF2I with PRKDC was confirmed experimentally by the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We identified that early and late fetal periods are crucial for 7q11.23 genes to affect brain development. Our results implicate that 7q11.23 CNV genes converge on the DNA repair pathway to contribute to the pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases.
