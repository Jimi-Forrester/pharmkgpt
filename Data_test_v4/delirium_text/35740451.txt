35740451|t|Antibacterial and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Apolipoprotein E.
35740451|a|Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a lipid-transport protein that functions as a key mediator of lipid transport and cholesterol metabolism. Recent studies have shown that peptides derived from human APOE display anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Here, we applied in vitro assays and fluorescent microscopy to investigate the anti-bacterial effects of full-length APOE. The interaction of APOE with endotoxins from Escherichia coli was explored using surface plasmon resonance, binding assays, transmission electron microscopy and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We also studied the immunomodulatory activity of APOE using in vitro cell assays and an in vivo mouse model in combination with advanced imaging techniques. We observed that APOE exhibits anti-bacterial activity against several Gram-negative bacterial strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. In addition, we showed that APOE exhibits a significant binding affinity for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipid A as well as heparin. MD simulations identified the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) binding region in helix 4 of APOE as a primary binding site for these molecules via electrostatic interactions. Together, our data suggest that APOE may have an important role in controlling inflammation during Gram-negative bacterial infection.
