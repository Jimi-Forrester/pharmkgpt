METHODS: 7-month-old male senescence resistant mouse strain 1 (SAMR1) and SAMP8 mice were assigned to the following groups, with 15 animals in each group: SAMR1 control (Rc), SAMP8 control (Pc), SAMP8 acupuncture (Pa), SAMP8 sham-acupuncture (Psa). The Pa group was given acupuncture treatment once daily for 15 days. Neuromuscular coordination and cognitive function of the mice were evaluated by the tightrope test and Morris water maze test, respectively. The number of neurons in the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus were measured. The levels of oxidative stress and protein carbonyl, mRNA and protein expression levels of Hsp84 and Hsp86 in the hippocampus were detected. RESULTS: Compared with the Rc group, in the Pc mice there was a lower success rate for the tightrope test, impaired cognitive abilities, a decline in neuron numbers, reduced levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), increased levels of superoxide anion and protein carbonyl, and decreased mRNA and protein levels of Hsp84 and Hsp86 (all P<0.05). After acupuncture treatment, the success rate for the tightrope test was elevated, cognitive function was improved, neuron numbers were enhanced, levels of SOD and GSH-Px were increased, levels of superoxide anion and protein carbonyl were decreased, and Hsp84 and Hsp86 mRNA and protein expression were increased in the Pa mice when compared with the Pc and Psa groups (all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture may delay brain ageing in SAMP8 mice by reducing oxidative protein damage and promoting Hsp84 and Hsp86 expression.
