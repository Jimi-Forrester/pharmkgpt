27094529|t|Acquired hepatocerebral degeneration.
27094529|a|Acquired hepatocerebral degeneration is a rare, mostly irreversible neurological syndrome that occurs in patients with chronic liver disease, particularly in those with surgically or spontaneously induced portosystemic shunts. Typical magnetic resonance findings are T1 hyperintensity in the pallidum, substantia nigra, periaquaductal gray matter. In this paper, we report a case of a 51-year-old woman presented with hepatic encephalopathy episodes and typical magnetic resonance findings, who does not develop any neurological signs or symptoms, nor cognitive decline in the follow up period, lasting for 3 years.
