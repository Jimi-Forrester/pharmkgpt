37844986|a|INTRODUCTION: Postoperative pain is a main component influencing the recovery of patients with lung cancer. The combination of patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) and paravertebral nerve block for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy for lung cancer can achieve a satisfactory analgesic effect and promote early rehabilitation of patients. The objective is to investigate the optimal dose of oxycodone for PCIA combined with paravertebral nerve block, to achieve effective multimodal analgesia management in patients undergoing thoracoscopic lung cancer lobectomy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective, double-blind, single-centre, parallel-group, superiority study from 7 April 2023 to 31 December 2024 will include 160 participants scheduled for thoracoscopic lobectomy for lung cancer. Participants will be randomly assigned to four groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio: OCA group (oxycodone: 0.5 mg/kg), OCB group (oxycodone: 1.0 mg/kg), OCC group (oxycodone: 1.5 mg/kg) and one sufentanil group (sufentanil: 2 microg/kg). Flurbiprofen 50 mg and ondansetron 16 mg are added to each group. All the drugs are diluted with 0.9% saline in a 100 mL volume, with a background infusion rate of 2 mL/hour, a bolus dose of 0.5 mL and a lockout interval of 15 min. The primary outcome is pain scores at rest and dynamic at 24 hours after surgery using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Dynamic NRS scores are defined as NRS when coughing. NRS scores will be assessed at 2, 4, 12, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. The secondary outcomes include the following variables: (1) NRS score at rest and dynamic at 2, 4, 12 and 48 hours postoperatively; (2) total dose of sufentanil or oxycodone consumption in PCIA; (3) the times of patient-controlled analgesia; (4) Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS) at 2, 4, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the surgery; (5) extubation time; (6) serum C-reactive protein and interleukin six levels; (7) incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting; (8) incidence of itching; (9) incidence of respiratory depression and (10) gastrointestinal recovery (exhaust time). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University's Ethics Committee granted consent for this study (approval number: YXLL-KY-2022(116)). To enable widespread use of the data gathered, we plan to publish the trial's findings in an appropriate scientific journal after it is complete. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05742256.
