39040877|t|Emotion expressions and cognitive impairments in the elderly: review of the contactless detection approach.
39040877|a|The aging population in Canada has been increasing continuously throughout the past decades. Amongst this demographic, around 11% suffer from some form of cognitive decline. While diagnosis through traditional means (i.e., Magnetic Resonance Imagings (MRIs), positron emission tomography (PET) scans, cognitive assessments, etc.) has been successful at detecting this decline, there remains unexplored measures of cognitive health that could reduce stress and cost for the elderly population, including approaches for early detection and preventive methods. Such efforts could additionally contribute to reducing the pressure and stress on the Canadian healthcare system, as well as improve the quality of life of the elderly population. Previous evidence has demonstrated emotional facial expressions being altered in individuals with various cognitive conditions such as dementias, mild cognitive impairment, and geriatric depression. This review highlights the commonalities among these cognitive health conditions, and research behind the contactless assessment methods to monitor the health and cognitive well-being of the elderly population through emotion expression. The contactless detection approach covered by this review includes automated facial expression analysis (AFEA), electroencephalogram (EEG) technologies and heart rate variability (HRV). In conclusion, a discussion of the potentials of the existing technologies and future direction of a novel assessment design through fusion of AFEA, EEG and HRV measures to increase detection of cognitive decline in a contactless and remote manner will be presented.
