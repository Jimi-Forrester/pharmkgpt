30506634|a|BACKGROUND: Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid categorized as a narcotic analgesic, has a 100- to 200-fold stronger effect than most opioids, such as morphine. Fatal accidents due to chronic use and abuse of fentanyl are a worldwide social problem. One reason for the abuse of fentanyl is its psychostimulant effects that could induce behavioral changes. The effects of chronic fentanyl administration on behavior, however, are unclear. METHODS: Adult male C57BL/6J mice were chronically administered fentanyl (0.03 or 0.3 mg/kg/d i.p.), and various behaviors were assessed using a behavioral test battery. RESULTS: Mice chronically administered a high dose of fentanyl (0.3 mg/kg/d) exhibited decreased anxiety-like behavior as assessed by the open field and elevated plus maze tests. On the other hand, interruption of fentanyl administration led to increased anxiety-like behavior as observed in the light and dark transition test. The hot plate test revealed that chronic administration of fentanyl reduced pain sensitivity. High-dose chronic fentanyl administration reduced the locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine. The results, however, failed to reach the threshold for study-wide statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Chronic fentanyl administration induces some behavioral changes in mice. Although further studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms of the behavioral effects of chronic fentanyl administration, our findings suggest that fentanyl is safe under properly controlled conditions.
