34153362|a|Aggregated amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in small oligomeric forms inside the brain causes synaptic function disruption and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Histidine is an important amino acid that may lead to structural changes. Abeta42 monomer chain includes 3 histidine residues that considering two epsilon and delta tautomers 8 isomers, including (epsilonepsilonepsilon) and (epsilondeltadelta) could be formed. Molecular dynamics simulation on homodimerization of (epsilonepsilonepsilon) (the most common type of tautomers) and (epsilondeltadelta) tautomers with different initial configurations using monomer chains from our previous work were performed to uncover the tautomeric behavior of histidine on Abeta42 aggregation in a physiological pH which is still largely unknown and impossible to observe experimentally. We found a higher propensity of forming beta-sheet in (epsilondeltadelta) homodimers and specifically in a greater amount from Abeta42 than from Abeta40. A smaller amount of beta-sheet formation was observed for (epsilonepsilonepsilon) homodimers compared with (epsilondeltadelta). Additionally, interactions in (epsilondeltadelta) homodimers may indicate the importance of the hydrophobic core and C-/N-terminals during oligomerization. Our findings indicate the important role of the tautomeric effect of histidine and (epsilondeltadelta) homodimers at the early stage of Abeta aggregation.
