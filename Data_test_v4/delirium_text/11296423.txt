11296423|t|[Is routine application of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting warranted?].
11296423|a|The limitation and indication of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) remain controversial. Since May 1999, we have applied OPCAB for all isolated coronary bypass cases routinely. Intraoperative conversion to CCAB occurred in 8 patients (10.8%). The main reasons for conversion were intramyocardial coronary arteries and arythmia-induced hemodynamic instability in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. We evaluated the results of OPCAB as compared to conventional coronary artery bypass (CCAB) as a historical control. The operative mortality was 1.6% in both groups. Postoperative complications including renal failure and requirements of circulatory support were significantly less in OPCAB. Postoperative max CPK-MB value, the amount of postoperative bleeding and the requirement of transfusion were also significantly less in OPCAB. Only neurological complication in OPCAB was temporary delirium in a high-aged patient, whereas three patients developed neurological complications including permanent stroke in CCAB. Right heart bypass was effectively utilized to maintain hemodynamics and expose the posterior vessels in patients with severely dilated and poorly functioning left ventricle (EF: 24-31%) and a patient with multiple severe stenosis in cerebral arteries. Coronary angiogram performed after the operation demonstrated 94% of graft patency. These results warrant the further application of OPCAB for multivessel surgical revascularization.
