Patients and Methods: This is a population-based observational study that included subjects aged >= 65 years. They were evaluated for the existence of cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes, stroke, alcohol abuse, and smoking. Hearing impairment was diagnosed by an audiologist, using behavioral audiometric examination. These evaluations might have been performed in response to concerns about hearing loss, or they could have been a routine component of yearly comprehensive health screenings that included a Mini-Mental State Examination 2nd Edition (MMSE-2) test. According to the results of the MMSE-2 scale, we divided the individuals into two groups, Group I for those who had cognitive impairment and severe neurocognitive disorder, and Group II for those who did not have cognitive impairment. Results: The study enrolled 203 patients with a mean age of 77 +- 7.5 years (range 65-98), 99 (48%) were males. When comparing the two groups, group I patients presented more often cardiovascular risk factors, stroke, diabetes, and impaired hearing. The univariable logistic regression found that cognitive impairment was significantly more frequent in the elderly with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and stroke (p<0.0001). The multivariate regression analysis found that stroke (p<0.0001) diabetes (p=0.0008), cardiovascular disease (p=0.0004), and impaired hearing (p=0.0011) were significantly linked to cognitive impairment. The occurrence of hearing impairment in the elderly was related to having an MMSE-2 score of 14 or below. Conclusion: According to the findings of this research, the elderly who have trouble hearing in addition to other conditions might have an increased risk for severe neurocognitive disorder.
