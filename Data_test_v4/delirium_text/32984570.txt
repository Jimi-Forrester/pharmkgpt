32984570|a|Mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT) is a new form of reproductive invitro fertilization (IVF) which works on the principle of replacing a women's abnormal mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA) with the donor's healthy one. MRT include different techniques like spindles transfer (ST), pronuclear transfer (PNT) or polar body transfer (PBT). Transmission of defective mitochondrial DNA to the next generation can also be prevented by using these approaches. The development of healthy baby free from genetic disorders and to terminate the lethal mitochondrial disorders are the chief motive of this technique. In aged individuals, through in vitro fertilization, MRT provides the substitution of defective cytoplasm with cured one to enhance the expectation of pregnancy rates. However, moral, social, and cultural objections have restricted its exploration. Therefore, this review summarizes the various methods involved in MRT, its global status, its exaggerated censure over the years which depicts a strong emphasis for social acceptance and clinical application in the world of medical science.
