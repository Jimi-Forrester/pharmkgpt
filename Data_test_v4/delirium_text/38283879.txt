38283879|t|Dementia: A call for a paradigm shift in pre-registration nurse education.
38283879|a|Dementia is a progressive brain disorder that affects memory, thinking and behaviour. It is a major global public health concern, with an estimated 55 million people worldwide living with the condition. In the UK, there is an estimated 944,000 people with dementia. This number is expected to double by 2050. Dementia is a major cause of disability and dependency, and it places a significant burden on families and carers. The current level of dementia education in pre-registration nursing programmes in the UK is inadequate. There are no pre-registration nursing educational programmes that offer dementia as a speciality. This is a major concern, as nurses are the primary providers of care to people with dementia. This article argues that dementia should be established as a branch of pre-registration nursing education that leads to a Registered Nurse (RN) - Dementia. This could help to address the shortage of specialist dementia nurses in the country. This article provides an important suggestion for countries with a shortage of specialist dementia nurses to consider establishing a stand-alone pre-registration branch of dementia nurse education. This would result in a more specialised workforce with the skills and knowledge to provide high-quality care to people with dementia.
