25707322|t|Isoindoline-1,3-dione derivatives targeting cholinesterases: design, synthesis and biological evaluation of potential anti-Alzheimer's agents.
25707322|a|Alzheimer's disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder with a complex etiology. Because the available therapy brings limited benefits, the effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease remains the unmet challenge. Our aim was to develop a new series of donepezil-based compounds endowed with inhibitory properties against cholinesterases and beta-amyloid aggregation. We designed the target compounds as dual binding site acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with N-benzylamine moiety interacting with the catalytic site of the enzyme and an isoindoline-1,3-dione fragment interacting with the peripheral anionic site of the enzyme. The results of pharmacological evaluation lead us to identify a compound 3b as the most potent and selective human acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (hAChE IC50=0.361muM). Kinetic studies revealed that 3b inhibited acetylcholinesterase in non-competitive mode. The result of the parallel artificial membrane permeability assay for the blood-brain barrier indicated that the compound 3b would be able to cross the blood-brain barrier and reach its biological targets in the central nervous system. The selected compound 3b represents a potential lead structure for further development of anti-Alzheimer's agents.
