36435392|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been the most extensively studied neurological disorders that affects millions of individuals globally and is associated with misfolding of proteins in the brain. Amyloid-beta and tau are predominantly involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Therapeutic interventions and nanotechnological advancements are useful only in managing the AD symptoms and the cure for this disease remains elusive. Exosomes, originating from most cell and tissue types are regarded as a double-edged sword, considering their roles in the progression and treatment of AD. Exosomes can be manipulated as drug delivery vehicles for a wide range of therapeutic cargos-both small molecules and macromolecules. Herein, we review the roles of exosomes in the pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of AD and highlight their application as a drug carrier to the brain for AD treatment.
