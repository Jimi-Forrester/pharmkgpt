31258879|t|Extracellular vesicles in type 2 diabetes mellitus: key roles in pathogenesis, complications, and therapy.
31258879|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a chronic disease, is widely prevalent all over the world. In recent years, the roles of some extracellular vesicles (EVs) in T2DM have attracted much attention. EVs are bilayer membrane vesicles secreted from most cells and can participate in regulating various physiological and pathological processes in vivo by being transported between cells. Recently, it was discovered that some abnormal EVs can contribute to the occurrence of T2DM by inducing insulin resistance and can also participate in the complications of T2DM. In addition, some stem/progenitor cells-derived EVs have a potential application in the therapy of T2DM. This review introduces basic concepts of EVs and summarizes the roles of EVs in the pathogenesis, complications, and therapy of T2DM.
