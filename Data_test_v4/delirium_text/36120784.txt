36120784|a|BACKGROUND: The ATN scheme was proposed as an unbiased biological characterization of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum, grouping biomarkers into three categories: brain Amyloidosis-A, Tauopathy-T, Neurodegeneration-N. Although this scheme was mainly recommended for research, it is relevant for diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ATN scheme performance in real-life cohorts reflecting the inflow of patients with cognitive complaints and different underlying disorders in general neurological centers. METHODS: We included patients (n = 1,128) from six centers with their core cerebrospinal fluid-AD biomarkers analyzed centrally. A was assessed through Abeta42/Abeta40, T through pTau-181, and N through tTau. Association between demographic features, clinical diagnosis at baseline/follow-up and ATN profiles was assessed. RESULTS: The prevalence of ATN categories was: A-T-N-: 28.3%; AD continuum (A + T-/+N-/+): 47.8%; non-AD (A- plus T or/and N+): 23.9%. ATN profiles prevalence was strongly influenced by age, showing differences according to gender, APOE genotype, and cognitive status. At baseline, 74.6% of patients classified as AD fell in the AD continuum, decreasing to 47.4% in mild cognitive impairment and 42.3% in other neurodegenerative conditions. At follow-up, 41% of patients changed diagnosis, and 92% of patients that changed to AD were classified within the AD continuum. A + was the best individual marker for predicting a final AD diagnosis, and the combinations A + T+ (irrespective of N) and A + T+N+ had the highest overall accuracy (83%). CONCLUSION: The ATN scheme is useful to guide AD diagnosis in real-life neurological centers settings. However, it shows a lack of accuracy for patients with other types of dementia. In such cases, the inclusion of other markers specific for non-AD proteinopathies could be an important aid to the differential diagnosis.
