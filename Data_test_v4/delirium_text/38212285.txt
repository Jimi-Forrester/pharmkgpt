38212285|t|Dynamic multilayer functional connectivity detects preclinical and clinical Alzheimer's disease.
38212285|a|Increasing evidence suggests that patients with Alzheimer's disease present alterations in functional connectivity but previous results have not always been consistent. One of the reasons that may account for this inconsistency is the lack of consideration of temporal dynamics. To address this limitation, here we studied the dynamic modular organization on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging across different stages of Alzheimer's disease using a novel multilayer brain network approach. Participants from preclinical and clinical Alzheimer's disease stages were included. Temporal multilayer networks were used to assess time-varying modular organization. Logistic regression models were employed for disease stage discrimination, and partial least squares analyses examined associations between dynamic measures with cognition and pathology. Temporal multilayer functional measures distinguished all groups, particularly preclinical stages, overcoming the discriminatory power of risk factors such as age, sex, and APOE epsilon4 carriership. Dynamic multilayer functional measures exhibited strong associations with cognition as well as amyloid and tau pathology. Dynamic multilayer functional connectivity shows promise as a functional imaging biomarker for both early- and late-stage Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.
