12932426|t|(-)-9-Dehydrogalanthaminium bromide, a new cholinesterase inhibitor, enhances place and object recognition memory in young and old rats.
12932426|a|In a previous study, we showed that (-)-9-dehydrogalanthaminium bromide, a synthetic galanthamine derivative, was more potent than galanthamine in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. We studied here the action of this new compound on recognition memory in young and old rats, using a two-trial recognition task designed to test both place and object recognition. (-)-9-dehydrogalanthaminium bromide was injected (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg, i.p.) in young and old rats before the acquisition phase, immediately after it, or before the retrieval phase of the task, in order to determine the stage of information processing affected by the compound. (-)-9-dehydrogalanthaminium bromide improved both place and object recognition in young rats, via an enhancement of acquisition (3 mg/kg: place recognition; 1 and 3 mg/kg: object recognition) and consolidation (1 and 3 mg/kg) information processing. In old rats, (-)-9-dehydrogalanthaminium bromide improved performance by acting on the acquisition processes of place (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg) and object (1 and 3 mg/kg) recognition. These results provide information on the profile of activity of (-)-9-dehydrogalanthaminium bromide on memory processes, and suggest that this new compound could have utility in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction occurring in Alzheimer's disease or in the normal course of aging.
