37892991|a|Among the high prevalence of cerebrovascular diseases nowadays, acute ischemic stroke stands out, representing a significant worldwide health issue with important socio-economic implications. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are important milestones for the management of this multifaceted pathology, making understanding the various stroke-onset symptoms crucial. A key role in acute ischemic stroke management is emphasizing the essential role of a multi-disciplinary team, therefore, increasing the efficiency of recognition and treatment. Neuroimaging and neuroradiology have evolved dramatically over the years, with multiple approaches that provide a higher understanding of the morphological aspects as well as timely recognition of cerebral artery occlusions for effective therapy planning. Regarding the treatment matter, the pharmacological approach, particularly fibrinolytic therapy, has its merits and challenges. Endovascular thrombectomy, a game-changer in stroke management, has witnessed significant advances, with technologies like stent retrievers and aspiration catheters playing pivotal roles. For select patients, combining pharmacological and endovascular strategies offers evidence-backed benefits. The aim of our comprehensive study on acute ischemic stroke is to efficiently compare the current therapies, recognize novel possibilities from the literature, and describe the state of the art in the interdisciplinary approach to acute ischemic stroke. As we aspire for holistic patient management, the emphasis is not just on medical intervention but also on physical therapy, mental health, and community engagement. The future holds promising innovations, with artificial intelligence poised to reshape stroke diagnostics and treatments. Bridging the gap between groundbreaking research and clinical practice remains a challenge, urging continuous collaboration and research.
