33967042|t|Urban Air Pollution Nanoparticles from Los Angeles: Recently Decreased Neurotoxicity.
33967042|a|BACKGROUND: Air pollution is widely associated with accelerated cognitive decline at later ages and risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Correspondingly, rodent models demonstrate the neurotoxicity of ambient air pollution and its components. Our studies with nano-sized particulate matter (nPM) from urban Los Angeles collected since 2009 have shown pro-amyloidogenic and pro-inflammatory responses. However, recent batches of nPM have diminished induction of the glutamate receptor GluA1 subunit, Iba1, TNFalpha, Abeta42 peptide, and white matter damage. The same methods, materials, and mouse genotypes were used throughout. OBJECTIVE: Expand the nPM batch comparisons and evaluate archived brain samples to identify the earliest change in nPM potency. METHODS: Batches of nPM were analyzed by in vitro cell assays for NF-kappaB and Nrf2 induction for comparison with in vivo responses of mouse brain regions from mice exposed to these batches, analyzed by PCR and western blot. RESULTS: Five older nPM batches (2009-2017) and four recent nPM batches (2018, 2019) for NF-kappaB and Nrf2 induction showed declines in nPM potency after 2017 that paralleled declines of in vivo activity from independent exposures in different years. CONCLUSION: Transcription-based in vitro assays of nPM corresponded to the loss of in vivo potency for inflammatory and oxidative responses. These recent decreases of nPM neurotoxicity give a rationale for evaluating possible benefits to the risk of dementia and stroke in Los Angeles populations.
