16124609|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the protective effect of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) on the level of synaptophysin ptotein in brain in rat model with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHOD: The AD rat models were established by intra-peritoneal injection of D-galactose combined with excitatory neurotoxin ibotenic acid injection into bilateral nbM. The activity and content of synaptophysin protein in brain were determined by immunohistochemistry analysis. RESULT: PNS could reduce the lesion of level of synaptophysin protein in brain, as compared with those of model group's rats. CONCLUSION: PNS plays a protective role by reducing down of the level of synaptophysin protein in brain in lesion of AD animal model.
