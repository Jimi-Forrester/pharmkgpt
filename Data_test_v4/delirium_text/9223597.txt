9223597|t|Cerebrospinal fluid apolipoprotein E (apoE) levels in Alzheimer's disease patients are increased at follow up and show a correlation with levels of tau protein.
9223597|a|Apolipoprotein E (apoE) levels were compared in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) taken on two occasions, with an average 15 months follow up, from groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD: n = 18), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 9) and other dementia disorders (ODD; n = 9). In these groups, CSF apoE levels were between 2-3-fold higher than values for a group of 27 healthy age-matched controls. CSF apoE levels in the AD group were significantly increased at follow up, compared to levels obtained on the first sampling occasion. For the same cases it had been shown previously that CSF tau protein levels were increased at follow up [Blomberg, M., Jensen, M., Basun, H., Lannfelt, L. and Wahlund, L-O., Neurosci. Lett., 214 (1996) 163-166]. The AD, but not MCI, ODD or control groups, also showed statistically significant correlations between CSF apoE and tau protein levels at both the first (r = 0.585, P < 0.01) and follow up (r = 0.695, P > 0.001 ) samplings. It is concluded that CSF measures of both apoE and tau may reflect an intimate relationship between these two proteins in AD and could prove useful in monitoring the progression of this condition.
