32961852|t|Mitochondrial Surveillance by Cdc48/p97: MAD vs. Membrane Fusion.
32961852|a|Cdc48/p97 is a ring-shaped, ATP-driven hexameric motor, essential for cellular viability. It specifically unfolds and extracts ubiquitylated proteins from membranes or protein complexes, mostly targeting them for proteolytic degradation by the proteasome. Cdc48/p97 is involved in a multitude of cellular processes, reaching from cell cycle regulation to signal transduction, also participating in growth or death decisions. The role of Cdc48/p97 in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), where it extracts proteins targeted for degradation from the ER membrane, has been extensively described. Here, we present the roles of Cdc48/p97 in mitochondrial regulation. We discuss mitochondrial quality control surveillance by Cdc48/p97 in mitochondrial-associated degradation (MAD), highlighting the potential pathologic significance thereof. Furthermore, we present the current knowledge of how Cdc48/p97 regulates mitofusin activity in outer membrane fusion and how this may impact on neurodegeneration.
