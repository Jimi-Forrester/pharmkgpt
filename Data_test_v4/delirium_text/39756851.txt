39756851|t|The fine line between relief and risk: new insights into postoperative delirium.
39756851|a|There is a complex association between postoperative pain and postoperative delirium, which highlights the need for a more balanced approach to pain management that considers various risk factors. We emphasise the importance of comprehensive documentation and standardised monitoring to improve detection and management of postoperative delirium, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. We advocate for a precision anaesthesia approach, which tailors care to individual patient profiles, as a potential solution to address these challenges.
