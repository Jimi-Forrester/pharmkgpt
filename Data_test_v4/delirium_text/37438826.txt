37438826|a|Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects around 1% of the population in widespread populations, with severe cases leading to long-term hospitalization and necessitation of lifelong treatment. Recent studies on schizophrenia have highlighted the involvement of inflammatory and immunoregulatory mechanisms with the onset of symptoms, and the usage of anti-inflammatory treatments are being tested against periods of rapid psychosis. In the central nervous system, microglia are the innate immune population which are activated in response to a wide range of physical and psychological stress factors and produce proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines. Microglial activation and neuroinflammation has been associated to numerous psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, especially during psychotic episodes. Thus, novel treatments which dampen microglial activation may be of great relevance in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Fingolimod (FTY720) is a drug used as an immunosuppressive treatment to multiple sclerosis. Recent clinical trials have focused on FTY720 as a treatment for the behavioral symptoms in schizophrenia. However, the mechanisms of Fingolimod in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia are not clear. In this study we use a recently developed neuroinflammatory psychosis model in mice: cuprizone short-term exposure, to investigate the effects of FTY720 administration. FTY720 administration was able to completely alleviate methamphetamine hypersensitivity caused by cuprizone exposure. Moreover, administration of FTY720 improved multiple measures of neuroinflammation (microglial activation, cytokine production, and leucocyte infiltration). In conclusion, our results highlight the future use of FTY720 as a direct anti-inflammatory treatment against microglial activation and psychosis.
