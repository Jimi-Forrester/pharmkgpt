38353228|t|Plasma Markers of Alzheimer's Disease Pathology, Neuronal Injury, and Astrocytic Activation and MRI Load of Vascular Pathology and Neurodegeneration: The SMART-MR Study.
38353228|a|BACKGROUND: Two of the main causes for dementia are Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular pathology, with most patients showing mixed pathology. Plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease-related pathology have recently emerged, including Abeta (amyloid-beta), p-tau (phosphorylated tau), NfL (neurofilament light), and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein). There is a current gap in the literature regarding whether there is an association between these plasma biomarkers with vascular pathology and neurodegeneration. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cross-sectional data from 594 individuals (mean [SD] age: 64 [8] years; 17% female) were included from the SMART-MR (Second Manifestations of Arterial Disease-Magnetic Resonance) study, a prospective cohort study of individuals with a history of arterial disease. Plasma markers were assessed using single molecular array assays (Quanterix). Magnetic resonance imaging markers included white matter hyperintensity volume, presence of infarcts (yes/no), total brain volume, and hippocampal volume assessed on 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging. Linear regressions were performed for each standardized plasma marker with white matter hyperintensity volume, total brain volume, and hippocampal volume as separate outcomes, correcting for age, sex, education, and intracranial volume. Logistic regressions were performed for the presence of lacunar and cortical infarcts. Higher p-tau181 was associated with larger white matter hyperintensity volume (b per SD increase=0.16 [95% CI, 0.06-0.26], P=0.015). Higher NfL (b=-5.63, [95% CI, -8.95 to -2.31], P=0.015) was associated with lower total brain volume and the presence of infarcts (odds ratio [OR], 1.42 [95% CI, 1.13-1.78], P=0.039). Higher GFAP levels were associated with cortical infarcts (OR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.09-1.92], P=0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma biomarkers that have been associated with tau pathology, axonal injury, and astrocytic activation are related to magnetic resonance imagingmarkers of vascular pathology and neurodegeneration in patients with manifest arterial disease.
