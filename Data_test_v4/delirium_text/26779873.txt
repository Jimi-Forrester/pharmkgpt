26779873|a|SUMMARY: The measurement of nursing workload in a sub-intensive unit with the Nine Equivalents of Nursing Manpower Scale. INTRODUCTION: The need to maximize the nursing manpower to patients complexity requires a careful assessment of the nursing workload. AIMS: To measure the nursing workload in a sub-intensive care unit and to assess the impact of patients isolated for multidrug resistant microorganisms (MDR) and with delirium, on the nursing workload. METHODS: From december 1 2014 to march 31 2015 the nursing workload of patients admitted to a semi intensive untit of a Turin Hospital was measured with Nine Equivalents of Nursing Manpower (NEMS) original and modified, adding 1 point score for patients isolated and with delirium (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale). Admission and discharge times, and the activities performed in and out of the unit were registered. RESULTS: Two-hundred-thirty patients were daily assessed and no differences were observed in mean NEMS scores with the original and modified scale: december 17.3 vs 18.5; January 19.4 vs 20.2; February 19.9 vs 20.6; March 19.5 vs 20.1). mean scores did not change across shifts although on average 8 days a month the scores exceeded 21, identifiyng an excess workload and a need of a 2:1 patient/nurse ratio. The maximum workload was concentrated between 12.00 and 18.00 pm. CONCLUSIONS: The NEMS scale allows to measure the nursing workload. Apparently patients isolated and with delirium did not significantly impact on the nursing workload.
