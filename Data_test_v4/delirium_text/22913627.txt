22913627|t|Abeta oligomer toxicity inhibitor protects memory in models of synaptic toxicity.
22913627|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation into synaptotoxic, prefibrillar oligomers is a major pathogenic event underlying the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pharmacological and neuroprotective properties of a novel Abeta aggregation inhibitor, SEN1269, were investigated on aggregation and cell viability and in test systems relevant to synaptic function and memory, using both synthetic Abeta(1-42)  and cell-derived Abeta oligomers. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Surface plasmon resonance studies measured binding of SEN1269 to Abeta(1-42) . Thioflavin-T fluorescence and MTT assays were used to measure its ability to block Abeta(1-42) -induced aggregation and reduction in cell viability. In vitro and in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments measured the effect of SEN1269 on deficits induced by synthetic Abeta(1-42)  and cell-derived Abeta oligomers. Following i.c.v. administration of the latter, a complex (alternating-lever cyclic ratio) schedule of operant responding measured effects on memory in freely moving rats. KEY RESULTS: SEN1269 demonstrated direct binding to monomeric Abeta(1-42) , produced a concentration-related blockade of Abeta(1-42)  aggregation and protected neuronal cell lines exposed to Abeta(1-42) . In vitro, SEN1269 alleviated deficits in hippocampal LTP induced by Abeta(1-42)  and cell-derived Abeta oligomers. In vivo, SEN1269 reduced the deficits in LTP and memory induced by i.c.v. administration of cell-derived Abeta oligomers. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: SEN1269 protected cells exposed to Abeta(1-42) , displayed central activity with respect to reducing Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and was neuroprotective in electrophysiological and behavioural models of memory relevant to Abeta-induced neurodegeneration. It represents a promising lead for designing inhibitors of Abeta-mediated synaptic toxicity as potential neuroprotective agents for treating AD.
