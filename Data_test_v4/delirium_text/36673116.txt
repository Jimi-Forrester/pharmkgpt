36673116|t|Impact of ACE and Endoplasmic Reticulum Aminopeptidases Polymorphisms on COVID-19 Outcome.
36673116|a|Background: COVID-19 outcomes display multiple unexpected varieties, ranging from unnoticed symptomless infection to death, without any previous alarm or known aggravating factors. Aim: To appraise the impact of ACErs4291(A/T) and ERAP1rs26618(T/C) human polymorphisms on the outcome of COVID-19. Subjects and methods: In total, 240 individuals were enrolled in the study (80 with severe manifestations, 80 with mild manifestations, and 80 healthy persons). ACErs4291(A/T) and ERAP1rs26618(T/C) genotyping was performed using RT-PCR. Results: The frequency of the ACErs4291AA genotype was higher among the severe COVID-19 group than others (p < 0.001). The ERAP1rs26618TT genotype frequency was higher among the severe COVID-19 group in comparison with the mild group (p < 0.001) and non-infected controls (p = 0.0006). The frequency of the ACErs4291A allele was higher among severe COVID-19 than mild and non-infected groups (64.4% vs. 37.5%, and 34.4%, respectively), and the ERAP1rs26618T allele was also higher in the severe group (67.5% vs. 39.4%, and 49.4%). There was a statistically significant association between severe COVID-19 and ACErs4291A or ERAP1rs26618T alleles. The coexistence of ACErs4291A and ERAP1rs26618T alleles in the same individual increase the severity of the COVID-19 risk by seven times [OR (95%CI) (LL-UL) = 7.058 (3.752-13.277), p < 0.001). A logistic regression analysis revealed that age, male gender, non-vaccination, ACErs4291A, and ERAP1rs26618T alleles are independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. Conclusions: Persons carrying ACErs4291A and/or ERAP1rs26618T alleles are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19.
