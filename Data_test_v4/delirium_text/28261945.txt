28261945|t|Cognitive decline and slower reaction time in elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment.
28261945|a|AIM: The relationship between declining performance, as measured by changes in reaction time, and declining cognitive function has not been critically studied. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between reaction time during a task and cognitive ability in elderly Taiwanese individuals. METHODS: Patients aged 65 years or older with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 33) and Alzheimer's disease (n = 26) were recruited from the neurology clinic of a regional hospital in southern Taiwan. In addition, 28 healthy controls aged 65 years or older were recruited from the community. The cognitive performance of the study participants was assessed using the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI). A computer-administered simple reaction time (SRT) task and a flanker reaction time (FRT) task were administered to assess participants' cognitive function. A non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to compare CASI scores, SRT, and FRT among the three groups. anova was also used to compare CASI scores, inverse-transformed SRT, and inverse-transformed FRT among the three groups, with adjustment for age and years of education. Additionally, Pearson's partial correlation coefficients were used to assess the association of CASI scores with inverse-transformed SRT, and inverse-transformed FRT within each of the three groups. RESULTS: Significant differences in CASI scores, SRT, and FRT were found between the Alzheimer's disease group and the other two groups, either with or without adjustment for age or education. The reaction time of patients with Alzheimer's disease was significantly slower than the other two groups. Moreover, significant correlation between CASI and FRT was found in patients with MCI. CONCLUSION: Altered performance in a speed task was observed in patients with MCI. The FRT task should further be explored for its role as a marker for cognitive decline in elderly individuals, particularly in those with MCI.
