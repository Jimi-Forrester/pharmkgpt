24930556|t|Occurrence of delirium after a short-term intake of olanzapine.
24930556|a|Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug, which is claimed to have fewer side effects than conventional antipsychotics. We report three cases where patients developed a classic delirium within a few days after first intake of olanzapine. The symptoms fulfilled all criteria of DSM-IV for delirium, and rapidly diminished after discontinuation of olanzapine. Additional reasons for the development of the delirias are possible, but less likely. Special awareness and future research of this phenomenon is highly indicated because of the common use of this drug.
