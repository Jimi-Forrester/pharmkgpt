7810590|t|Association of apolipoprotein E allele epsilon 4 with late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
7810590|a|Apolipoprotein E, type epsilon 4 allele (ApoE epsilon 4), is associated with late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) in French patients. The association is highly significant (0.45 AD versus 0.12 controls for epsilon 4 allele frequencies). These data support the involvement of ApoE epsilon 4 allele as a very important risk factor for the clinical expression of AD.
