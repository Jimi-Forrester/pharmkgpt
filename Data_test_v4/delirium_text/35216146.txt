35216146|a|Chicoric acid (CA), a polyphenolic acid compound extracted from chicory and echinacea, possesses antiviral, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. Growing evidence supports the pivotal roles of brain-spleen and brain-gut axes in neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), and the immune response of the spleen and colon is always the active participant in the pathogenesis and development of PD. In this study, we observe that CA prevented dopaminergic neuronal lesions, motor deficits and glial activation in PD mice, along with the increment in striatal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), dopamine (DA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HT). Furthermore, CA reversed the level of interleukin-17(IL-17), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) of PD mice, implicating its regulatory effect on the immunological response of spleen and colon. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 22 genes in the spleen (21 upregulated and 1 downregulated) and 306 genes (190 upregulated and 116 downregulated) in the colon were significantly differentially expressed in CA-pretreated mice. These genes were functionally annotated with GSEA, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment, providing the potential target genes and molecular biological mechanisms for the modulation of CA on the spleen and gut in PD. Remarkably, CA restored some gene expressions to normal level. Our results highlighted that the neuroprotection of CA might be associated with the manipulation of CA on brain-spleen and brain-gut axes in PD.
