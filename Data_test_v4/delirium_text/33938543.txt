33938543|a|. The management of pain delirium and dyspnea at home: a proposal for management algorithms. The project "E-health, advanced nursing care for the cancer patient at home" includes the implementation of an app (and the evaluation of the feasibility of its use) but the core aspect is the availability of a group of nurses able to prevent and answer the needs of the palliative care patients. The three pillars of the project are: training, organisation and the provision of instruments able to offer a guide to nurses when at home of the patients or when called in case of problems. In this issue 2 of the clinical practice protocols for the management of pain, delirium and dyspnea are presented. Each protocol is the result of a constant dialogue between the medical and nursing staff of the Palliative Care and Oncology units. The algorithms can be used by nurses to orient the patient in the choice of the most appropriate at need drugs.
