29774059|a|The inflammatory response is a major factor in stroke pathophysiology and contributes to secondary neuronal damage in both acute and chronic stages of the ischemic injury. Recent work in experimental cerebral ischemia has demonstrated the involvement of neurotransmitter signaling in the modulation of neuroinflammation. The present review discusses recent findings on the therapeutic potential and diagnostic perspectives of cholinergic, purinergic and glutamatergic receptors and transporters in experimental stroke. It provides evidence of the role of neurotransmission signaling as a promising inflammatory biomarker in stroke. Finally, recent molecular imaging studies using positron emission tomography of cholinergic receptors and glutamatergic transporters are outlined along with their potential as novel anti-inflammatory therapy to reduce the outcome of cerebral ischemia.
