23680419|t|Motor outcomes during hospitalization in Parkinson's disease patients: a prospective study.
23680419|a|BACKGROUND: Retrospective studies suggest that many Parkinson's disease patients have a worsening of their motor status during hospitalization. We aimed to quantify this prospectively, and study possible contributing factors. METHODS: Over one year we included all consecutive Parkinson's disease patients, newly admitted to a Dutch teaching hospital. We analyzed complications, interventions, and medication distribution. At inclusion and at discharge we assessed the motor status with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS-III). RESULTS: 48% of 46 admitted patients had complications, mainly confusion/delirium (24%) and infections (15%). At discharge 28% of the patients had a worse motor function with a mean increase of more than 5 points on the UPDRS-III. Medication errors occurred in 39%. This is the most important risk factor (p < 0.000) for motor function deterioration, followed by infections during hospitalization, and not being in control of own Parkinson's disease medication. 24% of patients were allowed to take control of their own Parkinson's disease medication, none of these patients did deteriorate. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study shows that a substantial part of hospitalized PD patients has a significant worse motor function at discharge mainly due to medication errors and infections. Quality of care could be improved by addressing preventable errors and allow patients to take control of their own Parkinson's disease medication.
