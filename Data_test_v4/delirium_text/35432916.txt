35432916|t|Diagnostic Test to Identify Parkinson's Disease from the Blood Sera of Chinese Population: A Cross-Sectional Study.
35432916|a|Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease, a hallmark by the formation of misfolded and aggregated alpha-synuclein proteins. The expression of potential microRNA (miRNA) candidates isolated from serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exosomes of PD patients was assessed for their diagnostic value and their potential role as biomarkers for PD was explored. In this study, we characterize the expression level of miRNAs in the exosomes of blood sera and cerebrospinal fluid and explore their potential role as biomarkers for PD. Materials and Methods: A total of 209 patients having an onset of PD, along with 60 neurodegenerative (ND) disorders and 50 healthy controls were enrolled. Blood samples and CSF samples were collected and exosomes were isolated. The isolated exosomes were characterized using CD63 detection and exosomal RNA was extracted. Serum miRNA profiling was carried out by synthesizing cDNA from the purified RNA and miRNA transcripts were determined by qRT-PCR using SYBR Green PremixScript. microRNA profiling strategy was employed for extracting the exosomal miRNAs from the exosomes. Results: Five common miRNAs viz. miR-151a-5p, miR-24, mir-485-5p, mir-331-5p, and mir-214 were found to be upregulated with statistical significance in both the serum exosome and CSF exosomes. The investigation revealed that serum and CSF exosomal miRNA molecules are definitive biomarkers for PD with proper specificity and sensitivity. Conclusions: The significant level of miR-151a-5p, miR-24, mir-485-5p, mir-331-5p, and mir-214 was observed in the serum and CSF which may be established as a biomarker for the diagnosis of PD.
