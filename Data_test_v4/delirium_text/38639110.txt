38639110|a|OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine associations between neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) status in older adults without dementia under the hypothesis that WMH increased the odds of having NPS. DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis of data acquired from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set. SETTINGS: Data were derived from 46 National Institute on Aging - funded Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers. PARTICIPANTS: NACC participants aged >=50 years with available data on WMH severity with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or who were cognitively unimpaired (CU) were studied. Among 4617 CU participants, 376 had moderate and 54 extensive WMH. Among 3170 participants with MCI, 471 had moderate and 88 had extensive WMH.Measurements: Using Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) scores, WMH were coded as no to mild (CHS score: 0-4), moderate (score: 5-6) or extensive (score: 7-8). NPS were quantified on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. Binary logistic regression models estimated the odds of reporting each of 12 NPS by WMH status separately for individuals with MCI or who were CU. RESULTS: Compared to CU individuals with no to mild WMH, the odds of having elation [9.87,(2.63-37.10)], disinhibition [4.42,(1.28-15.32)], agitation [3.51,(1.29-9.54)] or anxiety [2.74,(1.28-5.88)] were higher for the extensive WMH group, whereas the odds of having disinhibition were higher for the moderate WMH group [1.94,(1.05-3.61)]. In the MCI group, he odds of NPS did not vary by WMH status. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive WMH were associated with higher odds of NPS in CU older adults but not in those with MCI.
