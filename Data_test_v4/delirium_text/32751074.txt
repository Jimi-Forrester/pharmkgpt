32751074|t|Rehabilitation of Adult Patients with Primary Brain Tumors: A Narrative Review.
32751074|a|Rehabilitative measures have been shown to benefit patients with primary brain tumors (PBT). To provide a high quality of care, clinicians should be aware of common challenges in this population including a variety of medical complications, symptoms, and impairments, such as headaches, seizures, cognitive deficits, fatigue, and mood changes. By taking communication and family training into consideration, clinicians can provide integrated and patient-centered care to this population. This article looks to review the current literature in outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation options for adult patients with PBTs as well as explore the role of the interdisciplinary team in providing survivorship care.
