37571326|a|This study investigated the potential therapeutic properties of fermented ginseng berry extract (GBE) for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Fermented GBE was examined for its ginsenoside content and physiological properties, which have been suggested to have neuroprotective effects and improve cognitive function. The results showed that fermented GBE contains high levels of major active ginsenosides and exhibits antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. Post-fermented GBE demonstrated therapeutic potential in AF64A-induced damaged neural stem cells and an animal model of AD. These findings suggest that fermented GBE may hold promise as a candidate for developing new therapeutic interventions for memory deficits and cognitive disorders associated with AD and other neurodegenerative conditions. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of fermented GBE in human subjects and to determine its clinical applications. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that fermented GBE has potential as a natural product for the prevention and treatment of AD. The high levels of active ginsenosides and antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities of fermented GBE suggest that it may be a promising therapeutic agent for improving cognitive function and reducing neurodegeneration.
