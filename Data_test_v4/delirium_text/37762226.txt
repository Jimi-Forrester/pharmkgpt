37762226|t|In Silico Analysis Reveals the Modulation of Ion Transmembrane Transporters in the Cerebellum of Alzheimer's Disease Patients.
37762226|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. AD hallmarks are extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. It is interesting to notice that Abeta plaques appear in the cerebellum only in late stages of the disease, and then it was hypothesized that it can be resistant to specific neurodegenerative mechanisms. However, the role of cerebellum in AD pathogenesis is not clear yet. In this study, we performed an in silico analysis to evaluate the transcriptional profile of cerebellum in AD patients and non-AD subjects in order to deepen the knowledge on its role in AD. The analysis evidenced that only the molecular function (MF) "active ion transmembrane transporter activity" was overrepresented. Regarding the 21 differentially expressed genes included in this MF, some of them may be involved in the ion dyshomeostasis reported in AD, while others assumed, in the cerebellum, an opposite regulation compared to those reported in other brain regions in AD patients. They might be associated to a protective phenotype, that may explain the initial resistance of cerebellum to neurodegeneration in AD. Of note, this MF was not overrepresented in prefrontal cortex and visual cortex indicating that it is a peculiarity of the cerebellum.
