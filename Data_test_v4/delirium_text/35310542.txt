35310542|t|Promoter Hypomethylation of TGFBR3 as a Risk Factor of Alzheimer's Disease: An Integrated Epigenomic-Transcriptomic Analysis.
35310542|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the abnormal deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and tau tangles in the brain and accompanied with cognitive impairment. However, the fundamental cause of this disease remains elusive. To elucidate the molecular processes related to AD, we carried out an integrated analysis utilizing gene expression microarrays (GSE36980 and GSE5281) and DNA methylation microarray (GSE66351) in temporal cortex of AD patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We totally discovered 409 aberrantly methylated and differentially expressed genes. These dysregulated genes were significantly enriched in biological processes including cell part morphogenesis, chemical synaptic transmission and regulation of Abeta formation. Through convergent functional genomic (CFG) analysis, expression cross-validation and clinicopathological correlation analysis, higher TGFBR3 level was observed in AD and positively correlated with Abeta accumulation. Meanwhile, the promoter methylation level of TGFBR3 was reduced in AD and negatively associated with Abeta level and advanced Braak stage. Mechanically, TGFBR3 might promote Abeta production by enhancing beta- and gamma-secretase activities. Further investigation revealed that TGFBR3 may exert its functions via Synaptic vesicle cycle, Calcium signaling pathway and MAPK signal pathway by regulating hub genes GNB1, GNG3, CDC5L, DYNC1H1 and FBXW7. Overall, our findings highlighted TGFBR3 as an AD risk gene and might be used as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for AD treatment.
