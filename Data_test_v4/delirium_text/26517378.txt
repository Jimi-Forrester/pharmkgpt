26517378|t|Identification of 5-Methoxyflavone as a Novel DNA Polymerase-Beta Inhibitor and Neuroprotective Agent against Beta-Amyloid Toxicity.
26517378|a|Cell-cycle reactivation is a core feature of degenerating neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). A variety of stressors, including beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the case of AD, can force neurons to leave quiescence and to initiate an ectopic DNA replication process, leading to neuronal death rather than division. As the primary polymerase (pol) involved in neuronal DNA replication, DNA pol-beta contributes to neuronal death, and DNA pol-beta inhibitors may prove to be effective neuroprotective agents. Currently, specific and highly active DNA pol-beta inhibitors are lacking. Nine putative DNA pol-beta inhibitors were identified in silico by querying the ZINC database, containing more than 35 million purchasable compounds. Following pharmacological evaluation, only 5-methoxyflavone (1) was validated as an inhibitor of DNA pol-beta activity. Cultured primary neurons are a useful model to investigate the neuroprotective effects of potential DNA pol-beta inhibitors, since these neurons undergo DNA replication and death when treated with Abeta. Consistent with the inhibition of DNA pol-beta, 5-methoxyflavone (1) reduced the number of S-phase neurons and the ensuing apoptotic death triggered by Abeta. 5-Methoxyflavone (1) is the first flavonoid compound able to halt neurodegeneration via a definite molecular mechanism rather than through general antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
