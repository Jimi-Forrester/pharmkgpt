29480183|t|Low Prevalence of Cancer in Patients with Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration.
29480183|a|Several studies have reported reduced risk of cancer in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease. The relationship between cancer and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) has not been previously reported. Here, our aim was to evaluate the occurrence of cancer in Finnish FTLD patients with a high proportion of C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers in comparison to age- and sex-matched group of AD patients and control subjects classified as not cognitively impaired (NCI). The prevalence of cancer was 9.7% in FTLD, 18.7% in AD, and 17.4% in NCI (FTLD versus AD p = 0.012, FTLD versus NCI p = 0.029) groups. No differences were observed between C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers and non-carriers inside the FTLD group. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing significantly lower prevalence of cancer in FTLD patients compared to patients with AD or NCI subjects. Our data suggest an inverse association between neurodegeneration and cancer and that FTLD-specific mechanisms may underlie the especially strong inverse association observed in this study.
