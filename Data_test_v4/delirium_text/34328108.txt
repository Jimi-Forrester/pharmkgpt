34328108|a|Herbal antioxidant like curcumin holds great potential to treat neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's disease. However, its therapeutic potency is obstructed due to rapid metabolism, poor solubility, GI susceptibility, enzymatic degradation and lower bioavailability. Thus, the present work aimed to design and optimize curcumin-loaded NLC (CNL) with higher drug entrapment, prolonged release and better stability. CNL was prepared by modified melt emulsification method followed by ultrasonication. The formulation was optimized by 3 factor 3 level Box-Behnken design using solid: liquid lipid, surfactant concentration and ultrasonication time as independent variable while particle size, entrapment efficiency and % drug release as dependant variable. The design suggested 3.092 solid:liquid lipid, 2.131% surfactant and 4.757 min ultrasonication fit best to get the optimized formulation. The size of the optimized CNL was noted 124.37 +- 55.81 nm, which is in the acceptable range for brain delivery. SEM results also comply with this size range (near 150 nm) and demonstrated almost spherical and uniform particles with porous and uneven surface structures. PDI, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and % drug release were observed as 0.201 +- 0.00, - 17.2 +- 2.35 mV, 93.62 +- 0.68% and 92.73 +- 0.06%, respectively. The NLC demonstrated initial burst release with subsequent prolonged release of drug for 48 h. Weibull kinetic equation with 0.9958 R2, minimum AIC and maximum MSC value was found best fit to explain the release behavior. The beta exponent and diffusional coefficient (n) indicated combined release mechanism with Fickian diffusion as drug release mechanism. Formulation was also found stable at different storage condition.
