20641363|a|Benzodiazepines are used for their sedative, anxiolytic, and muscle-relaxant properties. Their mechanism of action involves the binding of a ligand to a specific benzodiazepine receptor. Alteration of the central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) has been reported in various diseases and pathologic conditions such as Alzheimer s disease, epilepsy, or cerebral ischemia (1-4). CBRs have been studied <i>in vivo</i> by positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography, and the existence of a specific benzodiazepine receptor linked to the g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor/chloride ionophore has been shown by use of diazepam (4). [<sup>11</sup>C]Flumazenil, a highly selective benzodiazepine antagonist, has been the most widely used agent for PET imaging of CBRs, but the short half-life of <sup>11</sup>C (20 min) limits its use. To overcome this great disadvantage, the flumazenil analog [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoroethyl 8-fluoro-5-methyl-6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4<i>H</i>-benzo-[<i>f</i>]imidazo[1,5-<i>a</i>][1,4]diazepine-3-carboxylate ([<sup>18</sup>F]fluoroflumazenil; [<sup>18</sup>F]FFMZ) has been developed and is currently under study. It can be conveniently synthesized and labeled, and preliminary research shows some favorable specific binding properties for CBRs.
