39886850|t|A feasibility study of KINDER: an elder mistreatment intervention for family caregivers of persons living with dementia.
39886850|a|Elder mistreatment occurs in as many as one-half of the 11 million family care partnerships with persons living with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (AD/ADRD) in the United States. Knowledge and Interpersonal Skills to Develop Enhanced Relationships is an 8-week psychoeducational intervention to prevent psychological mistreatment among family caregivers to persons living with dementia by building healthy caregiving relationships. The investigators conducted a single-arm pre- and posttest study to assess KINDER's feasibility. A total of 45 caregivers enrolled, among whom 37 completed the follow-up survey (82.2% retention). Caregivers attended an average of 2.1 of 3 discussion sessions (SD = 0.76). Paired t-test analyses comparing outcomes at baseline and post-intervention demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in psychological mistreatment and relationship strain, and an increase in resourcefulness skills. These findings suggest KINDER is a feasible low- to moderate-intensity intervention to prevent psychological mistreatment with AD/ADRD caregiving. Future research will test KINDER's efficacy.
