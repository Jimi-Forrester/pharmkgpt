36154329|t|Use of Valproic Acid for the Management of Delirium and Agitation in the Intensive Care Unit.
36154329|a|Purpose: Assess the efficacy and safety of valproic acid (VPA) for delirium and agitation in the intensive care unit (ICU) as compared to the use of other antipsychotics. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients treated for delirium and agitation in the ICU. Patients were included if they had a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale >=2 and Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU positive. Patients were split into two groups based on their VPA exposure. The primary outcome was delirium free days. Secondary outcomes included agitation free days, ICU length of stay (LOS), mechanical ventilation duration, and mortality. Results: One hundred eight patients were included, 49 patients in the VPA group and 59 patients in the control group. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome (difference -.15, 95% CI: 0.63-.93, P = .70). There were no significant differences in agitation-free days, mortality, mechanical ventilation duration, or ICU LOS. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that VPA is associated with similar delirium and agitation-free days compared to other non-VPA medications, with some adverse effects. Larger prospective studies are needed to validate the routine use of VPA in this setting.
