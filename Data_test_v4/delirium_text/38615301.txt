38615301|t|Clinical outcomes of clostridioides difficile infection in the very elderly.
38615301|a|BACKGROUND: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) causes considerable morbidity, mortality, and economic cost. Advanced age, prolonged stay in healthcare facility, and exposure to antibiotics are leading risk factors for CDI. Data on CDI clinical outcomes in the very elderly patients are limited. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized between 2016 and 2018 with CDI. We evaluated demographic clinical and laboratory parameters. Major clinical outcomes were evaluated including duration of hospital stay, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), in-hospital mortality, 30 days post-discharge mortality, and readmission/mortality composite outcome. We compared patients aged up to 80 years (elderly) to those of 80 years old or more (very elderly). RESULTS: Of 196 patients included in the study, 112 (57%) were very elderly with a mean age of 86 versus 67 years in the elderly group. The duration of hospital stays, and intensive care unit admission frequency were significantly reduced in the very elderly (13 vs. 22 days p = 0.003 and 1.8% vs. 10.7% p = 0.01, respectively). No significant difference was found in the frequencies of in-hospital and in 30 days post-discharge mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, the duration of hospital stay seemed to be shorter in the very elderly with no increase of in-hospital and post-discharge mortality. Although admitted less frequently to ICU, the in-hospital survival of the very elderly was not adversely affected compared to the elderly, suggesting that very advanced age per se should not be a major factor to consider in determining the prognosis of a patient with CDI.
