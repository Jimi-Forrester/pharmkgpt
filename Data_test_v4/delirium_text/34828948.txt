34828948|t|UPLC-MS/MS Profiling, Antioxidant, alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitory, Cholinesterase Inhibitory, and Cardiovascular Protection Potentials of Jialing 20 (Morus multicaulis Perr.) Mulberry Branch Extract.
34828948|a|As a by-product in the sericulture industry, mulberry branches are not currently utilized effectively. Jialing 20 is an artificial triploids mulberry that widely cultivated in southwest China. In this study, the chemical composition of the Jialing 20 mulberry branch extract (MBE) was first analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS, and 42 components, including alkaloids, flavonoids, and coumarins, were obtained. Then, the antioxidant activities, hypoglycemic effect, Alzheimer's disease inhibition, and cardiovascular protection of MBE were also evaluated in vitro. The IC50 values for the scavenging DPPH and ABTS radicals were, respectively, 31.23 +- 0.57 mug/mL and 8.88 +- 0.36 mug/mL (IC50 values of positive Vc were, respectively, 4.41 +- 0.19 mug/mL and 8.79 +- 0.41 mug/mL). The IC50 value for inhibiting alpha-glucosidase was 1.90 +- 0.05 mug/mL (IC50 value of positive acarbose was 0.03 mug/mL). The IC50 values for inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase were, respectively, 179.47 +- 0.38 mug/mL and 101.82 +- 3.37 mug/mL (IC50 values of positive berberine were, respectively, 1.27 +- 0.03 mug/mL and 57.41 +- 0.21 mug/mL). MBE (10 mug/mL and 40 mug/mL) significantly increased the survival rate of oxidized low-density lipoprotein- (ox-LDL) induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and significantly decreased the intracellular reactive oxygen species. These results suggest that the extracts of Jialing 20 mulberry branches could be used as a functional food additive.
