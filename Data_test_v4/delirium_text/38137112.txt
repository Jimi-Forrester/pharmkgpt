38137112|t|The Association between Kidney Function Biomarkers and Delayed Memory Impairments among Older Adults in the European North of Russia.
38137112|a|The prevention of memory decline requires better knowledge of biological markers. We studied the associations between kidney function biomarkers and memory decline (assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination-MMSE) in elderly individuals without dementia (MMSE 24-30, age 60-74 years, n = 643, Arkhangelsk, Russia). Participants were divided by sex and into three groups according to the delayed memory performance: recall of 0-1, 2, and 3 out of 3 words. The median of serum creatinine was 82 mumol/L in men who recalled 2 words and both medians in those recalling 3 and 0-1 words were 87 mumol/L. The 90th percentile for creatinine in men recalling 0-1 words (115.0 mumol/L) exceeded the upper limit of the normal range (110.5 mumol/L), while those who recalled 3 and 2 words had 90th percentiles within the normal range (109 and 101 mumol/L, respectively). Glomerular filtration rates were normal (>=60 mL/min/1.73 m2) with a median of 92.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 in men who recalled 2 words, 84.4 and 84.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 in men who recalled 3 and 0-1 words, respectively. None of these associations were observed in women. A reduced serum creatinine in older non-demented men may indicate the initial stages of memory decline, while the increased creatinine may reflect further stages of memory impairment.
