17560043|a|Several studies suggest a pivotal role of amyloid beta (Abeta)(1-42) and nitric oxide (NO) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. NO also possess central neuromodulatory properties. To study the soluble Abeta(1-42) effects on dopamine concentrations in rat prefrontal cortex, microdialysis technique was used. We showed that i.c.v. injection or retrodialysis Abeta(1-42) administration reduced basal and K(+)-stimulated dopamine levels, measured 2 and 48 h after peptide administration. Immunofluorescent experiments revealed that after 48 h from i.c.v. injection Abeta(1-42) was no longer detectable in the ventricular space. We then evaluated the role of NO on Abeta(1-42)-induced reduction in dopamine concentrations. Subchronic L-arginine administration decreased basal dopamine levels, measured either 2 h after i.c.v. Abeta(1-42) or on day 2 post-injection, whereas subchronic 7-nitroindazole administration increased basal dopamine concentrations, measured 2 h after i.c.v. Abeta(1-42) injection, and decreased them when measured on day 2 post-Abeta(1-42)-injection. No dopaminergic response activity was observed after K(+) stimulation in all groups. These results suggest that the dopaminergic system seems to be acutely vulnerable to soluble Abeta(1-42) effects. Finally, the opposite role of NO occurring at different phases might be regarded as a possible link between Abeta(1-42)-induced effects and dopaminergic dysfunction.
