35566562|a|BACKGROUND: The dissemination of recommendations on low-value care alone may not lead to physicians' behavioral changes. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a multifaceted behavioral intervention among internal medicine residents could reduce low-value care in hospitalized patients. METHODS: A pre-post quality improvement intervention was conducted at the Internal Medicine Division of La Tour hospital (Geneva, Switzerland) from May 2020 to October 2021. The intervention period (3 months) consisted of a multifaceted informational intervention with audits and educative feedback about low-value care. The pre- and post-intervention periods including the same six calendar months were compared in terms of number of blood samples per patient day, prescription rates of benzodiazepines (BZDs) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), as well as safety indicators including potentially avoidable readmissions, premature deaths and complications. RESULTS: A total of 3400 patients were included in this study; 1095 (32.2%) and 1155 (34.0%) were, respectively, hospitalized during the pre- and post-intervention periods. Patient characteristics were comparable between the two periods. Only the number of blood tests per patient day and the BZD prescription rate at discharge were significantly reduced in the post-intervention phase (pre: 0.54 +- 0.43 vs. post: 0.49 +- 0.60, p <= 0.001; pre: 4.2% vs. post: 1.7%, p = 0.003, respectively). PPI prescription rates remained comparable. Safety indicators analyses revealed no significant differences between the two periods of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a modest but statistically significant effect of a multifaceted educative intervention in reducing the number of blood tests and the BZD prescription rate at discharge in hospitalized patients. Limiting low-value services is very challenging and additional long-term interventions are necessary for wider implementation.
