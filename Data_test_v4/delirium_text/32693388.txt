32693388|t|RNA-seq analysis of the key long noncoding RNAs and mRNAs related to cognitive impairment after cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
32693388|a|Cardiac arrest (CA) is the leading cause of death around the world. Survivors after CA and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) develop moderate to severe cognitive impairment up to 60% at 3 months. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) played a pivotal role in ischemic brain injury. This study aimed to identify potential key lncRNAs associated with early cognitive deficits after CA/CPR. LncRNA and mRNA expression profiles of the hippocampus in CA/CPR or sham group were analyzed via high-throughput RNA sequencing, which exhibited 1920 lncRNAs and 1162 mRNAs were differentially expressed. These differentially expressed genes were confirmed to be primarily associated with inflammatory or apoptotic signaling pathways through GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and coding-noncoding co-expression network analysis. Among which, five key pairs of lncRNA-mRNA were further analyzed by qRT-PCR and western blot. We found that the lncRNANONMMUT113601.1 and mRNA Shc1, an inflammation and apoptosis-associated gene, exhibited the most significant changes in hippocampus of CA/CPR mice. Furthermore, we found that the correlations between this lncRNA and mRNA mainly happened in neurons of hippocampus by in situ hybridization. These results suggested that the critical pairs of lncRNA-mRNA may act as essential regulators in early cognitive deficits after resuscitation.
