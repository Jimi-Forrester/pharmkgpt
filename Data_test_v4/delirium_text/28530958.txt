28530958|t|Negative Symptoms in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease.
28530958|a|This study applies the concept of "negative symptoms," previously used in schizophrenia, to dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and examines the relationship of negative symptoms to cognitive deficits and depression. The negative symptom subscale of the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS-N), the Hamilton Depression Scale (Ham-D), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were administered to 26 patients with DAT and to 13 normal control subjects. The mean PANSS-N score in DAT patients was significantly higher than in control subjects. DAT patients demonstrated significant correlation between negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. Ham-D scores did not significantly correlate with MMSE or PANSS-N scores. These results indicate that negative symptoms are prevalent in DAT and do not result from depression.
