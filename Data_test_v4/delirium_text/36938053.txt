36938053|a|Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi is a valuable medicinal plant of the Lamiaceae family. The roots, Scutellariae baicalensis radix, are valued in the traditional medicine of East Asia and are also listed in several pharmacopeias, such as the Chinese and European versions. The roots contain a high amount of flavones, such as baicalein, wogonin and their glucuronides, baicalin and wogonoside, respectively, with rare structures of unsubstituted B-ring. These major constituents are responsible for its pharmacological activity, mainly anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antitumor, as well as BDZ-receptor modulating. There is a fast-growing demand for both the crude drug and the individual flavonoids obtained from it. However, the variability of content and composition of flavonoids in the roots is significant and affects pharmaceutical use, and little is known about the influence of various factors on root quality. In our experiments, we use aeroponics to determine the effect of electroporation as an abiotic stressor on plant growth, development, and root mass, as well as on its metabolic profile. Results: Electroporation significantly impacted plant growth and the content of flavonoids, especially baicalein and wogonin, depending on the treatment parameters. Concentrations of aglycones were increased in at least half of the treatment conditions. The greatest amounts (a 2.5-fold increase compared to controls) were recorded after applying an electrical field characterized by the following parameters: E = 3 kV/cm, t = 100 mus, and N = 10. In conclusion, electrostimulation is an innovative and efficient way to increase plant growth and yield in an aeroponic system, as well as modulate the profile and content of bioactive flavones in the roots. However, the fine-tuning of these parameters, such as the electrical field strength (E), length (t), and number (N) of impulses delivered, is of great importance. It was also shown that cultivation of the experimental plants in aeroponics had a positive impact on their survival and development while being a sustainable and efficient horticultural practice.
