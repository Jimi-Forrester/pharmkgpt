39744183|a|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent condition that affects individuals worldwide and is one of the leading causes of disability. Nevertheless, the underlying pathological mechanisms of OA remain inadequately understood. Current treatments for OA include non-drug therapies, pharmacological interventions, and surgical procedures. These treatments are mainly focused on alleviating clinical manifestations and improving patients' quality of life, but are not effective in limiting the progression of OA. The detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of OA is extremely significant for the development of OA treatment. Metabolic syndrome has become a great challenge for medicine and public health, In recent years, several studies have demonstrated that the metabolic syndrome and its individual components play a crucial role in OA. Consequently, this review summarizes the mechanisms and research progress on how metabolic syndrome and its components affect OA. The aim is to gain a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of OA and explore effective treatment strategies.
