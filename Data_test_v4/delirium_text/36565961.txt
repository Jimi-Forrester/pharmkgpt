36565961|a|Caring for the elderly has always been challenging for the intensive care unit (ICU) physician. Concerns like frailty, comorbidities, polypharmacy and advanced directives come up even before admission into the unit. The COVID-19 pandemic has put forward a variety of issues concerning elderly populations, making the topic more relevant than ever. Admittance to the ICU, an unequivocally multifactorial decision, requires special consideration from the side of the physician when caring for an elderly person. Patients' wishes are to be respected and thus given priority. Triage assessment must also account for age-related physiological alterations and functional status. Once in the ICU, special attention should be given to age-related specificities, such as therapeutic interventions' controversial role, infection susceptibility, and post-operative care, that could potentially alter the course of hospitalization and affect outcomes. Following ICU discharge, ensuring proper rehabilitation for both survivors and their caregivers can improve long-term outcomes and subsequent quality of life. The pandemic and its implications may limit the standard of care for the elderly requiring ICU support. Socioeconomic factors that further perplex the situation must be addressed. Elderly patients currently represent a vast expanding population in ICU. Tailoring safe treatment plans to match patients' wishes, and personalized needs will guide critical care for the elderly from this time forward.
