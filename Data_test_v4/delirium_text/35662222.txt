35662222|a|Accumulating studies have demonstrated that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment alleviates spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the underlying mechanism by which HBO alleviates SCI remains to be elucidated. In this study, we performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling of the spinal cord between SCI mice and mice that received HBO treatment by high-throughput RNA sequencing at 1 week after SCI. We also compared genome-wide transcriptional profiles from SCI mice and sham-operated mice. We found 76 differentially co-expressed genes in sham-operated mice, SCI mice, and HBO-treated SCI mice. Using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis, we identified the biological characteristics of these differentially expressed genes from the perspectives of cell component, biological process, and molecular function. We also found enriched functional pathways including ferroptosis, calcium signaling pathway, serotonergic synapse, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 signaling pathway, cholinergic synapse, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. We performed quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and validated that HBO treatment decreased the expression of Hspb1 (heat shock protein beta 1), Hmox1 (heme oxygenase 1), Ftl1 (ferritin light polypeptide 1), Tnc (tenascin C) and Igfbp3 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3) and increased the expression of Slc5a7 (solute carrier family 5 choline transporter member 7) after SCI. These results revealed the genome-wide transcriptional profile of the injured spinal cord after HBO treatment. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism by which HBO treats SCI and may provide new targets for SCI intervention.
