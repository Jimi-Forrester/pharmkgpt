38434827|t|DNA Hyperstructure.
38434827|a|This study presents a new procedure to condense DNA molecules and precipitate them onto a glass slide. The resulting DNA molecules undergo autonomous self-assembly, creating closed superstructures on the micrometer scale, which are called DNA hyperstructures. These structures can be observed using low-magnification (4x) light microscopy. Precisely controlling the alcohol/glacial acetic acid ratio and DNA concentration during precipitation enabled the regulation of structure compaction on the slide. The alcohol/glacial acetic acid ratio is inversely proportional to the DNA concentration to achieve optimal compaction on the slide. Confocal microscopy fluorescence analysis of DNA extracts stained with DAPI shows that nucleic acids self-assemble to form structures during precipitation on the slide. This methodology is relevant since it facilitates the precipitation and visualization of DNA, regardless of its origin or molecular weight. To confirm its versatility, results with DNA extracted from human peripheral blood, the Lambda virus, and plasmid pBR322 are presented. The study examined the morphological features of DNA hyperstructures in both healthy individuals and those diagnosed with different medical conditions or illnesses, revealing distinct patterns specific to each case. This innovative technology has potential for disease detection in peripheral blood samples, ranging from cancer and Alzheimer's disease to determining the gender of the gestational product at an early stage.
