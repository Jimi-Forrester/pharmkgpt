38103330|t|Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel capsaicin-tacrine hybrids as multi-target agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
38103330|a|A series of novel hybrid compounds were designed, synthesized, and utilized as multi-target drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) by connecting capsaicin and tacrine moieties. The biological assays indicated that most of these compounds demonstrated strong inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) activities with IC50 values in the nanomolar, as well as good blood-brain barrier permeability. Among the synthesized hybrids, compound 5s displayed the most balanced inhibitory effect on hAChE (IC50 = 69.8 nM) and hBuChE (IC50 = 68.0 nM), and exhibited promising inhibitory activity against beta-secretase-1 (BACE-1) (IC50 = 3.6 microM). Combining inhibition kinetics and molecular model analysis, compound 5s was shown to be a mixed inhibitor affecting both the catalytic active site (CAS) and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of hAChE. Additionally, compound 5s showed low toxicity in PC12 and BV2 cell assays. Moreover, compound 5s demonstrated good tolerance at the dose of up to 2500 mg/kg and exhibited no hepatotoxicity at the dose of 3 mg/kg in mice, and it could effectively improve memory ability in mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that compound 5s is a promising and effective multi-target agent for the potential treatment of AD.
