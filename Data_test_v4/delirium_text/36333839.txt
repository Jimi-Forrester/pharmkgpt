36333839|a|OBJECTIVES: Social distancing restrictions in the COVID-19 pandemic may have had adverse effects on older adults' mental health. Whereby the impact on mood is well-described, less is known about psychotic symptoms. The aim of this study was to compare characteristics associated with psychotic symptoms during the first UK lockdown and a pre-pandemic comparison period. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study we analysed anonymised records from patients referred to mental health services for older adults in South London in the 16-week period of the UK lockdown starting in March 2020, and in the comparable pre-pandemic period in 2019. We used logistic regression models to compare the associations of different patient characteristics with increased odds of presenting with any psychotic symptom (defined as hallucinations and/or delusion), hallucinations, or delusions, during lockdown and the corresponding pre-pandemic period. RESULTS: 1991 referrals were identified. There were fewer referrals during lockdown but a higher proportion of presentations with any psychotic symptom (48.7% vs. 42.8%, p = 0.018), particularly hallucinations (41.0% vs. 27.8%, p < 0.001). Patients of non-White ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-2.99) and patients with dementia (adjusted OR: 3.09; 95% CI: 1.91-4.99) were more likely to be referred with psychotic symptoms during lockdown. While a weaker association between dementia and psychotic symptoms was found in the pre-COVID period (adjusted OR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.19-2.03), interaction terms indicated higher odds of patients of non-White ethnicity or dementia to present with psychosis during the lockdown period. CONCLUSIONS: During lockdown, referrals to mental health services for adults decreased, but contained a higher proportion with psychotic symptoms. The stronger association with psychotic symptoms in non-White ethnic groups and patients with dementia during lockdown suggests that barriers in accessing care might have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.
