36738662|a|BACKGROUND: Mobility is an important component of functioning. Motor and cognitive impairment in older people with Alzheimer's disease can exert a negative impact on life-space mobility. OBJECTIVE: To compare life-space mobility in older adults with mild and moderate Alzheimer-type dementia and those without dementia and determine associations with health factors. METHODS: Life-space mobility was assessed using the Life Space Assessment (LSA) in 33 older adults with Alzheimer-type dementia (AD group) and 24 older adults without dementia (WD group). The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Modified Baecke Questionnaire for Older Adults (MBQOA), and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) were completed. Statistical analysis was performed with unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney tests for comparisons between groups and Spearman's correlation test. RESULTS: The AD group had a lower total LSA score compared to the WD group (44 vs 65, mean difference = -20.7 [95% CI: -28.6, -12.9]), 21% of the AD group were restricted to their homes when no assistance was available. In both groups, moderate correlations were found between LSA and both functioning and physical activity level. Symptoms of depression presented moderate correlation only in the WD group. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with AD have lower life-space mobility and require assistance to achieve higher levels of mobility. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: LSA can help assess life-space mobility. Encouraging and enabling assistance is fundamental to a greater life-space for older adults with dementia.
