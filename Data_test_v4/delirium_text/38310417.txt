38310417|a|As of December 2020, millions of people have been immunized using vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. A wide range of neurological adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been reported so far. Here, we report a 23-year-old male who experienced psychiatric symptoms, loss of consciousness, language disintegration, and incontinency that happened 10 days after the first dosage of the COVID-19 AstraZeneca vaccine. Anti-NMDAR Encephalitis was diagnosed based on the results of the autoimmune panel. The patient responded to intravenous dexamethasone very well and experienced no other complications in 6 months of follow-up. Scientific reports of neurological side effects such as anti-NMDAR encephalitis after vaccination are necessary to optimize the safety and effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
