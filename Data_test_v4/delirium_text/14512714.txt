14512714|a|The main objective was to investigate the acetylcholinesterase E (AChE) activity in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with three common dementia disorders. We also wanted to investigate the influence of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 allele possession and CSF-tau level on the CSF-AChE activity in these patients. The study included 17 consecutive patients with subcortical vascular dementia (SVD), 39 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 14 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and 12 controls. CSF was obtained by lumbar puncture and CSF-AChE activity was measured by an enzyme antigen immunoassay. CSF-AchE activity was significantly decreased compared to controls only in the SVD group (p = 0.010). The CSF-tau level was increased in the AD group compared to the control (p < 0.01) and FTD groups (p < 0.05). No influence of ApoE epsilon4 allele possession on CSF-AChE activity was found. It is suggested that abnormal CSF-AChE activity in patients with SVD reflects a disturbance in the cholinergic system.
