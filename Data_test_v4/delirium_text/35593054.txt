35593054|t|Expression of Ectonucleoside Triphosphate Diphosphohydrolase 2 (NTPDase2) Is Negatively Regulated Under Neuroinflammatory Conditions In Vivo and In Vitro.
35593054|a|Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2 (NTPDase2) hydrolyzes extracellular ATP to ADP, which is the ligand for P2Y1,12,13 receptors. The present study describes the distribution of NTPDase2 in adult rat brains in physiological conditions, and in hippocampal neurodegeneration induced by trimethyltin (TMT). The study also describes the regulation of NTPDase2 by inflammatory mediators in primary astrocytes and oligodendroglial cell line OLN93. In physiological conditions, NTPDase2 protein was most abundant in the hippocampus, where it was found in fibrous astrocytes and synaptic endings in the synaptic-rich hippocampal layers. In TMT-induced neurodegeneration, NTPDase2-mRNA acutely decreased at 2-dpi and then gradually recovered to the control level at 7-dpi and 21-dpi. As determined by immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence, the decrease was most pronounced in the dentate gyrus (DG), where NTPDase2 withdrew from the synaptic boutons in the polymorphic layer of DG, whereas the recovery of the expression was most profound in the subgranular layer. Concerning the regulation of NTPDase2 gene expression, proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1beta, TNFalpha, and IFNgamma negatively regulated the expression of NTPDase2 in OLN93 cells, while did not altering the expression in primary astrocytes. Different cell-intrinsic stressors, such as depletion of intracellular energy store, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and activation of protein kinase C, also massively disturbed the expression of the NTPDase2 gene. Together, our results suggest that the expression and the activity of NTPDase2 transiently cease in neurodegeneration and brain injury, most likely as a part of the acute adaptive response designed to promote cell defense, survival, and recovery.
