12960744|a|Australian research in psychiatric genetics covers molecular genetic studies of depression, anxiety, alcohol dependence, Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. For each disorder, a variety of clinical cohorts have been recruited including affected sib pair families, trios, case/controls, and twins from a large population-based twin registry. These studies are taking place both independently and in collaboration with international groups. Microarray studies now complement DNA investigations, while animal models are in development. An Australian government genome facility provides a high throughput genotyping and mutation detection service to the Australian scientific community, enhancing the contribution of Australian psychiatric genetics groups to gene discovery.
