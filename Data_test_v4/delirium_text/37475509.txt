37475509|t|Assessment of a Modified MINDS-based Protocol for Management of Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome on an Inpatient Medical Service.
37475509|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine if a novel symptom-based alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) protocol in a US Veterans cohort leads to significant clinical improvements in patient outcomes and safety. BACKGROUND: Prior studies of AWS management, oftentimes using the revised version of the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) index, have demonstrated the effectiveness of symptom-triggered therapy for AWS. The Minnesota Detoxification Scale (MINDS) is an alternative to the CIWA-Ar index but remains unevaluated outside of the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. This study assesses outcomes in AWS management prior to and after the implementation of a novel MINDS-based AWS protocol (SDAWP) utilizing a revised MINDS index (MINDS-rev) in an inpatient medical ward setting. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study including encounters prior to (n = 342) and after (n = 338) the implementation of the protocol. Pre- and post- protocol encounters were selected by combinations of diagnostic codes and charting elements. Outcome measures of AWS management were obtained in both groups. The primary endpoint was median total benzodiazepine exposure. Secondary outcomes included median length of hospitalization, median duration of benzodiazepine administration, and the incidence of complications. RESULTS: The median total benzodiazepine exposure in the post-SDAWP group was significantly lower than the pre- SDAWP group (21.2 vs 12.0 mg, p < 0.0001) and for a significantly shorter median duration of time (4.0 vs 3.0 days, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the median length of stay (4.0 vs 4.0 days, p 0.50). The incidence of delirium tremens (21 vs 7, p 0.01) and need for transfer to a higher level of care (33 vs 12, p 0.002) was significantly lower in the post-SDAWP group. CONCLUSION: The SDAWP has provided significant improvements in AWS management in our institution and may potentially serve as a template for wider use in other inpatient settings.
