38324518|a|INTRODUCTION: India, with its rapidly aging population, faces an alarming burden of dementia. We implemented DSM-5 criteria in large-scale, nationally representative survey data in India to characterize the prevalence of mild and major Neurocognitive disorder. METHODS: The Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI-DAD) (N = 4,096) is a nationally representative cohort study in India using multistage area probability sampling methods. Using neuropsychological testing and informant reports, we defined DSM-5 mild and major neurocognitive disorder, reported its prevalence, and evaluated criterion and construct validity of the algorithm using clinician-adjudicated Clinical Dementia Ratings (CDR) . RESULTS: The prevalence of mild and major neurocognitive disorder, weighted to the population, is 17.6% and 7.2%. Demographic gradients with respect to age and education conform to hypothesized patterns. Among N = 2,390 participants with a clinician-adjudicated CDR, CDR ratings and DSM-5 classification agreed for N = 2,139 (89.5%) participants. DISCUSSION: The prevalence of dementia in India is higher than previously recognized. These findings, coupled with a growing number of older adults in the coming decades in India, have important implications for society, public health, and families. We are aware of no previous Indian population-representative estimates of mild cognitive impairment, a group which will be increasingly important in coming years to identify for potential therapeutic treatment.
