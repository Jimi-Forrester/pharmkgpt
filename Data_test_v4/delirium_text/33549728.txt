33549728|a|Astaxanthin is a natural C40 carotenoid with numerous reported biological functions, most of them associated with its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, standing out from other antioxidants as it has shown the highest oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), 100-500 times higher than  -tocopherol and a 10 times higher free radical inhibitory activity than related antioxidants (alpha-tocopherol, alpha-carotene, beta -carotene, lutein and lycopene). In vitro and in vivo studies have associated astaxanthin's unique molecular features with several health benefits, including neuroprotective, cardioprotective and antitumoral properties, suggesting its therapeutic potential for the prevention or co-treatment of dementia, Alzheimer, Parkinson, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Benefits on skin and eye health promotion have also been reported, highlighting its potential for the prevention of skin photo-aging and the treatment of eye diseases like glaucoma, cataracts and uveitis. In this review, we summarize and discuss the currently available evidence on astaxanthin benefits, with a particular focus on human clinical trials, including a brief description of the potential mechanisms of action responsible for its biological activities.
