37534092|t|The dose-response relationships of the direct scavenging activity of amide-based local anesthetics against multiple free radicals.
37534092|a|This study aimed to illustrate the dose-response relationships of the direct scavenging activity of amide-based local anesthetics against multiple free radicals in vitro. We have demonstrated that amide-type local anesthetics selectively and directly scavenge some free radicals. Three kinds of free radicals were eliminated by all the four local anesthetics examined. Mepivacaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, and dibucaine scavenged hydroxyl radicals in dose-dependent manners. Ascorbyl free radicals were also scavenged in dose-dependent manners, and lastly singlet oxygen was scavenged in dose-dependent manners. Three other free radicals were not scavenged by all of the four local anesthetics; tert-butoxyl radical was scavenged by all the anesthetics examined but dibucaine, nitric oxide by mepivacaine but not by the other three, and tyrosyl radical by mepivacaine and lidocaine but not by the other two. Some free radicals (superoxide anion, tert-butyl peroxyl radical, DPPH) were not scavenged by any of the four local anesthetics. The local anesthetics were also shown to inhibit lipid peroxidation by TBARS assay. These results suggest that local anesthetics have antioxidant properties through their free radical scavenging activities.
