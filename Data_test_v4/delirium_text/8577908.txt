8577908|a|In this efficacy the study of diazepam loading-dose treatment of delirium tremens was evaluated in comparison with traditional therapeutic methods. Experimental and control groups consisted of 42 and 40 patients respectively. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms was evaluated from clinical status, in the experimental group CIWA-A score was also employed. Study results suggest high efficacy of the loading-dose method, which was characterized by significant shortening of psychosis duration (five times shorter in experimental vs. control group). The method turned out to be safe, no complications were observed during and after the treatment.
