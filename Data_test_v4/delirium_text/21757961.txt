21757961|t|Inflammatory markers and neuropsychological functioning: the Framingham Heart Study.
21757961|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: We hypothesized that inflammatory markers are cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with neuropsychological indicators of early ischemia and Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Framingham Offspring Study participants, free of clinical stroke or dementia (n = 1,878; 60 +- 9 years; 54% women), underwent neuropsychological assessment and ascertainment of 11 inflammatory markers. Follow-up neuropsychological assessments (6.3 +- 1.0 years) were conducted on 1,352 of the original 1,878 participants. RESULTS: Multivariable linear regression related the inflammatory markers to cross-sectional performance and longitudinal change in neuropsychological performances. Secondary models included a twelfth factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), available on a subset of the sample (n = 1,393 cross-sectional; n = 1,213 longitudinal). Results suggest a few modest cross-sectional inflammatory and neuropsychological associations, particularly for tests assessing visual organization (C-reactive protein, p = 0.007), and a few modest relations between inflammatory markers and neuropsychological change, particularly for executive functioning (TNF-alpha, p = 0.004). Secondary analyses suggested that inflammatory markers were cross-sectionally (TNF-alpha, p = 0.004) related to reading performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are largely negative, but suggest that specific inflammatory markers may have limited associations with poorer cognition and reading performance among community-dwelling adults. Because of multiple testing concerns, our limited positive findings are offered as hypothesis generating and require replication in other studies.
