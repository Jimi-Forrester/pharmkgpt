10559562|a|Human apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) is genetically polymorphic, the apoA-IV polymorphism being controlled by two alleles, apoA-IV1 and apoA-IV2. The association between the apoA-IV2 allele and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) has been reported in Caucasian populations. We investigated the codon 360 mutation of the apoA-IV gene allele frequency in 173 LOAD and in 158 age-matched control subjects of the Japanese population, and we found that the allele frequency of apoA-IV2 in the Japanese population was very rare and was extremely lower than in Caucasian populations. We conclude that there was no association between apoA-IV genotype and LOAD in the Japanese population. Copyrightz1999S.KargerAG,Basel
