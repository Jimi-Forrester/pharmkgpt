24339874|a|The chemokine Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) are widely used indicators of glial activation and neuroinflammation and are up-regulated in many brain disorders. These inflammatory mediators have been widely studied in rodent models of brain disorders, but less work has been undertaken using human brain cells. In this study we investigate the regulation of HLA and IP-10, as well as other cytokines and chemokines, in microglia, astrocytes, pericytes, and meningeal fibroblasts derived from biopsy and autopsy adult human brain, using immunocytochemistry and a Cytometric Bead Array. Interferongamma (IFNgamma) increased microglial HLA expression, but contrary to data in rodents, the anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) did not inhibit this increase in HLA, nor did TGFbeta1 affect basal microglial HLA expression or IFNgamma-induced astrocytic HLA expression. In contrast, IFNgamma-induced and basal microglial HLA expression, but not IFNgamma-induced astrocytic HLA expression, were strongly inhibited by macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). IFNgamma also strongly induced HLA expression in pericytes and meningeal fibroblasts, which do not basally express HLA, and this induction was completely blocked by TGFbeta1, but not affected by M-CSF. In contrast, TGFbeta1 did not block the IFNgamma-induced increase in IP-10 in pericytes and meningeal fibroblasts. These results show that IFNgamma, TGFbeta1 and M-CSF have species- and cell type-specific effects on human brain cells that may have implications for their roles in adult human brain inflammation.
