39604645|a|The choroid plexus not only secretes the majority of cerebrospinal fluid but also controls the circadian rhythm, which can be impaired in the presence of neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, many studies have reported the contribution of choroid plexus abnormalities to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks were obtained from the lateral ventricles of the brains of four subjects with AD, four with vascular dementia, four with Parkinson's disease, three with multiple system atrophy, and five control patients with unremarkable neuropathological findings. They were sectioned and routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Morphological analysis of epithelial cells in 10 high-power fields or a total area per case was conducted using digital images. There were no significant changes in any of the measurements: epithelial cell area, long and short axes, and ratio of the epithelial cell area to total stained area among the five groups. However, a simple linear regression analysis of epithelial cells in 20 patients showed that age was significantly correlated with the cell area, long axis, and short axis but not ratio. There were no effects of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or calcification in the stroma on the measurements. These findings indicate that age was associated with the cell area and size in choroid plexus epithelial cells, whereas no significant changes in any epithelial cell measurements were present in neurodegenerative diseases.
