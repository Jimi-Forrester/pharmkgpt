39702132|a|BACKGROUND: Although dyslipidemia has been acknowledged as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the effects of lipid-lowering drugs on AD have not been determined. The primary pathophysiological hallmark of AD is the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques in the brain. Plasma Abeta levels are influenced by the transport of Abeta from the central nervous system to the peripheral blood. This study investigates the effects of Probucol, a lipid-lowering and antioxidant drug, on plasma Abeta transport. METHODS: A total of 120 hyperlipidemic patients with normal cognition were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive either Probucol (1000 mg daily for 12 weeks) or a placebo. Plasma Abeta, soluble receptor of advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), and fasting lipid profiles were measured at baseline and every 6 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 108 participants completed the study, with 55 in the Probucol group. The cohort consisted of 58 (53.7%) women, with a mean age of 58.4 +- 8.0 (range, 45-80) years. After 12 weeks of treatment, the changes in plasma Abeta42 and sRAGE levels significantly differed between the Probucol and placebo groups (DeltaAbeta42: beta = 6.827, P = 0.030; DeltasRAGE: beta = 98.668, P = 0.004). Furthermore, DeltasRAGE was positively correlated with the change in Abeta42 (beta = 0.018, P = 0.048). When adjusted for DeltasRAGE, the effect of Probucol on plasma Abeta42 levels was attenuated (beta = 5.065, P = 0.116). In the Probucol group only, DeltasRAGE was significantly correlated with oxidized low-density lipoproteins (beta = 4.27, P = 0.011), total cholesterol (beta = 67.50, P = 0.046), and low-density lipoproteins (beta = - 91.01, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral administration of Probucol (1000 mg) for 12 weeks significantly increased plasma Abeta42 levels, likely through modulation of sRAGE. This effect may be attributed to the antioxidant and lipid-lowering properties of Probucol. These findings suggest that Probucol could potentially serve as a protective agent against the pathological processes of AD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry platform in June 2019 (Trial registration number: ChiCTR-1900023542).
