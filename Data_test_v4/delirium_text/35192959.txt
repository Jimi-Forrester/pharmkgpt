35192959|t|The retina: A window in which to view the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
35192959|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most familiar type of dementia affecting elderly populations worldwide. Studies of AD patients and AD transgenic mice have revealed alterations in the retina similar to alterations which occur in the AD brain. Moreover, AD retinal pathology occurs even earlier than AD brain pathology. Importantly, non-invasive imaging techniques can be utilized for retinal observation due to the unique optical transparency of the eye, which acts as a convenient window in which preclinical pathology in the AD brain can be monitored. In this review, we overview the existing literature covering different forms of AD retinal pathology and propose a basis for the clinical application of using the retina as a window to view AD during preclinical and clinical stages.
