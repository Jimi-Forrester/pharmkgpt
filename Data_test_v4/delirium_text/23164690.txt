23164690|a|Oligomers of beta-amyloid (Abeta) are implicated in the early memory impairment seen in Alzheimer's disease before to the onset of discernable neurodegeneration. Here, the capacity of a novel orally bioavailable, central nervous system-penetrating small molecule 5-aryloxypyrimidine, SEN1500, to prevent cell-derived (7PA2 [conditioned medium] CM) Abeta-induced deficits in synaptic plasticity and learned behavior was assessed. Biochemically, SEN1500 bound to Abeta monomer and oligomers, produced a reduction in thioflavin-T fluorescence, and protected a neuronal cell line and primary cortical neurons exposed to synthetic soluble oligomeric Abeta(1-42). Electrophysiologically, SEN1500 alleviated the in vitro depression of long-term potentiation induced by both synthetic Abeta(1-42) and 7PA2 CM, and alleviated the in vivo depression of long-term potentiation induced by 7PA2 CM, after systemic administration. Behaviorally, oral administration of SEN1500 significantly reduced memory-related deficits in operant responding induced after intracerebroventricular injection of 7PA2 CM. SEN1500 reduced cytotoxicity, acute synaptotoxicity, and behavioral deterioration after in vitro and in vivo exposure to synthetic Abeta and 7PA2 CM, and shows promise for development as a clinically viable disease-modifying Alzheimer's disease treatment.
