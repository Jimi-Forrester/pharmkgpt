36121610|t|Biotechnological Applications of Probiotics: A Multifarious Weapon to Disease and Metabolic Abnormality.
36121610|a|Consumption of live microorganisms "Probiotics" for health benefits and well-being is increasing worldwide. Their use as a therapeutic approach to confer health benefits has fascinated humans for centuries; however, its conceptuality gradually evolved with methodological advancement, thereby improving our understanding of probiotics-host interaction. However, the emerging concern regarding safety aspects of live microbial is enhancing the interest in non-viable or microbial cell extracts, as they could reduce the risks of microbial translocation and infection. Due to technical limitations in the production and formulation of traditionally used probiotics, the scientific community has been focusing on discovering new microbes to be used as probiotics. In many scientific studies, probiotics have been shown as potential tools to treat metabolic disorders such as obesity, type-2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, digestive disorders (e.g., acute and antibiotic-associated diarrhea), and allergic disorders (e.g., eczema) in infants. However, the mechanistic insight of strain-specific probiotic action is still unknown. In the present review, we analyzed the scientific state-of-the-art regarding the mechanisms of probiotic action, its physiological and immuno-modulation on the host, and new direction regarding the development of next-generation probiotics. We discuss the use of recently discovered genetic tools and their applications for engineering the probiotic bacteria for various applications including food, biomedical applications, and other health benefits. Finally, the review addresses the future development of biological techniques in combination with clinical and preclinical studies to explain the molecular mechanism of action, and discover an ideal multifunctional probiotic bacterium.
