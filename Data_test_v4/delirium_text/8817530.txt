8817530|t|Neurogenesis in adult human.
8817530|a|This report describes neurogenesis in the adult human olfactory epithelium in vitro. Olfactory epithelium was collected at autopsy and by biopsy, and grown in serum-free medium. Basic fibroblast growth factor induced the differentiation of bipolar cells which were immunopositive for several neuronal proteins but not glial proteins. [3H]thymidine autoradiography confirmed that these neurones were born in vitro. The results demonstrate that the adult human olfactory epithelium retains the capacity for neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, at least until the age of 72 years. It is now possible to examine neurones and neurogenesis in biopsies from patients with disorders that may involve a neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative aetiology such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and Alzheimer's disease.
