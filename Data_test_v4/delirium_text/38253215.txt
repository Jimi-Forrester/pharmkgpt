38253215|t|"Beyond Feasibility": A Qualitative Study of Patients, Their Whanau (Family) and Staff Perspectives and Experiences of a Non- Pharmacological Delirium-Prevention Intervention in Two Aotearoa/New Zealand Hospices.
38253215|a|CONTEXT: Delirium is prevalent in the hospice population. Despite causing significant distress to patients and families, delirium is under-recognised. There is a need to better understand delirium prevention and outcomes in this population including people's experiences of delirium-prevention strategies in different cultural contexts. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the "PRESERVE Aotearoa" delirium prevention intervention was feasible and acceptable for Maori (indigenous peoples of Aotearoa/ New Zealand) and non-Maori patients with advanced cancer, their families (called whanau in this paper), and clinical staff. METHODS: A qualitative semistructured interview substudy of a cohort PRESERVE Aotearoa feasibility study codesigned with a Maori partner to ensure inclusion of Maori-centred values. The study was underpinned conceptually by He Awa Whiria (braided rivers)-combining Western and Maori knowledges. Data were analysed using Hopwood and Srivasta's framework. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients and their whanau, 21 clinical staff and five researchers from two stand-alone hospices in the North Island, Aotearoa/New Zealand. Finding showed that, for the most part, participants considered the study interventions feasible and acceptable. Inductive analysis resulted in four themes highlighting the importance to whanau of their participation in the study: benefits of learning about delirium; the affirmation of the caregiver role and whanau-centred care; valuing fundamentals of care; and research as legacy. CONCLUSION: This qualitative study found that it is feasible and acceptable to study multicomponent nonpharmacological delirium-prevention interventions in Aotearoa/New Zealand hospice inpatient units. The study also highlights the value of Maori-centred approaches and whanau involvement in these settings.
