35698246|a|In recent years, intermittent fasting (IF), including periodic fasting and time-restricted feeding (TRF), has been increasingly suggested to constitute a promising treatment for cardiometabolic diseases (CMD). A deliberate daily pause in food consumption influences the gut microbiome and the host circadian clock, resulting in improved cardiometabolic health. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which circadian host-microbiome interactions affect host metabolism and immunity may add a potentially important dimension to effective implementation of IF diets. In this review, we discuss emerging evidence potentially linking compositional and functional alterations of the gut microbiome with IF impacts on mammalian metabolism and risk of development of hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, and their long-term micro- and macrovascular complications. We highlight the challenges and unknowns in causally linking diurnal bacterial signals with dietary cues and downstream metabolic consequences and means of harnessing these signals toward future microbiome integration into precision medicine.
