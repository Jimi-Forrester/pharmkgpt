35723303|t|Evaluation of Ectopic Mitochondrial DNA in HeLa Cells.
35723303|a|The presence of ectopic DNA in the cytoplasm induces inflammation and cell death. It has been widely reported that leakage of nuclear DNA into the cytoplasm can mainly be sensed by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). We recently reported that mitochondria-derived cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) that has escaped lysosomal degradation induces significant cytotoxicity in cultured cells and in vivo. Cytoplasmic mitochondrial DNA is assumed to be involved in various diseases and disorders, and more and more papers have been published confirming this. On the other hand, the current method for evaluating mitochondrial DNA in the cytoplasm may not be quantitative. Here, we introduce in detail a method to evaluate ectopic mitochondrial DNA in cells. This method is useful in basic research as well as in the study of aging, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, heart failure, autoimmune diseases, cancer, and other conditions.
