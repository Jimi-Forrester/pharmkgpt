33477319|t|A Case Series: Successfully Preventing COVID-19 Outbreak in a Residential Community Setting at a Drug and Alcohol Addiction Treatment Center.
33477319|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reduced the capacity of many addiction treatment centers, limiting access to safe, continual treatment for people with substance use disorders (SUD) in the setting of a pandemic. Here, we describe the COVID-19 screening process of a residential addiction treatment center in rural Connecticut that has had no outbreaks, closures, or reductions in capacity since the pandemic began. Out of 420 patients screened for COVID-19 from 1 February to 1 July, five patients tested positive for COVID-19: four prior to entering its residential community setting, and one after entering the residential community, resulting in no COVID-19 spread to other patients. Patient 1 presented from home and tested positive during screening prior to entry into the community. The primary care provider for patient 2 notified staff of a recent pos-itive COVID-19 test prior to the patient's arrival on-site. Patient 3 had a COVID-19 infection in the weeks prior to arrival and tested positive during initial screening. Patient 4 tested positive af-ter coming from another addiction treatment facility that was shut down due to a COVID-19 outbreak. Patient 5 tested negative for COVID-19 during initial screening, entered the residential community, and later tested positive. It is imperative that in-person support for SUD continues during the pandemic. This case report highlights the importance of implementing a variety of tools in an effective screening process, including polymerase chain reaction screening and daily symptomology and temperature screening, which may help prevent further closures or reductions in capacity of addiction treatment centers during the COVID-19 pandemic or future outbreaks.
