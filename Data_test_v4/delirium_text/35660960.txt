35660960|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by the novel betacoronavirus SARS-COV-2, has become a global pandemic threat. SARS- COV-2 is structurally similar to SARS-COV, and both bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter human cells. While patients typically present with fever, shortness of breath, sore throat, and cough, in some cases neurologic manifestations occur due to both direct and indirect involvement of the nervous system. Case reports include anosmia, ageusia, central respiratory failure, stroke, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, headache, myalgia, myelitis, ataxia, and various neuropsychiatric manifestations. Some patients with COVID-19 may present with concurrent acute neuromuscular syndromes such as myasthenic crisis (MC), Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM); these conditions coupled with respiratory failure could trigger a life-threatening condition. Here, we review the current state of knowledge on acute neuromuscular syndromes with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 infection in an attempt to clarify and to manage the muscle dysfunction overlapping SARS-COV-2 infection.
