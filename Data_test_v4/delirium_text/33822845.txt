33822845|a|Reliable delivery of presynaptic material, including active zone and synaptic vesicle proteins from neuronal somata to synaptic terminals, is prerequisite for successful synaptogenesis and neurotransmission. However, molecular mechanisms controlling the somatic assembly of presynaptic precursors remain insufficiently understood. We show here that in mutants of the small GTPase Rab2, both active zone and synaptic vesicle proteins accumulated in the neuronal cell body at the trans-Golgi and were, consequently, depleted at synaptic terminals, provoking neurotransmission deficits. Ectopic presynaptic material accumulations consisted of heterogeneous vesicles and short tubules of 40 x 60 nm, segregating in subfractions either positive for active zone or synaptic vesicle proteins and LAMP1, a lysosomal membrane protein. Genetically, Rab2 acts upstream of Arl8, a lysosomal adaptor controlling axonal export of precursors. Collectively, we identified a Golgi-associated assembly sequence of presynaptic precursor biogenesis dependent on a Rab2-regulated protein export and sorting step at the trans-Golgi.
