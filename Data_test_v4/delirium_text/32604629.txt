32604629|t|Wireless Monitoring Through Wearable Devices in the ICU: Are We Close?
32604629|a|Patients admitted to the ICU present life-threatening conditions requiring support from multidisciplinary specialists and continuous monitoring of vital signs and other parameters by a state-of-the-art medical technology. Wireless monitoring through wearable devices could be useful for hospitalized patients, particularly those who are unstable or at higher risk for serious complications such as critically ill patients. This review aims at summarizing current evidence regarding the use of wireless monitoring in the ICU setting. Relevant studies address some practical issues regarding wireless vital signs monitoring, detection of emergencies and delirium and pressure ulcer prevention. In general, wearable devices may offer multiple applications in the ICU setting. However, there are important limitations in their applicability related to high clinical requirements and patient, staff and environment related factors. Given the fast evolving field of wireless technology, more healthcare applications regarding the ICU are anticipated in the near future.
