36192455|a|Cognitive skills and the underlying neural architecture are under the influence of genetics. Cognitive genomics research explores the triadic relationship between genes, brain, and cognition, with its major strategy being genotype-driven. Here we show that an inverse strategy is feasible to identify novel candidate genes for particular neuro-cognitive phenotypes in macaques. Two monkeys, originally involved in separate psychological studies, exhibited learning delay and low levels of social performance monitoring. In one monkey, mirror neurons were fewer compared to controls and mu suppression was absent in the frontal cortex. The other monkey showed heightened visual responsiveness in both frontal cortex and dopamine-rich midbrain, with a lack of inter-areal synchronization. Exome analyses revealed that the two monkeys were most likely cousins and shared variants in MAP2, APOC1, and potentially HTR2C. This phenotype-driven strategy in cognitive genomics provides a useful means to clarify the genetic basis of phenotypic variation and develop macaque models of neuropsychiatric disorders.
