15885044|a|Creativity in any of its forms, either visual, musical, literary or performing arts, may be conceived as a cognitive capability, and should be actively explored in relation to patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementias, even when other cognitive functions do not allow us to even communicate with them. We are reporting the case of a talented artist with the diagnosis of early onset Alzheimer disease (AD) with progressive cognitive impairment but with preservation of her creativity until very late in the course of the disease.
