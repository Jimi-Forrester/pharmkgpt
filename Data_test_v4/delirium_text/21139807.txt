21139807|t|ACE variants and association with brain Abeta levels in Alzheimer's disease.
21139807|a|ACE is a candidate gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and associations have been reported between ACE variants and plasma ACE levels, AD risk, AD age at onset of disease and cerebrospinal fluid levels of Abeta. Despite evidence that ACE can degrade Abeta, the relationships between ACE variants and the levels of different types of Abeta in the brain are not known. We have investigated the relationship between AD-associated ACE variants, for which the associations with brain activity of ACE were previously analysed, and brain homogenate levels of soluble, insoluble and oligomeric Abeta. Reported AD risk variants in the ACE indel (rs1799752) and its 'proxy' rs4343 were significantly associated with soluble Abeta level in AD only (p=0.001), as was rs1800764 but less so (p=0.014). In contrast, insoluble Abeta was associated with ACE indel and rs4343 variants in controls only (p < 0.01). No associations were found for oligomeric Abeta. These data indicate a complex relationship between ACE and Abeta that differs between AD and control brains.
