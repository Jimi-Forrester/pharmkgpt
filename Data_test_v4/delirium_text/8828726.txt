8828726|t|The pupillary response to tropicamide in Alzheimer's disease.
8828726|a|An increased pupillary response to a weak solution of tropicamide has recently been suggested to be diagnostic for Alzheimer's disease. If so, it would have far-reaching implications. We performed a masked study involving 17 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 20 mentally healthy controls with respect to the pupillary response induced by tropicamide. We found no significant difference in pupillary dilatation between patients and controls (19.7 +/- 11% versus 19.1 +/- 9%; p = 0.19).
