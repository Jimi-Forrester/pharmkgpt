39733215|t|A tribute to Laszlo Zaborszky: pioneering discoveries in the basal forebrain and inspiring generations of neuroscientists.
39733215|a|This editorial celebrates the 80th birthday of Distinguished Professor Laszlo Zaborszky, co-founder of Brain Structure and Function, and reflects on his monumental contributions to neuroscience, particularly his pioneering work on the cholinergic basal forebrain. Professor Zaborszky's research has reshaped our understanding of this brain region's organization and function, uncovering its critical role in cognitive processes such as learning, memory, and attention. His findings have challenged longstanding assumptions, demonstrating that the cholinergic projections to the cortex are highly organized, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Beyond his scientific achievements, Professor Zaborszky has made lasting contributions through his mentorship, shaping the careers of many neuroscientists, including the author. This editorial pays tribute to his remarkable legacy, both as a researcher and mentor and highlights his enduring impact on the field of neuroscience.
