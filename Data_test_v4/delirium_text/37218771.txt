37218771|t|Proteolytically Resistant Bioactive Peptide-Grafted Sr/Mg-Doped Hardystonite Foams: Comparison of Two Covalent Functionalization Strategies.
37218771|a|Hardystonite-based (HT) bioceramic foams were easily obtained via thermal treatment of silicone resins and reactive oxide fillers in air. By using a commercial silicone, incorporating strontium oxide and magnesium oxide precursors (as well as CaO and ZnO), and treating it at 1100  C, a complex solid solution (Ca1.4Sr0.6Zn0.85Mg0.15Si2O7) that has superior biocompatibility and bioactivity properties compared to pure hardystonite (Ca2ZnSi2O7) can be obtained. Proteolytic-resistant adhesive peptide mapped on vitronectin (D2HVP), was selectively grafted to Sr/Mg-doped HT foams using two different strategies. Unfortunately, the first method (via protected peptide) was unsuitable for acid-sensitive materials such as Sr/Mg-doped HT, resulting in the release of cytotoxic levels of Zinc over time, with consequent negative cellular response. To overcome this unexpected result, a novel functionalization strategy requiring aqueous solution and mild conditions was designed. Sr/Mg-doped HT functionalized with this second strategy (via aldehyde peptide) showed a dramatic increase in human osteoblast proliferation at 6 days compared to only silanized or non-functionalized samples. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the functionalization treatment does not induce any cytotoxicity. Functionalized foams enhanced mRNA-specific transcript levels coding IBSP, VTN, RUNX2, and SPP1 at 2 days post-seeding. In conclusion, the second functionalization strategy proved to be appropriate for this specific biomaterial and was effective at enhancing the material's bioactivity.
