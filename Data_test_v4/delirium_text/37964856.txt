37964856|t|A bibliometric and thematic analysis of the trends in the research on ginkgo biloba extract from 1985 to 2022.
37964856|a|Background: Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE), a complementary and alternative medicine, has been widely used for disorders such as brain infarction, dementia, and coronary heart disease, in recent decades. Given its widespread clinical use, GBE has always been a vital research topic. However, there are no bibliometric analyses on this topic; furthermore, published reviews of GBE focus only on a specific research field or lack scientific and systematic evaluation. This study combined bibliometrics with thematic reviews by visual analysis to identify the current status of GBE research and to better identify research hotspots and trends in the past 40 years to understand future developments in basic and clinical research. Methods: Articles and reviews on GBE were retrieved by topic from the Web of Science Core Collection from inception to 2022.12.01. Countries, institutions, authors, journals, references, and keywords in the field were visually analyzed using CiteSpace, Scimago Graphica, and VOSviewer software; then, these visualization results for references and keywords were clarified in detail by thematic reviews in subdivisions of the fields. Results: In total, 2015 publications were included. The GBE-related literature has high volumes of publications and citations. The majority of literature is from China, and the USA cooperates most closely with other countries. In GBE research, Christen Yves is the most cited author, Phytotherapy Research is the most prolific journal, and the Journal of Ethnopharmacology is the most co-cited journal. Through a comprehensive analysis of keywords, references, and reviews, the quality of the meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials of GBE in treating dementia was evaluated by the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews scale (ROBIS). Current research on GBE focuses on its pharmacological mechanisms, and neuroprotective application in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, and glaucoma. Randomized controlled trials are the current research hotspot. Conclusion: Research on GBE is flourishing; using bibliometric and thematic analysis, we identified its hotspots and trends. The pharmacological mechanisms and clinical applications of GBE are the focus of present and likely future research.
