31014071|t|Smartphone-Based Interventions to Foster Simple Activity and Personal Satisfaction in People With Advanced Alzheimer's Disease.
31014071|a|OBJECTIVES: This study assessed a smartphone-based program to promote practical and mildly demanding arm responses and personal satisfaction and increase physical exertion (heart rates) in people with advanced Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The program relied on a Samsung Galaxy A3 smartphone with Android 6.0 operating system. Two groups of 10 and 11 participants, respectively, were assigned different responses (ie, placing cards into an elevated box and moving bottles with water from a table into a container). Responses activated the smartphone, which produced brief periods of preferred stimulation. Lack of responding led the smartphone to produce a verbal prompt. RESULTS: All participants had significant increases in independent response frequencies, level of personal satisfaction, and heart rates during program sessions as opposed to baseline or control sessions. CONCLUSION: A smartphone-based program may help people with advanced Alzheimer's disease increase independent occupation with possible benefits in terms of satisfaction and physical condition.
