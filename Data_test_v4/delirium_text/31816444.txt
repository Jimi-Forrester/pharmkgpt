31816444|a|Mitochondria, which are cell compartments that are widely present in eukaryotic cells, have been shown to be involved in a variety of synthetic, metabolic, and signaling processes, thereby playing a vital role in cells. The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR) is a response in which mitochondria reverse the signal to the nucleus and maintain mitochondrial protein homeostasis when unfolded and misfolded proteins continue to accumulate. Multiple neurodegeneration diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), are public health challenges. Every year, countless efforts are expended trying to clarify the pathogenesis and treatment of neurological disorders, which are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction to some extent. Numerous studies have shown that mtUPR is involved in and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, but the exact mechanism of the disorders is still unclear. Further study of the process of mtUPR in neurological disorders can help us more accurately understand their pathogenesis in order to provide new therapeutic targets. In this paper, we briefly review mtUPR signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and mammals and summarize the role of mtUPR in neurodegeneration diseases, including AD, PD and fALS.
