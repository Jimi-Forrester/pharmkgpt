24008440|a|Nicorandil, an ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel opener, is known to have protective effects on ischemic injury in heart and brain. One of the most important protective mechanisms is the anti-apoptotic effect on cardiomyocytes and neurons. This study explored the anti-apoptotic effect of nicorandil against neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing the Swedish mutant APP (APPsw) and the possible mechanisms involved. We used SH-SY5Y cells transiently transfected with APPsw as a cellular model of Alzheimer's disease. Cells were treated with nicorandil (0.1, 0.5, 1 mM) for 24 h with and without glibenclamide (10 muM), a KATP channel inhibitor. The cells were then collected for MTT, apoptosis assay, and Western blot. In addition, we also investigated the potential involvement of the PI3K/Akt pathway in nicorandil-mediated neuroprotection of APPsw cells. Our results showed that nicorandil dose-dependently increased cell viability and reduced the rate of apoptosis as measured by MTT assay and annexin V/PI staining. Western blot showed that nicorandil could upregulate Bcl-2 levels and downregulate Bax and caspase-3 expression. Further studies showed that nicorandil increased the levels of phospho-Akt and upregulated element-binding protein activity by PI3K activation. Applying a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 blocked the protection. All these findings suggest that nicorandil might be a potential treatment option for Alzheimer's disease.
