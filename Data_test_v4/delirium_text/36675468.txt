36675468|t|A Randomized Study of Rigid Video Stylet versus Macintosh Laryngoscope for Double-Lumen Endobronchial Tube Intubation Assistance in Thoracoscopic Pulmonary Surgery.
36675468|a|Double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) intubation is more challenging than single-lumen tube intubation is, and the rigid video stylet (RVS) is one of the tools that has emerged to deal with this demanding intubation procedure. We evaluated whether the UE  RVS can shorten the DLT intubation time and improve the first-attempt intubation success rate compared with that of Macintosh laryngoscope (ML). A total of 130 participants scheduled to undergo thoracoscopic pulmonary surgeries were enrolled. They were randomized to receive either ML- or RVS-assisted DLT intubation. The primary outcomes were the intubation time and first-attempt intubation success rate. The secondary outcomes were the overall intubation success rate, mean arterial pressure, postoperative sore throat (POST), and postoperative hoarseness at 1 h and 24 h. Compared with the ML group, the intubation time was significantly shorter in the RVS group (p < 0.001; 30.82 +- 10.61 vs. 39.62 +- 6.54 s), however, the first-attempt success rate was significantly lower (p = 0.048; 83.08% vs. 95.16%). The POST at 1 h was less severe in the RVS group (p = 0.021). No significant differences were found for the other indicators. Among the patients with normal airways, the UE  RVS can achieve faster DLT intubation and decrease the severity of a POST at 1 h, although it was associated with a lower first-attempt intubation success rate.
