35332937|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We assessed frailty, measured by a comprehensive geriatric assessment-based frailty index (FI-CGA), and its association with postoperative outcomes among older thoracic surgical patients. METHODS: Patients aged >=65 years evaluated in the geriatric-thoracic clinic between June 2016 through May 2020 who underwent lung surgery were included. Frailty was defined as FI-CGA > 0.2, and "occult frailty", a level not often recognized by surgical teams, as 0.2 < FI-CGA < 0.4. A qualitative analysis of geriatric interventions was performed. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were included, of which 45 (62%) were nonfrail and 28 (38%) were frail. "Occult frailty" was present in 23/28 (82%). Sixty-one (84%) had lung malignancy. Geriatric interventions included delirium management, geriatric-specific pain and bowel regimens, and frailty optimization. More sublobar resections versus lobectomies (61% vs. 25%) were performed among frail patients. Frailty was not significantly associated with overall complications (odds ratio [OR]: 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88-6.44; p = 0.087), major complications (OR: 2.33; 95% CI: 0.48-12.69; p = 0.293), discharge disposition (OR: 2.8; 95% CI: 0.71-11.95; p = 0.141), or longer hospital stay (1.3 more days; p = 0.18). CONCLUSION: Frailty and "occult frailty" are prevalent in patients undergoing lung surgery. However, with integrated geriatric management, these patients can safely undergo surgery.
