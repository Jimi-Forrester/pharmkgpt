36821645|a|Over the course of a lifetime, the risk of experiencing multiple chronic conditions (multimorbidity) increases, necessitating complex healthcare regimens. Healthcare that manages these requirements in an integrated way has been shown to be more effective than services that address specific diseases individually. One such chronic condition that often accompanies ageing is hearing loss and related symptoms, such as tinnitus. Hearing loss is not only highly prevalent in older adults but is also a leading cause of disability. Accumulating evidence demonstrates an interplay between auditory function and other aspects of health. For example, poorer cardiometabolic health profiles have been shown to increase the risk of hearing loss, which has been attributed to microvascular disruptions and neural degeneration. Additionally, hearing loss itself is associated with significantly increased odds of falling and is a potentially modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. Such evidence warrants consideration of new possibilities-a new horizon-for hearing care to develop a holistic, person-centred approach that promotes the overall health and wellbeing of the individual, as well as for audiology to be part of an interdisciplinary healthcare service. To achieve this holistic goal, audiologists and other hearing healthcare professionals should be aware of the range of conditions associated with hearing loss and be ready to make health promoting recommendations and referrals to the appropriate health practitioners. Likewise, healthcare professionals not trained in audiology should be mindful of their patients' hearing status, screening for hearing loss or referring them to a hearing specialist as required.
