26401932|a|BACKGROUND: Overexpression of the mitochondrial enzyme 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (17beta-HSD10, which is also known as the intracellular amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) binding protein) is observed in cortical or hippocampal regions of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). It appears that 17beta-HSD10 may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the possibility that levels of 17beta-HSD10 in cerebrospinal fluid could be a prospective biomarker of AD. METHODS: We estimated the enzyme levels in 161 people (15 non-demented controls, 52 people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 35 people with probable AD, or 59 people with other types of dementia) and compared them with those of Abeta(1- 42), tau, and phospho-tau. RESULTS: We found significantly higher levels of 17beta-HSD10 in people with MCI due to AD (to 109.9% ), with AD (to 120.0% ), or with other types of dementia (to 110.9% ) when compared to the control group. The sensitivity of the new biomarker to AD was 80.0% , and the specificity was 73.3% (compared to controls) or 52.5-59.1% (compared to other types of dementia). Results of multiple linear regression and of correlation analysis revealed AD-mediated changes in links between 17beta-HSD10 and Mini Mental State Examination score. CONCLUSION: It seems that changes in 17beta-HSD10 start many years before symptom onset, analogous to those in Abeta1 - 42, tau, or phospho-tau and that the levels are a relatively highly sensitive but unfortunately less specific biomarker of AD. A role of 17beta-HSD10 overexpression in AD is discussed.
