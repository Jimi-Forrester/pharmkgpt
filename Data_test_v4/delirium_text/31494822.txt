31494822|a|OBJECTIVES: Behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPS) worsen quality of life and increase institutionalization in dementia, but the relationship between BPS and vascular burden on neuroimaging is unclear. Our aim is to explore whether the profile of BPS differs between patients with large-vessel or cortical vascular dementia (cVaD), small-vessel or subcortical vascular dementia (sVaD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: The BEVASDE study comprised 806 demented patients (cVaD-136, sVaD-184, AD-486) recruited from outpatient consultations in Salamanca and Avila, Spain. The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) and the 12-item Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) were used to evaluate dementia severity and BPS. RESULTS: BPS were reported in 98.5%, 97.3% and 96.9% of the cVaD, sVaD and AD cases, respectively. The median NPI score was 36 in both cVaD and sVaD and 34 in AD, with a median number of four symptoms per patient. The most frequent disorders were depression (64.4%), apathy (61.8%) and sleep disturbance (60.5%). Multivariate regression analyses after controlling for possible confounders showed a higher risk of euphoria (p = 0.011), apathy (p = 0.007), irritability (p = 0.002) and sleep disturbance (p = 0.020) in cVaD than in AD and more apathy (p = 0.0001) and irritability (p = 0.0001) in sVaD than in AD. In contrast, AD subjects had a higher risk of delusions (p = 0.007) and hallucinations (p = 0.023) than patients with cVaD as well as more aberrant motor behaviour than both cVaD (p = 0.0001) and sVaD (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: BPS are common in dementia and may help in differential diagnosis of the various subtypes. We should inquire about them and treat as necessary.
