11424902|t|Neurotoxicity as a mechanism for neurodegenerative disorders: basic and clinical aspects.
11424902|a|This three day meeting focused on chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amylotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It attracted 69 participants from 10 countries with dominance of Chile and USA. Neurodegeneration and its prevention increasingly gain in importance as the number of people affected increases year-by-year. The meeting addressed various basic aspects having pragmatic implications such as: oxidative stress, inflammatory reaction, glial activation, role of glutamatergic system and apoptosis using a plethora of in vitro and in vivo methods.
