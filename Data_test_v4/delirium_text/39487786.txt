39487786|t|Risk of cognitive decline among patients with dengue virus infection: A systematic review.
39487786|a|BACKGROUND: Dengue fever, caused by the dengue virus and transmitted through Aedes mosquitoes, is a growing public health concern, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Traditionally associated with febrile and hemorrhagic symptoms, recent research suggests a potential link between dengue and cognitive impairments. This systematic review assessed existing research to understand the association between dengue virus infection and cognitive impairments, including dementia, Alzheimer's disease, memory loss, and confusion. METHODS: This systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to January 18, 2024. Studies examining the prevalence and association of cognitive impairments in dengue patients were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed using Nested Knowledge software and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Of the 1,129 articles identified, five were included in the review, covering a total of 200,873 participants from Taiwan, Brazil, and France. Evidence from population-based cohort studies indicated short-term cognitive impairments, including confusion and memory loss, in some dengue patients. Additionally, long-term risks of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, were observed, particularly among older adults. Although the findings suggest there might be an association between dengue infection and cognitive decline, the mechanisms underlying this link remain unclear. CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests that dengue virus infection may affect cognitive function in both acute and long-term contexts. However, the current evidence is not strong enough to establish a conclusive link. Further research with larger sample sizes and longitudinal studies is essential to confirm the impact of dengue virus on cognitive health.
