37304847|t|The Independent Association of Plasma and Red Blood Cell Zinc Concentrations with Long-Term Outcomes of Hospitalized Patients.
37304847|a|Background: Plasma and RBC zinc values are unrelated in hospitalized patients. The independent association of these values with important patient outcomes is unknown. Objectives: Measure the independent association of plasma and RBC zinc with outcomes in hospitalized patients. Methods: Plasma and RBC zinc concentrations were prospectively measured within 48 h of hospitalization in consenting patients. Data were linked deterministically with population-based health administrative data to measure each association of zinc measures with 2 outcomes (time to death from any cause and likelihood of death or urgent readmission to hospital within 30-d of discharge) after adjusting for validated outcome risk scores. Results: In total, 250 people admitted to medical services were studied. Patients were ill with a 1-y baseline expected death risk (IQR) of 19.9% (6.3%-37.2%). The observed 1-y and 2-y all-cause death risks were 24.5% (95% CI: 19.6%, 30.3%) and 33.2% (95% CI: 27.3%, 39.9%), respectively. Death risk increased significantly as plasma zinc concentrations decreased (P = 0.0001). This association persisted even after adjusting for the baseline expected death risk (P = 0.02) with every 2-mumol/L decrease in plasma zinc concentrations being independently associated with, on average, a 35% increase in the death risk. RBC zinc concentrations were not associated with the death risk. Neither plasma nor RBC zinc concentrations were significantly associated with the 30-d death or urgent readmission rate. Conclusions: Plasma, but not RBC, zinc concentrations are independently associated with the all-cause death risk in hospitalized medical patients. Further study is required to determine whether this association is causal and identify its potential causal pathways. Curr Dev Nutr 2023;x:xx.
