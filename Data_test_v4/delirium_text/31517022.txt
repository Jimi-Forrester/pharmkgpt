As brain atrophy can provide assessment of consequent neurodegeneration, our objective was to predict postmortem neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) from in vivo MRI measurements. METHODS: All participants with neuroimaging and neuropathological data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and the Rush Memory and Aging Project were selected (n = 186). Two hundred and thirty two variables were extracted from last MRI before death using FreeSurfer. Nonparametric correlation analysis and multivariable support vector machine classification were performed to provide a predictive model of Braak NFT staging. RESULTS: We demonstrated that 59 of our MRI variables, mostly temporal lobe structures, were significantly associated with Braak NFT stages (P < .005). We obtained a 62.4% correct classification rate for discrimination between transentorhinal, limbic, and isocortical groups. DISCUSSION: Structural neuroimaging may therefore be considered as a potential biomarker for early detection of Alzheimer's disease-associated neurofibrillary degeneration.
