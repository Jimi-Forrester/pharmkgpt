38638387|t|Relation of Cognitive Impairment with Number of Acute Exacerbations and Serum Level of VEGF among COPD Patients.
38638387|a|Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a main cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Its complications are numerous and one of their most common extra-pulmonary ones is cognitive impairment which is directly related to its mortality and morbidity. A decrease in cerebral perfusion in these patients had been seen in previous studies considering the role of VEGF on angiogenesis and its role in the pathogenesis of COPD. This study was done to evaluate the relation of cognitive impairment with serum VEGF and the number of COPD exacerbations. Materials and Methods: In the present study, 87 patients whom the pulmonologist confirmed their COPD disease based on spirometry testing were enrolled. The blood sample was received for serum VEGF level measurement and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) questionnaire was completed to assess the cognitive function. The number of exacerbations was also recorded. The blood sample was received from 87 other age and sex-matched persons without a history of pulmonary disease, CVA, or MI. Their VEGF level was also measured. The data was analyzed by SPSS version 20 software. Results: In the COPD group, 42 (48.28%) had no cognitive impairment, 39 (44.83%) had mild, and 6(6.89%) had moderate cognitive impairment. In this group, there was a significant relation between the score of the MMSE questionnaire and the number of COPD exacerbations during the past year. However, there was no significant relation between VEGF and cognitive impairment. Conclusion: According to the results of the present study, there was no significant relation between cognitive impairment and VEGF level. There was a significant relation between cognitive impairment and the number of COPD exacerbations. Also, there was a significant difference between the serum level of VEGF among COPD patients and the control group.
