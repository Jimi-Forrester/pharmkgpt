23506614|t|Untangling amyloid-beta, tau, and metals in Alzheimer's disease.
23506614|a|Protein misfolding and metal ion dyshomeostasis are believed to underlie numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pathological hallmark of AD is accumulation of misfolded amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau) proteins in the brain. Since AD etiology remains unclear, several hypotheses have emerged to elucidate its pathological pathways. The amyloid cascade hypothesis, a leading hypothesis for AD development, advocates Abeta as the principal culprit. Additionally, evidence suggests that tau may contribute to AD pathology. Abeta and tau have also been shown to impact each other's pathology either directly or indirectly. Furthermore, metal ion dyshomeostasis is associated with these misfolded proteins. Metal interactions with Abeta and tau/ptau also influence their aggregation properties and neurotoxicity. Herein, we present current understanding on the roles of Abeta, tau, and metal ions, placing equal emphasis on each of these proposed features, as well as their inter-relationships in AD pathogenesis.
