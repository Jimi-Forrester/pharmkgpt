26175765|t|Update on the Extracorporeal Life Support.
26175765|a|Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is a type of cardiopulmonary bypass. It is an artificial means of supplying oxygen and removing CO2 on behalf of damaged lungs while patients are recovering from underlying diseases. Recently, the use of ECLS is rapidly increasing as this machine becomes smaller, less invasive and easier to use. In addition, the improvement of clinicians' technique and outcome is increasing their application to patients with acute respiratory distress. In this regard, the purpose of this review is to introduce the physiological principles, risk factors, and advantages of ECLS, clinical rationale for using ECLS, ventilatory strategy during ECLS, which are still causing different opinions, the weaning from ECLS, and the use of anticoagulant.
