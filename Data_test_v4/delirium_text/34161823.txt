34161823|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by the accumulation of abnormal tau proteins within neurons and amyloid plaques in the brain parenchyma, which leads to progressive loss of neurons in the brain. While the detailed mechanism of the pathogenesis of AD is still unknown, evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction likely plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Due to the relevance of mitochondrial alterations in AD, recent works have suggested the therapeutic potential of mitochondrial-targeted lithium. Lithium has been shown to possess neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties that could also be related to the upregulation of mitochondrial function. In the current work, we perform a comprehensive investigation of the significance of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD and pharmacological treatment with lithium as imperative in this pathology, through a brief review of the major findings on the effects of lithium as a therapeutic approach targeting mitochondria in the context of AD.
