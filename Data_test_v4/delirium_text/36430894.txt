36430894|t|The Role of Insulin Signaling in Hippocampal-Related Diseases: A Focus on Alzheimer's Disease.
36430894|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global concern and has become a major public health event affecting human health. Insulin is a metabolic hormone secreted mainly by the peripheral tissue pancreas. In recent years, more and more evidence has proved that insulin regulates various functions of the brain. The hippocampus, one of the earliest brain regions affected by AD, is widely distributed with insulin receptors. Studies have shown that type 2 diabetes mellitus, characterized by insulin resistance, is closely related to AD, which has drawn extensive attention to the relationship between hippocampal insulin signaling and AD. Therefore, we provide an overview of intranasal insulin administration on memory and its underlying mechanism. We also highlight the molecular link between hippocampal insulin resistance and AD and provide a theoretical basis for finding new therapeutic targets for AD in clinical practice.
