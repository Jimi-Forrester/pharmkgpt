36790720|t|Evaluating the neuroprotective effect of Spirulina platensis-loaded niosomes against Alzheimer's disease induced in rats.
36790720|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by memory loss, changes in behavior, and avoidance of social bonds. Aluminum is one of the main risk factors in the development of AD. Spirulina platensis (SP) is a microalga that improves motor and cognitive skills and prevents cerebral endothelial damage. SP could be delivered in a more controlled and targeted manner using nanoparticles like niosomes. The purpose of this research was to develop a SP-loaded niosome (SPLN) formulation as a drug delivery system to investigate the effectiveness and toxicity of SP as an AD therapy using the AlCl3-induced AD rat model. A niosomal formulation that consists of Tween 60, cholesterol, and dihexadecyl phosphate in a molar ratio of 1:2:0.1 was chosen as an optimum formulation. AD was induced in rats by orally administering AlCl3. Compared with the AlCl3 control, the group treated with the SPLN formulation showed enhancement of the recognition and working memories by increasing the difference score, the discrimination ratio, and the spontaneous alternation behavior. Additionally, it revealed a significant increase in AchE genes, restored the reduced brain neurotransmitters, and improved brain oxidative status. In conclusion, SPLN formulation could be considered an effective AD therapy.
