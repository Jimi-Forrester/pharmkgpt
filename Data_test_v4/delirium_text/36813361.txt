36813361|t|Amyloid precursor protein in Alzheimer's disease.
36813361|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a membrane protein expressed in several tissues. The occurrence of APP is predominant in synapses of nerve cells. It acts as a cell surface receptor and plays a vital role as a regulator of synapse formation, iron export and neural plasticity. It is encoded by the APP gene that is regulated by substrate presentation. APP is a precursor protein activated by proteolytic cleavage and thereby generating amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides which eventually form amyloid plaques that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease patients' brains. In this chapter, we highlight basic mechanism, structure, expression patterns and cleavage of amyloid plaques, and its diagnosis and potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
