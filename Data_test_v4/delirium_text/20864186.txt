20864186|t|Anti-11[E]-pyroglutamate-modified amyloid beta antibodies cross-react with other pathological Abeta species: relevance for immunotherapy.
20864186|a|N-truncated/modified forms of amyloid beta (Ass) peptide are found in diffused and dense core plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down's syndrome patients as well as animal models of AD, and represent highly desirable therapeutic targets. In the present study we have focused on N-truncated/modified Abeta peptide bearing amino-terminal pyroglutamate at position 11 (AbetaN11(pE)). We identified two B-cell epitopes recognized by rabbit anti-AbetaN11(pE) polyclonal antibodies. Interestingly, rabbit anti-AbetaN11(pE) polyclonal antibodies bound also to full-length Abeta1-42 and N-truncated/modified AbetaN3(pE), suggesting that the three peptides may share a common B-cell epitope. Importantly, rabbit anti-AbetaN11(pE) antibodies bound to naturally occurring Abeta aggregates present in brain samples from AD patients. These results are potentially important for developing novel immunogens for targeting N-truncated/modified Abeta aggregates as well, since the most commonly used immunogens in the majority of vaccine studies have been shown to induce antibodies that recognize the N-terminal immunodominant epitope (EFRH) of the full length Abeta, which is absent in N-amino truncated peptides.
