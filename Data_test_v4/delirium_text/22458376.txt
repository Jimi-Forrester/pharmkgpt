22458376|a|It is now widely accepted that Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a functional disconnection between brain regions. The disease appears to begin up to decades prior to clinical diagnosis. Therefore, in the present study, we combined magnetoencephalography, a memory task, and functional connectivity analysis in mild cognitive impairment subjects in order to identify functional connectivity patterns that could characterize subjects who would eventually go on to develop the disease. We monitored 19 subjects and finally 5 of them developed Alzheimer's disease. These progressive patients showed a differential profile of functional connectivity values compared with those patients who remained stable over time. Specifically there were higher synchronization values over the parieto-occipital region in alpha and beta frequency bands. The involvement of this brain region in amyloid-beta accumulation and its possible association with hyper-synchronization are also discussed.
