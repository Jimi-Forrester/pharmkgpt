7888092|a|The major pathological characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the abnormal deposition of beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) in the brain. In some early onset cases, the disease develops because of mutations in the gene coding for beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP). However, the majority of AD families in the early onset subgroup are linked to a locus on chromosome 14. The genetic analysis and age of onset correlates of both the beta APP gene and the chromosome 14 locus are discussed. We speculate on the mechanisms by which the beta APP mutations cause the disease and discuss recent advances in beta APP processing that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of the late-onset (common) form of the disease. In addition, we review the association of the APOE locus with late-onset familial and nonfamilial disease. Further work is required to establish the effects of this locus on disease occurrence, age of onset, and progression. The molecular pathology of ApoE in relation to AD development and the identification of the chromosome 14 gene will greatly contribute to a general pathogenic model of AD, and will clarify the role of beta APP and its derivatives.
