19432090|a|An 81-year-old man died unexpectedly from a cardiac cause. His wife, who lived in the same house and suffered from Alzheimer's disease, did not realize his death. When the body was found at the foot of the stairs 2-3 days afterwards, extensive soft tissue defects with notched wound edges, but no signs of vitality, were observed on the head and neck. The site where the body was found showed almost no traces of blood. In view of the injuries and their obviously post-mortem origin it was assumed that they had been caused by the man's Appenzell mountain dog which also lived in the house. By means of DNA typing, swabs from the wound edges of the soft-tissue defects could be assigned to the deceased's dog.
