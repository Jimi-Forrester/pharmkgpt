37057867|a|OBJECTIVES: Cognitive fluctuations are a core clinical feature of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), but their contribution to the everyday functioning difficulties evident DLB are not well understood. The current study evaluated whether intraindividual variability across a battery of neurocognitive tests (intraindividual variability-dispersion) and daily cognitive fluctuations as measured by informant report are associated with worse daily functioning in DLB. METHODS: The study sample included 97 participants with consensus-defined DLB from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). Intraindividual variability-dispersion was measured using the coefficient of variation, which divides the standard deviation of an individual's performance scores across 12 normed neurocognitive indices from the NACC neuropsychological battery by that individual's performance mean. Informants reported on daily cognitive fluctuations using the Mayo Fluctuations Scale (MFS) and on daily functioning using the functional activities questionnaire (FAQ). RESULTS: Logistic regression identified a large univariate association of intraindividual variability-dispersion and presence of daily cognitive fluctuations on the MFS (Odds Ratio = 73.27, 95% Confidence Interval = 1.38, 3,895.05). Multiple linear regression demonstrated that higher intraindividual variability-dispersion and presence of daily cognitive fluctuations as assessed by the MFS were significantly and independently related to worse daily functioning (FAQ scores). CONCLUSIONS: Among those with DLB, informant-rated daily cognitive fluctuations and cognitive fluctuations measured in the clinic (as indexed by intraindividual variability-dispersion across a battery of tests) were independently associated with poorer everyday functioning. These data demonstrate ecological validity in measures of cognitive fluctuations in DLB.
