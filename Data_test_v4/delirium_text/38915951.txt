38915951|t|Green silver nanoparticles: Prospective nanotools against neurodegenerative cell line model.
38915951|a|Neurodegenerative diseases represent an increasingly burdensome challenge of the past decade, primarily driven by the global aging of the population. Ongoing efforts focus on implementing diverse strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of neurodegeneration, with the goal of decelerating the pathology progression. Notably, in recent years, it has emerged that the use of nanoparticles (NPs), particularly those obtained through green chemical processes, could constitute a promising therapeutic approach. Green NPs, exclusively sourced from phytochemicals, are deemed safer compared to NPs synthetized through conventional chemical route. In this study, the effects of green chemistry-derived silver NPs (AgNPs) were assessed in neuroblastoma cells, SHSY-5Y, which are considered a pivotal model for investigating neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we used two different concentrations (0.5 and 1 microM) of AgNPs and two time points (24 and 48 h) to evaluate the impact on neuroblastoma cells by observing viability reduction and intracellular calcium production, especially using 1 microM at 48 h. Furthermore, investigation using atomic force microscopy (AFM) unveiled an alteration in Young's modulus due to the reorganization of cortical actin following exposure to green AgNPs. This evidence was further corroborated by confocal microscopy acquisitions as well as coherency and density analyses on actin fibers. Our in vitro findings suggest the potential efficacy of green AgNPs against neurodegeneration; therefore, further in vivo studies are imperative to optimize possible therapeutic protocols.
