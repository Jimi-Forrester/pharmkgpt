39434049|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the current status of delirium care self-efficacy among nurses in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the level of their knowledge about delirium in the ICU, more importantly, to analyze factors influencing the delirium care self-efficacy of ICU nurses and to provide a theoretical basis for ICU nursing managers to develop strategies for effective delirium care and management. METHODS: The study was based on a sample of 283 ICU nurses from eight hospitals in Chongqing selected using a convenience sampling method between July 2023 and September 2023. The tools used included a general information questionnaire, the Chinese version of the Delirium Care Self-Efficacy of ICU Nurses Scale, and the Chinese version of the ICU Delirium Knowledge Level Questionnaire. RESULTS: The self-efficacy score (47.84 +- 9.93) of ICU nurses was positively correlated with the delirium knowledge level score (12.32 +- 3.47, r = 0.591, P < 0.001). Multivariate linear regression analysis identified the gender of the nurse, hospital level (tier), duration of ICU work experience, whether the nurse was a specialized ICU nurse, whether the nurse received delirium-related training, and the level of knowledge about delirium (all P < 0.05) as the influencing factors for the delirium care self-efficacy of ICU nurses. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that ICU nursing managers offer targeted interventions based on the influencing factors to improve the delirium care self-efficacy of ICU nurses and their delirium knowledge levels, thereby reducing the incidence of delirium and improving the quality of care provided for patients with delirium in the ICU.
