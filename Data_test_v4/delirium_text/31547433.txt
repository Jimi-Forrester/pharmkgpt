31547433|t|Transcriptional Analysis of FOXO1, C/EBP-alpha and PPAR-gamma2 Genes and Their Association with Obesity-Related Insulin Resistance.
31547433|a|BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with several comorbid disorders, ranging from cardiovascular diseases to insulin resistance. In this context, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) seems to have a close connection with insulin resistance. In our study, we hypothesized that the expression profile of key adipogenic genes, such as proliferator-activated receptor gamma type 2 (PPAR-gamma2), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein type alpha (C/EBP-alpha), and forkhead box protein class O type 1 (FOXO1) in VAT should shed light on their association with obesity-related insulin resistance. METHODS: To test this idea, we studied the expression profile of C/EBP-alpha, FOXO1 and PPAR-gamma2 in VAT from non-obese individuals, and low insulin (LIR-MO) and high insulin morbidly obese (HIR-MO) subjects, through a combination of RT-qPCR, co-immunoprecipitation, ELISA, Western blot analysis and EMSA assays. RESULTS: Our results show that C/EBP-alpha and PPAR-gamma2 were down-expressed in HIR-MO individuals, while FOXO1 was overexpressed. In addition, the PPAR-gamma2-RXR-alpha heterodimer showed weak activity and bound weakly to the putative IGFBP-2-PPRE promoter sequence in VAT from HIR-MO subjects when compared with LIR-MO individuals. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that PPAR-gamma2, C/EBP-alpha, FOXO1 and IGFBP-2 have a close relationship with insulin resistance in VAT of morbidly obese individuals.
