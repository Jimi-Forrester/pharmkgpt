24520345|t|Association between amylin and amyloid-beta peptides in plasma in the context of apolipoprotein E4 allele.
24520345|a|Amylin, a pancreatic peptide that readily crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB), and amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), the main component of amyloid plaques and a major component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the brain, share several features. These include having similar beta-sheet secondary structures, binding to the same receptor, and being degraded by the same protease. Thus, amylin may be associated with Abeta, but the nature of their relationship remains unclear. In this study, we used human samples to study the relationship between plasma amylin and Abeta in the context of the apolipoprotein E alleles (ApoE). We found that concentrations of Abeta1-42 (P<0.0001) and Abeta1-40 (P<0.0001) increased with each quartile increase of amylin. Using multivariate regression analysis, the study sample showed that plasma amylin was associated with Abeta1-42 (beta = +0.149, SE = 0.025, P<0.0001) and Abeta1-40 (beta = +0.034, SE = 0.016, P = 0.04) as an outcome after adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, ApoE4, BMI, diabetes, stroke, kidney function and lipid profile. This positive association between amylin and Abeta1-42 in plasma was found regardless of the ApoE genotype. In contrast, the relationship between amylin and Abeta1-40 in plasma seen in ApoE4 non-carriers disappeared in the presence of ApoE4. Using AD mouse models, our recent study demonstrates that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of synthetic amylin enhances the removal of Abeta from the brain into blood, thus resulting in increased blood levels of both amylin and Abeta. The positive association between amylin and Abeta, especially Abeta1-42, in human blood samples is probably relevant to the findings in the AD mouse models. The presence of ApoE4 may attenuate amylin's capacity to remove Abeta, especially Abeta1-40, from the AD brain.
