36919128|t|Impact of Educational Program on Critical Care Nurses' Knowledge of ICU Delirium: A Quasi-Experimental Study.
36919128|a|Background: Cat Intensive care unit (ICU) delirium is a significant complication that increases the mortality, morbidity, and length of stay for critically ill patient. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the critical care nurse's knowledge of ICU delirium and the effectiveness of an educational program about the recognition and assessment of ICU delirium on critical care nurse's knowledge. Methods: A quasi-experimental single group pre-test-post-test design was conducted using delirium knowledge assessment questionnaires. Results: The median post test score of overall nurses' knowledge was 76.2 (range 19.1-95.2) compared to the median pre-test score of 38.1 (range 14.3 - 61.9) indicating a significant change in nurses' knowledge after conducting the educational program (p<0.001). Conclusion: Critical care nurses' knowledge of ICU delirium was low before the intervention and increased significantly after delivering an educational program.
