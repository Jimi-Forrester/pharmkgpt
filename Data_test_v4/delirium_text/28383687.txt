28383687|a|BACKGROUND: Caregivers play a major role in providing care for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are themselves at higher risk of health comorbidities. AIM: To address the impact of neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients in different stages of AD on their caregivers' burden. DESIGN: This prospective study enrolled 260 AD patients with clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0.5, 1 and 2 at a tertiary medical center. METHODS: All patients were tested using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), the cognitive abilities screening instrument (CASI), the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) and the CDR scale. Data regarding therapeutic outcomes of anti-Alzheimer's drugs were also collected. Caregivers were tested using NPI. RESULTS: The mean follow-up interval was 25.0 +- 12.2 months, and two patients died during follow-up. NPI-burden was positively correlated with NPI-sum ( r  = 0.822, P  <   0.001) but negatively correlated with years of education ( r  = -0.140, P  =   0.024), CASI score ( r  = -0.259, P  <   0.001) and MMSE score ( r  = -0.262, P  <0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that only NPI-sum was independently associated with mean NPI-burden. Both higher mean CASI and MMSE scores had better therapeutic outcome of anti-Alzheimer's drugs ( P  =   0.001 and P =   0.005, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD was positively associated with caregiver's stress, and patients with better cognitive functions, under treatment with anti-Alzheimer's drugs, had better therapeutic outcomes. To reduce the impact of neuropsychiatric symptoms, it is crucial to detect dementia in its early phases and provide early intervention with anti-Alzheimer's drugs, which might help decrease the caregiver burden, thereby improving their quality of life.
