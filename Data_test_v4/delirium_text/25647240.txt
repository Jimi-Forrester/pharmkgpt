25647240|t|Pediatric delirium and associated risk factors: a single-center prospective observational study.
25647240|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe a single-institution pilot study regarding prevalence and risk factors for delirium in critically ill children. DESIGN: A prospective observational study, with secondary analysis of data collected during the validation of a pediatric delirium screening tool, the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium. SETTING: This study took place in the PICU at an urban academic medical center. PATIENTS: Ninety-nine consecutive patients, ages newborn to 21 years. INTERVENTION: Subjects underwent a psychiatric evaluation for delirium based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV criteria. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Prevalence of delirium in this sample was 21%. In multivariate analysis, risk factors associated with the diagnosis of delirium were presence of developmental delay, need for mechanical ventilation, and age 2-5 years. CONCLUSIONS: In our institution, pediatric delirium is a prevalent problem, with identifiable risk factors. Further large-scale prospective studies are required to explore multi-institutional prevalence, modifiable risk factors, therapeutic interventions, and effect on long-term outcomes.
