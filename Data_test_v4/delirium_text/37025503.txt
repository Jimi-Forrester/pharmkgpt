37025503|a|Background: Meaningful engagement has been described as active participation based on a person's interests, preferences, personhood, or perceived value. It has many benefits for persons living with dementia in long-term care (LTC) homes, including improvement in physical and cognitive function, and mental health. People with advanced dementia continue to need and benefit from inclusion and social contact in LTC, yet there is not a well-developed understanding of how to support this. A tailored intervention called Namaste Care has been shown to be an effective approach to meaningfully engage residents in LTC, decrease behavioral symptoms, and improve their comfort and quality of life. There is a need to consider how best to deliver this intervention. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe environmental, social, and sensory factors influencing meaningful engagement of persons with advanced dementia during Namaste Care implementation in LTC. Methods: In this qualitative descriptive study, focus groups and interviews were conducted with families, volunteers, staff, and managers at two LTC homes. Directed content analysis was conducted. The Comprehensive Process Model of Engagement was used as a coding framework. Results: With respect to environmental attributes, participants emphasized that a designated quiet space and a small group format were helpful for engagement. In terms of social attributes, participants emphasized Namaste Care staff capacity to deliver individualized care. Regarding sensorial factors, familiarity with the activities delivered in the program was emphasized. Conclusion: Findings reveal the need to offer small group programs that include adapted recreational and stimulating activities, such as Namaste Care, for residents at the end of life in LTC. Such programs facilitate meaningful engagement for persons with dementia as they focus on individual preferences, comfort, and inclusion while recognizing changing needs and abilities of residents.
