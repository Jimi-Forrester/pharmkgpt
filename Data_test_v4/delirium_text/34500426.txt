34500426|a|Recent studies suggested that the rich club organization promoting global brain communication and integration of information, may be abnormally increased in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, the structural and functional basis of this organization is still not very clear. Given the heritability of OCD, as suggested by previous family-based studies, we hypothesize that aberrant rich club organization may be a trait marker for OCD. In the present study, 32 patients with OCD, 30 unaffected first-degree relatives (FDR) and 32 healthy controls (HC) underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We examined the structural rich club organization and its interrelationship with functional coupling. Our results showed that rich club and peripheral connection strength in patients with OCD was lower than in HC, while it was intermediate in FDR. Finally, the coupling between structural and functional connections of the rich club, was decreased in FDR but not in OCD relative to HC, which suggests a buffering mechanism of brain functions in FDR. Overall, our findings suggest that alteration of the rich club organization may reflect a vulnerability biomarker for OCD, possibly buffered by structural and functional coupling of the rich club.
