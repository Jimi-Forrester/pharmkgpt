28057149|a|Objective: To understand the prevalence of senile dementia in the elderly aged >=60 years in China between 2000 and 2015. Methods: Publications between 2000 and 2015 were retrieved from China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Databases, Chinese Science and Technology Journal Databases (VIP) and PubMed. Observational studies on prevalence of senile dementia were included. Meta-analysis was carried out by using R software. Results: A total of 25 papers were included in this study. The total number of participants investigated was 76 980, with 4 295 dementia cases identified. The prevalence of senile dementia in the elderly was 5.15% (95%CI: 4.21%-6.09%); Subgroup analysis showed that the women had a higher prevalence (6.08%) than the men (4.10%); and the prevalence was significant increased with age (The senile dementia prevalence was 1.01% in age groups 60-64 years, but 23.60% in age group >=85 years). The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (3.56%) was higher than that of cerebral vascular dementia (1.11%). The senile dementia prevalence in the illiterate was 8.74%, higher than 3.17% in the literate. The prevalence of senile dementia in the unmarried was 6.83%, higher than that in the married (3.95%). Conclusion: The prevalence of senile dementia was high in the population aged >=60 years in China. Age, sex, education level and marital status might influence the prevalence of senile dementia.
