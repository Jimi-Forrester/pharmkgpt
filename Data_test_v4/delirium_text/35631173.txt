35631173|t|Modulation of Inflammation by Plant-Derived Nutraceuticals in Tendinitis.
35631173|a|Tendinitis (tendinopathy) is a pro-inflammatory and painful tendon disease commonly linked with mechanical overuse and associated injuries, drug abuse, and lifestyle factors (including poor diet and physical inactivity) that causes significant healthcare expenditures due to its high incidence. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is one of the major pro-inflammatory transcription factors, along with other inflammation signaling pathways, triggered by a variety of stimuli, including cytokines, endotoxins, physical and chemical stressors, hypoxia, and other pro-inflammatory factors. Their activation is known to regulate the expression of a multitude of genes involved in inflammation, degradation, and cell death. The pathogenesis of tendinitis is still poorly understood, whereas efficient and sustainable treatment is missing. Targeting drug suppression of the key inflammatory regulators represents an effective strategy for tendinitis therapy, but requires a comprehensive understanding of their principles of action. Conventional monotherapies are often ineffective and associated with severe side effects in patients. Therefore, agents that modulate multiple cellular targets represent therapeutic treatment potential. Plant-derived nutraceuticals have been shown to act as multi-targeting agents against tendinitis via various anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, whereat they were able to specifically modulate numerous signaling pathways, including NF-kappaB, p38/MAPK, JNK/STAT3, and PI3K/Akt, thus down-regulating inflammatory processes. This review discusses the utility of herbal nutraceuticals that have demonstrated safety and tolerability as anti-inflammatory agents for the prevention and treatment of tendinitis through the suppression of catabolic signaling pathways. Limitations associated with the use of nutraceuticals are also described.
