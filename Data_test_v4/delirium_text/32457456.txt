32457456|a|Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a serious threat to human life globally with over 100 genotypes including cancer causing high risk HPVs. Study on protein interaction maps of pathogens with their host is a recent trend in 'omics' era and has been practiced by researchers to find novel drug targets. In current study, we construct an integrated protein interaction map of HPV with its host human in Cytoscape and analyze it further by using various bioinformatics tools. We found out 2988 interactions between 12 HPV and 2061 human proteins among which we identified MYLK, CDK7, CDK1, CDK2, JAK1 and 6 other human proteins associated with multiple viral oncoproteins. The functional enrichment analysis of these top-notch key genes is performed using KEGG pathway and Gene Ontology analysis, which reveals that the gene set is enriched in cell cycle a crucial cellular process, and the second most important pathway in which the gene set is involved is viral carcinogenesis. Among the viral proteins, E7 has the highest number of associations in the network followed by E6, E2 and E5. We found out a group of genes which is not targeted by the existing drugs available for HPV infections. It can be concluded that the molecules found in this study could be potential targets and could be used by scientists in their drug design studies.
