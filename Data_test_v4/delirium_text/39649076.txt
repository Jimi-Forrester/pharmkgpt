39649076|a|Objective: Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is a dementia intervention shown to improve cognition and quality of life (QoL). Previous research on individual CST delivered by family carers showed no significant improvements in people with dementia. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of Virtual Individual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (V-iCST) delivered by healthcare personnel. Methods: Mixed methods feasibility randomised controlled trial. Thirty-four participants were randomly allocated to either 14 sessions of twice-weekly V-iCST (n = 17) or treatment as usual (n = 17) delivered over seven weeks. We assessed cognition, QoL, communication, and depressive symptoms pre/post-treatment. We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with participants and carers (n = 15) following V-iCST, analysed with thematic analysis. Results: High levels of attendance, adherence, completion of outcomes, and moderate fidelity. There were no significant between-group changes, but there was a positive trend in cognition. Qualitative findings suggested that V-iCST was valued and convenient but can evoke negative emotions. Conclusions: V-iCST was feasible and acceptable. Preliminary data indicate that V-iCST delivered by healthcare personnel might meet a critical gap through increasing access to those who cannot or prefer not to attend in-person CST/groups. The need for remote treatments and CST being the main psychosocial intervention emphasizes the need for definitive trial.
