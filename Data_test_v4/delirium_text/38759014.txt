38759014|t|Prognostic Power? Do the Plasma Biomarkers, Neurofilament Light and Phospho-Tau 181, Improve Prediction of Progression to Alzheimer's Disease Using a Machine Learning Approach in the ADNI Cohort?
38759014|a|With the advent of therapeutics with potential to slow Alzheimer's disease progression the necessity of understanding the diagnostic value of plasma biomarkers is critical, not only for understanding the etiology and progression of Alzheimer's disease, but also for access and response to potentially disease modifying therapeutic agents. Multiple studies are currently assessing the sensitivity and specificity of plasma biomarkers in large cohorts such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. This study uses machine learning to predict the progression from mild cognitive impairment using plasma biomarkers in conjunction with well-established cerebrospinal fluid and imaging biomarkers of disease progression.
