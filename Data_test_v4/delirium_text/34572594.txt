34572594|t|The Effects of Fibrinogen's Interactions with Its Neuronal Receptors, Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 and Cellular Prion Protein.
34572594|a|Neuroinflammatory diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI), are associated with the extravascular deposition of the fibrinogen (Fg) derivative fibrin and are accompanied with memory impairment. We found that during the hyperfibrinogenemia that typically occurs during AD and TBI, extravasated Fg was associated with amyloid beta and astrocytic cellular prion protein (PrPC). These effects coincided with short-term memory (STM) reduction and neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms of a direct Fg-neuron interaction and its functional role in neurodegeneration are still unclear. Cultured mouse brain neurons were treated with Fg in the presence or absence of function-blockers of its receptors, PrPC or intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Associations of Fg with neuronal PrPC and ICAM-1 were characterized. The expression of proinflammatory marker interleukin 6 (IL-6) and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial superoxide, and nitrite in neurons were assessed. Fg-induced neuronal death was also evaluated. A strong association of Fg with neuronal PrPC and ICAM-1, accompanied with overexpression of IL-6 and enhanced generation of ROS, mitochondrial superoxide, and nitrite as well as the resulting neuronal death, was found. These effects were reduced by blocking the function of neuronal PrPC and ICAM-1, suggesting that the direct interaction of Fg with its neuronal receptors can induce overexpression of IL-6 and increase the generation of ROS, nitrite, and mitochondrial superoxide, ultimately leading to neuronal death. These effects can be a mechanism of neurodegeneration and the resultant memory reduction seen during TBI and AD.
