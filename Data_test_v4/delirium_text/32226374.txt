32226374|t|Cognitive Reserve Is Not Associated With Hippocampal Microstructure in Older Adults Without Dementia.
32226374|a|OBJECTIVE: Mean Diffusivity (MD) as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used to detect microstructural alterations of the brain's gray matter (GM). A previous study found that higher education, which is a proxy for cognitive reserve (CR), was related to decreased hippocampal MD in middle-aged healthy adults, indicating decreased microstructural damage in more educated participants. Based on this study, we aimed at determining the role of hippocampal GM MD in the interaction of AD pathology and CR in older people without dementia. METHOD: We used a sample of 52 cognitively normal people and 38 participants with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) from the ADNI database. MCI and cognitively normal participants were analyzed separately. Using linear models, we regressed hippocampal GM MD on CR (quantified by a composite score), amyloid status and the interaction of both, adjusting for age, gender and memory score. RESULTS: CR was not associated with hippocampal GM MD and hippocampal GM volume. Also, no interaction of amyloid status and CR was found. CONCLUSION: Our results do not confirm an association of CR and hippocampal GM MD in older adults. In contrast to previous studies, we did not find an association between CR and microstructural, nor macrostructural alterations of the hippocampus in older adults. More research is needed to determine the influence of CR on hippocampal microstructural integrity in relation to age and AD pathology.
