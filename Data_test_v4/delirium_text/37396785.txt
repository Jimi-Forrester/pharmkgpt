37396785|a|Introduction: Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic condition that causes intellectual disability in humans. The molecular mechanisms behind the DS phenotype remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, we present new findings on its molecular mechanisms through single-cell RNA sequencing. Methods: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the patients with DS and the normal control (NC) patients were differentiated into iPSCs-derived neural stem cells (NSCs). Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to achieve a comprehensive single-cell level differentiation roadmap for DS-iPSCs. Biological experiments were also performed to validate the findings. Results and Discussion: The results demonstrated that iPSCs can differentiate into NSCs in both DS and NC samples. Furthermore, 19,422 cells were obtained from iPSC samples (8,500 cells for DS and 10,922 cells for the NC) and 16,506 cells from NSC samples (7,182 cells for DS and 9,324 cells for the NC), which had differentiated from the iPSCs. A cluster of DS-iPSCs, named DS-iPSCs-not differentiated (DSi-PSCs-ND), which had abnormal expression patterns compared with NC-iPSCs, were demonstrated to be unable to differentiate into DS-NSCs. Further analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that inhibitor of differentiation family (ID family) members, which exhibited abnormal expression patterns throughout the differentiation process from DS-iPSCs to DS-NSCs, may potentially have contributed to the neural differentiation of DS-iPSCs. Moreover, abnormal differentiation fate was observed in DS-NSCs, which resulted in the increased differentiation of glial cells, such as astrocytes, but decreased differentiation into neuronal cells. Furthermore, functional analysis demonstrated that DS-NSCs and DS-NPCs had disorders in axon and visual system development. The present study provided a new insight into the pathogenesis of DS.
