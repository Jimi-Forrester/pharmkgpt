37424591|a|Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an endogenous catabolite of tryptophan that has been found to demonstrate neuroprotective properties in psychiatric disorders. Recently, accumulating data have suggested that KYNA may also play a significant role in various metabolic diseases by stimulating energy metabolism in adipose tissue and muscle. However, whether KYNA can serves as an anti-diabetes agent has yet to be studied. In this study, we investigated the potential anti-diabetic effects of administering KYNA orally through drinking water in pre-diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats and examined how this treatment may influence energy metabolism regulation within the liver. We found that hyperglycemic Goto-Kakizaki rats showed lower plasmatic KYNA levels compared to normal rats. Oral administration of KYNA significantly delayed the onset of diabetes in Goto-Kakizaki rats compared to untreated animals. Moreover, we found that KYNA treatment significantly increased respiration exchange ratio and promoted the energy expenditure by stimulating the expression of uncoupling protein (UCP). We confirmed that KYNA stimulated the UCP expression in HepG2 cells and mouse hepatocytes at mRNA and protein levels. Our study reveals that KYNA could potentially act as an anti-diabetic agent and KYNA-induced UCP upregulation is closely associated with the regulation of energy metabolism. These results provide further evidence for the therapeutic potential of KYNA in diabetes.
