7811491|t|[Multicenter register of index cases of dementia. A study by the Spanish Neurological Society's dementia group].
7811491|a|We report the objectives and case registration methods used by neurologists belonging to the Spanish Neurological Society's dementia group (GERMICIDE). Forerunners of the present project are also described. The group's principal aim, which is to determine the distribution of dementia in the "neurological" environment is pursued by enrolling consecutive index cases (new presentations) arriving at 18 Spanish neurological units over a period of 2 years. A standard protocol was used to study the patients and final diagnoses were agreed upon in keeping with international criteria for dementia and the main neurological diseases (DSM-III-R, CDR and others). A second objective is to study risk factors for the main etiological groups of dementia (Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia) and to follow each patient in the cohort until death in order to assess the course of disease and its biological markers. The series will be large, as there are already over 800 cases listed in the coordinating centre even though the period of enrollment has not ended.
