23537795|a|OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence of delirium in the residential environment and to analyse the associated clinical, functional and mental factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional epidemic study was conducted on a population of elderly persons institutionalised in 2011 in 6 nursing homes in Asturias. Socio-demographic, clinical, functional (Barthel Index [BI]) and mental (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]) variables were collected. Delirium was defined by the Confusion Assessment Method. RESULTS: A total of 505 elderly were included in the study (age 83.30 +- 7.33 years, with 67.70% women), and scores on the MMSE of 17.19 +- 10.35 and a BI score of 55.11 +- 35.82. The prevalence of delirium was 11.70%. On examining the risk of delirium among the studied variables, there was statistical significance when considering: BI, MMSE, dementia, pressure ulcers, or urinary catheter, and the prescribing of clomethiazole, ACTH-I or trazodone. In the analysis of the variables in the logistic regression with BI, diagnosis of dementia, the prescribing of clomethiazole or trazodone, in the equation, there was a statistical significance associated with delirium. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of delirium in a residential environment in our study population was 11.7%. The results show that BI, diagnosis of dementia, and prescribing of clomethiazole or trazodone were associated with risk of delirium in institutionalised patients.
