36762332|a|Cognitive impairment is common in patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Researchers are seeking pharmaceutical compounds with low side effects to decrease these outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba therapy on the cognitive function of patients treated with electroshock. In a double-blinded clinical trial, 80 patients with psychiatric disorders who were candidates for ECT in 2019 were randomly assigned to two groups: the intervention group (receiving Ginkgo biloba drug) and the control group (receiving placebo). We used the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Wechsler Memory Scale Recipe III (WMS-III) questionnaires to evaluate the efficacy of the drug on the cognitive function at time 0, after 4 sessions and 72 hours post-final session of ECT. The data were analyzed by SPSS version 22, with a significance level of 0.05. Patients' assessment after the intervention showed that the average MMSE scores in the intervention group (28.92+-1.04) were statistically higher than in the control group (27.85+-1.56). The average scores of the WMS-III in the intervention group and the control group were 97.45+-8.04 and 92.00+-4.45 after 4 sessions of ECT, and 100.26+-8.33 and 92.40+-3.92 after the intervention (p=0.001). According to the findings, Gingko biloba increased MMSE and WMS-III scores in older patients (patients over 40 had better scores in both questionnaires, the drug was more effective, and with no side effects).
