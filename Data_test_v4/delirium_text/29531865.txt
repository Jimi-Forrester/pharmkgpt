29531865|a|Flavonoids have been used in traditional medicine to promote human health. Crocin has been proposed to be effective in the management of the various diseases including the neurodegenerative diseases. Antiepileptic and anti-Alzheimer effects of crocin have also been indicated. The efficacy of crocis in the treatment of cerebral ischemia and traumatic brain injury was also confirmed by using animal models. Crocin treatment increased dopamine levels in the brain of experimental model of Parkinson's disease. In addition, crocin modulates the opioid system to decrease the withdrawal syndrome. Thus, the present study highlighted the effects of crocin on the nervous system and the underling mechanisms. This review also indicated that crocins can be considered as an effective candidate in the management of nervous system diseases due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammation effects.
