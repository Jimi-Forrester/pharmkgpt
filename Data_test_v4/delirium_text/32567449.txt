32567449|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between dyslipidaemia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a cohort of postmenopausal women. METHODS: This retrospective study analysed data from postmenopausal women with early AD (group AD) and a cohort of healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects (group NC) that were considered to be within standard limits according to a neuropsychological assessment between March 2010 and March 2019. The primary endpoints were body mass index and lipid-related laboratory parameters, including leptin, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol, adiponectin, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein E4, which were evaluated using multivariate binary logistic analysis. RESULTS: The study enrolled 200 postmenopausal women with early AD (mean +- SD age 69.34 +- 6.25 years) and 180 control subjects (mean +- SD age 67.48 +- 7.42 years). Lower HDL-C and higher LDL-C were risk factors for AD. A multivariate binary logistic regression model demonstrated that lower HDL-C and higher LDL-C were the only variables associated with the development of AD (odds ratio [OR] 21.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.47, 4.13; OR 36.35, 95% CI 1.24, 3.38; respectively). CONCLUSION: Both low HDL-C and high LDL-C were associated with the occurrence of AD in a cohort of postmenopausal women.
