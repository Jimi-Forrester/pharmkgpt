37620595|t|Trends and perioperative mortality in gastric cancer surgery: a nationwide population-based cohort study.
37620595|a|This study aimed to investigate changes and perioperative mortality over a 6-year period within the Italian Hospital Information System among patients with gastric cancer (GC) who underwent gastrectomies and to identify risk factors associated with 90-day mortality. Additionally, nationwide differences between high and low-volume hospitals were evaluated. A nationwide retrospective study was conducted using patient hospital discharge records (HDRs) based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) classification. The HDRs were linked to the National Tax Registry records using deterministic record linkage. The data were obtained from the Italian National Outcomes Evaluation Programme (PNE). Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine risk factors for 90-day mortality among patients with GC who underwent partial or total gastrectomies over the period from 2018 to 2020 with adjustment for comorbidities. Overall, the number of patients with GC who underwent total or partial gastrectomies steadily decreased in Italy from 5765 in 2015 to 4291 in 2020 (p < 0.001). The use of the laparoscopic approach more than doubled from 2015 (10.8%) to 2020 (26.3%), with a concomitant conversion rate from laparoscopy to open surgery decreasing from 7.7 to 5.8%. The 30 and 90-day mortality rates remained stable over time (p > 0.05). Low-volume hospitals had higher inpatient, early, and late mortality compared to high-volume hospitals (5.9% vs 3.8%, 6.3% vs 3.8%, and 11.8% vs 7.9%, respectively; p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that an advanced age (adjusted odds ratio: 3.72; 95% [CI]: 3.15-4.39; p < 0.001), an open approach (adjusted-OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.43-1.99, p < 0.001) and a total gastrectomy (adjusted-OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.27-1.64, p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for 90-day mortality. Additionally, patients with GC who referred to high-volume hospitals were 26% less likely to die within 90 days after a gastrectomy than those who underwent surgery in low-volume hospitals. During the 6-year period, surgeons implemented a minimally invasive approach to reduce the conversion over time. Centralisation was associated with better outcomes while advanced age, an open approach, and total gastrectomy were identified as risk factors for 90-day mortality.
