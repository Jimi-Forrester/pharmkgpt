25055921|t|A schematic workflow for collecting information about the interaction between copy number variants and microRNAs using existing resources.
25055921|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and copy number variations (CNVs) are two extensively studied genomic components in the field of modern biology-as they have been found to be associated with many disorders such as cancer, Alzheimer, pancreatitis, HIV susceptibility, beta-thalassemia, and glomerulonephritis. Several studies suggested that an alteration in CNV-miRNA interaction could result in some human diseases such as cancer. Therefore, the possible miRNA-binding site information within the CNV genes opens new avenues in understanding such disorders. In this chapter, we present a schematic approach for collecting the information on CNV-miRNA interactions using miRWalk and TargetScan databases.
