28827863|a|BACKGROUND: Very few studies have evaluated the reasons for referral to consultation-liaison (CL) psychiatry teams. AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the psychiatric morbidity pattern, reasons for referral and diagnostic concordance between physicians/surgeons and the CL psychiatry team. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and nineteen psychiatric referrals made to the CL psychiatry team were assessed for reason for referral and diagnostic concordance in terms of reason of referral and psychiatric diagnosis made by the CL psychiatry team. RESULTS: In 57% of cases, a specific psychiatric diagnosis was mentioned by the physician/surgeon. The most common specific psychiatric diagnoses considered by the physician/surgeon included depression, substance abuse, and delirium. Most common psychiatric diagnosis made by the CL psychiatric services was delirium followed by depressive disorders. Diagnostic concordance between physician/surgeon and psychiatrist was low (kappa < 0.3) for depressive disorders and delirium and better for the diagnosis of substance dependence (kappa = 0.678) and suicidality (kappa = 0.655). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that delirium is the most common diagnosis in referrals made to CL psychiatry team, and there is poor concordance between the psychiatric diagnosis considered by the physician/surgeon and the psychiatrist for delirium and depression; however, the concordance rates for substance dependence and suicidal behavior are acceptable.
