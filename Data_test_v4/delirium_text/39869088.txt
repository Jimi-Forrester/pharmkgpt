39869088|t|Horizontal Gaze Tolerance and Its Effects on Visual Sensitivity in Glaucoma.
39869088|a|Purpose: This study evaluates the effect of 6  horizontal gaze tolerance on visual field mean sensitivity (MS) in patients with glaucoma using a binocular head-mounted automated perimeter, following findings of structural changes in the posterior globe from magnetic resonance imaging and optical coherence tomography. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 161 eyes (85 primary open-angle glaucoma [POAG] and 76 healthy) from 117 participants were included. Logistic regression and 1:1 matched analysis assessed the propensity score for glaucoma and healthy eyes, considering age, sex, and axial length as confounders. Visual field tests were performed with the imo perimeter (CREWT Medical Systems, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) at central gaze, 6  abduction, and 6  adduction positions as fixation points. A mixed-effects model was used to compare MS under all conditions. Results: The analysis included a total of 82 eyes, with 41 POAG and 41 healthy after matching. The mean (standard deviation) age was 68.0 (11.0) years, with a mean deviation of -9.9 (6.6) dB for POAG and -1.0 (1.9) dB for healthy eyes using Humphrey field analysis 24-2. MS did not significantly differ among central gaze (27.0 [1.8] dB), abduction (27.1 [1.9] dB), and adduction (26.9 [2.2] dB) in healthy eyes (P = 0.650). However, MS was significantly lower for adduction (17.2 [5.9] dB) compared to central gaze (18.1 [5.9] dB) and abduction (17.9 [5.9] dB) in glaucoma eyes (P = 0.001 and P = 0.022, respectively). Conclusions: Horizontal gaze, especially in adduction, significantly reduces visual sensitivity in glaucoma, suggesting a specific vulnerability associated with eye movement. This finding highlights the importance of eye positioning in glaucoma, warranting further investigation of its clinical significance.
