38886822|a|Areca nut, the seed of Areca catechu L., is one of the most widely consumed addictive substances in the world after nicotine, ethanol, and caffeine. The major effective constituent of A. catechu, arecoline, has been reported to affect the central nervous system. Less is known if it may affect pain and its related emotional responses. In this study, we found that oral application of arecoline alleviated the inflammatory pain and its induced anxiolytic and anti-depressive-like behavior. Arecoline also increased the mechanical nociceptive threshold and alleviated depression-like behavior in naive mice. In the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which acts as a hinge of nociception and its related anxiety and depression, by using the multi-electrode field potential recording and whole-cell patch-clamp recording, we found that the evoked postsynaptic transmission in the ACC of adult mice has been inhibited by the application of arecoline. The muscarinic receptor is the major receptor of the arecoline in the ACC. Our results suggest that arecoline alleviates pain, anxiety, and depression-like behavior in both physiological and pathological conditions, and this new mechanism may help to treat patients with chronic pain and its related anxiety and disorder in the future.
