32802136|t|Network Pharmacology-Based Strategy to Investigate the Pharmacological Mechanisms of Ginkgo biloba Extract for Aging.
32802136|a|Aging is a main risk factor for a number of debilitating diseases and contributes to an increase in mortality. Previous studies have shown that Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb) can prevent and treat aging-related diseases, but its pharmacological effects need to be further clarified. This study aimed to propose a network pharmacology-based method to identify the therapeutic pathways of EGb for aging. The active components of EGb and targets of sample chemicals were obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) database. Information on aging-related genes was obtained from the Human Ageing Genomic Resources database and JenAge Ageing Factor Database. Subsequently, a network containing the interactions between the putative targets of EGb and known therapeutic targets of aging was established, which was used to investigate the pharmacological mechanisms of EGb for aging. A total of 24 active components, 154 targets of active components of EGb, and 308 targets of aging were obtained. Network construction and pathway enrichment were conducted after data integration. The study found that flavonoids (quercetin, luteolin, and kaempferol) and beta-sitosterol may be the main active components of EGb. The top eight candidate targets, namely, PTGS2, PPARG, DPP4, GSK3B, CCNA2, AR, MAPK14, and ESR1, were selected as the main therapeutic targets of EGb. Pathway enrichment results in various pathways were associated with inhibition of oxidative stress, inhibition of inflammation, amelioration of insulin resistance, and regulation of cellular biological processes. Molecular docking results showed that PPARG had better binding capacity with beta-sitosterol, and PTGS2 had better binding capacity with kaempferol and quercetin. The main components of EGb may act on multiple targets, such as PTGS2, PPARG, DPP4, and GSK3B, to regulate multiple pathways, and play an antiaging role by inhibiting oxidative stress, inhibiting inflammation, and ameliorating insulin resistance.
