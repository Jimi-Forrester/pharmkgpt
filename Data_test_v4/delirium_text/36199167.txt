36199167|a|Heparan sulfate (HS) plays important roles in many biological processes. The inherent complexity of naturally existing HS has severely hindered the thorough understanding of their structure-activity relationship. To facilitate biological studies, a new strategy has been developed to synthesize a HS-like pseudo-hexasaccharide library, where HS disaccharides were linked in a "head-to-tail" fashion from the reducing end of a disaccharide module to the non-reducing end of a neighboring module. Combinatorial syntheses of 27 HS-like pseudo-hexasaccharides were achieved. This new class of compounds bound with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) with similar structure-activity trends as HS oligosaccharides bearing native glycosyl linkages. The ease of synthesis and the ability to mirror natural HS activity trends suggest that the new head-to-tail linked pseudo-oligosaccharides could be an exciting tool to facilitate the understanding of HS biology.
