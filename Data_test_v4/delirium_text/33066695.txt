33066695|t|Computational SNP Analysis and Molecular Simulation Revealed the Most Deleterious Missense Variants in the NBD1 Domain of Human ABCA1 Transporter.
33066695|a|The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a membrane-bound exporter protein involved in regulating serum HDL level by exporting cholesterol and phospholipids to load up in lipid-poor ApoA-I and ApoE, which allows the formation of nascent HDL. Mutations in the ABCA1 gene, when presents in both alleles, disrupt the canonical function of ABCA1, which associates with many disorders related to lipid transport. Although many studies have reported the phenotypic effects of a large number of ABCA1 variants, the pathological effect of non-synonymous polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in ABCA1 remains elusive. Therefore, aiming at exploring the structural and functional consequences of nsSNPs in ABCA1, in this study, we employed an integrated computational approach consisting of nine well-known in silico tools to identify damaging SNPs and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to get insights into the magnitudes of the damaging effects. In silico tools revealed four nsSNPs as being most deleterious, where the two SNPs (G1050V and S1067C) are identified as the highly conserved and functional disrupting mutations located in the NBD1 domain. MD simulation suggested that both SNPs, G1050V and S1067C, changed the overall structural flexibility and dynamics of NBD1, and induced substantial alteration in the structural organization of ATP binding site. Taken together, these findings direct future studies to get more insights into the role of these variants in the loss of the ABCA1 function.
