30092511|a|The increase of oligomeric amyloid-beta (oAbeta) has been related to synaptic dysfunction, thought to be the earliest event in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Conversely, the suppression of endogenous Abeta impaired synaptic plasticity and memory, suggesting that the peptide is needed in the healthy brain. However, different species, aggregation forms and concentrations of Abeta might differently influence synaptic function/dysfunction. Here, we have tested the contribution of monomeric and oligomeric Abeta42 and Abeta40 at 200 nM and 200 pM concentrations on hippocampal long-term potentiation and spatial memory. We found that, when at 200 nM, oAbeta40, oAbeta42, and monomeric Abeta42 impaired long-term potentiation and memory, whereas only oAbeta42 200 pM enhanced synaptic plasticity and memory and rescued the detrimental effect due to depletion of endogenous Abeta. Interestingly, quantification of monomer-like and oligomer-like species carried out by transmission electron microscopy revealed an increase of the monomer/oligomer ratio in the oAbeta42 200 pM preparation, suggesting that the content of monomers and oligomers depends on the final concentration of the solution.
