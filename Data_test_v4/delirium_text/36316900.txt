36316900|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this meta-analysis is to systematically evaluate and summarize the risk factors of intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICU-AW), to provide evidence-based evidence for the formulation of prevention strategies for ICU-AW. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CBM (China Biology Medicine, China), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese WANFANG, and VIP will be searched to define relevant risk factors for ICU-AW. The databases search period is from January 1, 2005 to August 13, 2021. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) is used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. RevMan 5.3 analysis software will be used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis included a total of 12 cohort studies, including 9 international journals and 3 Chinese journals, with a total of 1950 patients, of which 856 had ICU-AW. The results showed that the significant risk factors for ICU-AW included female (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-1.71; P = .02), mechanical ventilation days (OR = 3.04, 95% CI: 1.82-4.26; P < .00001), age (OR = 6.33, 95% CI: 5.05-7.61; P < .00001), length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (OR = 3.78, 95% CI: 2.06-5.51; P < .0001), infectious disease (OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.20-2.33; P = .002), renal replacement therapy (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.11-2.28; P = .01), use of aminoglucoside drugs (OR = 2.51, 95% CI: 1.54-4.08; P = .0002), sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.24-1.90; P = .01), hyperglycemia (OR = 2.95, 95% CI: 1.70-5.11; P = .0001). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides comprehensive evidence-based on the assessment of the risk factors for ICU-AW, their multifactorial etiology was confirmed. This study indicated that female, mechanical ventilation days, age, length of ICU stay, infectious disease, renal replacement therapy, use of aminoglucoside drugs, SOFA score, and hyperglycemia are independent risk factors for ICU-AW. We have not found consistent evidence that corticosteroids, neuromuscular blockers, sepsis have any effect on ICU-AW risk.
