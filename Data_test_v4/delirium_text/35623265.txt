35623265|t|Postoperative outcomes in older surgical patients with preoperative cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
35623265|a|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of cognitive impairment (CI) and dementia on adverse outcomes in older surgical patients. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Various databases were searched from their inception dates to March 8, 2021. SETTING: Preoperative assessment. PATIENTS: Older patients (>= 60 years) undergoing non-cardiac surgery. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes included postoperative delirium, mortality, discharge to assisted care, 30-day readmissions, postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay. Effect sizes were calculated as Odds Ratio (OR) and Mean Difference (MD) based on random effect model analysis. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk Bias Tool for RCTs and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational cohort studies. RESULTS: Fifty-three studies (196,491 patients) were included. Preoperative CI was associated with a significant risk of delirium in older patients after non-cardiac surgery (25.1% vs. 10.3%; OR: 3.84; 95%CI: 2.35, 6.26; I2: 76%; p < 0.00001). Cognitive impairment (26.2% vs. 13.2%; OR: 2.28; 95%CI: 1.39, 3.74; I2: 73%; p = 0.001) and dementia (41.6% vs. 25.5%; OR: 1.96; 95%CI: 1.34, 2.88; I2: 99%; p = 0.0006) significantly increased risk for 1-year mortality. In patients with CI, there was an increased risk of discharge to assisted care (44.7% vs. 38.3%; OR 1.74; 95%CI: 1.05, 2.89, p = 0.03), 30-day readmissions (14.3% vs. 10.8%; OR: 1.36; 95%CI: 1.00, 1.84, p = 0.05), and postoperative complications (40.7% vs. 18.8%; OR: 1.85; 95%CI: 1.37, 2.49; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative CI in older surgical patients significantly increases risk of delirium, 1-year mortality, discharge to assisted care, 30-day readmission, and postoperative complications. Dementia increases the risk of 1-year mortality. Cognitive screening in the preoperative assessment for older surgical patients may be helpful for risk stratification so that appropriate management can be implemented to mitigate adverse postoperative outcomes.
