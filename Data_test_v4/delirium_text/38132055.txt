38132055|a|(1) Background: Esophago-airway fistula after esophageal resection is a rare, life-threatening complication associated with a high postoperative mortality rate. Managing this condition is challenging, and the prognosis for patients is uncertain. The results and our own approach to treatment are presented. (2) Material and Methods: We present a retrospective analysis of a group of 22 patients treated for an esophago-airway fistula between 2012 and 2022, with 21 cases after esophageal resection and one during the course of Hodgkin's disease. (3) Results: Twenty-two patients were treated for an esophago-airway fistula. Among them, a tracheobronchial fistula occurred in 21 (95.4%) patients during the postoperative period, while 1 (4.5%) was treated for Hodgkin's disease. Of these cases, 17 (70.7%) patients underwent esophageal diversion with various treatments, including intercostal flap in most cases, greater omentum in one (4.5%), latissimus dorsi muscle in two (9%), and greater pectoral muscle in one (4.5%). Esophageal stenting was performed in two patients (9.0%), and one (4.5%) was treated conservatively. Unfortunately, one patient (4.5%) died after being treated with bronchial stenting, and two (9.5%) experienced a recurrence of the fistula. (4) Conclusions: The occurrence of an esophago-airway fistula after esophagectomy is a rare but life-threatening complication with an uncertain prognosis that results in several serious perioperative sequelae.
