20101275|t|Roles of the prostaglandin E2 receptors EP subtypes in Alzheimer's disease.
20101275|a|Neuroinflammation has always been of concern in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a major inflammatory mediator, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) plays an important role in the inflammatory process of AD. Up to now, there is still controversy on the neuroprotective or neurotoxic role of PGE(2). However, the role of PGE(2) in neurodegeneration may be far more complex, due to the 4 EP receptor subtypes. This article aims to summarize the relationship between PGE(2) receptor EP subtypes and AD. It is believed that a better understanding of the PGE(2) receptor EP subtypes may help to clarify the relation between inflammation and AD, and to develop novel therapeutic strategies targeting specific EP receptor for AD treatment.
