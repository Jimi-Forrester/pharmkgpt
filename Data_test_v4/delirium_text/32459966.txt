32459966|t|Matrix Metalloproteinases as New Targets in Alzheimer's Disease: Opportunities and Challenges.
32459966|a|Although matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated in the regulation of numerous physiological processes, evidence of their pathological roles have also been obtained in the last decades, making MMPs attractive therapeutic targets for several diseases. Recent discoveries of their involvement in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, and in particular in Alzheimer's disease (AD), have paved the way to consider MMP modulators as promising therapeutic strategies. Over the past few decades, diverse approaches have been undertaken in the design of therapeutic agents targeting MMPs for various purposes, leading, more recently, to encouraging developments. In this article, we will present recent examples of inhibitors ranging from small molecules and peptidomimetics to biologics. We will also discuss the scientific knowledge that has led to the development of emerging tools and techniques to overcome the challenges of selective MMP inhibition.
