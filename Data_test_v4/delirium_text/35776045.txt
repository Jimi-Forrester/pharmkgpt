35776045|a|OBJECTIVE: Delirium is an acute disorder in which attention, perception, memory, thought, mood, psychomotor activity and sleep-wake cycles change rapidly. Delirium is also a common clinical syndrome in patients hospitalized in intensive care units due to COVID-19 pneumonia. We reviewed clinical features and predisposing factors of delirium according to psychomotor subtype in patients hospitalized in the intensive care units due to COVID-19 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 64 patients who were hospitalized in the intensive care units due to COVID-19 pneumonia were included. Delirium status and psychomotor subtype were determined by applying the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit scale to the patients daily. The gender, age, comorbidity, treatments, intubation, and mortality rates of the patients were recorded. Multivariate analyses were performed by examining predisposing factors, arterial blood gases, hemograms, biochemistry, and brain magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: There were 64 patients in delirium clinic, 65.6% (n=42) of them were male. Hypokinetic delirium was more common in 60.9% (n=39). 79.4% of the patients who received ventilator support were male (p=0.013).When mortality was analyzed in this group, hypoactive delirium was found to be significantly higher (p=0.035). In addition, leukocyte levels were higher in patients with hypokinetic delirium (p=0.029). Ferritin and fibrinogen levels were higher in patients with hyperkinetic delirium (p=0.039, p=0.008, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of additional diseases such as advanced age, male gender, hypertension, coronary artery disease, dementia, and hypoxia were factors that increased the frequency of delirium. In addition, the mortality rate was higher in patients with hypokinetic delirium.
