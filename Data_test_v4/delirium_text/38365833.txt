Current approaches targeting hallmark pathological features of AD have had no consistent clinical benefit. Neuroinflammation is a major contributor to neurodegeneration and hence, microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, are an attractive target for potentially more effective therapeutic strategies. However, there is no current in vitro model system that captures AD patient-specific microglial characteristics using physiologically relevant and experimentally flexible culture conditions. METHODS: To address this shortcoming, we developed novel 3D Matrigel-based monocyte-derived microglia-like cell (MDMi) mono-cultures and co-cultures with neuro-glial cells (ReNcell VM). We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis to compare the transcriptomic signatures of MDMi between model systems (2D, 3D and 3D co-culture) and against published human microglia datasets. To demonstrate the potential of MDMi for use in personalized pre-clinical strategies, we generated and characterized MDMi models from sixteen AD patients and matched healthy controls, and profiled cytokine responses upon treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs (dasatinib and spiperone). RESULTS: MDMi in 3D exhibited a more branched morphology and longer survival in culture compared to 2D. scRNAseq uncovered distinct MDMi subpopulations that exhibit higher functional heterogeneity and best resemble human microglia in 3D co-culture. AD MDMi in 3D co-culture showed altered cell-to-cell interactions, growth factor and cytokine secretion profiles and responses to amyloid-beta. Drug testing assays revealed patient- and model-specific cytokine responses. CONCLUSION: Our study presents a novel, physiologically relevant and AD patient-specific 3D microglia cell model that opens avenues towards improving personalized drug development strategies in AD.
