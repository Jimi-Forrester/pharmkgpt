24828504|t|Early-onset formation of parenchymal plaque amyloid abrogates cerebral microvascular amyloid accumulation in transgenic mice.
24828504|a|The fibrillar assembly and deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) protein, a key pathology of Alzheimer disease, can occur in the form of parenchymal amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Familial forms of CAA exist in the absence of appreciable parenchymal amyloid pathology. The molecular interplay between parenchymal amyloid plaques and CAA is unclear. Here we investigated how early-onset parenchymal amyloid plaques impact the development of microvascular amyloid in transgenic mice. Tg-5xFAD mice, which produce non-mutated human Abeta and develop early-onset parenchymal amyloid plaques, were bred to Tg-SwDI mice, which produce familial CAA mutant human Abeta and develop cerebral microvascular amyloid. The bigenic mice presented with an elevated accumulation of Abeta and fibrillar amyloid in the brain compared with either single transgenic line. Tg-SwDI/Tg-5xFAD mice were devoid of microvascular amyloid, the prominent pathology of Tg-SwDI mice, but exhibited larger parenchymal amyloid plaques compared with Tg-5xFAD mice. The larger parenchymal amyloid deposits were associated with a higher loss of cortical neurons and elevated activated microglia in the bigenic Tg-SwDI/Tg-5xFAD mice. The periphery of parenchymal amyloid plaques was largely composed of CAA mutant Abeta. Non-mutated Abeta fibril seeds promoted CAA mutant Abeta fibril formation in vitro. Further, intrahippocampal administration of biotin-labeled CAA mutant Abeta peptide accumulated on and adjacent to pre-existing parenchymal amyloid plaques in Tg-5xFAD mice. These findings indicate that early-onset parenchymal amyloid plaques can serve as a scaffold to capture CAA mutant Abeta peptides and prevent their accumulation in cerebral microvessels.
