30294468|a|Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) describes all forms of cognitive impairment caused by any type of cerebrovascular disease. Early identification of VCI is quite difficult due to the lack of both sensitive and specific biomarkers. Extensive damage to the white matter tracts, which connect the cortical and subcortical regions, has been shown in subcortical VCI (SVCI), the most common subtype of VCI that is caused by small vessel disease. Two specific MRI sequences, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have emerged as useful tools for identifying subtle white matter changes and the intrinsic connectivity between distinct cortical regions. This review describes the advantages of these two modalities in SVCI research and the current DTI and fMRI findings on SVCI. Using DTI technique, a variety of studies found that white matter microstructural damages in the anterior and superior areas are more specific to SVCI. Similarly, functional brain abnormalities detected by fMRI have also been mainly shown in anterior brain areas in SVCI. The characteristic distribution of brain abnormalities in SVCI interrupts the prefrontal-subcortical loop that results in cognitive impairments in particular domains, which further confirms the 'disconnection syndrome' hypothesis. In addition, another MRI technique, arterial spin labelling (ASL), has been used to describe the disconnection patterns in a variety of conditions by measuring cerebral blood flow. The role of the ASL technique in SVCI research is also assessed. Finally, the review proposes the application of multimodality fusion in the investigation of SVCI pathogenesis.
