38479478|a|Non-pharmacological therapy has gained popularity in the intervention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its apparent therapeutic effectiveness and the limitation of biological drug. A wealth of research indicates that music interventions can enhance cognition, mood and behavior in individuals with AD. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms behind these improvements have yet to be fully and systematically delineated. This review aims to holistically review how music-based intervention (MBI) ameliorates abnormal emotion, cognition decline, and behavioral changes in AD patients. We cover several key dimensions: the regulation of MBIs on cerebral blood flow (CBF), their impact on neurotransmission (including GABAergic and monoaminergic transmissions), modulation of synaptic plasticity, and hormonal release. Additionally, we summarize the clinical applications and limitations of active music-based intervention (AMBI), passive music-based intervention (PMBI), and hybrid music-based intervention (HMBI). This thorough analysis enhances s our understanding of the role of MBI in AD and supports the development of non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies.
