2633127|t|Treatment of AIDS in a psychiatric setting.
2633127|a|Treatment staff in psychiatric facilities must meet new diagnostic and treatment challenges as more patients with an AIDS-related syndrome are admitted to their institutions. Staff probably will encounter two categories of patients with AIDS-related syndromes requiring treatment: functional, which is adjustment disorder; and organic brain syndrome, which includes major depression, dementia, and delirium. Health care professionals dealing with these people must respond to legal and ethical questions surrounding the diagnosis and plan of care. This article examines treatment issues, and legal and ethical questions that often arise in the delivery of care to psychiatric patients with an AIDS-related syndrome. Specific areas addressed include care of the psychotic patient, compulsory testing, and confidentiality of information. The article presents some suggested basic guidelines for working with patients with AIDS.
