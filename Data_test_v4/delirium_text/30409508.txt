However, due to the difficulty in obtaining human astrocytes, their role in these pathologies is still poorly characterized. Here, we develop a serum-free protocol to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into astrocytes. Gene expression and functional assays show that our protocol consistently yields a highly enriched population of resting mature astrocytes across the 13 hiPSC lines differentiated. Using this model, we first highlight the importance of serum-free media for astrocyte culture to generate resting astrocytes. Second, we assess the astrocytic response to IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, all cytokines important in neuroinflammation, such as multiple sclerosis. Our study reveals very specific profiles of reactive astrocytes depending on the triggering stimulus. This model provides ideal conditions for in-depth and unbiased characterization of astrocyte reactivity in neuroinflammatory conditions.
