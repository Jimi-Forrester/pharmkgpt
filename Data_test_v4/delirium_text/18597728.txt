18597728|a|Aripiprazole is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in Europe and the United States, and for bipolar disorders in the latter. Nevertheless, a review of recent literature has shown that aripiprazole has been studied in many other disorders, notably resistant depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, borderline personality, Tourette syndrome, addiction, psychotic symptoms in children and adolescents, and neurological and psychiatric disorders in the elderly (late onset delusional disorders, Alzheimer, Parkinson, and delirium). The study of aripiprazole in these numerous indications is motivated by its excellent tolerance and original pharmacological effect (partial agonistic effect on the D2 and 5-HT1A receptors, and antagonistic effect on the 5-HT2A receptors). This paper reviews the recent literature, with particular attention paid to the level of proof provided by these various studies.
