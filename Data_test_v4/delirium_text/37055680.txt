37055680|t|Reversible splenial lesion after surgery for distant arteriovenous malformation: a case report.
37055680|a|Isolated lesions of the corpus callosum are rare and may represent permanent but also transient responses to various pathology termed "reversible splenial lesion syndrome" (RESLES) when in light of relevant clinical presentation. We present the first case of the RESLES after elective surgery for distant arteriovenous malformation (AVM), followed by a slight speech disturbance and MRI verified small, oval, well-circumscribed area of apparent cytotoxic edema in the center of the corpus callosum splenium, which completely resolved within 15 days. Surgery for AVM is followed by the complex adaptation to a new vascular pattern, RESLES might develop, and should be suspected.
