31490322|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is a high prevalence of delirium in palliative care patients. This review aims to evaluate the effects of the pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions used to manage delirium symptoms in this patient group. RECENT FINDINGS: A recent study has suggested there is no role for antipsychotic medication in the management of delirium in palliative care patients, which is a move away from previous expert opinion. In addition, recent findings suggest there may be a role for the use of antipsychotics in combination with benzodiazepines in the management of agitated delirium. SUMMARY: It is too early to abandon the use of antipsychotic medication entirely in the management of delirium, however there remains inadequate evidence to support the routine use of either pharmacological or nonpharmacological interventions for delirium treatment. Clinicians should determine the delirium subtype and severity, using this to inform the most appropriate pharmacological treatment if required. Further rigorously designed research is needed to seek clarity over whether the alleviation of symptoms is dose dependent, and to determine whether there is a severity threshold over which pharmacological interventions are most effective. Future research is required to evaluate nonpharmacological interventions in this population.
