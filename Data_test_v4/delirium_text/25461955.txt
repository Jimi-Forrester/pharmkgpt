25461955|a|OBJECTIVES: Recent genome-wide association studies identified bridging integrator 1 (Bin1) to be associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD). To clarify the relevance of Bin1 as a genetic determinant of AD, we analyzed its association in a Han Chinese population from the South East part of mainland China. METHODS: This study investigated 427 SAD patients and 451 unrelated age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs7561528 and rs744373) adjacent to Bin1 that emerged from previous genome-wide association studies were genotyped using the MassARRAY Analyzer 4 Sequenom platform. RESULTS: As expected, the genotype distribution of rs7561528 was significantly different between the SAD group and the controls, with more AG in controls [odds ratio (OR) 0.605, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.429-0.854, P=0.004], and the difference increased using an additive genetic model (OR 0.593, 95% CI 0.425-0.828, P=0.002). However, we did not observe a difference in the genotype distribution of the rs744373 between the SAD and the control group (OR 1.189, 95% CI 0.809-1.747, P=0.378). CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to confirm the association of the variant rs7561528 adjacent to Bin1 with SAD in a Han Chinese Population.
