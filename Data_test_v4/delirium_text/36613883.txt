36613883|a|Antioxidants are being explored as novel therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) through strategies such as chemically linking antioxidants to synthesize novel co-drugs. The main objective of this study was to assess the cytoprotective effects of the novel antioxidant compound VANL-100 in a cellular model of beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced toxicity. The cytotoxic effects of Abeta in the presence and absence of all antioxidant compounds were measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2-5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in SH-SY5Y cells in both pre-treatment and co-treatment experiments. In pre-treatment experiments, VANL-100, or one of its parent compounds, naringenin (NAR), alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), or naringenin + alpha-lipoic acid (NAR + ALA), was administrated 24 h prior to an additional 24-h incubation with 20 muM non-fibril or fibril Abeta25-35. Co-treatment experiments consisted of simultaneous treatment with Abeta and antioxidants. Pre-treatment and co-treatment with VANL-100 significantly attenuated Abeta-induced cell death. There were no significant differences between the protective effects of VANL-100, NAR, ALA, and NAR + ALA with either form of Abeta, or in the effect of VANL-100 between 24-h pre-treatment and co-treatment. These results demonstrate that the novel co-drug VANL-100 is capable of eliciting cytoprotective effects against Abeta-induced toxicity.
