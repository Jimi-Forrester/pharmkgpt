20386634|t|When Should Brain Imaging be Performed?: A Case Report of Caudate Nucleus Infarct.
20386634|a|A 21-year-old man presented in a state of delirium with compulsive, pathologic laughter and no focal neurologic findings. Brain imaging revealed a lenticulostriate artery infarct of the caudate nucleus. The absence of neurological signs made the diagnosis difficult, but the presence of delirium was a clue to the existence of structural brain disease.
