35425931|t|Cognitive impairment in adult CHD survivors: A pilot study.
35425931|a|The most common comorbidities in children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are neurodevelopmental impairments, particularly in areas of executive function, memory and attention. Limited studies have demonstrated similar impairments in CHD adults although no studies have screened specifically for mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Methods We performed a prospective cross-sectional study of CHD patients, ages 30-65 years, who were coming for clinic visits. We administered the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), and scores were compared with population norms adjusted by age and education level. Results A total of 125 patients were recruited (55% male). The median age was 40 years (range 30-65). More than a half (80%) had some college education or advanced degrees. Adjusting for age and education, CHD participants scored significantly lower than the general population (median 1 point lower, p<0.001) on the MMSE. The greatest impairments occurred in recall and orientation. Five percent of the total cohort met the general threshold for mild cognitive impairment (MMSE < 24). Clinical factors associated with this degree of cognitive impairment were duration of cyanosis (p=0.005) and decreased systemic ventricular function (p=0.003). Conclusions Our pilot study showed that, when adjusted for age and education level, CHD adults had significantly lower MMSE scores than the general population, with 5% meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that subtle and early cognitive changes are present in the adult CHD population. Further studies are needed to investigate those changes that might influence long-term outcomes in the adult CHD population.
