30374260|t|Management of pain, anxiety, agitation and delirium in burn patients: a survey of clinical practice and a review of the current literature.
30374260|a|Management of pain, agitation and anxiety is crucial in critically ill patients, and has a significant impact on clinical and functional outcome. This study aims to assess current management of analgesia, sedation and delirium in adult burn ICUs, and determine if discrepancies exist between current guidelines and actual practices.An online survey was created and sent to burn specialists worldwide.A total of 40 respondents submitted valuable data. Of all respondents, 20 (50%) were from Europe, 7 (17.5%) from North America, 6 (15%) from Africa and 12 (30%) from other regions. The majority of respondents were from burn centres with more than 60 admissions per year (32 centres, 80%); 36 respondents (90%) were affiliated with a University Hospital. 92.5% reported that they routinely screen severe burn patients for pain, while 27.5% declared that no particular pain assessment tool is used. The most common analgesics were opioids, mainly administered intravenously (90%). 70% affirmed they routinely screen burn ICU patients for sedation, but 30% declared that they do not use a specific sedation scoring scale. The most commonly used sedatives were midazolam (72.5%) and propofol (55%). 70% claimed to assess burn ICU patients routinely for delirium, but 57.5% reported they did not use a specific scoring system. 62.5% stated that they prevent delirium by combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Our results indicate that awareness regarding the systematic and correct management of pain, sedation and delirium is increasing among burn specialists. However, a substantial gap between guidelines and clinical practices exist. Efforts should be directed at creating specific burn care guidelines and enhancing the implementation of existing recommendations.
