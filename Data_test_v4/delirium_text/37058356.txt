37058356|t|Quantitation of Residual Host Cell DNA in Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus Using Droplet Digital Polymerase Chain Reaction.
37058356|a|Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is a viral vector commonly used in gene therapy. Residual host cell DNA is an impurity that has been associated with the risk of infection and oncogenicity. Thus, it needs to be monitored for quality control. We aimed to develop a droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method targeting 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes to quantitate residual host cell DNA. The copy number of the 18S rRNA gene was determined using two sets of primer pairs for 116- and 247-bp amplicons sharing the C-terminus. For conversion of the copy number of the 18S rRNA gene into the mass concentration of genomic DNA, the accurate copy number of 18S rRNA genes in HEK293 genomic DNA was determined by comparison with copy numbers of three reference genes (EIF5B, DCK, and HBB). Results showed that 88.6-97.9% of HEK293 genomic DNA spiked into rAAV preparations was recovered. The ddPCR-based assay was applied to rAAV preparations to quantitate residual host cell DNA as an impurity. Our findings indicate that the assay can be used for the quantitation and size distribution of residual host cell DNA in rAAV products.
