29548857|t|C-Reactive Protein Can Be an Early Predictor of Poststroke Apathy in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients.
29548857|a|BACKGROUND: Apathy is a multidimensional syndrome referring to a primary lack of motivation that occurs frequently in survivors of stroke. Higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level was associated with higher apathy scores among Alzheimer disease cases. However, data on the relationship between CRP levels and apathy in patients with stroke are lacking. So, we hypothesized an association between CRP and poststroke apathy (PSA). METHODS: Two hundred ninety-two consecutive patients with stroke were recruited within 7 days after stroke. Apathy symptoms were assessed at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months after stoke using the Apathy Evaluation Scale-Clinical (AES-C). Demographic and clinical information were obtained using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, Barthel Index (BI) scores, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores, and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) scores. CRP was measured at baseline. The presence and the location of infarcts were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Apathy at baseline was significantly associated with body mass index (BMI), NIHSS, BI, MMSE, HAMD, and CRP (P < .05) upon admission. PSA at 6 months was significantly associated with elevated CRP concentrations, high AES-C score, and low BI score (P < .05) upon admission. The AES-C scores peaked 3 months after stroke, but then abated over 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: CRP, BMI, MMSE, depression, and disability are closely related to apathy during the acute stage of ischemic stroke. Lower BI scores, higher CRP concentrations, and apathy in acute stroke phase increased the risk of PSA at 6 months.
