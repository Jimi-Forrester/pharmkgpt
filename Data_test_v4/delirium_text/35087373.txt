35087373|t|Discriminative Analysis of Schizophrenia Patients Using Topological Properties of Structural and Functional Brain Networks: A Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.
35087373|a|Interest in the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for the diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) at the individual level is growing. However, a few studies have applied the features of structural and functional brain networks derived from multimodal MRI data to the discriminative analysis of SZ patients at different clinical stages. In this study, 205 normal controls (NCs), 61 first-episode drug-naive SZ (FESZ) patients, and 79 chronic SZ (CSZ) patients were recruited. We acquired their structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting-state functional MRI data and constructed brain networks for each participant, including the gray matter network (GMN), white matter network (WMN), and functional brain network (FBN). We then calculated 3 nodal properties for each brain network, including degree centrality, nodal efficiency, and betweenness centrality. Two classifications (SZ vs. NC and FESZ vs. CSZ) were performed using five ML algorithms. We found that the SVM classifier with the input features of the combination of nodal properties of both the GMN and FBN achieved the best performance to discriminate SZ patients from NCs [accuracy, 81.2%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 85.2%; p < 0.05]. Moreover, the SVM classifier with the input features of the combination of the nodal properties of both the GMN and WMN achieved the best performance to discriminate FESZ from CSZ patients (accuracy, 86.2%; AUC, 92.3%; p < 0.05). Furthermore, the brain areas in the subcortical/cerebellum network and the frontoparietal network showed significant importance in both classifications. Together, our findings provide new insights to understand the neuropathology of SZ and further highlight the potential advantages of multimodal network properties for identifying SZ patients at different clinical stages.
