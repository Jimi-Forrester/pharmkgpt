33364438|t|Play attention! Therapeutic aspects to play in delirium prevention and management.
33364438|a|It is recognised that delirium is common among older adult inpatients and correlated with negative outcomes. The gold standard care for delirium management is achieved using multicomponent interventions. Which components work best is not yet well defined. During the COVID-19 outbreak, a paediatric ward was repurposed to treat adult patients. Paediatric nurses and play specialists remained on the ward. It was observed that the paediatric ward aesthetic and the team's dedicated approach to cognitive stimulation and sleep promotion improved well-being among older adult patients. We propose that elements of paediatric care, primarily deployment of a play specialist, could be incorporated into a multicomponent intervention for delirium prevention and management.
