36979380|a|It has been known that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated from the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Majima et al. proved that mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) caused apoptosis for the first time in 1998 (Majima et al. J Biol Chem, 1998). It is speculated that mtROS can move out of the mitochondria and initiate cellular signals in the nucleus. This paper aims to prove this phenomenon by assessing the change in the amount of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) by MnSOD transfection. Two cell lines of the same genetic background, of which generation of mtROS are different, i.e., the mtROS are more produced in RGK1, than in that of RGM1, were compared to analyze the cellular signals. The results of immunocytochemistry staining showed increase of Nrf2, Keap1, HO-1 and 2, MnSOD, GCL, GST, NQO1, GATA1, GATA3, GATA4, and GATA5 in RGK1 compared to those in RGM1. Transfection of human MnSOD in RGK1 cells showed a decrease of those signal proteins, suggesting mtROS play a role in cellular signals in nucleus.
