12153530|t|ERK activation and nuclear translocation in amyloid-beta peptide- and iron-stressed neuronal cell cultures.
12153530|a|Oxidative stress in the human brain has been strongly implicated as the cause of neuronal cell losses in Alzheimer's disease patients, but the exact mechanism still remains unknown. In this report several oxidative stress parameters and an associated signalling transduction cascade predating neuronal cell death in cultures treated with the oxidative stressors Fe(2+) (5 microm) and the amyloid beta (A beta(1-40)) peptide (5 microm) were studied. Production of reactive oxygen species as detected by dichlorofluorescein staining was apparent within 5 min in the presence of both agents. Lipid peroxide content increased by approximately 10-fold after 2 h, while mitochondrial activity was impaired by 40% after 6 h. Caspase-3 activity was elevated 5-6 fold, all indicative of oxidative cell stress. The combined presence of A beta(1-40) and Fe(2+) resulted in a rapid (5 min) ERK activation followed by a decline by 30 min and a second activation that continued up to 24 h when nuclear translocation was noticed. Neither treatment with Fe(2+) nor that with A beta(1-40) alone caused similar changes. Addition of either deferroxamine (DFe, 25 microm), catalase (0.4 mg/mL) or N-acetyl cysteine (0.5 mm) - the last two known as suppressants of oxidative stress - attenuated ERK activation and nuclear translocation. The mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 blocked ERK and caspase 3 activation, suppressed ERK translocation and reduced the number of apoptotic cells, suggesting a central role for the ERK signalling cascade in A beta(1-40) plus Fe(2+) (A beta(1-40)/Fe(2+)) -induced apoptotic death. The full peptide A beta(1-42) was very effective at 0.5 microm while the inverse peptide A beta(40-1) at 5 microm was ineffective. The acetyl-amyloid-beta protein amide fragment 15-20 (V-pep) known to be an A beta aggregation inhibitor, prevented A beta(1-40)/Fe(2+)-induced toxicity. These findings indicate that metal ions chelators and antioxidants suppress the A beta(1-40)/Fe(2+)-induced oxidative stress cascade and may be beneficial in reducing the severity of Alzheimer's disease.
