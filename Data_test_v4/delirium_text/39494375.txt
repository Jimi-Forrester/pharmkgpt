39494375|t|Serine phosphorylation mimics of Abeta form distinct, non-cross-seeding fibril morphs.
39494375|a|The self-assembly of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) into fibrils and oligomers is linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Fibrillar aggregates in AD patient's brains contain several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at positions 8 and 26. These play a key role in modifying the aggregation propensity of Abeta, yet how they affect the mechanism of aggregation is only poorly understood. Here we elucidate the aggregation mechanism of Abeta42 peptides with phosphomimic mutations at these positions, with glutamine mimicking the size, and glutamate mimicking both the size and charge effect. We find that all variants are less aggregation-prone than wild-type Abeta42 with the glutamate mutants showing the largest reduction. Secondary nucleation is the dominant nucleation route for all variants, as confirmed using seeding experiments; however, its rate is reduced by about an order of magnitude or more for all variants relative to wild-type. S26Q and S26E fibrils fail to catalyse nucleation of wild-type monomers and vice versa, while the S8 variants co-aggregate more readily with wild-type. Ultrastructural analyses by cryo-electron microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering reveal an altered structure with longer node-to-node distance and smaller cross-section dimensions of S26Q fibrils. These results imply that structural compatibility between fibrils and monomer is a key determinant in secondary nucleation, and that small modifications can alter the preferred fibril structure, and thus its potential to induce aggregation of other variants. Overall, our results indicate that phosphorylation could play a key role in controlling aggregation propensity and may lead to the formation of distinct, non-cross-seeding fibril populations.
