34878031|t|Association of health vulnerability with adverse outcomes in older people with COVID-19: a prospective cohort study.
34878031|a|OBJECTIVES: Health vulnerability is associated with a higher risk of mortality and functional decline in older people in the community. However, few studies have evaluated the role of the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) in predicting clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients. In the present study, we tested the ability of the VES-13 to predict mortality and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in older people hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This prospective cohort included 91 participants aged >=60 years who were confirmed to have COVID-19. VES-13 was applied, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collected within 72h of hospitalization. A Poisson generalized linear regression model with robust variance was used to estimate the relative risk of death and invasive mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Of the total number of patients, 19 (21%) died and 15 (16%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Regarding health vulnerability, 54 (59.4%) participants were classified as non-vulnerable, 30 (33%) as vulnerable, and 7 (7.6%) as extremely vulnerable. Patients classified as extremely vulnerable and male sex were strongly and independently associated with a higher relative risk of in-hospital mortality (p<0.05) and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Elderly patients classified as extremely vulnerable had more unfavorable outcomes after hospitalization for COVID-19. These data highlight the importance of identifying health vulnerabilities in this population.
