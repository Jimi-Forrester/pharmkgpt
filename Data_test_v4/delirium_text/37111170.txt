37111170|t|Vitamin K and the Visual System-A Narrative Review.
37111170|a|Vitamin K occupies a unique and often obscured place among its fellow fat-soluble vitamins. Evidence is mounting, however, that vitamin K (VK) may play an important role in the visual system apart from the hepatic carboxylation of hemostatic-related proteins. However, to our knowledge, no review covering the topic has appeared in the medical literature. Recent studies have confirmed that matrix Gla protein (MGP), a vitamin K-dependent protein (VKDP), is essential for the regulation of intraocular pressure in mice. The PREDIMED (Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea) study, a randomized trial involving 5860 adults at risk for cardiovascular disease, demonstrated a 29% reduction in the risk of cataract surgery in participants with the highest tertile of dietary vitamin K1 (PK) intake compared with those with the lowest tertile. However, the specific requirements of the eye and visual system (EVS) for VK, and what might constitute an optimized VK status, is currently unknown and largely unexplored. It is, therefore, the intention of this narrative review to provide an introduction concerning VK and the visual system, review ocular VK biology, and provide some historical context for recent discoveries. Potential opportunities and gaps in current research efforts will be touched upon in the hope of raising awareness and encouraging continued VK-related investigations in this important and highly specialized sensory system.
