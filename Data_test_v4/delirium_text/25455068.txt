25455068|t|The role of nutrient-based epigenetic changes in buffering against stress, aging, and Alzheimer's disease.
25455068|a|Converging evidence identifies stress-related disorders as putative risk factors for Alzheimer Disease (AD). This article reviews evidence on the complex interplay of stress, aging, and genes-epigenetics interactions. The recent classification of AD into preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, and AD offers a window for intervention to prevent, delay, or modify the course of AD. Evidence in support of the cognitive effects of epigenetics-diet, and nutraceuticals is reviewed. A proactive epigenetics diet and nutraceuticals program holds promise as potential buffer against the negative impact of aging and stress responses on cognition, and can optimize vascular, metabolic, and brain health in the community.
