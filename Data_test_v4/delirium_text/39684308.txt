39684308|t|Magnesium (Mg) and Neurodegeneration: A Comprehensive Overview of Studies on Mg Levels in Biological Specimens in Humans Affected Some Neurodegenerative Disorders with an Update on Therapy and Clinical Trials Supplemented with Selected Animal Studies.
39684308|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by neuron loss, are a group of neurological disorders that adversely affect the lives of millions of people worldwide. Although several medicines have been approved for managing neurodegenerative diseases, new therapies allowing for a significant slowdown in the progression of neurodegenerative syndromes are constantly being sought. Magnesium (Mg), a crucial mineral necessary for the functioning of organisms, is important to normal central nervous system (CNS) activity. Although the effects of this bioelement on the CNS are relatively well recognized, its role in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders in humans is not yet well characterized. Therefore, the main goal of this review is to collect data about a possible association between Mg and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in humans. Hence, the levels of Mg in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine, and hair from subjects with AD, PD, and ALS are compiled to detect possible variations in the levels of this mineral in the biological specimens of people with neurodegenerative illnesses. Additionally, the findings from an animal model are summarized to offer the reader a deeper insight into studies on Mg in the context of neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. Data provided in the present review indicate that Mg, due to its neuroprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and mitochondrial-supportive properties, could be a potential therapeutic agent for AD, PD, and ALS. However, more epidemiological studies with standardized methods of dietary assessment and Mg measurement are necessary to recognize its exact role in neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, extensive well-designed clinical trials are also needed to establish definitive therapeutic protocols and optimal dosages, and to ensure long-term safety of this mineral supplementation in AD, PD, and ALS patients.
