31511808|t|Thyroid Storm-induced Severe Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Ventricular Tachycardia.
31511808|a|Thyroid storm is an extreme form of hyperthyroidism associated with a high mortality rate. Heart failure is considered the leading cause of mortality in patients with thyroid storm, though the underlying cardiac pathology is unclear. Approximately 6% of patients with thyroid storm have heart failure symptoms as the initial presenting complaint. Roughly, one-third of these patients develop dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In this report, we present a case of cardiogenic pulmonary edema and sustained ventricular tachycardia in a patient with hyperthyroidism presenting with thyroid storm.
