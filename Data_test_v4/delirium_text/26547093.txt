26547093|a|OBJECTIVES: Single-incision thoracoscopic and laparoscopic procedures have been applied in treating various diseases. However, it is unknown whether such procedures are feasible in treating oesophageal cancer. METHODS: Minimally invasive oesophagectomy (MIO) with a single-incision approach in the thoracoscopic and laparoscopic procedures was attempted in 16 patients with oesophageal cancer. RESULTS: One patient was converted to laparotomy and a four-port thoracoscopic procedure due to bleeding. Of the patients successfully treated with a single-port MIO, 6 underwent a McKeown procedure and 9 an Ivor Lewis procedure, including 3 cases of total laryngopharyngo-oesophagectomy with cervical pharyngogastrostomy. The mean ventilator usage of the patients after surgery was 0.3 +- 0.6 days, the mean intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 3.8 +- 3.1 days and the mean number of dissected lymph nodes was 28.6 +- 14.6. One delayed anastomotic leakage occurred, and another patient developed a trachea-oesophageal fistula induced by surgical clip-related tissue erosion, both of which were successfully treated by the placement of an oesophageal stent. No pulmonary complications or surgical mortalities occurred in the study. Minor complications developed in 2 patients, 1 experiencing pneumothorax and 1 postoperative delirium. When compared with traditional MIO in our series (n = 315), no statistical difference was found among patients receiving single-port MIO in terms of ventilator usage, ICU stay and the number of dissected lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Single-port MIO seems to be a feasible option for treating patients with oesophageal cancer, which requires further evaluation and follow-up in the future.
