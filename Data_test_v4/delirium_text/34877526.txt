34877526|a|The proximal composition, amino acid, carbohydrate, and volatile profiles of caferana (Bunchosia glandulifera) seeds flour were here assessed. Seeds were also subjected to the following extraction processes: one with pressurized ethanol (PLE) and two with ethanol + supercritical CO2 mixture at different temperatures and pressures (SC1 and SC2). Extracts were characterized in terms of caffeine, total phenolic, and delta-lactam. The characterization of caferana seed and its extracts is unprecedented in terms of carbohydrate and volatiles profiles, besides the delta-lactam identification/isolation. SC2 extract exhibited a higher caffeine (9.3 mg/g) and delta-lactam (29.4 mg/g) content, whereas the PLE extract contained a higher total phenolic amount (3.0 mgGAE/g). Caferana is regionally associated to protective effects on mental health. Its byproduct (seed) revealed to be a promising source of bioactive compounds, and a potential raw material of nutritive extracts and flours that can be incorporated into pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmetic, and food products.
