38639615|t|Evaluation of Early Psychological Interventions in Patients with Intracranial Aneurysm Embolism: A Nursing Business Process Reengineering Perspective.
38639615|a|Objective: This study examines the impact of early psychological intervention for patients undergoing nursing process modification through a business process reengineering (BPR) approach in preventing intracranial aneurysm embolism. Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design was employed in this study. A randomized method was utilized to allocate a total of 201 cases into two distinct groups. 10 patients experiencing delirium and coma due to drug sedation were excluded from the analysis. Consequently, the final distribution included 96 cases in the nursing group and 95 cases in the routine group. Results: In the nursing group, waiting time, nursing staff working hours, and hospital stay were significantly lower compared to the routine group (t = 50.916, 28.893, 4.298, P < .05). No substantial difference in actual running time between the groups was observed (t=0.289, P > .05). Scores for physical pain, psychological well-being, material life status, and social function were notably higher in the nursing group than in the routine group (t=19.109, 20.658, 21.165, 24.014, P < .05). Post-intervention, SAS and SDS scores in the nursing group were significantly lower than those in the routine group (t=21.910, 25.808, P < .05). The complication rate in the nursing group (1.04%) was significantly lower than that in the routine group (8.42%) (chi2=5.791, P < .05). Furthermore, nursing staff job satisfaction (92.71%) was significantly higher than that in the routine group (78.13%) (chi2=7.449, P < .05). Conclusions: The modification of the nursing process demonstrates a positive impact on efficiency and quality of care, ensuring patient safety and meeting patient needs without altering surgical techniques. The findings highlight substantial enhancements and effectiveness of nursing process, providing strong support for the broad implementation of these interventions.
