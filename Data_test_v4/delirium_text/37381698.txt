37381698|a|BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous membrane vesicles secreted by cells in extracellular spaces that play an important role in intercellular communication under both normal and pathological conditions. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory cells capable of secreting EVs, which are considered promising molecules for treating immune, inflammatory, and degenerative diseases. Our previous studies demonstrate that, by activating innate immune receptors TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4), binge-like ethanol exposure in adolescence causes neuroinflammation and neural damage. AIMS: To evaluate whether the intravenous administration of MSC-derived EVs is capable of reducing neuroinflammation, myelin and synaptic alterations, and the cognitive dysfunction induced by binge-like ethanol treatment in adolescent mice. MATERIALS & METHODS: MSC-derived EVs obtained from adipose tissue were administered in the tail vein (50 microg/dose, one weekly dose) to female WT adolescent mice treated intermittently with ethanol (3.0 g/kg) during two weeks. RESULTS: MSC-derived EVs from adipose tissue ameliorate ethanol-induced up-regulation of inflammatory genes (e.g., COX-2, iNOS, MIP-1alpha, NF-kappaB, CX3CL1, and MCP-1) in the prefrontal cortex of adolescent mice. Notably, MSC-derived EVs also restore the myelin and synaptic derangements, and the memory and learning impairments, induced by ethanol treatment. Using cortical astroglial cells in culture, our results further confirm that MSC-derived EVs decrease inflammatory genes in ethanol-treated astroglial cells. This, in turn, confirms in vivo findings. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results provide the first evidence for the therapeutic potential of the MSC-derived EVs in the neuroimmune response and cognitive dysfunction induced by binge alcohol drinking in adolescence.
