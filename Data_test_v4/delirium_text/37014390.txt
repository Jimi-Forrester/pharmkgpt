37014390|a|INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis is a major disease state associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Less than half of the individuals sustaining a low energy hip fracture are diagnosed and treated for the underlying osteoporosis. OBJECTIVE: A multidisciplinary Canadian hip fracture working group has developed practical recommendations to meet Canadian quality indicators in post hip fracture care. METHODS: A comprehensive narrative review was conducted to identify and synthesize key articles on post hip fracture orthogeriatric care for each of the individual sections and develop recommendations. These recommendations are based on the best evidence available today. CONCLUSION: Recommendations are anticipated to reduce recurrent fractures, improve mobility and healthcare outcomes post hip fracture, and reduce healthcare costs. Key messages to enhance postoperative care are also provided.
