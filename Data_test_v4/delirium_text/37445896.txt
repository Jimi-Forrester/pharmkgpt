37445896|t|Sirt6 Activation Ameliorates Inflammatory Bone Loss in Ligature-Induced Periodontitis in Mice.
37445896|a|Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease caused by microorganisms that induce the destruction of periodontal tissue. Inflamed and damaged tissue produces various inflammatory cytokines, which activate osteoclasts and induce alveolar bone loss and, eventually, tooth loss. Sirt6 expression suppresses inflammation and bone resorption; however, its role in periodontitis remains unclear. We hypothesized that Sirt6 has a protective role in periodontitis. To understand the role of Sirt6 in periodontitis, we compared periodontitis with ligature placement around the maxillary left second molar in 8-week-old control (C57BL/6J) male mice to Sirt6-overexpressing Tg (Sirt6Tg) mice, and we observed the resulting phenotypes using micro-CT. MDL801, a Sirt6 activator, was used as a therapy for periodontitis through oral gavage. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased osteoclast numbers were observed in alveolar bone tissue under periodontitis surgery. In the same condition, interestingly, protein levels from Sirt6 were the most downregulated among sirtuins in alveolar bone tissue. Based on micro-CT and CEJ-ABC distance, Sirt6Tg was observed to resist bone loss against ligature-induced periodontitis. Furthermore, the number of osteoclasts was significantly reduced in Sirt6Tg-ligated mice compared with control-ligated mice, although systemic inflammatory cytokines did not change. Consistent with this observation, we confirmed that bone loss was significantly reduced when MDL801, a Sirt6 activator, was included in the ligation mouse model. Our findings demonstrate that Sirt6 activation prevents bone loss against ligature-induced periodontitis. Thus, a Sirt6 activator may provide a new therapeutic approach for periodontitis.
