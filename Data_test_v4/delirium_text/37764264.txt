37764264|t|Engaging Isatins and Amino Acids in Multicomponent One-Pot 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions-Easy Access to Structural Diversity.
37764264|a|Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have undoubtedly emerged as the most indispensable tool for organic chemists worldwide, finding extensive utility in the synthesis of intricate natural products, heterocyclic molecules with significant bioactivity, and pharmaceutical agents. The multicomponent one-pot 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions, which were initially conceptualized by Rolf Huisgen in 1960, find extensive application in contemporary heterocyclic chemistry. In terms of green synthesis, the multicomponent 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is highly favored owing to its numerous advantages, including high step- and atom-economies, remarkable product diversity, as well as excellent efficiency and diastereoselectivity. Among the numerous pieces of research, the most fascinating reaction involves the utilization of azomethine ylides generated from isatins and amino acids that can be captured by various dipolarophiles. This approach offers a highly efficient and convenient method for constructing spiro-pyrrolidine oxindole scaffolds, which are crucial building blocks in biologically active molecules. Consequently, this review delves deeper into the dipolarophiles utilized in the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of isatins and amino acids over the past six years.
