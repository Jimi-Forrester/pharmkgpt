15704487|t|[Cognitive potential P300 in dementia with Levy's bodies and Alzheimer's disease].
15704487|a|Neurodegenerative diseases accompanied by cognitive impairment (dementia with Levy's bodies--DLB and Alzheimer's disease--AD) and others) are becoming more widespread due to increasing population life expectancy. The paper addresses use of cognitive event-related potential P300 to verbal and nonverbal stimuli with an assessment of interhemispheric asymmetry and topographic distribution of P300 in patients with DLB and AD comparied to age-matched healthy controls. Specific alterations of P300 amplitude and latency suggest a use of cognitive event-related potential P300 in differential diagnosis of DLB and AD.
