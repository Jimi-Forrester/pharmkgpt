35360926|t|Longitudinal Progression of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Markers and Cognition in Dutch-Type Hereditary Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy.
35360926|a|BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic and ischemic magnetic resonance imaging lesions as well as the more recently described decrease in vasomotor reactivity have been suggested as possible biomarkers for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Analyses of these markers have been primarily cross-sectional during the symptomatic phase of the disease, with little data on their longitudinal progression, particularly in the presymptomatic phase of the disease when it may be most responsive to treatment. We used the unique opportunity provided by studying Dutch-type hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy (D-CAA) to determine longitudinal progression of CAA biomarkers during the presymptomatic as well as the symptomatic phase of the disease. METHODS: In this longitudinal case-control study, magnetic resonance imaging markers and cognitive performance were assessed at baseline and after  4 years in 10 presymptomatic and 6 symptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers and 20 control subjects. These magnetic resonance imaging markers included hemorrhagic and ischemic manifestations, measurements of cerebral blood flow, and vasomotor reactivity to visual stimulation. RESULTS: In presymptomatic D-CAA mutations carriers, vasomotor reactivity showed a decline over time for blood-oxygen-level-dependent amplitude (P=0.011) and prolongation of time to peak (P<0.001). In contrast, no significant changes in hemorrhagic markers, ischemic markers, cerebral blood flow, and cognition were found. In symptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers, the number of intracerebral hemorrhages increased over the 4-year period (P=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that in the presymptomatic phase of D-CAA, cerebrovascular reactivity measured by the blood-oxygen-level-dependent amplitude and time to peak to visual stimulation progressively worsens and can thus be regarded as a disease progression marker. In the symptomatic phase, the most salient marker of progression appears to be recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage.
