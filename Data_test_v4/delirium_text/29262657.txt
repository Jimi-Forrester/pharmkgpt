29262657|t|hsa-miR-29c-3p regulates biological function of colorectal cancer by targeting SPARC.
29262657|a|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common type of behavioral cancers, miRNAs play a critical role in cancer development and progression. In the present study, we downloaded the original data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and conduct data analysis. has-mir-29c-3p mimic, inhibitor, negative control or si-SPARC (secreted protein acidic, rich in cysteine) were transfected into HCT116 cells, respectively. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure has-mir-29c-3p and SPARC mRNA expressions, western blot was used to detect ACAA1 (acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1), ACOX1 (acyl-CoA oxidase 1), COL1A1(collagen, type I, alpha-1), COL1A2 (collagen, type I, alpha-2), COL4A1 (collagen, type IV, alpha-1), COL5A2 (collagen, type V, alpha-2), COL12A1 (collagen, type XII, alpha-1), CPT2 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2), ETHE1 (persulfide dioxygenase), HMGCS2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2), SPARC, SQRDL (sulfide quinone oxidoreductase), and TST (thiosulfate sulfurtransferase) protein expression. CCK-8 and wound healing assay were employed to verify cell proliferation and migration. The luciferase reporter assay data made sure the target correlation of has-mir-29c-3p and SPARC. Firstly, we found that the expression of has-mir-29c-3p was lower in CRC tissues than in their paired corresponding non-cancerous tissues and there was significant inversed correlation between has-mir-29c-3p and SPARC. Overexpression of has-mir-29c-3p reduced cell proliferation and migration. SPARC was identified as a direct target of has-mir-29c-3p, whose silencing reduced cell proliferation and migration. These data showed that has-mir-29c-3p regulates CRC cell functions through regulating SPARC expression. Taken together, has-mir-29c-3p may function as an oncogenic miRNA targeting SPARC, targeted modulation of has-mir-29c-3p expression may became a potential strategy for the treatment.
