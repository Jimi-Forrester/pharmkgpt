38580905|t|The relationship between serum astroglial and neuronal markers and AQP4 and MOG autoantibodies.
38580905|a|BACKGROUND: Certain demyelinating disorders, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) exhibit serum autoantibodies against aquaporin-4 (alphaAQP4) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (alphaMOG). The variability of the autoantibody presentation warrants further research into subtyping each case. METHODS: To elucidate the relationship between astroglial and neuronal protein concentrations in the peripheral circulation with occurrence of these autoantibodies, 86 serum samples were analyzed using immunoassays. The protein concentration of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NFL) and tau protein was measured in 3 groups of subcategories of suspected NMOSD: alphaAQP4 positive (n = 20), alphaMOG positive (n = 32) and alphaMOG/alphaAQP4 seronegative (n = 34). Kruskal-Wallis analysis, univariate predictor analysis, and multivariate logistic regression with ROC curves were performed. RESULTS: GFAP and NFL concentrations were significantly elevated in the alphaAQP4 positive group (p = 0.003; p = 0.042, respectively), and tau was elevated in the alphaMOG/alphaAQP4 seronegative group (p < 0.001). A logistic regression model to classify serostatus was able to separate alphaAQP4 seropositivity using GFAP + tau, and alphaMOG seropositivity using tau. The areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) were 0.77 and 0.72, respectively. Finally, a combined seropositivity versus negative status logistic regression model was generated, with AUC = 0.80. CONCLUSION: The 3 markers can univariately and multivariately classify with moderate accuracy the samples with seropositivity and seronegativity for alphaAQP4 and alphaMOG.
