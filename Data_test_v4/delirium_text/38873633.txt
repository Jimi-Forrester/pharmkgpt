38873633|t|Interoception in anxiety, depression, and psychosis: a review.
38873633|a|Research has examined the relationship between interoception and anxiety, depression, and psychosis; however, it is unclear which aspects of interoception have been systematically examined, what the combined findings are, and which areas require further research. To answer these questions, we systematically searched and narratively synthesised relevant reviews, meta-analyses, and theory papers (total n = 34). Existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses (anxiety n = 2; depression n = 2; psychosis n = 0), focus on cardiac interoceptive accuracy (heartbeat perception), and indicate that heartbeat perception is not systematically impaired in anxiety or depression. Heartbeat perception might be poorer in people with psychosis, but further evidence is needed. Other aspects of interoception, such as different body systems and processing levels, have been studied but not systematically reviewed. We highlight studies examining these alternative bodily domains and levels, review the efficacy of interoception-based psychological interventions, and make suggestions for future research.
