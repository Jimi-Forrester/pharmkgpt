METHODS: Male patients with OSAHS were enrolled from January to June 2019 in Suzhou Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University, and nineteen healthy male volunteers were selected as the normal control group. The patients with OSAHS were divided into mild, moderate, and severe groups according to their apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Early in the morning after the polysomnography (PSG), blood samples were collected and serum levels of serum amyloid A (SAA) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All subjects were scored by the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) scale. Resting brain function images of healthy male volunteers and patients in the severe group were collected by 3.0 T magnetic resonance scanner. SPSS25.0 software was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The SAA of the OSAHS group (n = 43) were higher than those of control group (n = 19). The scores of AVLT-immediate and AVLT-delay in the severe OSAHS group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05), and it was negatively correlated with SAA. In the severe OSAHS group, the rest state Function Connection (rsFC) in temporal lobe, marginal lobe, and frontal lobe was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05) and was significantly negatively correlated with SAA. The rsFC in bilateral parietal lobes was higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05), was significantly positively correlated with SAA, and was negatively correlated with AVLT-delay. CONCLUSIONS: The significant increase in SAA concentration in patients with OSAHS correlated with brain rsFC intensity, providing a reference role for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of cognitive dysfunction in patients with OSAHS.
