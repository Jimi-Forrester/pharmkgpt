7543987|a|We compared immunohistochemical expression of the transforming growth factor-betas (TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2, and TGF-beta 3) using brain tissue from patients with nondominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (NDAD) (n = 9), autosomal dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease with linkage to 14q24.3 (FAD-14) (n = 4), and cognitively normal controls (n = 10) to determine whether their pathologic changes are associated with an altered distribution of the TGF-betas. We found increased expression of TGF-beta 2 in large, tangle-bearing neurons with widespread staining of glia in NDAD and FAD-14 patients compared with control cases. This result was confirmed with sandwich ELISA assays of brain tissue, which showed TGF-beta 2 levels in AD and NDAD to average 3.2 times the average level of control cases. Despite proximity of TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 3 to the sites of susceptibility loci on chromosomes 19 and 14, we did not find that TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 3 were selectively altered in any AD subtypes. However, selective induction of TGF-beta 2 may occur in NDAD and FAD-14.
