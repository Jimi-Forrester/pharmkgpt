27387531|a|The aggregation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide into fibrillar deposits has long been considered the key neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta peptides are generated from proteolytic processing of the transmembrane Abeta precursor protein (AbetaPP) via sequential proteolysis through the beta-secretase activity of beta-site AbetaPP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and by the intramembranous enzyme gamma-secretase. For over a decade, Drosophila melanogaster has been used as a model organism to study AD, and two different approaches have been developed to investigate the toxicity caused by AD-associated gene products in vivo In one model, the Abeta peptide is directly over-expressed fused to a signal peptide, allowing secretion of the peptide into the extracellular space. In the other model, human AbetaPP is co-expressed with human BACE1, resulting in production of the Abeta peptide through the processing of AbetaPP by BACE1 and by endogenous fly gamma-secretase. Here, we performed a parallel study of flies that expressed the Abeta1-42 peptide alone or that co-expressed AbetaPP and BACE1. Toxic effects (assessed by eye phenotype, longevity and locomotor assays) and levels of the Abeta1-42, Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-38 peptides were examined. Our data reveal that the toxic effect per amount of detected Abeta1-42 peptide was higher in the flies co-expressing AbetaPP and BACE1 than in the Abeta1-42-expressing flies, and that the co-existence of Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 in the flies co-expressing AbetaPP and BACE1 could be of significant importance to the neurotoxic effect detected in these flies. Thus, the toxicity detected in these two fly models seems to have different modes of action and is highly dependent on how and where the peptide is generated rather than on the actual level of the Abeta1-42 peptide in the flies. This is important knowledge that needs to be taken into consideration when using Drosophila models to investigate disease mechanisms or therapeutic strategies in AD research.
