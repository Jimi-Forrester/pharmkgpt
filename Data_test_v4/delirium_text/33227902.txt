33227902|t|Age-Dependent Decline in Synaptic Mitochondrial Function Is Exacerbated in Vulnerable Brain Regions of Female 3xTg-AD Mice.
33227902|a|Synaptic aging has been associated with neuronal circuit dysfunction and cognitive decline. Reduced mitochondrial function may be an early event that compromises synaptic integrity and neurotransmission in vulnerable brain regions during physiological and pathological aging. Thus, we aimed to measure mitochondrial function in synapses from three brain regions at two different ages in the 3xTg-AD mouse model and in wild mice. We found that aging is the main factor associated with the decline in synaptic mitochondrial function, particularly in synapses isolated from the cerebellum. Accumulation of toxic compounds, such as tau and Abeta, that occurred in the 3xTg-AD mouse model seemed to participate in the worsening of this decline in the hippocampus. The changes in synaptic bioenergetics were also associated with increased activation of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1. These results suggest the presence of altered mechanisms of synaptic mitochondrial dynamics and their quality control during aging and in the 3xTg-AD mouse model; they also point to bioenergetic restoration as a useful therapeutic strategy to preserve synaptic function during aging and at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
