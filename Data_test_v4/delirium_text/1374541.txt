1374541|t|Alzheimer's disease: is the decrease of the cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus related to intrinsic hippocampal pathology?
1374541|a|Consistent findings in the hippocampi of patients with Alzheimer's disease are the presence of neurofibrillary tangles in pyramidal neurons and the loss of choline acetyltransferase activity due to degeneration of hippocampal cholinergic terminals. The present study sought to clarify, in the brains of five patients with Alzheimer's disease and four controls, whether the loss of cholinergic terminals in the hippocampal stratum pyramidale in Alzheimer's disease is related to degenerative changes in hippocampal pyramidal cells. A polyclonal antibody to human choline acetyltransferase was employed to visualize immunohistochemically cholinergic terminals. Hippocampal neurons were stained with Cresyl Violet, neurofibrillary tangles with thioflavin S and a monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated neurofilament (RT97). Quantification of the stained structures was performed in CA4, CA1 and the subiculum, on five sections selected from the entire anteroposterior extent of each hippocampus. In the group of Alzheimer patients, the densities of cholinergic terminals were homogeneously diminished in the three hippocampal subregions in comparison with the controls (32-33%). In contrast, a significant loss of pyramidal neurons was found only in CA1, and the density of neurofibrillary tangles was markedly increased only in CA1 and the subiculum in Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that there is no relationship between the loss of cholinergic terminals and the degeneration of pyramidal cells in the hippocampus of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
