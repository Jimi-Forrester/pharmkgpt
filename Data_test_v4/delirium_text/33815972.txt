33815972|a|Immunotherapy is the upcoming trend in cancer treatment. Traditional cancer treatment methods include surgical resection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, small molecule targeted drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Surgical resection is useful for early-stage patients but not for metastatic cancer cells; radiotherapy and chemotherapy are more common but produce substantial damage to normal tissues and have poor selectivity. Targeted drugs, including monoclonal antibodies, have better comprehensive efficacy but can also encourage gene mutation of tumor cells and drug tolerance. HSCT is effective, but choosing a donor is often difficult, and the graft is also prone to rejection. Thus, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, a form of cellular/adoptive immunotherapy, is at the forefront of cancer therapy treatments due to its sustained remission, fewer side effects, and a better quality of life. CAR-T cell therapy involves genetically modifying the T cells and multiplying their numbers to kill cancer cells. This review article gives an insight into how the CAR-T cells have evolved from simple T cells with modest immune function to genetically engineered robust counterparts that brought great hope in the treatment of hematological malignancies. Much research has been undertaken during the past decade to design and deliver CAR-T cells. This has led to successful outcomes in leukemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma, paving the way for expanding CAR therapy. Despite tremendous progress, CAR-T cell therapies are faced with many challenges. Areas for improvement include limited T cell persistence, tumor escape, immunosuppressive components in the tumor microenvironment, cancer relapse rate, manufacturing time, and production cost. In this manuscript, we summarize the innovations in the design and delivery of CAR technologies, their applications in hematological malignancies, limitations to its widespread application, latest developments, and the future scope of research to counter the challenges and improve its effectiveness and persistence.
