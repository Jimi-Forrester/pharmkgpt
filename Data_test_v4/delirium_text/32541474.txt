32541474|a|Symptomatic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral escape (sCVE) is reported in people with HIV, who are on ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) containing antiretroviral therapy (ART). Management of sCVE includes performing genotypic HIV-1 resistance testing (GRT) on CSF and plasma HIV and changing ART accordingly. Neither GRT nor newer drugs (Dolutegravir and Darunavir/ritonavir) are routinely available in India. As a result, management of sCVE includes 2 modalities: a) ART intensification by adding drugs that reach therapeutic concentrations in CSF, like Zidovudine, to existing ART or b) Changing to a regimen containing newer boosted PI/r and integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) as per GRT or expert opinion. In this retrospective study, we report the outcomes of above 2 modalities in treatment of sCVE in Pune, India.Fifty-seven episodes of sCVE in 54 people with HIV taking PI/r-containing ART were identified. Clinical, demographic, laboratory and ART data were recorded. Forty-seven cases had follow-up data available after ART change including measurement of plasma and CSF viral load (VL).Of the 47 cases, 23 received zidovudine intensification (Group A, median VL: plasma- 290, CSF- 5200 copies/mL) and 24 received PI/INSTI intensification (Group B, median VL: plasma- 265, CSF-4750 copies/mL). CSF GRT was performed in 16 participants: 8 had triple class resistance. After ART change, complete resolution of neurologic symptoms occurred in most participants (Group A: 18, Group B: 17). In Group A, follow-up plasma and CSF VL were available for 21 participants, most of whom achieved virologic suppression (VL < 20 copies/mL) in plasma (17) and CSF (15). Four participants were shifted to the PI/INSTI intensification group due to virologic failure (plasma or CSF VL > 200 copies/mL). In Group B, follow-up plasma and CSF VL were available for 23 participants, most of whom also achieved virologic suppression in plasma (21) and CSF (18). Four deaths were noted, 2 of which were in individuals who interrupted ART.This is a unique sCVE cohort that was managed with 1 of 2 approaches based on treatment history and the availability of GRT. At least 75% of participants responded to either approach with virologic suppression and improvement in symptoms.
