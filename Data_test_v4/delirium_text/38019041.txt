38019041|a|INTRODUCTION: The central nervous system is frequently involved during severe sepsis. Patients either develop septic encephalopathy characterized by delirium and coma or focal neurological signs as a consequence of septic-embolic or septic-metastatic encephalitis. AREAS COVERED: In this review, a summary of currently available literature on established and some promising experimental treatment options for septic encephalopathy and encephalitis is provided, with a focus on the clinical utility of published studies. EXPERT OPINION: Treatment relies on proper identification of the causative pathogen and rapidly initiated adequate empirical or (after identification of the pathogen) tailored antibiotic therapy, fluid and electrolyte management. In the presence of brain abscess(es) or mycotic aneurysm(s), surgery or interventional neuroradiology must be considered. Pharmacological approaches to prevent delirium of different etiology include the use of dexmedetomidine and (with limitations) of melatonin and its derivatives. In the absence of a specific pharmacological treatment, non-pharmacological bundles of interventions (e.g. promotion of sleep, cognitive stimulation, early mobilization and adequate therapy of pain) are of proven efficacy to prevent delirium of different etiology including sepsis. Experimental promising therapies include the use of non-bacteriolytic antibiotics and the reduction of the toxic effects of microglial activation.
