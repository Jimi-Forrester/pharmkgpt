35815283|t|Effects of Catalpol on Alzheimer's Disease and Its Mechanisms.
35815283|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. With the increasing aging of the population, the incidence of AD and the number of patients are also increasing year by year, causing more and more heavy burdens to the family and society. Catalpol, an iridoid glycoside compound, is one of the main active components of Rehmannia glutinosa. At present, a large number of experimental studies in vivo and in vitro have confirmed that catalpol has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and other neuroprotective effects, and it plays a significant role in the prevention and treatment of AD, with very small side effects and high safety. Therefore, it may be an ideal drug for the treatment of AD. Based on this, the role and mechanism of catalpol in AD will be comprehensively reviewed in the following.
