38221912|a|Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no conclusive remedy. Yohimbine, found in Rauwolfia vomitoria, may reduce brain inflammation by targeting tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), implicated in AD pathogenesis. Metoserpate, a synthetic compound, may inhibit TNFalpha. The study is aimed at assessing the potential utility of repurposing metoserpate for TNFalpha inhibition to reduce neuronal damage and inflammation in AD. The development of safe and effective treatments for AD is crucial to address the growing burden of the disease, which is projected to double over the next two decades. Methods: Our study repurposed an FDA-approved drug as TNFalpha inhibitor for AD management using structural similarity studies, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. Yohimbine was used as a reference compound. Molecular docking used SeeSAR, and molecular dynamics simulation used GROMACS. Results: Metoserpate was selected from 10 compounds similar to yohimbine based on pharmacokinetic properties and FDA approval status. Molecular docking and simulation studies showed a stable interaction between metoserpate and TNFalpha over 100 ns (100000 ps). This suggests a reliable and robust interaction between the protein and ligand, supporting the potential utility of repurposing metoserpate for TNFalpha inhibition in AD treatment. Conclusion: Our study has identified metoserpate, a previously FDA-approved antihypertensive agent, as a promising candidate for inhibiting TNFalpha in the management of AD.
