34164228|a|OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to assess sleep disturbances in patients subjected to home quarantine due to suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study used a mixed methods design study as a research methodology. METHODS: A semi-structured interview and the scale for Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were used to achieve the aim of the study. The survey was conducted from 16 to 20 April 2020 and 1 to 2 September 2020 in Poland, at the during of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in this country. The data were coded and cross-processed. The (COREQ) checklist was followed. RESULTS: Interviews with patients and a thorough analysis of recordings revealed commonly used phrases in the following categories: "anxiety", "Am I going crazy?", "Sleep problems". 10 out of 11 respondents reported sleep disorders of varying severity according to the Insomnia Severity Index scale. Patients presented a fear related to the return to society and normal functioning after quarantine. Additionally, some study participants voiced concerns related to their mental health; some cases of hallucinations were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Further global population studies should be conducted to analyse this phenomenon. Acute Stress Disorder should be understood as a threat to life and health of an isolated society in quarantine. Further research in this area should be promoted and the need for global guidelines for the entire population should be developed.
