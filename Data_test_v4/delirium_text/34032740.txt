34032740|a|ABSTRACT: Based on association studies on amounts of alcohol consumed and cortical and subcortical structural shrinkage, we investigated the effect of chronic alcohol consumption on white matter pathways using probabilistic tractography.Twenty-three alcohol-dependent men (with an average sobriety of 13.1 months) from a mental health hospital and 22 age-matched male healthy social drinkers underwent 3T magnetic resonance imaging. Eighteen major white matter pathways were reconstructed using the TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy tool (provided by the FreeSurfer). The hippocampal volumes were estimated using an automated procedure. The lifetime drinking history interview, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, Brief Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test, and pack-years of smoking were also evaluated.Analysis of covariance controlling for age, cigarette smoking, total motion index indicated that there was no definite difference of diffusion parameters between the 2 groups after multiple comparison correction. As hippocampal volume decreased, the fractional anisotropy of the right cingulum-angular bundle decreased. Additionally, the axial diffusivity of right cingulum-angular bundle was positively correlated with the alcohol abstinence period.The results imply resilience of white matter in patients with alcohol dependence. Additional longitudinal studies with multimodal methods and neuropsychological tests may improve our findings of the changes in white matter pathways in patients with alcohol dependence.
