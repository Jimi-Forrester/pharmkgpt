7810469|t|Analgesia, sedation and paralysis in the intensive care unit.
7810469|a|Patients admitted to the intensive care unit often experience some degree of pain and frequently are anxious, confused or delirious. Relief of pain, anxiety and agitation is important for effective patient care. Initial attention should be directed toward eliminating organic causes of delirium. Opioids are the cornerstone of analgesia, while benzodiazepines and haloperidol are commonly used for sedation and relief of agitation. When sedative agents fail to control agitation and effective ventilation of the patient is compromised, it may be appropriate to pharmacologically paralyze the patient.
