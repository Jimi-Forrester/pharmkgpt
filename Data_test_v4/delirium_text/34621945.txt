34621945|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare perioperative outcomes of the elderly versus non-elderly patients on ERPs undergoing laparotomy for gynecologic surgery. METHODS: From January 2016 to June 2017, patients undergoing elective laparotomies for gynecologic surgery were enrolled in a perioperative ERP protocol. Outcomes were compared between the elderly (age >= 70 years) and the non-elderly (age <= 69 years). Primary outcomes were length of stay and perioperative complication rates. Comparisons were performed using chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact tests for categorical data and Student's t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables, with p < 0.05 for significance. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-nine patients were enrolled in the study, including 16 patients >= 70 years old. The median age was 75 years for the elderly and 45 years for the non-elderly. Elderly patients were more likely to have more complex surgery and longer operative times (absolute median difference of 39 min). Despite the increasing complexity of surgical procedures for elderly patients, there were no statistically significant differences in serious inpatient complications (Clavien-Dindo score 3A or greater), pain and nausea scores, 30-day complications and readmission rates. Elderly patients had a longer median length of stay compared to non-elderly patients by one day (p < 0.001), however, this was not statistically significant on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: In our series, elderly patients on the ERP had similar rates of complications and readmission when compared to non-elderly patients, despite undergoing more complex surgeries. This suggests that ERP may be feasible and safe in the elderly population undergoing elective gynecologic laparotomy.
