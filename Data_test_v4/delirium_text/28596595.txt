28596595|a|To investigate the relationship between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and hypertension as well as the mechanism involved in mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction. We identified a novel tRNAMet C4467A mutation in a Han Chinese family with hypertension. The maternal members presented with increased glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and serum sodium as well as decreased potassium compared with non-maternal members (P < 0.05). Segregation analysis showed this mutation was maternally inherited. We analyzed lymphocyte cell lines derived from three maternal and three non-maternal family members. Reactive oxygen species production in the mutant cell lines was 114.5% higher compared with that in controls (P < 0.05) while ATP was 26.4% lower. The mitochondrial membrane potential of the mutated cell lines was 26.2% lower than that in controls (P < 0.05). Oxygen consumption rates were decreased in the mutant cell lines (P < 0.05). The activation of caspase-3/7 was 104.1% higher in the mutant cell lines compared with controls (P < 0.05). The expression of voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), Bax and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in the mutant cell lines was higher compared with that in controls, with the increased colocalization of VDAC and Bax. Therefore, this mutation contributes to oxidative stress and mitochondrial biogenesis dysfunction, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension.
