35565786|t|Dietary Advanced Glycation End Products in an Elderly Population with Diabetic Nephropathy: An Exploratory Investigation.
35565786|a|Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are important in pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Dietary AGEs (dAGEs) contribute to the overall AGE pool in the body. Forty elderly T2DM patients with DKD were randomly allocated to a low-AGE (n = 20) or regular diabetic (n = 20) diet group. A three-day meal questionnaire was used to estimate average quantity of dAGEs. AGE accumulation was measured using skin autofluorescence and urine spectroscopy. sRAGE (soluble receptor AGE) was quantified using ELISA. After 8 weeks, the mean consumption of dAGEs was considerably reduced, both in the low-AGE diet (p = 0.004) and the control (p = 0.019) group. The expected urinary emission peak at 490 nm was shifted to 520 nm in some spectra. dAGEs did not correspond with urine AGE output. An AGE-limited diet for two months did not affect AGE content in skin and urine, or sRAGE concentration in the blood. The role of glycemia is likely to be greater than the impact of dAGE consumption. The unique observation of a fluorescence pattern at 520 nm warrants further examination, since it might point to genetic differences in AGE regulation, which could have clinical consequences, as AGE content depends on its formation and elimination.
