35962782|a|Rates of tau accumulation in cognitively unimpaired older adults are subtle, with magnitude and spatial patterns varying in recent reports. Regional accumulation also likely varies in the degree to which accumulation is amyloid-beta-dependent. Thus, there is a need to evaluate the pattern and consistency of tau accumulation across multiple cognitively unimpaired cohorts and how these patterns relate to amyloid burden, in order to design optimal tau end points for clinical trials. Using three large cohorts of cognitively unimpaired older adults, the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's and companion study, Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration (n = 447), the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 420) and the Harvard Aging Brain Study (n = 190), we attempted to identify regions with high rates of tau accumulation and estimate how these rates evolve over a continuous spectrum of baseline amyloid deposition. Optimal combinations of regions, tailored to multiple ranges of baseline amyloid burden as hypothetical clinical trial inclusion criteria, were tested and validated. The inferior temporal cortex, fusiform gyrus and middle temporal cortex had the largest effect sizes of accumulation in both longitudinal cohorts when considered individually. When tau regions of interest were combined to find composite weights to maximize the effect size of tau change over time, both longitudinal studies exhibited a similar pattern-inferior temporal cortex, almost exclusively, was optimal for participants with mildly elevated amyloid beta levels. For participants with highly elevated baseline amyloid beta levels, combined optimal composite weights were 53% inferior temporal cortex, 31% amygdala and 16% fusiform. At mildly elevated levels of baseline amyloid beta, a sample size of 200/group required a treatment effect of 0.40-0.45 (40-45% slowing of tau accumulation) to power an 18-month trial using the optimized composite. Neither a temporal lobe composite nor a global composite reached 80% power with 200/group with an effect size under 0.5. The focus of early tau accumulation on the medial temporal lobe has resulted from the observation that the entorhinal cortex is the initial site to show abnormal levels of tau with age. However, these abnormal levels do not appear to be the result of a high rate of accumulation in the short term, but possibly a more moderate rate occurring early with respect to age. While the entorhinal cortex plays a central role in the early appearance of tau, it may be the inferior temporal cortex that is the critical region for rapid tau accumulation in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
