28947908|t|The Versatile Effects of Dihydromyricetin in Health.
28947908|a|Dihydromyricetin is a flavonoid isolated from Ampelopsis grossedentata, which is traditionally used in China. Dihydromyricetin exhibits health-benefiting activities with minimum adverse effects. Dihydromyricetin has been demonstrated to show antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antimicrobial, cell death-mediating, and lipid and glucose metabolism-regulatory activities. Dihydromyricetin may scavenge ROS to protect against oxidative stress or potentiate ROS generation to counteract cancer cells selectively without any effects on normal cells. However, the low bioavailability of dihydromyricetin limits its potential applications. Recent research has gained positive and promising data. This review will discuss the versatile effects and clinical prospective of dihydromyricetin.
