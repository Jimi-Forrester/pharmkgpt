36852442|t|Upregulation of Wnt2b exerts neuroprotective effect by alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
36852442|a|AIMS: This study investigated the relationship between plasma Wnt2b levels and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and explored the effect of Wnt2b on mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. METHODS: Healthy and AD subjects, AD transgenic mice, and in vitro models were used to investigate the roles of Wnt2b in abnormalities in canonical Wnt signaling and mitochondria in AD. RT-qPCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence analysis were performed to assay canonical Wnt signaling. Mitochondrial structure was analyzed by electron microscopy. Flow cytometry was used to examine the intracellular calcium and neuronal apoptosis. RESULTS: Plasma Wnt2b levels were lower in AD patients and positively correlated with cognitive performance. Similarly, Wnt2b was reduced in the hippocampus of AD mice and in vitro models. Next, Wnt2b overexpression and recombinant Wnt2b were used to endogenously and exogenously upregulate Wnt2b levels. Upregulation of Wnt2b could effectively prevent downregulation of canonical Wnt signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction in in vitro AD models. Subsequently, intracellular calcium overload and neuronal damage were ameliorated. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights that Wnt2b decline is associated with cognitive impairment in AD, and upregulation of Wnt2b can exert neuroprotective effects in AD, particularly in ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction.
