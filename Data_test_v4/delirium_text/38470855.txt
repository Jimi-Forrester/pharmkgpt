38470855|t|COVID-19 and the Impact on Delirium Care of Hospitalized Older Adults: A Qualitative Study.
38470855|a|BACKGROUND: Older adult patients with COVID-19 and delirium experience higher rates of adverse outcomes. Early recognition of at-risk patients and implementation of management strategies improve outcomes, though understanding barriers to acute care nurses implementing these strategies is limited. PURPOSE: This study's purpose was to understand the experiences of acute care nurses providing care to older adults with COVID-19 and delirium. Experiences explored included assessment, nursing management interventions, and barriers to care. METHODS: Purposive sampling to recruit nurses for semistructured focus groups was performed, and thematic analysis was generated by 4 members of the research team. RESULTS: Twenty-one nurses participated in focus groups. Thematic analysis revealed themes of increased patient social isolation, barriers to delirium assessment and prevention, increased staff demands, and stressful work environments. CONCLUSION: Rich findings reveal the profound impact of the pandemic on assessment for delirium and implementation of strategies for prevention and management in older adult patients.
