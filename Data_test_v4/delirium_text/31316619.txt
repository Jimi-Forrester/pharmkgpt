31316619|a|Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common glomerular disease. The major pathological changes associated with it affect cell proliferation, fibrosis, apoptosis, inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. However, the molecular events underlying IgAN remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, an integrated bioinformatics analysis was applied to further explore novel potential gene targets for IgAN. The mRNA expression profile datasets GSE93798 and GSE37460 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. After data preprocessing, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the DEGs were built with the STRING online search tool and visualized by using Cytoscape, and hub genes were identified through the degree of connectivity in the PPI. The hub genes were subjected to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, and co-expression analysis was performed. A total of 298 DEGs between IgAN and control groups were identified, and 148 and 150 of these DEGs were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. The DEGs were enriched in distinct GO terms for Biological Process, including cell growth, epithelial cell proliferation, ERK1 and ERK2 cascades, regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway and ECM organization. The top 10 hub genes were then screened from the PPI network by Cytoscape. As novel hub genes, Fos proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit and early growth response 1 were determined to be closely associated with apoptosis and cell proliferation in IgAN. Tumor protein 53, integrin subunit beta2 and fibronectin 1 may also be involved in the occurrence and development of IgAN. Co-expression analysis suggested that these hub genes were closely linked with each other. In conclusion, the present integrated bioinformatics analysis provided novel insight into the molecular events and novel candidate gene targets of IgAN.
