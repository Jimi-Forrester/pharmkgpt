22754299|t|Abeta-40 Y10F increases betafibrils formation but attenuates the neurotoxicity of amyloid-beta peptide.
22754299|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the abnormal aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in extracellular deposits known as senile plaques. The tyrosine residue (Tyr-10) is believed to be important in Abeta-induced neurotoxicity due to the formation of tyrosyl radicals. To reduce the likelihood of cross-linking, here we designed an Abeta-40 analogue (Abeta-40 Y10F) in which the tyrosine residue was substituted by a structurally similar residue, phenylalanine. The aggregation rate was determined by the Thioflavin T (ThT) assay, in which Abeta-40 Y10F populated an ensemble of folded conformations much quicker and stronger than the wild type Abeta. Biophysical tests subsequently confirmed the results of the ThT assay, suggesting the measured increase of beta-aggregation may arise predominantly from enhancement of hydrophobicity upon substitution and thus the propensity of intrinsic beta-sheet formation. Nevertheless, Abeta-40 Y10F exhibited remarkably decreased neurotoxicity compared to Abeta-40 which could be partly due to the reduced generation of hydrogen peroxide. These findings may lead to further understanding of the structural perturbation of Abeta to its fibrillation.
