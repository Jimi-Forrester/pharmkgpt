37854176|t|Alzheimer Disease: A Life-Limiting Disease With a Burden of a Terminal Illness.
37854176|a|Purpose of Review: An estimated 6.5 million Americans live with Alzheimer dementia. Better understanding of advanced stages of Alzheimer disease (AD) and timely monitoring of its preventable complications would translate to improved survival and quality of life in this population. Recent Findings: In this perspective review, we proposed shifting the narrative to recognizing AD as a chronic life-limiting illness instead of a terminal disease. In support of this view, we discussed the following: (1) the biochemical, cellular (preclinical), and clinical phases of AD; (2) survival after AD; (3) AD therapeutics and potential implications for the population with AD in the advanced stages. Summary: On the bases of the prolonged preclinical phase in AD, promising advances in AD therapeutics and the varying survival after AD, we proposed a new classification for AD and more broadly neurodegenerative disorders to be recognized as chronic life-limiting illnesses rather than terminal diseases with important implications for patients with AD in the advanced stages given the challenges that are specific to this population.
