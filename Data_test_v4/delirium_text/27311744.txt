27311744|a|An early event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is the formation of extracellular aggregates of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), thought to be initiated by a prion-like seeding mechanism. However, the molecular nature and location of the Abeta seeds remain rather elusive. Active Abeta seeds are found in crude homogenates of amyloid-laden brains and in the soluble fraction thereof. To analyze the seeding activity of the pellet fraction, we have either separated or directly immunoisolated membranes from such homogenates. Here, we found considerable Abeta seeding activity associated with membranes in the absence of detectable amyloid fibrils. We also found that Abeta seeds on mitochondrial or associated membranes efficiently induced Abeta aggregation in vitro and seed beta-amyloidosis in vivo. Abeta seeds at intracellular membranes may contribute to the spreading of Abeta aggregation along neuronal pathways and to the induction of intracellular pathologies downstream of Abeta.
