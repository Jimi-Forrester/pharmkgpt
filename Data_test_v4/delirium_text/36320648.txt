36320648|a|Background and Aims: Patient satisfaction is an important quality indicator of health care service. The concept of home-based palliative care has been recently introduced in Bangladesh, but the patients' satisfaction with this care remained unexplored. This study aimed to assess the satisfaction of the cancer patients receiving this care. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 51 surviving cancer patients above 18 years of age registered under the home-based care service of the Department of Palliative Medicine, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire based on the FAMCARE P16 questionnaire from February to March 2019. Descriptive analysis was done for the sociodemographic and satisfaction-related indicators. A correlation matrix was done to see the correlation among the satisfaction indicators. Result: The majority of the patients (88.2%) were satisfied with the service provided by the home care team. Most (76.5%) of the patients were women, and the mean age was 56.25 +- 14.8 years. The median duration of getting home-based care was 4 months. Main satisfaction indicators were-assessment of physical symptoms (70.6%), providing information about pain management (70.6%), the inclusion of the family in decision making (76.5%), coordination of care between the members of the home care team (84.3%) and availability of doctors, nurses and palliative care assistants (74.5%). A high correlation was observed between satisfaction regarding the care of physical symptoms and provision of information (R = 0.814, p < 0.001). Also, satisfaction regarding the provision of information and support provided to the family is highly correlated (R = 0.722, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Despite the limitations, the overall satisfaction level of the patients regarding home-based palliative care services in Bangladesh is very high. Home-based palliative can be a solution to provide palliative care to patients who are unable to access institution-based care and improve their quality of life.
