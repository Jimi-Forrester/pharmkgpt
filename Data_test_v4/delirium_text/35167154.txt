35167154|a|The perioperative period is a significant and stressful experience that may cause negative consequences in children, both in a short-term and long-term perspective. Despite a wide base of evidence stating the importance of adequate preparation to reduce anxiety, improve coping, cooperation and enhance recovery, many children continue to report that they feel unprepared for their perioperative experience. To secure children's right to request and need for preparation, the content, format, and availability of existing programs need to be scrutinized. Preparation programs in perioperative care must change from simply providing information to embracing the importance of children's need to process the information provided in order to learn and understand. Interactive web-based technology can function as a significant resource for preparation of children for perioperative procedures. By changing perspective from children's need for information to their need for learning and by developing preparation programs including adequate educational principles, web-based technology can be used to its fullest advantage as a healthcare learning and preparation resource.
