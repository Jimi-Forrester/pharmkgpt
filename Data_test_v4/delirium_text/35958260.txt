35958260|a|Background: Physical frailty and cognitive aging have important influences on poor clinical outcomes in older adults. Many studies have investigated the association between frailty and cognitive function, but whether vitamin D mediates the association between frailty and cognitive function is unclear. We explored the mediating role of vitamin D on the cross-sectional association between physical frailty and cognitive function using data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). Methods: We analyzed data from 1944 subjects aged 60 years and older from the 2011 CLHLS cohort. Frailty status was identified by the Osteoporotic Fracture Study (SOF) index. The Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to assess cognitive function. Linear regression models were used to examine the association between frailty, vitamin D, and cognition, adjusted for a range of covariates. Mediation analyses tested the indirect effects of vitamin D on physical frailty and cognitive function. Result: Physical frailty was negatively associated with vitamin D levels and scores on the MMSE, and vitamin D levels were positively associated with scores on the MMSE. Linear regression analysis showed that physical frailty and serum vitamin D concentration were significant predictors of cognitive function. Importantly, mediation analysis showed that serum vitamin D concentration significantly mediated the relationship between physical frailty and cognitive function. Conclusion: The association between physical frailty and cognitive function appears to be mediated by vitamin D. Future studies should explore whether serum vitamin D concentrations may mediate the association between physical frailty and cognitive decline and whether this mediating role is moderated by other factors.
