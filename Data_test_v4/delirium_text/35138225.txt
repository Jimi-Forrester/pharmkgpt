Caring for a person with dementia is complicated, in part because ADRD changes a person's ability to communicate and create memories. Practitioners have increasingly identified communication-centered interventions as one way to address care partner needs while also improving well-being for the person with dementia. In this study, we evaluated one program, the SPECAL  method.Method: Using mixed-methods research, we assessed the effectiveness of a seven-week SPECAL course at facilitating positive outcomes for informal care partners. Participants completed pre- and post-program surveys (n = 17) as well as post-program interviews (n = 20).Results: Results showed several positive changes from pre- to post-program. Participants also reported several key themes in their experiences and implementation of SPECAL, including many beneficial and some challenging outcomes.Conclusion: Results from this study underscore the importance of communication as an intervention target for dementia care partners, identifying opportunities and challenges in working to help care partners communicate with people with ADRD in ways that sustain their relationship and foster mutual well-being.
