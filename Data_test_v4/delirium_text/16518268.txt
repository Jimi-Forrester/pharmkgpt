16518268|a|In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), evaluation scales and measurement instruments are less codified than in Alzheimer's disease. Some nonspecific scales are available, two of which are very useful for early diagnose of the disease: Lebert and Pasquier's Frontotemporal Behavioral Scale (FBS) to assess behavioral disturbances and Dubois's Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) to assess executive ability. However, these scales do not contain enough items to follow up FTD. The main scale used to follow up the disease is the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The Frontal Behavioural Inventory (Kertesz) seems to be interesting, but has not yet been validated in France. The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, not specific for FTD, is used to assess the cognitive rate. The activities of daily living scales and caregiver burden are not well known in FTD.
