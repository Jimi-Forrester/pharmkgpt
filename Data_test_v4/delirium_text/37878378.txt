37878378|t|Effect of Individual Virtual Reality Cognitive Training Programs on Cognitive Function and Depression in Middle-Aged Women: Randomized Controlled Trial.
37878378|a|BACKGROUND: Given the increasing incidence of early-onset Alzheimer disease, strategies for early diagnosis and swift treatment interventions are crucial for mitigating cognitive problems in women and middle-aged individuals who face a high risk of cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of individual cognitive training programs based on virtual reality (VR), a nonpharmacological intervention, on cognitive function and depression in middle-aged women at risk of cognitive impairment. It used VR technology, which has recently been recognized as a promising tool. METHODS: We administered a VR-based cognitive training program for 30 minutes daily, twice a week, for 12 weeks (24 sessions). This study included middle-aged women residing in older adults' welfare facilities in G-gu, Busan, from May to August 2021. A total of 60 participants were randomly divided into the training (n=30) and control (n=30) groups. Cognitive and depressive functions were assessed using the Korean versions of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (K-MoCA), Digit Span Test (DST), Korean-Color Word Stroop Test (K-CWST), and Short Form of the Geriatric Depression Scale (SGDS-K) before the intervention. The training group underwent a VR-based cognitive training program, whereas the control group was educated to maintain regular daily activities. The same assessments were performed 12 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: A comparison of the mean scores before and after K-MoCA in the training group revealed a significant increase from 24.87 (SD 2.62) to 27.50 (SD 1.70; P<.01), indicating substantial cognitive improvement. Similarly, the mean DST forward scores increased significantly from 6.97 (SD 1.10) to 7.90 (SD 1.18; P<.01), suggesting enhanced short-term auditory memory and attention. The mean DST backward scores also showed a significant improvement from 4.10 (SD 0.71) to 4.77 (SD 1.2; P=.01). Notably, the mean SGDS-K scores decreased significantly from 3.97 (SD 2.51) to 2.13 (SD 1.87; P<.01), indicating a reduction in depression within the training group. CONCLUSIONS: The VR-based cognitive training programs significantly enhanced cognitive function and reduced depression in middle-aged women. Consequently, these programs are considered beneficial nonpharmacological cognitive training interventions for middle-aged women at high risk of cognitive impairment.
