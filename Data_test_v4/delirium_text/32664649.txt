32664649|t|Direct Oral Anticoagulants and Timing of Hip Fracture Surgery.
32664649|a|Abstract: Timely surgical intervention in hip fracture has been linked to improved outcomes. Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) are an emerging class of anticoagulants without evidence-based guidelines on surgical timing. This study aims to investigate how DOACs affect surgical timing and hence perioperative outcomes. A retrospective database/registry review was conducted for geriatric hip fracture patients aged 65 and over between 2011 and 2018. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included serious adverse events (SAE), transfusion and postoperative day (POD) 1 haemoglobin (Hb) levels. From a cohort of 3264 patients, 112 admitted subjects were taking DOACs; the annual proportion on DOACs increased over time. Mean time to surgery from last dose (Ts) was 2.2 (+-1.0 SD) days. The primary outcome, 30-day mortality, occurred in 16 (14%) patients with secondary outcomes of SAEs in 25 (22%) patients and transfusion in 30 (27%) patients. Ts (days) did not significantly affect 30-day mortality (odds ratio (OR): 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80-2.33; p = 0.248), SAE (hazard ratio (HR): 1.03, 95% CI: 0.70-1.52; p = 0.885), transfusion (OR: 0.72 95% CI: 0.45 to 1.16; p = 0.177) or POD 1 Hb (OR: 1.99, 95% CI: -0.59 to 4.57; p = 0.129). Timing of surgery does not influence common surgical outcomes such as 30-day mortality, SAE, transfusion, and POD1 Hb in patients taking DOACs on admission.
