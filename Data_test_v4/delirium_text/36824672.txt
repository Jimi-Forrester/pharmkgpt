36824672|a|The lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder is estimated to be about 2%. Epigenetics defines regulatory mechanisms that determine relatively stable patterns of gene expression by controlling all key steps, from DNA to messenger RNA to protein. This Mini Review highlights recent discoveries of modified epigenetic control resulting from genetic variants associated with bipolar disorder in genome-wide association studies. The revealed epigenetic abnormalities implicate gene transcription and post-transcriptional regulation. In the light of these discoveries, the Mini Review focuses on the genes PACS1, MCHR1, DCLK3, HAPLN4, LMAN2L, TMEM258, GNL3, LRRC57, CACNA1C, CACNA1D, and NOVA2 and their potential biological role in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder. Molecular mechanisms under control of these genes do not translate into a unified picture and substantially more research is needed to fill the gaps in knowledge and to solve current limitations in prognosis and treatment of bipolar disorder. In conclusion, the genetic and functional studies confirm the complex nature of bipolar disorder and indicate future research directions to explore possible targeted treatment options, eventually working toward a personalized approach.
