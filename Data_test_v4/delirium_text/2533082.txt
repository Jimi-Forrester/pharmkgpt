2533082|t|Behavioral neuroanatomy of cholinergic innervation in the primate cerebral cortex.
2533082|a|This brief review summarizes the anatomy and behavioral affiliations of cortical cholinergic innervation. A depletion of this innervation has been reported in a number of human neurodegenerative conditions (including Alzheimer's disease) and may contribute to the genesis of the associated behavioral disturbances.
