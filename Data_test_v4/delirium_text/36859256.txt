36859256|a|BACKGROUND: Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an inflammatory disease of the peripheral nervous system characterized by rapidly evolving polyneuropathy caused by autoimmune demyelination and/or axonal degeneration. Since SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, several GBS cases following exposure to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in literature, raising the concern of the latter being a potential trigger event for GBS. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 90-year-old Caucasian woman who was admitted to our hospital because of fatigue, worsening gait and leg strength, dysphonia, dysarthria and dysphagia, started 3 weeks after being exposed to COVID-19. Based on clinical presentation GBS was suspected, so she performed a lumbar puncture and electromyography, which confirmed the diagnosis of acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) variant. We administered high dose of intravenous immunoglobulin with slight neurological improvement. However, after 2 weeks of hospitalization with maximization of care, her physical condition worsen, manifesting severe frailty. The patient was discharged with home support services for managing parenteral nutrition and intense scheduled physiotherapy. A few days later, the patient experienced a further decline in her clinical condition and died at home. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, we report the oldest woman with GBS AMSAN variant after COVID-19 described in the existing literature. Our case supports further research aimed at improving recognition, characterization and prompt management of neurological diseases related to COVID-19 in older patients.
