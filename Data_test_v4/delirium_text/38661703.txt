38661703|a|ABSTRACT: Patients who have Parkinson disease require individualized medication regimens to optimize care. A review of the medication management of patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital with a secondary diagnosis of Parkinson disease found significant departures from the patients' home regimen. Medication regimens are often altered by health care teams unfamiliar with Parkinson disease-specific care in order to conform to standard hospital medication orders and administration times, potentially resulting in increased patient falls, delirium, and mortality.A nurse-led multidisciplinary team consisting of pharmacy, nursing, informatics, neurology, and quality personnel implemented a quality improvement (QI) project between July 2020 and July 2022 to identify patients with Parkinson disease, including those with a secondary diagnosis and those undergoing deep brain stimulation, and customize medication management in order to reduce length of stay, mortality, falls, falls with harm, and 30-day readmissions. The QI project team also evaluated patient satisfaction with medication management.Among patients with a secondary diagnosis of Parkinson disease, the proportion who had medication histories conducted by a pharmacy staff member increased from a baseline of 53% to more than 75% per month. For all patients with Parkinson disease, those whose medication history was taken by a pharmacy staff member had orders matching their home regimen 89% of the time, whereas those who did not had orders matching the home regimen only 40% of the time. Among patients with a secondary diagnosis of Parkinson disease, the length-of-stay index decreased from a baseline of 1 to 0.94 and observed-to-expected mortality decreased from 1.03 to 0.78. The proportion of patients experiencing a fall decreased from an average of 5% to 4.08% per quarter, while the proportion of patients experiencing a fall with harm decreased from an average of 1% to 0.75% per quarter. The rate of 30-day readmissions decreased from 10.81% to 4.53% per quarter. Patient satisfaction scores were 1.95 points higher for patients who had medication histories taken by pharmacy than for those who did not (5 versus 3.05).
