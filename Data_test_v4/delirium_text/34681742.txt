34681742|t|Discovery of a Potent and Selective JNK3 Inhibitor with Neuroprotective Effect Against Amyloid beta-Induced Neurotoxicity in Primary Rat Neurons.
34681742|a|As members of the MAPK family, c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNKs) regulate the biological processes of apoptosis. In particular, the isoform JNK3 is expressed explicitly in the brain at high levels and is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we prepared a series of five 6-dihydroxy-1H-benzo[d]imidazoles as JNK3 inhibitors and found them have potential as neuroprotective agents. Following a previous lead scaffold, benzimidazole moiety was modified with various aryl groups and hydroxylation, and the resulting compounds exhibited JNK3 inhibitory activity with improved potency and selectivity. Out of 37 analogues synthesized, (S)-cyclopropyl(3-((4-(2-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin -6-yl)-5,6-dihydroxy-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)pyrimidin-2-yl)amino) piperidin-1-yl)methanone (35b) demonstrated the highest JNK3 inhibition (IC50 = 9.7 nM), as well as neuroprotective effects against Abeta-induced neuronal cell death. As a protein kinase inhibitor, it also showed excellent selectivity over other protein kinases including isoforms JNK1 (>1000 fold) and JNK2 (-10 fold).
