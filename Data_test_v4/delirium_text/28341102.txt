28341102|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate functional results and complication rate of patients who underwent medial-dorsolateral plating for intra-articular distal humeral fracture (Muller AO type 13C). METHODS: Twenty-four patients (14 men, 10 women; mean age: 47 years) with AO type 13C distal humerus fracture were included in the study. Mean follow-up time was 28 months. Nine patients were in 13C1 subgroup, according to AO classification system, 11 patients were categorized as 13C2, and 4 patients were 13C3. Final follow-up assessment of outcomes included Broberg and Morrey radiological criteria; Mayo Elbow Performance Score, disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Outcome Measure, score based on Jupiter criteria; and range of motion (ROM) values. RESULTS: The mean carrying angle of operated elbows was 11.37  (range: 0-20 ). According to Broberg and Morrey radiological criteria, 14 patients, had radiologically normal elbow, 4 patients had mild change, 3 patients had moderate change, and 3 patients had severe radiological change. Mean DASH score was 21.91 (range: 0-50), and mean Mayo rating was 83.37 (range: 55-100). Jupiter criteria evaluation revealed excellent results in 10 cases, good in 12, and fair results in 2. One patient with fair result had open fracture, and the other had previous hemiparesis in the same extremity. There was no instance of nonunion observed at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Osteosynthesis with medial-dorsolateral plating is a safe and effective method for the treatment of intra-articular fractures of distal humerus. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, Therapeutic study.
