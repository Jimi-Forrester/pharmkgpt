32326254|a|Flavonoids, quercitrin, isoquercitrin (IQ), and afzelin, were isolated from ethyl acetate fraction of Acer okamotoanum. We investigated anti-obesity effects and mechanisms of three flavonoids from A. okamotoanum in the differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. The differentiated 3T3-L1 cells increased triglyceride (TG) contents, compared with non-differentiated normal group. However, treatments of three flavonoids from A. okamotoanum decreased TG contents without cytotoxicity. In addition, they showed significant down-regulation of several adipogenic transcription factors, such as gamma-cytidine-cytidine-adenosine-adenosine-thymidine/enhancer binding protein -alpha, -beta, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, compared with non-treated control group. Furthermore, treatment of the flavonoids inhibited expressions of lipogenesis-related proteins including fatty acid synthase, adipocyte protein 2, and glucose transporter 4. Moreover, IQ-treated group showed significant up-regulation of lipolysis-related proteins such as adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase. In addition, flavonoids significantly activated 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) compared to control group. In particular, IQ showed higher inhibition of TG accumulation by regulation of pathways related with both adipogenesis and lipolysis, than other flavonoids. The present results indicated that three flavonoids of A. okamotoanum showed anti-obesity activity by regulation of adipocyte differentiation, lipolysis, and AMPK signaling, suggesting as an anti-obesity functional agents.
