32368748|t|Comparison of Continuous Adductor Canal and Femoral Nerve Blocks for Analgesia and Return of Quadriceps Function After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Adolescent Patients.
32368748|a|PURPOSE: To compare early pain relief and late quadriceps function after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with hamstring autograft in adolescent patients treated with either a continuous femoral nerve block (cFNB) or continuous adductor canal block (cACB). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of adolescent patients who underwent ACLR and received either a cACB or cFNB for postoperative pain management. Over a 1-year period, all patients underwent ACLR with cFNBs. Over the subsequent 9 months, all patients underwent their ACLR with cACBs. Patient demographics, postoperative pain scores, opioid consumption, satisfaction and complications, and dates and results of quadriceps function derived at the Return to Sports evaluation were compared. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients (53 cFNB, 38 cACB) were reviewed. There were no differences in the demographics of the 2 groups. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in variations in postoperative pain scores (P = .21), or satisfaction with the blocks (P = .93). Patients in the cFNB group consumed a greater number of opioid doses on postoperative day 3 (2.2 +- 2.1 doses cFNB, 1.1 +- 1.6 doses cACB, P = .03) and a greater number of opioid doses overall for postoperative days 1 to 3 (mean 6.8 +- 5.3 doses cFNB, 3.8 +- 2.1 doses cACB, P = .03). There was no difference in time to return of acceptable quadriceps strength and function when comparing the 2 groups (30.9 +- 7.7 weeks cFNB, 28.9 +- 6.6 weeks cACB, P = .087). CONCLUSIONS: We found few differences in postoperative analgesic requirements when comparing patients who underwent ACLR with hamstring autograft with a cACB to those who underwent a similar procedure with a cFNB. Return of quadriceps strength and function by six months did not appear to vary with regional technique, either cACB or cFNB, employed at surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, Retrospective comparative study.
