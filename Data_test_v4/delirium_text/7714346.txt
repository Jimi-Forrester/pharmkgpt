7714346|t|A critique of instruments and methods to detect, diagnose, and rate delirium.
7714346|a|This document reviews existing instruments for evaluation of delirium. Instruments have been grouped into four categories: tests that screen for cognitive impairment, delirium diagnostic instruments, delirium-specific numerical rating scales, and laboratory and paraclinical exams. Analysis of instruments was based on comparison of their psychometric properties as well as subjective judgment. Guidelines are suggested for choosing the appropriate instrument according to the type of clinical evaluation or delirium research envisaged. Important factors in choosing an instrument, besides the appropriateness of its psychometric characteristics, include administration time constraints, level of rater expertise, and patient capabilities. By familiarizing investigators with the variety of evaluation instruments available, this work should permit more appropriate instrument selection in future studies on delirium.
