26878478|a|The deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and neuroinflammation are critical pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Astrocytes are considered the principal immunoregulatory cells in the brain. Neurosteroid progesterone (PG) exerts neuromodulatory properties, particularly its potential therapeutic function in ameliorating AD. However, the role of PG and the neuroprotective mechanism involving in the regulation of neuroinflammation in astrocytes warrant further investigation. In this study, we found that Abeta significantly increased the processing of neuroinflammatory responses in astrocytes. The processing is induced by an increase activity of PERK/elF2alpha-dependent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Additionally, the inhibition of ER stress activation by Salubrinal significantly suppressed the Abeta-induced neuroinflammatory responses in astrocytes. While the treatment of astrocytes with Abeta caused an increase of neuroinflammatory responses, PG significantly inhibited Abeta-induced neuroinflammatory cytokine production by suppressing ER stress activation together with attenuating PERK/elF2alpha signalling. Taken together, these results indicate that PG exerts a neuroprotective effect against Abeta-induced neuroinflammatory responses, and significantly suppresses ER stress activation, which is an important mediator of the neurotoxic events occurring in Abeta-induced neuroinflammatory responses in astrocytes. These neuroprotective mechanisms may facilitate the development of therapies to ameliorate AD.
