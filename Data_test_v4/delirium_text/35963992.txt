35963992|a|BACKGROUND: Mobility deficits are highly prevalent among geriatric patients and have serious impact on quality of life, hospitalizations, and mortality. This study aims to capture predictors of mobility deficits in hospitalized geriatric patients using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model as a framework. METHODS: Data were obtained from n = 397 patients (78 +- 7 years, 15 +- 7 ICD-11 diagnoses) on a geriatric ward at time of admission. Mobility was assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) total score and gait, static balance and transfer subscores. Parameters from an extensive assessment including medical history, neuropsychological and motor examination, and questionnaires were assigned to the five components of the ICF model. Spearman's Correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were calculated to identify predictors for the SPPB total score and subscores. RESULTS: Use of walking aid, fear of falling (FOF, but not occurrence of previous falls), participation in society, ADL and grip strength were strongly associated with the SPPB total score and all subscores (p < .001). FOF and grip strength were significant predictors for the SPPB total score as well as for gait and transfer subscores. FOF also showed a strong association with the static balance subscore. The clinical parameters of the ICF model could only partially explain the variance in the SPPB total score (24%) and subscores (12-23%), with no parameter from the activities and participation component being significantly predictive. CONCLUSIONS: FOF and reduced grip strength are associated with mobility deficits in a hospitalized geriatric cohort. Further research should focus on interventions to reduce FOF and increase muscle strength in geriatric patients. Moreover, there is a need for ICF-based assessments instruments (especially in the activities and participation components) that allow a holistic view on mobility and further daily life-relevant health aspects in geriatric patients.
