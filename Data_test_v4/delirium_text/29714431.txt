29714431|a|Background/aim: This  study  aims  to  investigate  the  relationship  between  emotion  regulation  characteristics  and  the  efficacy  of  midazolam premedication.Materials and methods: Sixty-threechildren, aged3 to 8 years old,with tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy and taking premedication with midazolam (Group 2) or without premedication (Group 1), were included in this study. The behavioral and emotional status of the children was evaluated with the Conners Parent Rating Scale-48 (CPRS-48) and Emotion Regulation Checklist (ERC). Age, sex, body weight, response to intravenous (IV) cannulation and mask, hemodynamic data, preoperative sedation scores [Wilton Sedation Scale (WSS)], postoperative pain intensity [Objective Pain Scale (OPS)], and emergence agitation (EA) level [Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED)] were recorded.Results:A total of 90.6% patients were quiet and sleepy in Group 2, and 25.8% in Group 1. The mean scores of OPS and PAED were higher in Group 1, and the percentage of patients with PAED score of >10 was 51.6% in Group 1 and 18.8% in Group 2 (P < 0.05). In Group 1, a significant correlation was found between PAED scores and WSS and the subfactors of the CPRS-48 (P < 0.05). A correlation was found between WSS and subfactors of ERS in Group 1 (P < 0.05). Conclusion:The incidence of anxiety and postoperative EA is increased in children with emotion regulation disorder, and midazolam premedication reduced the frequency of EA.
