38427477|t|Music Therapy as a Complementary Treatment in Patients with Dementia Associated to Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.
38427477|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex condition that affects various aspects of a patient's life. Music therapy may be considered a beneficial supplementary tool to traditional therapies, that not fully address the range of AD manifestations. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review is to investigate whether music therapy can have a positive impact on AD patients and on which symptoms. Methods: The main research databases employed have been PubMed and Cochrane, using the keywords "dementia", "music therapy", "Alzheimer", "fMRI", "music", and "EEG". Results: After removing duplicates and irrelevant studies, 23 were screened using set criteria, resulting in the final inclusion of 15 studies. The total number of participants included in these studies has been of 1,196 patients. For the fMRI analysis the search resulted in 28 studies on PubMed, two of which were included in the research; the total number of participants was of 124 individuals. The studies conducted with EEG were found using PubMed. The initial search resulted in 15 studies, but after a more accurate evaluation only 2 have been included in the analysis. Conclusions: Even though the data currently available is not sufficient to draw conclusions supported by robust statistical power, the impact of music therapy on AD neuropsychiatric symptoms deserves great interest. Further research should be ushered, possibly multicentric studies, led with neuroimaging and other recent techniques, which can eventually open views on the music role in improving the cognitive status in AD.
