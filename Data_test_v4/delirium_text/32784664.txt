32784664|t|Macronutrients and Human Health for the 21st Century.
32784664|a|Fat, protein and carbohydrate are essential macronutrients. Various organisations have made recommendations as to the energy contribution that each of these components makes to our overall diet. The extent of food refining and the ability of food systems to support future populations may also impact on how macronutrients contribute to our diet. In this Special Issue, we are calling for manuscripts from all disciplines to provide a broad-ranging discussion on macronutrients and health from personal, public and planetary perspectives.
