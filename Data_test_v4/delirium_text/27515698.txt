27515698|t|Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Correlate With Electroencephalography Parameters Assessed by Exact Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (eLORETA).
27515698|a|Recently, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) have garnered a lot of clinical attention. To explore neurophysiological traits of AD and parameters for its clinical diagnosis, we examined the association between CSF biomarkers and electroencephalography (EEG) parameters in 14 probable AD patients. Using exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA), artifact-free 40-sesond EEG data were estimated with current source density (CSD) and lagged phase synchronization (LPS) as the EEG parameters. Correlations between CSF biomarkers and the EEG parameters were assessed. Patients with AD showed significant negative correlation between CSF beta-amyloid (Abeta)-42 concentration and the logarithms of CSD over the right temporal area in the theta band. Total tau concentration was negatively correlated with the LPS between the left frontal eye field and the right auditory area in the alpha-2 band in patients with AD. Our study results suggest that AD biomarkers, in particular CSF Abeta42 and total tau concentrations are associated with the EEG parameters CSD and LPS, respectively. Our results could yield more insights into the complicated pathology of AD.
