30755953|t|Chronic Mercury Intoxication Masquerading as Systemic Disease: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.
30755953|a|BACKGROUND: Mercury is a highly toxic environmental metal that exists in three different forms: elemental, inorganic and organic. Intoxication occurs in either occupational or non-occupational settings, mainly after the inhalation of vapour and fumes in work places, laboratories or homes. Chronic mercury toxicity ranges from mild and insignificant to severe and life-threatening. We describe the case of a young male patient who presented with multiple organ dysfunction after chronic mercury exposure. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of 28-year-old male artisanal gold miner who was admitted to hospital for severe neurological impairment associated with inflammatory bowel disease-like symptoms and a skin rash after mercury exposure. Symptomatic treatment and corticosteroid administration assured rapid clinical improvement. Chronic mercury poisoning can masquerade as an autoimmune or systemic inflammatory disease. CONCLUSION: Physicians should be aware that low exposure to mercury, even from artisanal gold mining, may be harmful to health. Management can be simple without the need for aggressive or invasive therapeutic measures. Larger case series are required in order to establish a clear management plan. LEARNING POINTS: Mercury intoxication has a wide the variety of clinical manifestations that may involve the neurological, gastrointestinal and dermatological systems.Therefore, it can mimic degenerative neurological conditions, autoimmune diseases, as well as metabolic and mitochondrial disorders.Once diagnosed, mercury intoxication is easily treated.
