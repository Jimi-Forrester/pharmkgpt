1793420|t|Potentially reversible dementia: a review.
1793420|a|Potentially reversible dementia is reviewed with reference to diagnosis, causes and outcome. Many disorders which cause cognitive impairment, such as drug toxicity and depression, fail to meet diagnostic criteria for dementia. These tend to have the best prognosis. Studies of the neuropsychiatric syndromes associated with disorders causing potentially reversible dementias suggest that dementia is an infrequent outcome and when it does occur, few cases recover. Factors predictive of improvement are short duration of symptoms and mild degree of cognitive impairment, usually subcortical in type. It is suggested that potentially reversible cognitive impairment would be a more accurate term as many cases are due to delirium and depression. While cases of well established dementia do not require extensive investigation, all cases should have a thorough clinical assessment as in many instances dual pathology exists and all require psychosocial management.
