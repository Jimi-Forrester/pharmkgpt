31460204|t|C-Terminal Plays as the Possible Nucleation of the Self-Aggregation of the S-Shape Abeta11-42 Tetramer in Solution: Intensive MD Study.
31460204|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides are characterized as the major factors associated with neuron death in Alzheimer's disease, which is listed as the most common form of neurodegeneration. Disordered Abeta peptides are released from proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein. The Abeta self-assembly process roughly takes place via five steps: disordered forms   oligomers   photofibrils   mature fibrils   plaques. Although Abeta fibrils are often observed in patient brains, oligomers were recently indicated to be major neurotoxic elements. In this work, the neurotoxic compound S-shape Abeta11-42 tetramer (S4Abeta11-42) was investigated over 10 mus of unbiased MD simulations. In particular, the S4Abeta11-42 oligomer adopted a high dynamics structure, resulting in unsuccessful determination of their structures in experiments. The C-terminal was suggested as the possible nucleation of the Abeta42 aggregation. The sequences 27-35 and 39-40 formed rich beta-content, whereas other residues mostly adopted coil structures. The mean value of the beta-content over the equilibrium interval is ~42 +- 3%. Furthermore, the dissociation free energy of the S4Abeta11-42 peptide was predicted using a biased sampling method. The obtained free energy is DeltaG US = -58.44 kcal/mol which is roughly the same level as the corresponding value of the U-shape Abeta17-42 peptide. We anticipate that the obtained S4Abeta11-42 structures could be used as targets for AD inhibitor screening over the in silico study.
