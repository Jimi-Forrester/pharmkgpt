38144876|a|Background: Nausea and vomiting are two common symptoms in myocardial infarction patients. This study aims to determine the impact of p6 acupressure on nausea, vomiting, comfort, and the need for anti-vomiting drugs in myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Methods: This research involved 90 patients with acute heart attacks experiencing persistent nausea despite taking anti-vomiting drugs. They were divided into three groups: acupressure, placebo, and control. The acupressure group wore a wristband with a button, the placebo group had a similar wristband without a button, and the control group received no wristband. Data on nausea severity, comfort, frequency of nausea, vomiting, and retching was collected before and after the intervention at different time points. The study also assessed the use of anti-vomiting drugs within 24 h of the intervention. Results: The patients in the acupressure group, compared to those in the placebo and control groups, experienced significantly lower severity of nausea, frequency of vomiting, nausea, and retching and a substantially higher level of comfort level during the two, four, and 6 h after the start of the intervention (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference between the placebo and control groups was observed (P > 0.05). During the 24 h after the start of the intervention, administration of anti-vomiting drugs to the acupressure group was significantly less than that done in the placebo and control groups (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The results illustrated that p6 acupressure reduces nausea, vomiting, and retching and increases the comfort level in myocardial infarction patients.
