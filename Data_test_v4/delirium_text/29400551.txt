29400551|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently an incurable neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people around the world. The aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta), one of the primary pathological hallmarks of AD, plays a key role in the AD pathogenesis. In this regard, Abeta aggregates have been considered as both biomarkers and drug targets for the diagnosis and therapy of AD. Various Abeta-targeted metal complexes have exhibited promising potential as anti-AD agents due to their fascinating physicochemical properties over the past two decades. This review classifies the complexes into three groups based on their potential applications in AD including therapy, diagnosis and theranosis. The recent representative examples are highlighted in terms of design rationale, working mechanism and potential applications.
