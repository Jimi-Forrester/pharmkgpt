33960687|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of early ambulation on elderly patients' postoperative physical functional outcomes, complications, 90-day readmission rate, and the length of postoperative hospital stay. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study conducted between June 2019 and December 2019. The study enrolled 86 elderly patients (39 males) with newly diagnosed lumbar degenerative disease undergoing single-segment decompression and fusion surgerywere enrolled. Of all 86 patients, 39 voluntarily joined the early ambulation group, and 47 joined the regular ambulation group. The early ambulation group included patients ambulated within 4 h postoperatively, whereas the regular ambulation group included patients who were ambulatory at a minimum of 24 h after surgery. Participants' baseline characteristics, surgical information, ambulation ability, degree of pain, functional scores, postoperative complications, 90-day readmission rate, and length of postoperative hospital stay were recorded. RESULTS: Participants' baseline demographic characteristics were balanced between the early ambulation group and the regular ambulation group. The operative time and blood loss were similar between groups. The time before the first-time ambulation was 4 +- 0.5 h in the early ambulation group and 28 +- 4.5 h in the regular ambulation group. Ambulating distance was significantly longer in the early ambulation group compared with the regular ambulation group on the 1st (63 +- 45 vs 23 +- 60 m), the 2nd (224 +- 100 vs 101 +- 130 m), and the 3rd (280 +- 102.5 vs 190 +- 170 m) ambulation days based on generalized estimating equation analyses. Generalized estimating equation analyses also demonstrated that the ambulating time was longer in the early ambulation group compared with the regular ambulation group on the 1st (10 +- 5 vs 10 +- 5 min), the 2nd (19 +- 7 vs 15 +- 5 min), and the 3rd (22 +- 16.5 vs 27 +- 12 min) ambulation days. Patients in the regular ambulation group experienced a higher degree of pain than the early ambulation group patients, with an odds ratio of 1.627 (P = 0.002). Short-term functional independence was superior in the early ambulation group, with a lower Roland-Morris disability questionnaire score (P = 0.008) and Oswestry disability index (P < 0.001). The incidences of postoperative urinary retention (early ambulation group: 7.7%, regular ambulation group: 25.5%, P = 0.030) and ileus (early ambulation group: 0%, regular ambulation group: 12.8%, P = 0.030) were significantly higher in the regular ambulation group. The prevalence of at least one complication rate was significantly lower in the early ambulation group than in the regular ambulation group (early ambulation group, 23.1%; regular ambulation group, 46.8%, P = 0.022). The duration of indwelling of the drainage catheter was shorter in the early ambulation group (early ambulation group, 68 +- 24 h; regular ambulation group, 78 +- 20 h, P = 0.001), and the length of the postoperative hospital stay was also shorter in the early ambulation group (early ambulation group, 4 +- 0 days; regular ambulation group: 5 +- 2 days, P < 0.001). However, there was no statistical difference in the 90-day readmission rate between groups. CONCLUSION: Early ambulation improved patients' postoperative functional status, decreased the incidence of complications, and shortened postoperative hospital stay in elderly patients undergoing lumbar decompression and fusion surgery.
