38949932|t|LCGNet: Local Sequential Feature Coupling Global Representation Learning for Functional Connectivity Network Analysis with fMRI.
38949932|a|Analysis of functional connectivity networks (FCNs) derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has greatly advanced our understanding of brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Advanced machine learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been used to learn high-level feature representations of FCNs for automated brain disease classification. Even though convolution operations in CNNs are good at extracting local properties of FCNs, they generally cannot well capture global temporal representations of FCNs. Recently, the transformer technique has demonstrated remarkable performance in various tasks, which is attributed to its effective self-attention mechanism in capturing the global temporal feature representations. However, it cannot effectively model the local network characteristics of FCNs. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel network structure for Local sequential feature Coupling Global representation learning (LCGNet) to take advantage of convolutional operations and self-attention mechanisms for enhanced FCN representation learning. Specifically, we first build a dynamic FCN for each subject using an overlapped sliding window approach. We then construct three sequential components (i.e., edge-to-vertex layer, vertex-to-network layer, and network-to-temporality layer) with a dual backbone branch of CNN and transformer to extract and couple from local to global topological information of brain networks. Experimental results on two real datasets (i.e., ADNI and ADHD-200) with rs-fMRI data show the superiority of our LCGNet.
