34805658|t|Dereplication Based Strategy for Rapid Identification and Isolation of a Novel Anti-inflammatory Flavonoid by LCMS/MS from Colebrookea oppositifolia.
34805658|a|Colebrookea oppositifolia is a folkloric medicinal plant, well known for its tremendous medicinal properties such as curing epilepsy, ulcers, and urinary problems. The aim of the present study was to apply the dereplication strategy on the ethanol extract of C. oppositifolia with potent anti-inflammatory activity for the rapid identification and isolation of novel bioactive molecules to aid the drug discovery process. An integrated approach using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) followed by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for the isolation of potent molecules from the anti-inflammatory extract of C. oppositifolia . Purity of the compounds (>98.5%) was established by HPLC, and identification was carried out by NMR and ESI-MS. 5,6,7-Trihydroxyflavone-3-O-glucuronide methyl ester (compound III) isolated from C. oppositifolia was extensively studied for anti-inflammatory potential in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and the mice model. Compound III significantly repressed various proinflammatory mediators and upregulated the release of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Compound III reduced inflammation when studied for parameters such as the phagocytic index, carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice, and effect on organ weight. It reduced inflammation in a dose-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo. Further molecular insights into the study revealed that compound III blocks the phosphorylation of I kappa b kinase alpha/beta (IKKalpha/beta), IkappaBalpha, and nuclear factor kB p65 (NF-kappaBp65) which is a key controller of inflammation, thereby showing anti-inflammatory potential. Hence, this study permits further investigation to develop compound III as an anti-inflammatory drug.
