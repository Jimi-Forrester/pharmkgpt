29996096|t|Cholinergic Homeostatic Synaptic Plasticity Drives the Progression of Abeta-Induced Changes in Neural Activity.
29996096|a|Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) is the ability of neurons to exert compensatory changes in response to altered neural activity. How pathologically induced activity changes are intertwined with HSP mechanisms is unclear. We show that, in cholinergic neurons from Drosophila, beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides Abeta40 and Abeta42 both induce an increase in spontaneous activity. In a transgenic line expressing Abeta42, we observe that this early increase in spontaneous activity is followed by a dramatic reduction in spontaneous events, a progression that has been suggested to occur in cholinergic brain regions of mammalian models of Alzheimer's disease. We present evidence that the early enhancement in synaptic activity is mediated by the Drosophila alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and that, later, Abeta42-induced inhibition of synaptic events is a consequence of Dalpha7-dependent HSP mechanisms induced by earlier hyperactivity. Thus, while HSP may initially be an adaptive response, it may also drive maladaptive changes and downstream pathologies.
