32948791|t|Ultrasound neuromodulation depends on pulse repetition frequency and can modulate inhibitory effects of TTX.
32948791|a|Ultrasound is gaining traction as a neuromodulation method due to its ability to remotely and non-invasively modulate neuronal activity with millimeter precision. However, there is little consensus about optimal ultrasound parameters required to elicit neuromodulation and how specific parameters drive mechanisms that underlie ultrasound neuromodulation. We address these questions in this work by performing a study to determine effective ultrasound parameters in a transgenic mouse brain slice model that enables calcium imaging as a quantitative readout of neuronal activity for ultrasound neuromodulation. We report that (1) calcium signaling increases with the application of ultrasound; (2) the neuronal response rate to ultrasound is dependent on pulse repetition frequency (PRF); and (3) ultrasound can reversibly alter the inhibitory effects of tetrodotoxin (TTX) in pharmacological studies. This study offers mechanistic insight into the PRF dependence of ultrasound neuromodulation and the nature of ultrasound/ion channel interaction.
