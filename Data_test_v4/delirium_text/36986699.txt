36986699|t|Nanocarriers for the Delivery of Neuroprotective Agents in the Treatment of Ocular Neurodegenerative Diseases.
36986699|a|Retinal neurodegeneration is considered an early event in the pathogenesis of several ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma. At present, there is no definitive treatment to prevent the progression or reversal of vision loss caused by photoreceptor degeneration and the death of retinal ganglion cells. Neuroprotective approaches are being developed to increase the life expectancy of neurons by maintaining their shape/function and thus prevent the loss of vision and blindness. A successful neuroprotective approach could prolong patients' vision functioning and quality of life. Conventional pharmaceutical technologies have been investigated for delivering ocular medications; however, the distinctive structural characteristics of the eye and the physiological ocular barriers restrict the efficient delivery of drugs. Recent developments in bio-adhesive in situ gelling systems and nanotechnology-based targeted/sustained drug delivery systems are receiving a lot of attention. This review summarizes the putative mechanism, pharmacokinetics, and mode of administration of neuroprotective drugs used to treat ocular disorders. Additionally, this review focuses on cutting-edge nanocarriers that demonstrated promising results in treating ocular neurodegenerative diseases.
