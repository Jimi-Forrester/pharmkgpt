36080253|a|Despite advances in antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory therapies, inflammation and its consequences still remain a significant problem in medicine. Acute inflammatory responses are responsible for directly life-threating conditions such as septic shock; on the other hand, chronic inflammation can cause degeneration of body tissues leading to severe impairment of their function. Neuroinflammation is defined as an inflammatory response in the central nervous system involving microglia, astrocytes, and cytokines including chemokines. It is considered an important cause of neurodegerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a strong immunogenic particle present in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. It is a major triggering factor for the inflammatory cascade in response to a Gram-negative bacteria infection. The use of LPS as a strong pro-inflammatory agent is a well-known model of inflammation applied in both in vivo and in vitro studies. This review offers a summary of the pathogenesis associated with LPS exposure, especially in the field of neuroinflammation. Moreover, we analyzed different in vivo LPS models utilized in the area of neuroscience. This paper presents recent knowledge and is focused on new insights in the LPS experimental model.
