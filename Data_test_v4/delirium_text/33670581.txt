33670581|t|Murine Typhus Infection in Pregnancy: Case Series and Literature Review.
33670581|a|Murine typhus is a flea-borne disease of worldwide distribution with a recent reemergence in the United States of America. There are limited data about the presentation, treatment, and outcomes in the pregnant population. We report on two cases of murine typhus during pregnancy and review the literature to compile previously reported cases. A comprehensive search was performed via the PubMed database for published articles between 1990 and 2020. Seven articles met the criteria of symptomatic pregnant murine typhus infection. A total of 37 patients were identified. Patients frequently presented with a prolonged duration of fevers prior to presentation, headache, and elevated hepatic transaminases. The diagnosis was predominantly based on serology. Treatment varied. Overall, the pregnancy outcome was favorable. Murine typhus can mimic other pregnancy-related pathologies. More exclusive and large-scale studies are needed to learn more of murine typhus during pregnancy.
