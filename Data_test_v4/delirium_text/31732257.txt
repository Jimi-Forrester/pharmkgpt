31732257|a|Over the past decade, many drug discovery endeavors have been invested in targeting the serine proteases prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) for the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and, more recently, epithelial cancers. Our research group has focused on the discovery of reversible covalent inhibitors, namely nitriles, to target the catalytic serine residue in this enzyme. While there have been many inhibitors discovered containing a nitrile to covalently bind to the catalytic serine, we have been investigating others, particularly boronic acids and boronic esters, the latter of which have been largely unexplored as covalent warheads. Herein we report a series of computationally-designed POP boronic ester pro-drug inhibitors exhibiting nanomolar-potencies in vitro as their active boronic acid species. These easily-accessible (1-2 step syntheses) compounds could facilitate future biochemical and biological studies of this enzyme's role in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer progression.
