34739758|t|All-d-Enantiomeric Peptide D3 Designed for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment Dynamically Interacts with Membrane-Bound Amyloid-beta Precursors.
34739758|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative pathology with no effective treatment known. Toxic amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) oligomers play a crucial role in AD pathogenesis. All-d-Enantiomeric peptide D3 and its derivatives were developed to disassemble and destroy cytotoxic Abeta aggregates. One of the D3-like compounds is approaching phase II clinical trials; however, high-resolution details of its disease-preventing or pharmacological actions are not completely clear. We demonstrate that peptide D3 stabilizing Abeta monomer dynamically interacts with the extracellular juxtamembrane region of a membrane-bound fragment of an amyloid precursor protein containing the Abeta sequence. MD simulations based on NMR measurement results suggest that D3 targets the amyloidogenic region, not compromising its alpha-helicity and preventing intermolecular hydrogen bonding, thus creating prerequisites for inhibition of early steps of Abeta conversion into beta-conformation and its toxic oligomerization. An enhanced understanding of the D3 action molecular mechanism facilitates development of effective AD treatment and prevention strategies.
