38029736|t|Evaluation of advective solute infiltration into porous media by pulsed focused ultrasound-induced acoustic streaming effects.
38029736|a|PURPOSE: Acoustic streaming induced by applying transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) promotes localized advective solute transport in the brain and has recently garnered research interest for drug delivery and enhancement of brain waste clearance. The acoustic streaming behavior in brain tissue is difficult to model numerically and thus warrants an in vitro examination of the effects of using different sonication parameters, in terms of frequency, intensity, and pulse duration (PD). METHODS: Melamine and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) foams were used to mimic the porous brain tissue, which contains leptomeningeal fenestrations and perivascular space, while agar hydrogel was used to emulate denser neuropil. FUS was delivered to these media, which were immersed in a phosphate-buffered saline containing toluidine blue O dye, across various frequencies (400, 500, and 600 kHz; applicable to transcranial delivery) in a pulsed mode at two different spatialpeak pulse-average intensities (3 and 4 W/cm2). RESULTS: Image analysis showed that the use of 400 kHz yielded the greatest dye infiltration in melamine foam, while sonication had no impact on infiltration in the agar hydrogel due to the dominance of diffusional transport. Using a fixed spatial-peak temporal-average intensity of 0.4 W/cm2 at 400 kHz, a PD of 75 ms resulted in the greatest infiltration depth in both melamine and PVA foams among the tested range (50-150 ms). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the existence of a specific frequency and PD that induce greater enhancement of solute/fluid movement, which may contribute to eventual in vivo applications in promoting waste clearance from the brain.
