28413272|t|An analysis of perioperative adverse neurological events associated with anesthetic management at a Tertiary Care Center of a developing country.
28413272|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Existing literature on neurological complications related to anesthesia is reported from affluent countries but the trends may vary in less affluent countries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The objective was to find the associated factors contributing to neurological adverse events occurring within 48 h of anesthesia and surgery. The existing departmental morbidity and mortality database was reviewed from 1992 to 2012 for major adverse neurological events. A standardized methodology was used in reviewing and classifying the data. All adverse events were predefined and categorized before filling the form into the following headers; meningitis, cord/plexus/peripheral nerve injury, stroke, paraparesis/paraplegia/quadriparesis/or quadriplegia, new onset postoperative seizures, postoperative vocal cord injury, and a miscellaneous group. RESULTS: During this period, 195,031 patients underwent anesthesia and twenty-nine patients had major neurological morbidity within 48 h (1:6700). There were three cases of meningitis/meningism, eight cases of cord, plexus or peripheral nerve injury, seven of stroke, four had new onset seizures, one had quadriparesis, five had vocal cord, and one had cranial nerve palsy. Forty-one percent cases received regional anesthesia alone or in combination with the general. In six cases, anesthesia was considered solely responsible. Human error contributed to 93% of these events. CONCLUSION: This data has helped in identifying areas of concern and can serve as a reference for further audits in the region.
