32285305|t|Considerations and Current Trends in the Management of the Geriatric Patient on a Consultation-Liaison Service.
32285305|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide consultation-liaison psychiatrists with an updated resource that can assist in the treatment and management of geriatric patients. RECENT FINDINGS: The current available literature has not shown any differences in efficacy between haloperidol and second-generation antipsychotics in patients with delirium. When considering relative advantages of forms of antipsychotic administration, there is no support for a superior safety profile of oral compared to intramuscular or intravenous administration. A recent meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials concluded that when melatonin was administered to older age patients on medical wards, it significantly prevented the incidence of delirium when compared with the control group. While suvorexant administered nightly to elderly patients in acute care settings may lower the incidence of delirium, larger studies are needed to confirm this finding. Despite the black box warning of increased mortality risk in older patients with dementia, antipsychotics may be used with caution by the consultation-liaison (CL) psychiatrist to treat the neuropsychologic symptoms of dementia including hallucinations and psychosis in the hospital setting. While antidepressant studies have focused primarily on citalopram and escitalopram in the treatment of agitation in the setting of dementia, these two medications have not been adequately compared directly to other SSRIs for this condition. It is therefore not clear whether citalopram and escitalopram are more efficacious in treating agitation in the setting of dementia when compared to other SSRIs. While the evidence supporting trazodone's use is limited, it is generally well tolerated and is an option as a PRN for irritability and agitation in patients with Alzheimer's and mixed dementia. While there is some evidence to support the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for treating cognitive impairments and hallucinations in Lewy body dementia, the usefulness of these agents in other forms of dementia is not well studied, and those studies did not show any benefit in the management of acute agitation. It is important to note that memantine can cause or exacerbate agitation and may be the cause of behavioral dysregulation. There is no evidence to support the routine use of benzodiazepines for behavioral improvement in patients with dementia. Escitalopram and citalopram do have a unique pharmacokinetic properties in the sense that they have been found to have 50-56% plasma protein binding, compared to sertraline, fluoxetine, and paroxetine (95% or more). Pooled analyses suggest that antidepressants are more effective than placebo in reducing the symptoms of post-stroke depression. SSRIs are considered first-line antidepressants in stroke patients, who are often elderly with underlying cardiovascular problems. Although treatment with SSRIs is recommended for post-stroke depression, there are no studies providing conclusive data on the superiority of a specific drug. Older age is associated with a better outcome from ECT, with remission rates of approximately 73% to 90% in patients over 65 years. ECT is the treatment of choice for patients with psychotic depression, and elderly patients with psychotic depression have been shown to have a higher remission rate and faster time to response than depressed patients without psychotic symptoms. With the average life expectancy increase, it is projected that 19 million people will reach the age of 85 or higher, an increase from 5.5 million in 2010. With an increasing older population, psychiatric consultation in the management of geriatric patients is becoming more necessary. Psychiatrists must be aware of the unique considerations in elderly patients. In this article, we provide evidence-based guidance to the CL psychiatrist on major issues relating to the older age patient, highlighting recent trends in treatment. First, we provide background on the evaluation of the medically hospitalized geriatric patient. As rates of medical and psychiatric illnesses increase with advancing age, elderly patients are more likely to be taking a higher number of medications as compared to younger patients, and physicians must pay special attention to polypharmacy, including side effects and drug interactions in this group. Next, we focus on the diagnosis, management, and unique needs of the geriatric patient presenting with common clinical syndromes of delirium, dementia, and depression. Delirium and dementia are among the most common causes of cognitive impairment in clinical settings yet are often either unrecognized or misdiagnosed as they may have similar signs and symptoms. In addition, depression is prevalent in older adults, especially in those with comorbid medical illness. Depression can be fatal as the rates of suicide are higher in later life than in any other age group. Consultation can improve the management of elderly patients and prevent unnecessary nursing home placement.
