17045397|t|International quality control survey of neurochemical dementia diagnostics.
17045397|a|UNLABELLED: Currently, neurochemical dementia diagnostics (NDD) are increasingly entering routine clinical neurochemistry, offering improved early and differential diagnosis of dementias. However, there is an obvious lack of standardization in pre-analytical sample handling and systematic quality surveys. Therefore, in this study, 14 laboratories in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland were given aliquots of a human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample, and were asked to measure Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers (amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, total Tau protein, and phosphorylated Tau protein (P-tau(181P))) according to their routine protocols. RESULTS: The inter-laboratory coefficients of variation of the results obtained by the laboratories participating in this study were in the range of 20-30%. Although the results of this quality control survey are promising, the quality of measurements has to be further optimized.
