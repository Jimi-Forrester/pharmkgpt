37038595|t|Frailty and Age-Associated Assessments Associated with Chronic Kidney Disease and Transplantation Outcomes.
37038595|a|Background: Frailty is often defined as a decrease in physiological reserve and has been shown to be correlated with adverse health outcomes and mortality in the general population. This condition is highly prevalent in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) patient population as well as in kidney transplant (KT) recipients. Other age-associated changes include sarcopenia, nutrition, cognition, and depression. In assessing the contributions of these components to patient outcomes and their prevalence in the CKD and KT patient population, it can be determined how such variables may be associated with frailty and the extent to which they may impact the adverse outcomes an individual may experience. Objectives: We sought to perform a systematic literature review to review published data on frailty and associated age-associated syndromes in CKD and KT patients. Results: Over 80 references pertinent to frailty, sarcopenia, nutrition, cognition, or depression in patients with CKD or KT were identified. Systematic review was performed to evaluate the data supporting the use of the following approaches: Fried Frailty, Short Physical Performance Battery, Frailty Index, Sarcopenia Index, CT scan quantification of muscle mass, health-related quality of life, and assessment tools for nutrition, cognition, and depression. Conclusion: This report represents a comprehensive review of previously published research articles on this topic. The intersectionality between all these components in contributing to the patient's clinical status suggests a need for a multifaceted approach to developing comprehensive care and treatment for the CKD and KT population to improve outcomes before and after transplantation.
