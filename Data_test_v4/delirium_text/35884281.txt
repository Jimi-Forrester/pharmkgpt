35884281|t|Dual-Mode Tumor Imaging Using Probes That Are Responsive to Hypoxia-Induced Pathological Conditions.
35884281|a|Hypoxia in solid tumors is associated with poor prognosis, increased aggressiveness, and strong resistance to therapeutics, making accurate monitoring of hypoxia important. Several imaging modalities have been used to study hypoxia, but each modality has inherent limitations. The use of a second modality can compensate for the limitations and validate the results of any single imaging modality. In this review, we describe dual-mode imaging systems for the detection of hypoxia that have been reported since the start of the 21st century. First, we provide a brief overview of the hallmarks of hypoxia used for imaging and the imaging modalities used to detect hypoxia, including optical imaging, ultrasound imaging, photoacoustic imaging, single-photon emission tomography, X-ray computed tomography, positron emission tomography, Cerenkov radiation energy transfer imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, electron paramagnetic resonance imaging, magnetic particle imaging, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and mass spectrometric imaging. These overviews are followed by examples of hypoxia-relevant imaging using a mixture of probes for complementary single-mode imaging techniques. Then, we describe dual-mode molecular switches that are responsive in multiple imaging modalities to at least one hypoxia-induced pathological change. Finally, we offer future perspectives toward dual-mode imaging of hypoxia and hypoxia-induced pathophysiological changes in tumor microenvironments.
