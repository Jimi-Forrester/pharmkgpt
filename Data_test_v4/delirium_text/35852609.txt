35852609|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia with limited treatment options affecting millions of people and the prevalence increasing with the aging population. The current knowledge on the role of the hypoxia/hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) in the AD pathology is restricted and controversial. We hypothesized based on benefits of the genetic long-term inactivation of HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylase-2 (HIF-P4H-2) on metabolism, vasculature and inflammatory response that prolonged moderate activation of the hypoxia response could hinder AD pathology. We used an aging model to study potential spontaneous accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in HIF-P4H-2-deficient mice and a transgenic APP/PSEN1 mouse model subjected to prolonged sustained environmental hypoxia (15% O2 for 6 weeks) at two different time points of the disease; at age of 4 and 10 months. In both settings, activation of the hypoxia response reduced brain protein aggregate levels and this associated with higher vascularity. In the senescent HIF-P4H-2-deficient mice metabolic reprogramming also contributed to less protein aggregates while in APP/PSEN1 mice lesser Abeta associated additionally with hypoxia-mediated favorable responses to neuroinflammation and amyloid precursor protein processing. In conclusion, continuous, non-full-scale activation of the HIF pathway appears to mediate protection against neurodegeneration via several mechanisms and should be studied as a treatment option for AD.
