34515123|a|INTRODUCTION: The ability to use everyday technology (ET) is becoming increasingly necessary for maintaining domestic and social lives. For older adults, difficulties with using ETs can begin at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) state and may indicate increasing cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to conduct a detailed investigation into the ability to use ETs among Japanese older community-dwelling adults at 3 stages of cognitive function and the ability to carry out daily activities. METHOD: We analyzed family members' responses to questions about older adults with cognitive decline in their families. A total of 168 older adults with subjective memory complaints (SMC) or cognitive decline and inconvenience in daily life were analyzed. A questionnaire was used to assess the characteristics, ability to use ETs, and ability to manage refrigerator contents, all of which can be early signs of dementia. Participants were divided 3 groups by the type of dementia: SMC (n = 77), MCI (n = 36), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 55) for comparison. RESULT: The observation list of early signs of dementia (OLD) total score indicated a significant positive correlation with the number of ET errors (r = 0.37, p < 0.001) and number of difficulties with refrigerator management (r = 0.18, p = 0.031). Regarding number of ET errors, there was a significant main effect for the 3 groups, and the SMC group made significantly fewer errors than the AD group (p = 0.02). In 7 of the 11 ET categories, errors with using ETs were associated with all 3 groups, with the SMC group making fewer errors, and the AD group making more. Regarding difficulties with refrigerator management, 2 out of 9 problems were associated with the 3 groups, with the SMC group having fewer difficulties and the AD group having more. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the ability to use ETs and to manage refrigerator contents begins to decline at the SMC stage. Further evaluation of the ability to use ETs is needed for older adults with SMC so that adequate support in the context of the individual can be provided.
