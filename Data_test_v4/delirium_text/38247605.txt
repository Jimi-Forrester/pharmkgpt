38247605|t|Multidrug-Resistant Sepsis: A Critical Healthcare Challenge.
38247605|a|Sepsis globally accounts for an alarming annual toll of 48.9 million cases, resulting in 11 million deaths, and inflicts an economic burden of approximately USD 38 billion on the United States healthcare system. The rise of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) has elevated the urgency surrounding the management of multidrug-resistant (MDR) sepsis, evolving into a critical global health concern. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current epidemiology of (MDR) sepsis and its associated healthcare challenges, particularly in critically ill hospitalized patients. Highlighted findings demonstrated the complex nature of (MDR) sepsis pathophysiology and the resulting immune responses, which significantly hinder sepsis treatment. Studies also revealed that aging, antibiotic overuse or abuse, inadequate empiric antibiotic therapy, and underlying comorbidities contribute significantly to recurrent sepsis, thereby leading to septic shock, multi-organ failure, and ultimately immune paralysis, which all contribute to high mortality rates among sepsis patients. Moreover, studies confirmed a correlation between elevated readmission rates and an increased risk of cognitive and organ dysfunction among sepsis patients, amplifying hospital-associated costs. To mitigate the impact of sepsis burden, researchers have directed their efforts towards innovative diagnostic methods like point-of-care testing (POCT) devices for rapid, accurate, and particularly bedside detection of sepsis; however, these methods are currently limited to detecting only a few resistance biomarkers, thus warranting further exploration. Numerous interventions have also been introduced to treat MDR sepsis, including combination therapy with antibiotics from two different classes and precision therapy, which involves personalized treatment strategies tailored to individual needs. Finally, addressing MDR-associated healthcare challenges at regional levels based on local pathogen resistance patterns emerges as a critical strategy for effective sepsis treatment and minimizing adverse effects.
