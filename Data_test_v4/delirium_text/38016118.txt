38016118|t|A 12-Year Comparison of Alzheimer's Dementia Patients With Their Informants in Taiwan.
38016118|a|BACKGROUND: To update the characteristics of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their informants in Taiwan and compare them from 12 years ago. METHODS: 1218 patients with AD and their informants were recruited from six hospitals in Taiwan. The uniform data set version 3.0 (UDS3, form A1-A3) were administered. RESULTS: Compared with the first registration from 2010-2012 (n = 691), the mean clinical dementia rating sum of boxes score was significantly lower, more patients living independently, and more informants not living together with the patients. A total of 11.2%, 4.1%, 12.8%, and 0.5% of the patients had a reported history of cognitive impairment in their mothers, fathers, siblings, and children, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with the data from 2010, patients have been diagnosed at a milder disease stage, and their informants used telephone contact more frequently instead of living with the patients. Family histories of cognitive impairment in patients with AD remain frequent.
