33987547|a|Leuconostoc mesenteroides H40 (H40) was isolated from kimchi, and its probiotic properties and neuroprotective effect was evaluated in oxidatively stressed SH-SY5Y cells. H40 was stable in artificial gastric conditions and can be attached in HT-29 cells. In addition, H40 did not produce beta-glucuronidase and showed resistant to several antibiotics. The conditioned medium (CM) was made using HT-29 cells refined with heat-killed probiotics (Probiotics-CM) and heated yogurts (Y-CM) to investigate the neuroprotective effect. Treatment with H40-CM not only increased cell viability but also significantly improved brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) expression and reduced the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in oxidatively stress-induced SH-SY5Y cells. Besides, probiotic Y-CM significantly increased BDNF mRNA expression and decreased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The physicochemical properties of probiotic yogurt with H40 was not significantly different from the control yogurt. The viable cell counts of lactic acid bacteria in control and probiotic yogurt with H40 was 8.66 Log CFU/mL and 8.96 Log CFU/mL, respectively. Therefore, these results indicate that H40 can be used as prophylactic functional dairy food having neuroprotective effects.
