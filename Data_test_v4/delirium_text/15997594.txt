15997594|a|The progressive aging of the population and the difficulty of diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) portends an exponencial increase in the prevalence of this illness. One way to approach this social and health problem is to develop diagnostic techniques that allow us to detect the disease in its pre-clinical stages and apply early treatment that can slow down AD advance. Molecular imaging, in particular that generated by positron emission tomography with 2-fluoro-2 deoxi-D-glucose (PET-FDG) has shown high sensitivity in detecting changes in cerebral metabolic activity in the early stages of AD, and allow other dementias and physiological changes that accompany normal aging to be distinguished from AD.
