39858375|t|Antibiotic Residues in Animal Products from Some African Countries and Their Possible Impact on Human Health.
39858375|a|This review investigates the levels of antibiotic residues in animal products, types of antibiotics, and their possible impact on human health in Africa. The literature search involved the use of a systematic survey using data that were published from Africa from 2015 to 2024. The search terms used the Boolean operators with keywords such as antibiotics, antibiotic residues, antibiotics in animal products in Africa, and impact on human health. Only research conducted in Africa was used in the present study. The findings showed that the most prevalent groups of antibiotic residues were aminoglycoside, macrolides, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines sulfonamides, and phenicols. Tetracycline showed the most prevalent antibiotic residue with 43% mostly from East Africa, followed by sulfonamides at 19%, and beta-lactams at 16%; most of the antibiotic residue levels were higher than the World Health Organization permissible limit. Noncompliance with withdrawal periods and maximum residue limits for antibiotics used in food-producing animals may lead to negative outcomes such as allergic reactions, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity, microbiome alterations, and, most notably, antibiotic resistance. As a result, there is a need for constant monitoring of antibiotic residues in animal products in addition to the consideration of alternatives to antibiotics in order to avoid their health implications.
