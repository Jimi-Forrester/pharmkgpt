35407458|t|Hospital at Home for Elderly COVID-19 Patients: A Preliminary Report with 100 Patients.
35407458|a|Hospital-at-home (HaH) care is useful for patients with COVID-19 and an alternative strategy when hospital capacity is under pressure due to patient surges. However, the efficacy and safety of HaH in elderly patients with COVID-19 remain unknown. In Kyoto city, we conducted a retrospective medical record review of HaH care focused on elderly COVID-19 patients from 4 February to 25 June 2021. Eligible patients were (1) COVID-19 patients aged >=70 years and those who lived with them or (2) COVID-19 patients aged <70 years with special circumstances and those who lived with them. During the study period, 100 patients received HaH care. Their median age was 76 years (interquartile range 56-83), and 65% were over 70 years. Among 100 patients, 36 (36%) had hypoxia (oxygen saturation <= 92%), 21 (21%) received steroid medication, and 34 (34%) received intravenous fluids. Although 22 patients were admitted to the hospital and 3 patients died there, no patients died during HaH care. HaH care may be safe and effective in elderly patients with COVID-19. Our study shows that HaH provides an alternative strategy for treating COVID-19 patients and can reduce the healthcare burden at hospitals.
