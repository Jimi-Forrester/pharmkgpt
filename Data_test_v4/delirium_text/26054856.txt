26054856|a|BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is involved in neuronal cell death and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. Liriope platyphylla (LP) has been suggested to have anti-inflammation, anti-bacterial, and anti-cancer effects. However, whether LP exerts neuroprotective effects on neuronal cells is unknown. METHODS: The present study was performed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of LP extract (LPE) against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced injury in human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y. To test neuroprotective effects of LPE, we performed cell viability assay, flow cytometry analysis and western blot analysis. In addition, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and oxidative stress were performed to evaluate the anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant effects. RESULTS: LPE pretreatment conferred significant protection against the H2O2-induced decrease of SH-SY5Y cell viability. H2O2-induced increases of intracellular oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction were attenuated by LPE pretreatment. Therefore, LPE pretreatment prevented SH-SY5Y cell injury. Treatment with H2O2 significantly induced poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 cleavage, which was blocked by LPE. We found that p38 activation was involved in the neuroprotective effects of LPE. CONCLUSIONS: Current findings suggest that LPE exerts neuroprotective effects against H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death by modulating p38 activation in SH-SY5Y cells. Therefore, LPE has potential anti-apoptotic effects that may be neuroprotective in neurodegenerative diseases and aging-related dementia.
