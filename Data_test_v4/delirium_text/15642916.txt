15642916|a|The authors report a patient with Alzheimer disease (AD) without encephalitis who was immunized with AN-1792 (an adjuvanted formulation of Abeta-42). There were no amyloid plaques in the frontal cortex and abundant Abeta-immunoreactive macrophages, but tangles and amyloid angiopathy were present. The white matter appeared normal and minimal lymphocytic infiltration in the leptomeninges was observed. This case illustrates the effects of an Abeta-based immunization on AD pathogenesis in the absence of overt meningoencephalitis and leukoencephalopathy.
