34682814|t|Association between Severity of Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis and Ossification of Other Spinal Ligaments in Patients with Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal Ligament.
34682814|a|BACKGROUND: Although diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is known to coexist with the ossification of spinal ligaments (OSLs), details of the radiographic relationship remain unclear. METHODS: We prospectively collected data of 239 patients with symptomatic cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) and analyzed the DISH severity on whole-spine computed tomography images, using the following grades: grade 0, no DISH; grade 1, DISH at T3-T10; grade 2, DISH at both T3-T10 and C6-T2 and/or T11-L2; and grade 3, DISH beyond C5 and/or L3. Ossification indices were calculated as the sum of vertebral and intervertebral levels with OSL for each patient. RESULTS: DISH was found in 107 patients (44.8%), 65 (60.7%) of whom had grade 2 DISH. We found significant associations of DISH grade with the indices for cervical OPLL (r = 0.45, p < 0.0001), thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF; r = 0.41, p < 0.0001) and thoracic ossification of the supra/interspinous ligaments (OSIL; r = 0.53, p < 0.0001). DISH grade was also correlated with the index for each OSL in the whole spine (OPLL: r = 0.29, p < 0.0001; OLF: r = 0.40, p < 0.0001; OSIL: r = 0.50, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The DISH grade correlated with the indices of OSL at each high-prevalence level as well as the whole spine.
