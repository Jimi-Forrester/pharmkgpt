36899835|t|The Protein Network in Subcutaneous Fat Biopsies from Patients with AL Amyloidosis: More Than Diagnosis?
36899835|a|AL amyloidosis is caused by the misfolding of immunoglobulin light chains leading to an impaired function of tissues and organs in which they accumulate. Due to the paucity of -omics profiles from undissected samples, few studies have addressed amyloid-related damage system wide. To fill this gap, we evaluated proteome changes in the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue of patients affected by the AL isotypes kappa and lambda. Through our retrospective analysis based on graph theory, we have herein deduced new insights representing a step forward from the pioneering proteomic investigations previously published by our group. ECM/cytoskeleton, oxidative stress and proteostasis were confirmed as leading processes. In this scenario, some proteins, including glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), tubulins and the TRiC complex, were classified as biologically and topologically relevant. These and other results overlap with those already reported for other amyloidoses, supporting the hypothesis that amyloidogenic proteins could induce similar mechanisms independently of the main fibril precursor and of the target tissues/organs. Of course, further studies based on larger patient cohorts and different tissues/organs will be essential, which would be a key point that would allow for a more robust selection of the main molecular players and a more accurate correlation with clinical aspects.
