28444069|a|OBJECTIVE:: This study aimed to examine the clinical characteristics, weaning pattern, and outcome of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation in acute intensive care unit settings in a resource-limited country. METHODS:: This was a prospective single-center observational study in India, where all adult patients requiring prolonged ventilation were followed for weaning duration and pattern and for survival at both intensive care unit discharge and at 12 months. The definition of prolonged mechanical ventilation used was that of the National Association for Medical Direction of Respiratory Care. RESULTS:: During the one-year period, 49 patients with a mean age of 49.7 years had prolonged ventilation; 63% were male, and 84% had a medical illness. The median APACHE II and SOFA scores on admission were 17 and 9, respectively. The median number of ventilation days was 37. The most common reason for starting ventilation was respiratory failure secondary to sepsis (67%). Weaning was initiated in 39 (79.5%) patients, with success in 34 (87%). The median weaning duration was 14 (9.5 - 19) days, and the median length of intensive care unit stay was 39 (32 - 58.5) days. Duration of vasopressor support and need for hemodialysis were significant independent predictors of unsuccessful ventilator liberation. At the 12-month follow-up, 65% had survived. CONCLUSION:: In acute intensive care units, more than one-fourth of patients with invasive ventilation required prolonged ventilation. Successful weaning was achieved in two-thirds of patients, and most survived at the 12-month follow-up.
