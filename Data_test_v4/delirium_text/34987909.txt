34987909|a|Background Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common condition that has a significant impact on people's lives. COVID-19 pandemic imposed a challenging situation for the general population with new precautionary measures. All that can have serious implications for those who already have intense concerns about cleanliness and hygiene and those diagnosed with OCD. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the emergence and severity of obsession and compulsion symptoms in Saudi Arabia. Methods This was a cross-sectional study with 1,190 participants who completed an online three-part questionnaire that included sociodemographic data, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) checklist, and (Y-BOCS) severity scale. On account of the fact that OCD requires a clinical evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, screening positive for OCD was defined based on criteria A of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which is selecting at least one of either obsession or compulsion symptoms or both. Screening positive for obsession was defined as selecting at least one of the obsessional symptoms while screening positive for compulsion was defined as selecting at least one of the compulsion symptoms. Results Overall, OCD screening was positive in 82% of participants. Previous diagnosis of OCD was reported by 2.6% (N=36) of the participants and 55.2% of them reported that their symptoms did not change during the pandemic, while 41.1% reported that their symptoms increased. Positive OCD screening was significantly higher in participants who reported previous psychological illness (87.6% vs. 80.9%), those who followed news related to COVID-19 on a daily basis (88.7% vs. 76.1%), and participants who had not acquired the infection (82.9%) compared to those who were infected with COVID-19 (72.3%). Conclusion The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on OCD screening and symptoms. New OCD symptoms were reported in a high proportion of the participants. The results of this study can provide guidance for psychiatrists and psychologists in the clinical approach and management of patients with OCD. Further focused research on the factors affecting the emergence or severity of OCD symptoms needs to be conducted in the future.
