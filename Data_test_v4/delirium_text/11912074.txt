11912074|t|No association between metabotropic glutamate receptors 7 and 8 (mGlur7 and mGlur8) gene polymorphisms and withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens in alcohol-dependent individuals.
11912074|a|- Up-regulation of the glutamatergic neurotransmission from chronic ethanol intoxication may cause a hyperexcitable state during alcohol withdrawal that may lead to seizures and delirium tremens. The aim of our study was to evaluate the association between a history of alcohol withdrawal-induced seizures and delirium tremens and a mGlurR7 (Tyr433Phe); and a mGlurR8 (C2756T) metabotropic glutamate receptor polymorphism in alcoholics compared to controls. A total of 182 patients meeting DSM-IV alcohol dependence criteria and 117 controls, both groups being of German descent, were investigated. mGluR7 and mGluR8 polymorphisms were determined using polymerase chain reaction of lymphocyte DNA. History of alcohol withdrawal-induced delirium tremens and seizures were obtained using the Semi-Structured Assessment of Genetics in Alcoholism (SSAGA). Data were cross-checked with inpatients' clinical files. No significant associations were obtained between both receptor polymorphisms and alcohol withdrawal-induced seizures and delirium tremens. The negative results in this study question the role of these polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of alcohol withdrawal-induced seizures and delirium tremens.
