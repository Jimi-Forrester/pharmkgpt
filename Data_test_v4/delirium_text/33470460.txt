33470460|a|BACKGROUND: The glymphatic system, including the perivascular space (PVS), plays a critical role in brain homeostasis. Although mounting evidence from Alzheimer's disease has supported the potential role of PVS in neurodegenerative disorders, its contribution in Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been fully elucidated. Although idiopathic (IPD) and familial PD (FPD) share similar pathophysiology in terms of protein aggregation, the differential impact of PVS on PD subtypes remains unknown. Our objective was to examine the differences in PVS volume fraction in IPD and FPD compared to healthy controls (HCs) and nonmanifest carriers (NMCs). METHODS: A total of 470 individuals were analyzed from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database, including (1) IPD (n = 179), (2) FPD (LRRK2 [leucine-rich repeat kinase 2], glucocerebrosidase, or alpha-synuclein) (n = 67), (3) NMC (n = 101), and (4) HCs (n = 84). Total PVS volume fraction (%) was compared using parcellation and quantitation within greater white matter volume at global and regional levels in all cortical and subcortical white matter. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in global and regional PVS volume fraction in PD versus non-PD, particularly in FPD versus NMC and LRRK2 FPD versus NMC. Regionally, FPD and NMC differed in the medial orbitofrontal region, as did LRRK2 FPD versus NMC. Non-PD and PD differed in the medial orbitofrontal region and the banks of the superior temporal regions. IPD and FPD differed in the cuneus and lateral occipital regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the role of PVS in PD and highlight a potentially significant contribution of PVS to the pathophysiology of FPD, particularly LRRK2.   2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.
