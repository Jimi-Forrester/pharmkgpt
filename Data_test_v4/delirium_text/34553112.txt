METHOD: Seventy-eight subjects with good nutrition were considered as the healthy control group. Twenty-eight male subjects who had malnutrition and were older than 70 years were included and randomly divided into the short-term (3 months) intervention group (n = 20) and the long-term (12 months) group (n = 8). They were provided with enteral nutritional suspension (TPF-DM) 500 mL/day or maximum tolerance dose, so as to observe the changes in nutrition-related indexes and intestinal flora after the elderly take enteral nutritional suspension (TPF-DM). RESULTS: (1) For elderly male subjects with malnutrition, their body weight, body mass index, hemoglobin, total protein, and albumin were significantly lower than the control group with favorable nutrition. (2) There were obvious differences in intestinal flora between healthy elderly male subjects and those with malnutrition. After the treatment of enteral nutritional suspension (TPF-DM), intestinal flora of the malnourished elderly subjects showed recovery toward the healthy elderly subjects. The obvious gradient changes of the flora were mainly in the bacteroidetes, firmicutes, and proteobacteria phyla, and the relative abundance of CAG2 clusters in the malnourished group was higher than that in the healthy control group, and the relative abundance decreased after long-term treatment, and the change approached the healthy control group. The relative abundance of CAG3 and CAG6 clusters in the malnourished group was lower than that in the healthy control group, and the relative abundance increased after long-term treatment, and the change approached the healthy control group. CONCLUSION: Malnutrition has obvious impact on intestinal flora of the elderly. Enteral nutritional suspension (TPF-DM) not only prevents the further decline in the state of nutrition but also helps the recovery in intestinal flora of the elderly. Long-term application can produce better effects.
