29102776|a|Building upon the knowledge that a number of important brain circuits undergo significant degeneration in Alzheimer's disease, numerous recent studies suggest that the norepinephrine-ergic system in the brainstem undergoes significant alterations early in the course of both Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome. Massive projections from locus coeruleus neurons to almost the entire brain, extensive innervation of brain capillaries, and widespread distribution of noradrenergic receptors enable the norepinephrine-ergic system to play a crucial role in neural processes, including cognitive function. These anatomical and functional characteristics support the role of the norepinephrine-ergic system as an important target for developing new therapies for cognitive dysfunction. Careful neuropathological examinations using postmortem samples from individuals with Alzheimer's disease have implicated the role of the norepinephrine-ergic system in the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, numerous studies have supported the existence of a strong interaction between norepinephrine-ergic and neuroimmune systems. We explore the interaction between the two systems that could play a role in the disease-modifying effects of norepinephrine in Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome.
