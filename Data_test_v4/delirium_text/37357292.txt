37357292|a|OBJECTIVE: Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) can rapidly cross the blood-brain barrier and provide an alternative energy source for the brain. This study aims to determine 1) whether plasma caprylic acid (C8:0) is associated with risk of incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among baseline cognitively normal (CN) participants, and incident Alzheimer's Disease (AD) among baseline MCI participants; and 2) whether these associations differ by sex, comorbidity of cardiometabolic diseases, apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 alleles, and ADAS-Cog 13. METHODS: Within the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, plasma C8:0 was measured at baseline in 618 AD-free participants aged 55 to 91. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs with incident MCI and AD as dependent variables, separately. RESULTS: The inverse association between circulating C8:0 and risk of incident MCI was of borderline significance. The inverse association between circulating levels of C8:0 and risk of incident MCI was significant among CN participants with >=1 cardiometabolic diseases [OR (95% CI): 0.75 (0.58-0.98) (P=0.03)], those with one copy of APOE epsilon4 alleles [OR (95% CI): 0.43 (0.21-0.89) (P=0.02)], female [OR (95% CI): 0.60 (0.38-0.94) (P=0.02)], and ADAS-Cog 13 above the median [OR (95%CI): 0.69 (0.50-0.97)(P=0.03)] after adjusting for all covariates. CONCLUSION: The inverse associations were present only among subgroups of CN participants, including female individuals, those with one or more cardiometabolic diseases, or one APOE epsilon4 allele, or higher ADAS-Cog 13 scores. If confirmed, this finding will facilitate precision prevention of MCI, in turn, AD among CN older adults.
