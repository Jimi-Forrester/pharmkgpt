36364894|t|Tocotrienol-Rich Fraction and Levodopa Regulate Proteins Involved in Parkinson's Disease-Associated Pathways in Differentiated Neuroblastoma Cells: Insights from Quantitative Proteomic Analysis.
36364894|a|Tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF), a palm oil-derived vitamin E fraction, is reported to possess potent neuroprotective effects. However, the modulation of proteomes in differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (diff-neural cells) by TRF has not yet been reported. This study aims to investigate the proteomic changes implicated by TRF in human neural cells using a label-free liquid-chromatography-double mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) approach. Levodopa, a drug used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), was used as a drug control. The human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were differentiated for six days and treated with TRF or levodopa for 24 h prior to quantitative proteomic analysis. A total of 81 and 57 proteins were differentially expressed in diff-neural cells following treatment with TRF or levodopa, respectively. Among these proteins, 32 similar proteins were detected in both TRF and levodopa-treated neural cells, with 30 of these proteins showing similar expression pattern. The pathway enrichment analysis revealed that most of the proteins regulated by TRF and levodopa are key players in the ubiquitin-proteasome, calcium signalling, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial pathway and axonal transport system. In conclusion, TRF is an essential functional food that affects differential protein expression in human neuronal cells at the cellular and molecular levels.
