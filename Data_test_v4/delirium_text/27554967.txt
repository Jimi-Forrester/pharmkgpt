27554967|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Its pathology often accompanies inflammatory action, and astrocytes play important roles in such procedure. Rela(p65) is one of significant message factors in NF-kappaB pathway which has been reported high expression in astrocyte treated by Abeta. HupA, an alkaloid isolated from Chinese herb Huperzia serrata, has been widely used to treat AD and observations reflected that it improves memory and cognitive capacity of AD patients. To reveal its molecular mechanisms on p65, we cultured astrocytes, built Abeta-induced AD model, treated astrocytes with HupA at different concentrations, assayed cell viability with MTT, and detected p65 expression by immunohistochemistry and PCR. Our results revealed that treatment with 10 muM Abeta1-42 for 24 h induced a significant increase of NF-kappaB in astrocytes; HupA significantly down-regulated p65 expression induced by Abeta in astrocytes. This study infers that HupA can regulate NF-kappaB pathway to treat AD.
