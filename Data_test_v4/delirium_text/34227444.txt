34227444|a|Introduction: Metabolomics focuses on interactions among different metabolites associated with various cellular functions in cells, tissues, and organs. In recent years, metabolomics has emerged as a powerful tool to identify perturbed metabolites, pathways influenced by the environment, for protein conformational diseases (PCDs) and also offers wide clinical application.Area Covered: This review provides a brief overview of recent advances in metabolomics as applied to identify metabolic variations in PCDs, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, prion disease, and cardiac amyloidosis. The 'PubMed' and 'Google Scholar' database search methods have been used to screen the published reports with key search terms: metabolomics, biomarkers, and protein conformational disorders.Expert opinion: Metabolomics is the large-scale study of metabolites and is deemed to overwhelm other omics. It plays a crucial role in finding variations in diseases due to protein conformational changes. However, many PCDs are yet to be identified. Metabolomics is still an emerging field; there is a need for new high-resolution analytical techniques and more studies need to be carried out to generate new information.
