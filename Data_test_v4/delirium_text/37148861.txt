37148861|a|Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are characterized by cognitive function loss and progressive memory impairment. Vitis vinifera, which is consumed in the form of fruits and wines in various countries, contains several dietary stilbenoids that have beneficial effects on neuronal disorders related to cognitive impairment. However, few studies have investigated the hypothalamic effects of vitisin A, a resveratrol tetramer derived from V. vinifera stembark, on cognitive functions and related signaling pathways. In this study, we conducted in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments with multiple biochemical and molecular analyses to investigate its pharmaceutical effects on cognitive functions. Treatment with vitisin A increased cell viability and cell survival under H2O2-exposed conditions in a neuronal SH-SY5 cell line. Ex vivo experiments showed that vitisin A treatment restored the scopolamine-induced disruption of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapse, indicating the restoration of synaptic mechanisms of learning and memory. Consistently, central administration of vitisin A ameliorated scopolamine-induced disruptions of cognitive and memory functions in C57BL/6 mice, as evidenced by Y-maze and passive avoidance tests. Further studies showed that vitisin A upregulates BDNF-CREB signaling in the hippocampus. Together, our findings suggest that vitisin A exhibits neuroprotective effects, at least partially, by upregulating BDNF-CREB signaling and LTP.
