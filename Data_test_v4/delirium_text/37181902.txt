37181902|a|Introduction: Agomelatine is an atypical antidepressant drug enhancing norepinephrine and dopamine liberation; nevertheless, additional mechanisms are considered for the drug's pharmacological action. Since protein glycoxidation plays a crucial role in depression pathogenesis, agomelatine's impact on carbonyl/oxidative stress was the research purpose. Methods: Reactive oxygen species scavenging (hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and nitrogen oxide) and antioxidant capacity (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical and ferrous ion chelating assays) of agomelatine were marked. Agomelatine's antiglycoxidation properties were assayed in sugars (glucose, fructose, and galactose) and aldehydes- (glyoxal and methylglyoxal) glycated bovine serum albumin (BSA). Aminoguanidine and alpha-lipoic acid were used as standard glycation/oxidation inhibitors. Results: Agomelatine did not show meaningful scavenging/antioxidant capacity vs. standards. Sugars/aldehydes increased glycation ( kynurenine,  N-formylkynurenine,  dityrosine,  advanced glycation end products, and  beta-amyloid) and oxidation ( protein carbonyls and  advanced oxidation protein products) parameters in addition to BSA. Standards restored BSA baselines of glycation and oxidation markers, unlike agomelatine which sometimes even intensifies glycation above BSA + glycators levels. Molecular docking analysis of agomelatine in BSA demonstrated its very weak binding affinity. Discussion: Agomelatine's very low affinity to the BSA could proclaim non-specific bonding and simplify attachment of glycation factors. Thereby, the drug may stimulate brain adaptation to carbonyl/oxidative stress as the systematic review indicates. Moreover, the drug's active metabolites could exert an antiglycoxidative effect.
