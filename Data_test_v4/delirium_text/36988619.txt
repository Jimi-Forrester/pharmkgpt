36988619|t|The Impact of Episodes of Lucidity on People Living With Dementia and Their Caregivers: A Case Report.
36988619|a|People living with dementia (PLWD) may experience the episodes of lucidity (ELs), defined as a sudden return of abilities presumed to have been lost and presenting as meaningful communication and connection. Early research on ELs in advanced disease stages suggests these are predominantly positive events. This case report draws from 1 outlier case from a descriptive qualitative study on caregivers of PLWDs' experiences with ELs. The caregiver-reported events perceived as an EL being accompanied with unexpected self-awareness, leading to a negative emotional reaction and feelings of loss. This case report contributes insights to the current understandings of ELs as exclusively relevant in advanced stages of dementia, as similar events may present in earlier disease stages, and may be associated with the negative emotional experiences among PLWD. Future research is needed to consider the ethical implications surrounding ELs and to support the caregivers in anticipating and responding to ELs.
