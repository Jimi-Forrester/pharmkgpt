34613870|t|Safety of Japanese encephalitis vaccines.
34613870|a|Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an endemic disease dominantly in the Asia-Pacific region with mortality rate varying between 3% and 30%. Long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae developed in 30-50% of the survivors. There is no available antiviral therapy for JE. JE vaccines play a major role in preventing this devastating disease. The incidence of JE declined over years and the age distribution shifted toward adults in countries where JE immunization program exists. Mouse brain-JE vaccine is currently replaced by inactivated Vero cell-derived vaccine and live-attenuated vaccine using SA14-14-2 strain, and live chimeric JE vaccines. These three types of JE vaccines are associated with favorable efficacy and safety profiles. Common adverse reactions include injection site reactions and fever, and severe adverse reactions are rare.
