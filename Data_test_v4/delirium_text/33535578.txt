33535578|t|Targeting Diet and Exercise for Neuroprotection and Neurorecovery in Glaucoma.
33535578|a|Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. In glaucoma, a progressive dysfunction and death of retinal ganglion cells occurs, eliminating transfer of visual information to the brain. Currently, the only available therapies target the lowering of intraocular pressure, but many patients continue to lose vision. Emerging pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggests that metabolic deficiencies and defects may play an important role in glaucoma pathophysiology. While pre-clinical studies in animal models have begun to mechanistically uncover these metabolic changes, some existing clinical evidence already points to potential benefits in maintaining metabolic fitness. Modifying diet and exercise can be implemented by patients as an adjunct to intraocular pressure lowering, which may be of therapeutic benefit to retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma.
