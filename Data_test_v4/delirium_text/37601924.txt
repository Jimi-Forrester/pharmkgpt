37601924|a|Background and Aims: Preoperative cognitive function screening can help identify high-risk patients, but resource-intensive testing limits its widespread use. A novel self-administered tablet computer-based Processing Speed Test (PST) was used to assess cognitive "executive" function in non-cardiac surgery patients, but the relationship between preoperative test scores and postoperative outcomes is unclear. The primary outcome was a composite of 30-day readmission/death. The secondary outcome was a collapsed composite of discharge to a long-term care facility/death. Exploratory outcomes were 1) time to discharge alive, 2) 1-year mortality and 3) a collapsed composite of postoperative complications. Methods: This retrospective study, after approval, was conducted in elective non-cardiac surgery patients >=65 years old. We assessed the relationship between processing speed test scores and primary/secondary outcomes using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounding variables. Results: Overall 1568 patients completed the PST, and the mean +- standard deviation test score was 33 +- 10. The higher PST score is associated with better executive function. A 10-unit increase in the test score was associated with an estimated 19% lower 30-day readmission/death odds, with an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.81 (0.68, 0.96) (P = 0.015). Similarly, 10-unit increase in test score was associated with an estimated 26% lower odds of long-term care need/death, with OR (95% CI) of 0.74 (0.61, 0.91) (P = 0.004). We also found statistically significant associations between the test scores and time to discharge alive and to 1-year mortality, however, not with a composite of postoperative complications. Conclusion: Elderly non-cardiac surgery patients with better PST scores were less likely to be readmitted, need long-term care after discharge or die within 30 days. Preoperative assessment of cognitive function using a simple self-administered test is feasible and may guide perioperative care.
