11324866|a|Previous research has found that patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) show lower levels of false recognition of semantic associates than do healthy older adults. To investigate whether this finding is attributable to semantic impairments in patients with AD, the authors examined false recognition of perceptually related novel objects with little semantic content in patients with AD and healthy older adults. By using corrected recognition scores to control for unrelated false alarms, it was found that patients with AD showed lower levels of both true and false recognition of novel objects than did older adults. These results suggest that the previous difference in false recognition of semantic associates observed between patients with AD and older adults is not entirely attributable to semantic memory deficits in patients with AD but may also involve poorly developed gist information in these patients.
