21951957|a|The present paper reports on a 68-year-old man with a 10-year history of parkinsonism who developed hallucinations and delusions after admission to an intensive care unit for the treatment of organophosphate intoxication. His initial diagnosis was delirium. On the basis of brain computed tomography findings and clinical symptoms, we diagnosed drug-induced psychosis in parkinsonism with multiple cysts in the bilateral striata.
