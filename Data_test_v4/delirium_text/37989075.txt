37989075|t|IF-AIP: A machine learning method for the identification of anti-inflammatory peptides using multi-feature fusion strategy.
37989075|a|BACKGROUND: The most commonly used therapy currently for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases is nonspecific anti-inflammatory drugs, which have various hazardous side effects. Recently, some anti-inflammatory peptides (AIPs) have been found to be a substitute therapy for inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's. Therefore, the identification of these AIPs is an emerging topic that is equally important. METHODS: In this work, we have proposed an identification model for AIPs using a voting classifier. We used eight different feature descriptors and five conventional machine-learning classifiers. The eight feature encodings were concatenated to get a hybrid feature set. The five baseline models trained on the hybrid feature set were integrated via a voting classifier. Finally, a feature selection algorithm was used to select the optimal feature set for the construction of our final model, named IF-AIP. RESULTS: We tested the proposed model on two independent datasets. On independent data 1, the IF-AIP model shows an improvement of 3%-5.6% in terms of accuracies and 6.7%-10.8% in terms of MCC compared to the existing methods. On the independent dataset 2, our model IF-AIP shows an overall improvement of 2.9%-5.7% in terms of accuracy and 8.3%-8.6% in terms of MCC score compared to the existing methods. A comparative performance analysis was conducted between the proposed model and existing methods using a set of 24 novel peptide sequences. Notably, the IF-AIP method exhibited exceptional accuracy, correctly identifying all 24 peptides as AIPs.
