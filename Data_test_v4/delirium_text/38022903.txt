38022903|t|Evaluation of Glycogen Synthase Kinase Pathway for Assessing the Antidepressant-like Effect of Glucosamine as a Radioprotector in Rats: Behavioral and Biochemical Studies.
38022903|a|Radiotherapy is a very important tool in the treatment of cancer; nevertheless, its side effects are a hindrance to its use. The present study is designed to evaluate glucosamine effects against radiation-induced brain oxidative stress and depression-like effect in rats. Four groups of female Wister rats were used as control, irradiated (4 x 2 Gy), glucosamine (1 g/kg P.O), and glucosamine + irradiated group. The behavioral responses are estimated. The brain hippocampi of the rats are separated to evaluate oxidative stress biochemical parameters and glycogen synthase kinase pathway in addition to the biogenic amines. Irradiation exposure led to disturbances in the behavioral assessments (forced swimming test, light-dark box, and open field test) and a significant decrease in brain GSH, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), and phosphorylated protein kinase-B (p-AKT) levels. Additionally, MDA and ROS levels increased significantly post-irradiation along with the phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase (p-GSK3). Glucosamine administration before irradiation caused improvement in the behavioral valuations and the biochemical parameters in the brain as well. Glucosamine might be used as a radioprotector to improve brain function and as an antidepressant drug. It could be promising as a future therapy in managing depression occurring during radiotherapy.
