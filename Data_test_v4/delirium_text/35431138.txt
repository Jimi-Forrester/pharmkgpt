35431138|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline. Synaptic impairment is one of the first events to occur in the progression of this disease. Synaptic plasticity and cellular association of various plastic events have been shown to be affected in AD models. Nogo-A, a well-known axonal growth inhibitor with a recently discovered role as a plasticity suppressor, and its main receptor Nogo-66 receptor 1 (NGR1) have been found to be overexpressed in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's patients. However, the role of Nogo-A and its receptor in the pathology of AD is still widely unknown. In this work we set out to investigate whether Nogo-A is working as a plasticity suppressor in AD. Our results show that inhibition of the Nogo-A pathway via the Nogo-R antibody in an Alzheimer's mouse model, APP/PS1, leads to the restoration of both synaptic plasticity and associativity in a protein synthesis and NMDR-dependent manner. We also show that inhibition of the p75NTR pathway, which is strongly associated with NGR1, restores synaptic plasticity as well. Mechanistically, we propose that the restoration of synaptic plasticity in APP/PS1 via inhibition of the Nogo-A pathway is due to the modulation of the RhoA-ROCK2 pathway and increase in plasticity related proteins. Our study identifies Nogo-A as a plasticity suppressor in AD models hence targeting Nogo-A could be a promising strategy to understanding AD pathology.
