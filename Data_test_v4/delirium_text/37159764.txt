37159764|t|Rare Presentations of Sarcoidosis: A Case Series.
37159764|a|Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown etiology with multi-system affection. It typically involves the skin, eyes, hilar lymph nodes, and pulmonary parenchyma. However, as any organ system could be involved, one has to be aware of its atypical manifestations. We present three uncommon manifestations of the disease. Our first case presented with fever, arthralgias, and right hilar lymphadenopathy with a history of tuberculosis in the past. He was treated for tuberculosis but had a relapse of symptoms three months after completion of treatment. The second patient presented with a headache for two months. On evaluation, cerebrospinal fluid examination showed evidence of aseptic meningitis, while an MRI of the brain demonstrated enhancement of the basal meninges. The third patient was admitted with a mass on the left side of the neck for one year. On evaluation, he was found to have left cervical lymphadenopathy, with its biopsy showing non-caseating epitheloid granuloma. Immunofluorescence did not show evidence of leukemia or lymphoma. All the patients had negative tuberculin skin tests and elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels supporting the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. They were treated with steroids with complete resolution of symptoms and no recurrence at follow-up. Sarcoidosis is an underdiagnosed entity in India. Thus, awareness of the atypical clinical features could lead to early recognition of the disease and its treatment.
