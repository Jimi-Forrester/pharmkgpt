35958297|t|The Analysis of SNPs' Function in miR-21 and miR146a/b in Multiple Sclerosis and Active Lesions: An In Silico Study.
35958297|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous disorder caused by several factors. Studies have recently shown that non-coding RNA such as miRNA could participate in MS initiation, progression, and active lesion. This study aims to theoretically analyze the potential impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on mir-21 and mir-146a/b, which has been previously demonstrated as MS microRNA signature. To fulfill this purpose, the SNPs were investigated for functionality through several online tools, including miRNA-SNP, SNP2-TFBS, RBP-Var, and RNAfold. Furthermore, SNPs of miR-21 and miR-146a/b that exist in pre-miRNA, mature miRNA, and promoter area were extracted; moreover, miRNA and RNA-binding protein interactions were analyzed. This article presented a list of validated SNPs that could affect the expression or function of miR-21 and miR-146a/b for the future practical study of MS and active lesions.
