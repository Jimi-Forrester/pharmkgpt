39470434|t|Biology, function and structure of the calcium homeostasis modulator family.
39470434|a|Calcium homeostasis modulators (CALHMs) are the most recently discovered members of the large-pore channel family. They mediate the conductance of ions and larger molecules, such as ATP, and play critical roles in pathways related to Alzheimer's disease, neuroinflammation, neuromodulation, taste perception and innate immune responses. Since the inaugural report on CALHM1 in 2008, significant breakthroughs have revealed their biological roles, ion and ATP channel functions, and structures, positioning the field for further advancements. In this review, we discuss the overall progress and recent developments in understanding the biological roles, functions and molecular structures of CALHM proteins.
