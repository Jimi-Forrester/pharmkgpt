36740800|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and Huntington's disease (HD), are characterized by cognitive and motor dysfunctions and neurodegeneration. These diseases become more severe over time and cannot be cured currently. Until now, most treatments for these diseases are only used to relieve the symptoms. Taxifolin (TAX), 3, 5, 7, 3, 4-pentahydroxy flavanone, also named dihydroquercetin, is a compound derived primarily from Douglas fir and Larix gemelini. TAX has been confirmed to present various pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, anti-virus and regulation of oxidative stress effects. In central nervous system, TAX is demonstrated to inhibit Abeta fibril formation, protect neurons and improve cerebral blood flow, cognitive ability and dyskinesia. At present, TAX is only applied as a health additive in clinical practice. This review aimed to summarize the application of TAX in neurodegenerative diseases and the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms, such as suppressing inflammation, attenuating oxidative stress, preventing Abeta protein formation, maintaining dopamine levels and thus reducing neuronal loss.
