33615665|a|Stroke is a major cause of death and long-term disability in the adult. Neuronal apoptosis plays an essential role in the pathophysiology of ischemic brain damage and impaired functional recovery after stroke. The tumor suppressor protein p53 regulates key cellular processes, including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence, and apoptosis. Under cellular stress conditions, p53 undergoes post-translational modifications, which control protein localization, stability, and proapoptotic activity. After stroke, p53 rapidly accumulates in the ischemic brain, where it activates neuronal apoptosis through both transcriptional-dependent and -independent programs. Over the last years, subcellular localization of p53 has emerged as an important regulator of ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis. Upon an ischemic insult, p53 rapidly translocates to the mitochondria and interacts with B-cell lymphoma-2 family proteins, which activate the mitochondrial apoptotic program, with higher efficacy than through its activity as a transcription factor. Moreover, the identification of a human single nucleotide polymorphism at codon 72 of the Tp53 gene that controls p53 mitochondrial localization and cell susceptibility to apoptosis supports the important role of the p53 mitochondrial program in neuronal survival and functional recovery after stroke. In this article, we review the relevance of mitochondrial and nuclear localization of p53 on neuronal susceptibility to cerebral ischemia and its impact on functional outcome of stroke patients.
