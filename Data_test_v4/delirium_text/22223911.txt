22223911|a|Administering anaesthesia to a patient with chronic schizophrenia is a challenge due to the increased risk of various perioperative complications. Neuroleptic agents are highly effective drugs used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, but are rarely associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Here, we describe the successful anaesthetic management of a patient of chronic schizophrenia with past history of NMS who presented in emergency with active bleeding per rectum and haemoglobin of 3 gm%.
