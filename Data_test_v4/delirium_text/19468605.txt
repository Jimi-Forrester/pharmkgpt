19468605|a|BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The main goal of palliative care is the control of pain and other symptoms in patients with chronic diseases without possibility of cure, especially advanced cancer. About 75% of patients with advanced cancer experience severe pain, which interferes with quality of life and, according to the WHO, it is considered a worldwide medical emergency. This study evaluated the profile of oncology patients enrolled in the Chronic Pain Treatment and Palliative Care Program of the HUCFF/FM/UFRJ, focusing on the role of the anesthesiologist, medications used, humanization of the treatment, and improvement in patient's quality of life. METHODS: The 2003-oncology patients' charts were analyzed retrospectively. Several parameters were compared: age, race, gender, preexisting conditions organ the cancer originated from, type of pain and other symptoms, medications, hospital routine, and end of treatment. RESULTS: The types of pain included nociceptive, neuropathic, and incidental, which were evaluated using the unidimensional faces pain rating scale. In the first week, patients were treated with home-based patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with oral methadone. After this period, the patient returned to the clinic to calculate the regular dose of methadone. Other opioids used included codeine, tramadol, morphine, and oxycodone. Besides pain, patients experienced: constipation, vomiting, delirium, sleep disturbances, and dyspnea. Neuroleptics, corticosteroids, and laxatives were also used as adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patient controlled analgesia with methadone is safe and effective, since there were no significant side effects. The clinical and pharmacological knowledge of the anesthesiologist in the multidisciplinary team provided for better patient care, relief of symptoms, and humanization of the final stages of life.
