36989942|a|Semaglutide, one of the most potent glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 analogs, has widely been used to treat type II diabetes mellitus and obesity. Recent studies have shown that semaglutide also works on the brain, suggesting its potential utility for various diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. This study aimed to develop a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of semaglutide in both plasma and brain to characterize the pharmacokinetics and brain distribution in rats. Semaglutide was extracted by simple protein precipitation with methanol from plasma and by solid phase extraction from brain tissue. Liraglutide was used as an internal standard. Gradient elution profiles with mobile phases comprising 0.1 % formic acid in water and acetonitrile were used for chromatographic separation. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of the LC-MS/MS assay was 0.5 ng/mL for both rat plasma and brain. Intra- and inter-day accuracy ranged 89.20-109.50 % in the plasma and 92.00-105.00 % in the brain. Precision was within 8.92 % in the plasma and 7.94 % in the brain. Sprague-Dawley rats were given semaglutide by intravenous (IV, 0.02 mg/kg) and subcutaneous (SC, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) injection. Plasma concentrations of semaglutide showed a multi-exponential decline with an average half-life of 7.22-9.26 hr in rats. The subcutaneous bioavailability of semaglutide was 76.65-82.85 %. The brain tissue to plasma partition coefficient (Kp) value of semaglutide was estimated as <0.01. Among the different regions of the brain, semaglutide concentrations were significantly higher in the hypothalamus. The analytical method and pharmacokinetic information may be helpful toward a better understanding of the effect of semaglutide in the brain and further development of GLP-1 analogs for various brain diseases.
