37111207|a|Phytochemicals are natural compounds found in food ingredients with a variety of health-promoting properties. Phytochemicals improve host health through their direct systematic absorption into the circulation and modulation of the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota increases the bioactivity of phytochemicals and is a symbiotic partner whose composition and/or diversity is altered by phytochemicals and affects host health. In this review, the interactions of phytochemicals with the gut microbiota and their impact on human diseases are reviewed. We describe the role of intestinal microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, amino acid derivatives, and vitamins, from a therapeutic perspective. Next, phytochemical metabolites produced by the gut microbiota and the therapeutic effect of some selected metabolites are reviewed. Many phytochemicals are degraded by enzymes unique to the gut microbiota and act as signaling molecules in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and metabolic pathways. Phytochemicals can ameliorate diseases by altering the composition and/or diversity of the gut microbiota, and they increase the abundance of some gut microbiota that produce beneficial substances. We also discuss the importance of investigating the interactions between phytochemicals and gut microbiota in controlled human studies.
