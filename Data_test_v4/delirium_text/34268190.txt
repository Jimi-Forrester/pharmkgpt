34268190|t|Determining Association Between Cognitive Function and Oral Health Status among Rural Community Dwelling Geriatrics.
34268190|a|OBJECTIVE: Numerous prospective studies worldwide investigated the association between oral health status and dementia or cognitive decline. No clear agreement has emerged on the association. This study aimed to determine the association of cognitive function and oral health status among community dwelling geriatrics in rural South India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among community dwelling geriatrics in rural South India by recruiting 211 individuals aged above 60 years. Their cognitive function was assessed using pre-validated community screening instrument for dementia (CSI-D) which has informant and cognitive scale. The data on cognitive function was collected by community health workers in electronic version (Web app). Their oral health status was assessed by World Health Organization (WHO) oral health assessment form in electronic version (Web app). RESULTS: From the logistic regression analysis, it was observed that cognitive impairment showed an association with 1.6- and 1.9-times risk for root caries and a greater number of missing teeth (P <= 0.05). No association of other oral health parameters such as gingivitis, periodontitis, dental erosion, and dental trauma with cognitive impairment exhibited. CONCLUSION: From the results, it can be concluded that cognitive impairment has an association with root caries and number of missing teeth which increases the risk for the same and vice versa.
