34041132|a|Elderly people account for more than 9% of the global population, and more than 6% of the Indian population. Covid-19 has badly affected the older population, identification of risk factors for severe disease and early intervention results in reduced mortality. Older adults may have a varied spectrum of presentation which ranges from mild to severe disease. Milder diseases are more in older adults without prior comorbidities whereas severity increases with increase in number of illness. Till date there is no definitive treatment and vaccines are also at different stages of trial only preventive methods and early detection of cases are important tools for fighting this pandemic. Dedicated centre's for elder care as well as trained geriatricians are very few in India. Prevention should be the most important strategy for older adults. Follow social distancing and maintain a distance of 1 meter from others even if you are healthy. Wash hands repeatedly with soap and water or use hand sanitizer and generous use of masks. Older adults should be encouraged to take their regular medication and the baseline disease should be under controlled. Frequent teleconsultation from the primary physician should be done repeatedly to identify the symptoms and also control of baseline disease. Considering Covid-19 increased mortality and severity in the older population we are providing practical suggestions for family physicians while managing elderly Covid patients.
