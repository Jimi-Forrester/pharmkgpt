30880993|a|The neurodevelopment period is susceptible to alterations by genetic and environmental factors, such as the exposure to organophosphates (OP). The OP is neurotoxic and has been associated with neurological diseases pathophysiology. The OP temephos is widely used against Aedes aegypti in Brazil's public health programs. PURPOSE: To evaluate behavioral effects of prenatal exposition to temephos in Wistar rats. METHODS: First, we divided pregnant females into groups: those who received temephos diluted in distilled water by gavage between gestational days 6-13 and those who received only distilled water in the same period and volume. Then, we divided pups according to sex and exposure, and we made the behavioral tests on postnatal day 30. RESULTS: Prenatal exposure to temephos caused hyperactivity, stereotyped behavior, and social impairment in animals. CONCLUSION: These results are similar to the altered behavior presented in some neurobiological diseases models, like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorders, and this study may bring a red alert to the large use of temephos in Brazil, due to the damage caused by its exposure.
