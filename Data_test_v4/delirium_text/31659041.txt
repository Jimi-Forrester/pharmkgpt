31659041|a|The assembly of small disordered proteins into highly ordered amyloid fibrils in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients is closely associated with dementia and neurodegeneration. Understanding the process of amyloid formation is thus crucial in the development of effective treatments for these devastating neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, a tiny, highly conserved and disordered protein called SERF was discovered to modify amyloid formation in Caenorhabditis elegans and humans. Here, we use kinetics measurements and native ion mobility-mass spectrometry to show that SERF mainly affects the rate of primary nucleation in amyloid formation for the disease-related proteins Abeta40 and alpha-synuclein. SERF's high degree of plasticity enables it to bind various conformations of monomeric Abeta40 and alpha-synuclein to form structurally diverse, fuzzy complexes. This structural diversity persists into early stages of amyloid formation. Our results suggest that amyloid nucleation is considerably more complex than age-related conversion of Abeta40 and alpha-synuclein into single amyloid-prone conformations.
