8705294|a|Several investigations have implicated the involvement of metals in neuropathologies. In particular, the disruption of iron metabolism and iron transport molecules have been demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have identified a novel pathway of iron uptake into mammalian cells involving melanotransferrin, or p97, which is independent of the transferrin receptor. Here we investigated whether there is a possible link between this molecule and the pathology of AD. The distributions of melanotransferrin, transferrin and the transferrin receptor were studied immunohistochemically in brain tissues from AD cases. In brain tissues from AD, melanotransferrin and the transferrin receptor were highly localized to capillary endothelium, while transferrin itself was mainly localized to glial cells. In brain tissue derived from AD patients, melanotransferrin was additionally detected in a subset of reactive microglia associated with senile plaques. Our demonstration that melanotransferrin mediates iron uptake through a pathway independent of the transferrin receptor indicates that this mechanism may have a role in AD.
