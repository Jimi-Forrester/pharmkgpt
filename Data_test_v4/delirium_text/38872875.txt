38872875|t|Atypical case of Erdheim-Chester Disease involving bilateral orbits.
38872875|a|Purpose: We report a patient who initially visited the ophthalmology clinic for a vision loss diagnosed with Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD). Observations: ECD is a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by multisystemic organ involvement and poor prognosis. Our patient had complete vision loss due to prominent orbital involvement before any systemic symptoms appeared. This case demonstrates variable clinical manifestations of ECD. Conclusions and importance: Painless bilateral proptosis with poor response to steroid treatment should prompt consideration for ECD and systemic evaluation. In addition, in the absence of typical clinical manifestations, a thorough evaluation of the biopsy can be crucial for an accurate diagnosis.
