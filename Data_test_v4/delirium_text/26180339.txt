26180339|a|[Purpose] The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between visual perceptual function and manual dexterity in community-dwelling older adults. [Subjects and Methods] Fifty-eight participants were recruited by convenience sampling from local rehabilitation centers. This was a cross-sectional study that used the following four clinical tools: the Mini-Mental State Examination, 9 Hole Pegboard, Box and Block Test, and Motor-free Visual Perception Test, Third Edition. [Results] The Motor-free Visual Perception Test, Third Edition and Mini-Mental State Examination correlated significantly and positively with Box and Block Test, and did correlate significantly and negatively with 9 Hole Pegboard. [Conclusion] The results of this study suggest that visual perceptual impairment and cognitive dysfunction may influence manual dexterity in older adults, and rehabilitation of upper extremity function, along with visual perception and cognitive training, may be beneficial for this population.
