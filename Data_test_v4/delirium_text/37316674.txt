37316674|t|Improving Blood Monocyte Energy Metabolism Enhances Its Ability to Phagocytose Amyloid-beta and Prevents Alzheimer's Disease-Type Pathology and Cognitive Deficits.
37316674|a|Deficiencies in the clearance of peripheral amyloid beta (Abeta) play a crucial role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that the ability of blood monocytes to phagocytose Abeta is decreased in AD. However, the exact mechanism of Abeta clearance dysfunction in AD monocytes remains unclear. In the present study, we found that blood monocytes in AD mice exhibited decreases in energy metabolism, which was accompanied by cellular senescence, a senescence-associated secretory phenotype, and dysfunctional phagocytosis of Abeta. Improving energy metabolism rejuvenated monocytes and enhanced their ability to phagocytose Abeta in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, enhancing blood monocyte Abeta phagocytosis by improving energy metabolism alleviated brain Abeta deposition and neuroinflammation and eventually improved cognitive function in AD mice. This study reveals a new mechanism of impaired Abeta phagocytosis in monocytes and provides evidence that restoring their energy metabolism may be a novel therapeutic strategy for AD.
