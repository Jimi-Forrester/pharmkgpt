30967340|t|Longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid biomarker trajectories along the Alzheimer's disease continuum in the BIOMARKAPD study.
30967340|a|INTRODUCTION: Within-person trajectories of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not well defined. METHODS: We included 467 subjects from the BIOMARKAPD study with at least two serial CSF samples. Diagnoses were subjective cognitive decline (n = 75), mild cognitive impairment (n = 128), and AD dementia (n = 110), and a group of cognitively unimpaired subjects (n = 154) were also included. We measured baseline and follow-up CSF levels of total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), YKL-40, and neurofilament light (NfL). Median CSF sampling interval was 2.1 years. RESULTS: CSF levels of t-tau, p-tau, NfL, and YKL-40 were 2% higher per each year of baseline age in controls (P <.001). In AD, t-tau levels were 1% lower (P <.001) and p-tau levels did not change per each year of baseline age. Longitudinally, only NfL (P <.001) and YKL-40 (P <.02) increased during the study period. DISCUSSION: All four CSF biomarkers increase with age, but this effect deviates in AD for t-tau and p-tau.
