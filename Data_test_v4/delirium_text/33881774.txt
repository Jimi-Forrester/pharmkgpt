33881774|a|Significant sleep disturbance can occur following major abdominal surgery. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of earplugs and eye masks in improving sleep quality and patient satisfaction, reducing nursing demands and in the incidence of delirium in patients after major abdominal surgery. We conducted a randomised controlled trial in 100 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. We randomly allocated participants to sleep with or without earplugs and eye masks on postoperative days 1-3. The primary outcome measure was sleep quality as measured by the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were patient satisfaction, frequency of nursing demand and incidence of delirium measured by the Neelon and Champagne Confusion Scale. Median (IQR [range]) sleep scores were 64 (38-74 [0-100] and 60 (44-82 [18-100]) for the control and intervention groups, respectively (p = 0.310). Age and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores were found to be significant factors affecting sleep quality. There were no differences in patient satisfaction, reduction in frequency of nursing demands or incidence of delirium on postoperative days 1-3 after major abdominal surgery. The compliance rate in the intervention group was 60-65%. This study has demonstrated that the use of earplugs and eye masks did not contribute to improvements in sleep quality. Of note, sleep quality was moderate, with higher age and worse baseline sleep quality contributing to worse sleep scores. More studies are needed to investigate interventions to improve sleep quality after major abdominal surgery.
