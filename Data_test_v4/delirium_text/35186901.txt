35186901|a|The delivery of therapeutic molecules to the brain remains an unsolved problem to the researchers due to the existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which halts the entry of unwanted substances to the brain. Central nervous system (CNS) disorders, mainly Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, brain tumors, and stroke, are highly prevalent globally and are a growing concern for researchers due to restricting the delivery of pharmaceutical drugs to the brain. So effective treatment modalities are essential to combat the growing epidemic of CNS diseases. Recently, the growing attention in the field of nanotechnology has gained the faith of researchers for the delivery of therapeutics to the brain by targeting them to the specific target site. Polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) emerge out to be an instrumental approach in drug targeting to the brain by overcoming the physiological barrier, biomedical barrier, and BBB. Preclinical discovery has shown the tremendous potential and versatility of PNPs in encapsulating several drugs and their targeting to the deepest regions of the brain, thus improving therapeutic intervention of CNS disorders. The current review will summarize advances in the development of PNPs for targeting therapeutics to the brain and the functional and molecular effects obtained in the preclinical model of most common CNS diseases. The advancement of PNPs in clinical practice and their prospect in brain targeting will also be discussed briefly.
