18288287|a|Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of new blindness in the western world and is becoming more of a socio-medical problem as the proportion of the aged population increases. There are multiple efforts underway to better understand this disease process. AMD involves the abnormal retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), drusen formation, photoreceptor atrophy, and choroidal neovascularization. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) play an important role in lipid degeneration, immune regulation, regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs), as well as regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These molecules have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of AMD. In addition, PPAR gamma is expressed in RPE, an essential cell in photoreceptor regeneration and vision maintenance. This review summarizes the interactions between PPAR, AMD-related molecules, and AMD-related disease processes.
