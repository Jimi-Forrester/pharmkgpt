36343083|a|Development of delirium during hospitalization impairs the activities of daily living in elderly hospitalized patients. In clinical practice, early mobilization from bed is recommended to reduce delirium incidence and hospitalization stay. However, the effects of early mobilization on elderly inpatients with delirium have not been established yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between early mobilization and the duration of delirium in elderly inpatients with delirium. This retrospective cohort pilot study examined 45 participants (23 males, 22 females; mean age: 84.5 +- 6.6 years), who developed delirium during hospitalization. Of the participants, 28 were surgically treated and 17 were non-surgically treated. We classified early or delayed mobilization based on the median number of days until the start of mobilization and compared after propensity score matching to adjust for baseline characteristics. Additionally, we examined the correlation between the number of days until the start of mobilization and the duration of delirium. The duration of delirium was significantly shorter in the early mobilization group, particularly in terms of sitting on the bed and wheelchair use than that in the delayed mobilization group {median: 4.0 [interquartile range (IQR): 2.0-6.0] vs 8.0 [IQR: 7.0-14.5] days, P = .013; median: 3.0 [IQR: 2.0-5.5] vs 11.0 [IQR: 7.5-14.5] days, P = .004, respectively}. Moreover, the duration of delirium significantly positively moderate correlated with the time until the start of sitting on the bed and wheelchair use (Spearman r = 0.527; P = .012, Spearman r = 0.630; P = .002, respectively). The results of this study suggest that early mobilization from sitting on the bed or wheelchair use after hospitalization or surgery may shorten the duration of delirium. Because the sample size of this pilot study is small, careful interpretation is needed, and further research is warranted.
