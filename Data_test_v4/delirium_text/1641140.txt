1641140|t|A case-control study of Alzheimer's disease in China.
1641140|a|We conducted a case-control study to assess possible factors associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) with 70 clinically diagnosed AD patients and 140 age- and sex-matched nondemented neighborhood controls in China. Factors significantly associated with AD cases were family history of dementia in first-degree relatives, family history of psychotic disorders in first-degree relatives, and left-handedness/ambidexterity. A history of arthritis showed a significantly negative association with AD. Neither a family history for Down's syndrome, history of head trauma, nor other conditions that might support immune or viral hypotheses in AD were significantly associated with AD cases. These data support the role of familial/genetic factors in AD.
