38249577|a|Fatty acid oxidation (FAO), primarily known as beta-oxidation, plays a crucial role in breaking down fatty acids within mitochondria and peroxisomes to produce cellular energy and preventing metabolic dysfunction. Myeloid cells, including macrophages, microglia, and monocytes, rely on FAO to perform essential cellular functions and uphold tissue homeostasis. As individuals age, these cells show signs of inflammaging, a condition that includes a chronic onset of low-grade inflammation and a decline in metabolic function. These lead to changes in fatty acid metabolism and a decline in FAO pathways. Recent studies have shed light on metabolic shifts occurring in macrophages and monocytes during aging, correlating with an altered tissue environment and the onset of inflammaging. This review aims to provide insights into the connection of inflammatory pathways and altered FAO in macrophages and monocytes from older organisms. We describe a model in which there is an extended activation of receptor for advanced glycation end products, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and the nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome within macrophages and monocytes. This leads to an increased level of glycolysis, and also promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine production and signaling. As a result, FAO-related enzymes such as 5' AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha are reduced, adding to the escalation of inflammation, accumulation of lipids, and heightened cellular stress. We examine the existing body of literature focused on changes in FAO signaling within macrophages and monocytes and their contribution to the process of inflammaging.
