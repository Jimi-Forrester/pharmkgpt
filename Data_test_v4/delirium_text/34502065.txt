34502065|t|Role of the Novel Peptide Phoenixin in Stress Response and Possible Interactions with Nesfatin-1.
34502065|a|The novel peptide phoenixin was shown to be involved in several physiological processes ranging from reproduction to food intake. Interest in this protein has steadily increased over the last few years and its known implications have become much broader, playing a role in glucose homeostasis, anxiety, nociception, and pruritus. Phoenixin is expressed in a multitude of organs such as the small intestine, pancreas, and in the hypothalamus, as well as several other brain nuclei influencing numerous physiological functions. Its highly conserved amino-acid sequence amongst species leads to the assumption, that phoenixin might be involved in essential physiological functions. Its co-expression and opposing functionality to the extensively studied peptide nesfatin-1 has given rise to the idea of a possible counterbalancing role. Several recent publications focused on phoenixin's role in stress reactions, namely restraint stress and lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation response, in which also nesfatin-1 is known to be altered. This review provides an overview on the phoenixins and nesfatin-1 properties and putative effects, and especially highlights the recent developments on their role and interaction in the response to response.
