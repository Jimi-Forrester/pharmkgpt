36548335|a|CRISPR-Cas9-mediated leptin (Lep) knockout (KO) mice exhibited prominent phenotypes for constipation, even though they were not compared with other model animals. This study compared the stool excretion, gastrointestinal motility, histological structure, mucin secretion, and enteric nerve function in Lep KO and high fat diet (HFD)-treated mice to determine if there were differences in their phenotypes for constipation. Most obesity phenotypes, including fat weight, adipocyte size, expression of lipolytic proteins (HSL, perilipin, and ATGL), and glucose concentrations, were detected similarly in the Lep KO and HFD-treated mice. They showed a similar decrease in the excretion parameters, including the stool number, weight, and water content, while the same pattern was detected in the gastrointestinal motility and intestinal length. A similar decrease in the mucosal layer thickness, muscle thickness, ability for mucin secretion, and expression of water channel (aquaporin 3 and 8) genes was detected in the mid-colon of the Lep KO and HFD-treated mice, but the alteration rate in some levels was greater in the HFD-treated group than the Lep KO mice. On the other hand, the levels of c-kit, nNOS, NSE, and PGP9.5 expression for the enteric neurons and intestitial cells of Cajal (ICC) were remarkably lower in the mid-colon of the HFD-treated mice than in the Lep KO mice, but the level of most proteins in both groups remained lower than those in the control group. A similar alteration pattern in the expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) and serotonin receptors was detected in the Lep KO and HFD-treated mice. These results suggest that most phenotypes for obesity-induced constipation were similarly detected in the Lep KO and HFD-treated mice, but there was a difference in the regulatory function of the enteric nervous system (ENS).
