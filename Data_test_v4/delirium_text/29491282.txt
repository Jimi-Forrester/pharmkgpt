29491282|t|Manifestation of Central Diabetes Insipidus in a Patient with Thyroid Storm.
29491282|a|We herein report a case of central diabetes insipidus complicated with thyroid storm. A middle-aged woman who was receiving treatment for Graves' disease suddenly complained of polydipsia, polyuria and general fatigue. Laboratory tests showed hyperthyroidism, hypernatremia, hypoosmolar urine and a decreased plasma vasopressin level. The occurrence of central diabetes insipidus with hyperthyroidism was revealed on the basis of pituitary magnetic resonance imaging, a water deprivation test and a desmopressin test. The clinical co-existence of diabetes insipidus and hyperthyroidism is very rare; however, the complication should be considered when hypernatremia and/or dehydration progress in patients with Graves's disease as a common autoimmune-related etiology.
