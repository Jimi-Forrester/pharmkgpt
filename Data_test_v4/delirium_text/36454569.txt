36454569|a|Importance: Postoperative sleep disturbance (PSD) is common in patients after surgery. Objective: To examine the effect of intraoperative esketamine infusion on the incidence of PSD in patients who underwent gynecological laparoscopic surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted from August 2021 to April 2022 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University in China. Participants included patients aged 18 to 65 years with an American Society of Anesthesiologist Physical Status classification of I to III (with I indicating a healthy patient, II a patient with mild systemic disease, and III a patient with severe systemic disease) who underwent gynecological laparoscopic surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to either the esketamine group or control group. Data were analyzed using the per protocol principle. Interventions: Patients in the esketamine group received a continuous infusion of esketamine, 0.3 mg/kg/h, intraoperatively. Patients in the control group received an equivalent volume of saline. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the incidence of PSD on postoperative days (PODs) 1 and 3. Postoperative sleep disturbance was defined as a numeric rating scale score of 6 or higher or an Athens Insomnia Scale score of 6 points or higher. The secondary outcomes included postoperative anxiety and depression scores using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, postoperative pain using the visual analog scale, postoperative hydromorphone consumption, and risk factors associated with PSD. Results: A total of 183 female patients were randomized to the control group (n = 91; median [IQR] age, 45 [35-49] years) and the esketamine group (n = 92; median [IQR] age, 43 [32-49] years). The incidence of PSD in the esketamine group was significantly lower than in the control group on POD 1 (22.8% vs 44.0%; odds ratio [OR], 0.38 [95% CI, 0.20-0.72]; P = .002) and POD 3 (7.6% vs 19.8%; OR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.13-0.84]; P = .02). There were no differences in postoperative depression and anxiety scores between the 2 groups. Postoperative hydromorphone consumption in the first 24 hours (3.0 [range, 2.8-3.3] mg vs 3.2 [range, 2.9-3.4] mg; P = .04) and pain scores on movement (3 [3-4] vs 4 [3-5] points; P < .001) were significantly lower in the esketamine group than in the control group. On multivariable logistic regression, preoperative depression (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.01-1.70) and anxiety (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.04-1.80) scores, duration of anesthesia (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.08), and postoperative pain score (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.24-2.96) were identified as risk factors associated with PSD. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this trial showed the prophylactic effect of intraoperative esketamine infusion on the incidence of PSD in patients who underwent gynecological laparoscopic surgery. Further studies are needed to confirm these results. Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Identifier: ChiCTR2100048587.
