39010148|a|BACKGROUND: The relationship between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and female reproductive endocrine diseases has gained significant attention and research interest in recent years. However, there is still limited understanding of the exact impacts of LTL on these diseases. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to investigate the genetic causal association between LTL and female reproductive endocrine diseases by employing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. METHODS: Instruments for assessing genetic variation associated with exposure and outcome were derived from summary data of published genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) was utilized as the main analysis method to investigate the causal relationship between LTL and female reproductive endocrine diseases. The exposure data were obtained from the UK Biobanks GWAS dataset, comprising 472,174 participants of European ancestry. The outcome data were acquired from the FinnGen consortium, including abnormal uterine bleeding (menorrhagia and oligomenorrhea), endometriosis (ovarian endometrioma and adenomyosis), infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Furthermore, to account for potential confounding factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, insomnia, body mass index (BMI) and a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis was also conducted. Lastly, a series of pleiotropy tests and sensitivity analyses were performed to ensure the reliability and robustness of our findings. P < 0.0063 was considered to indicate statistically significant causality following Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: Our univariable MR analysis demonstrated that longer LTL was causally associated with an increased risk of menorrhagia (IVW: odds ratio [OR]: 1.1803; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0880-1.2804; P = 0.0001) and ovarian endometrioma (IVW: OR: 1.2946; 95%CI: 1.0970-1.5278; P = 0.0022) at the Bonferroni significance level. However, no significant correlation was observed between LTL and oligomenorrhea (IVW: OR: 1.0124; 95%CI: 0.7350-1.3946; P = 0.9398), adenomyosis (IVW: OR: 1.1978; 95%CI: 0.9983-1.4372; P = 0.0522), infertility (IVW: OR: 1.0735; 95%CI: 0.9671-1.1915; P = 0.1828), PCOS (IVW: OR: 1.0633; 95%CI: 0.7919-1.4278; P = 0.6829), POI (IVW: OR: 0.8971; 95%CI: 0.5644-1.4257; P = 0.6459) or PMS (IVW: OR: 0.7749; 95%CI: 0.4137-1.4513; P = 0.4256). Reverse MR analysis indicated that female reproductive endocrine diseases have no causal effect on LTL. MVMR analysis suggested that the causal effect of LTL on menorrhagia and ovarian endometrioma remained significant after accounting for smoking, alcohol consumption, insomnia, BMI and a history of PID. Pleiotropic and sensitivity analyses also showed robustness of our results. CONCLUSION: The results of our bidirectional two-sample MR analysis revealed that genetically predicted longer LTL significantly increased the risk of menorrhagia and ovarian endometrioma, which is consistent with the findings from MVMR studies. However, we did not notice any significant effects of LTL on oligomenorrhea, adenomyosis, infertility, PCOS, POI or PMS. Additionally, reproductive endocrine disorders were found to have no impact on LTL. To enhance our understanding of the effect and underlying mechanism of LTL on female reproductive endocrine diseases, further large-scale studies are warranted in the future.
