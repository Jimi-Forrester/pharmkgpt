38586123|t|Detection and analysis of plasma lncRNA, miRNA and mRNA profile in preterm birth with intraventricular hemorrhage.
38586123|a|Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants and is strongly associated with adverse neurological outcomes. The incidence of severe IVH (grade 3 or 4) has persisted despite the overall decline in IVH. IVH has been attributed to changes in cerebral blood flow to the immature germinal matrix microvasculature. The cascade of adverse events following IVH includes inflammation, white matter injury, and delayed oligodendrial maturation. In this study, we aimed to identify long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the peripheral blood of preterm infants with IVH compared to normal controls, resulting in the finding of novel biomarkers for IVH. We conducted transcriptome sequencing and small RNA sequencing for identifying differential expression of RNA in preterm infants with IVH. We identified differentially expressed 47 lncRNAs, 95 miRNAs, and 1,370 mRNAs in preterm infants with IVH compared to normal control. Particularly, lncRNA H19 exhibited significantly high expression in preterm infants with IVH. The functional analysis revealed that differentially expressed RNAs in preterm infants with IVH were associated with ferroptosis, heme metabolism, and immune response such as lymphocyte activation and interferon response. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the potential of lncRNA, miRNA, mRNA as possible diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for IVH.
