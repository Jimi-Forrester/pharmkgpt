32899026|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease that is slowly becoming a global problem. Salvia miltiorrhiza (SM) has a history of thousands of years of use in China. In recent years, SM has been reported to have the effect of improving Alzheimer's disease. However, there is no systematic review of its efficacy and safety yet. Therefore, we propose a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SM for AD patients. METHODS: Six databases will be searched: China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biological Medicine (CBM), China Scientific Journals Database (CSJD), Wanfang database, PubMed, and EMBASE. The information is searched from January 2010 to July 2020. Languages are limited to English and Chinese. The primary outcomes include changes in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) and Activities of Daily Living scale (ADL). Additional outcomes include clinical effective rate and adverse event rate. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system will be used to assess the strength of the evidence. RESULTS: This systematic review will evaluate the efficacy and safety of SM in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: This systematic review provides evidence as to whether SM is effective and safe for Alzheimer's disease patients. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: INPLASY202070066.
