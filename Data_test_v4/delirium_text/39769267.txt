39769267|a|Recombinant antibodies and, more recently, T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cell therapies represent two immunological strategies that have come to the forefront of clinical interest for targeting intracellular neoantigens in benign and malignant diseases. T cell-based therapies targeting neoantigens use T cells expressing a recombinant complete TCR (TCR-T cell), a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) with the variable domains of a neoepitope-reactive TCR as a binding domain (TCR-CAR-T cell) or a TCR-like antibody as a binding domain (TCR-like CAR-T cell). Furthermore, the synthetic T cell receptor and antigen receptor (STAR) and heterodimeric TCR-like CAR (T-CAR) are designed as a double-chain TCRalphabeta-based receptor with variable regions of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains (VH and VL) fused to TCR-Calpha and TCR-Cbeta, respectively, resulting in TCR signaling. In contrast to the use of recombinant T cells, anti-neopeptide MHC (pMHC) antibodies and intrabodies neutralizing intracellular neoantigens can be more easily applied to cancer patients. However, different limitations should be considered, such as the loss of neoantigens, the modification of antigen peptide presentation, tumor heterogenicity, and the immunosuppressive activity of the tumor environment. The simultaneous application of immune checkpoint blocking antibodies and of CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing tools to engineer different recombinant T cells with enhanced therapeutic functions could make T cell therapies more efficient and could pave the way for its routine clinical application.
