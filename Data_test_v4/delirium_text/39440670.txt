METHODS: Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project participants (n = 129), dementia or stroke free, completed fasting lumbar puncture, SCD assessment, and cognitive assessment. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for AD were analyzed. Linear regression models related SCD to CSF AD biomarkers and follow-up models assessed interactions of SCD x cognitive status, sex, reading level, and education on AD biomarkers. RESULTS: In main effect models, higher SCD was associated with more amyloidosis (p-values <0.004). SCD was not associated with tau, p-tau, or neurofilament light (NFL) levels (p-values >0.38). SCD score interacted with cognitive status (p < 0.02), sex (p = 0.03), and education (p-values <0.005) on amyloidosis. In stratified models, higher SCD was associated with more amyloid in cognitively unimpaired (p-values <0.003), men (p = 0.0003), and higher education. No SCD score x reading-level interaction was found (p-values >0.51) though SCD related to amyloid markers in the higher reading-level group (p-values <0.004). INTERPRETATION: Higher SCD was associated with greater cerebral amyloid accumulation, one of the earliest pathological AD changes. SCD appears most useful in detecting early AD-related brain changes prior to objective cognitive impairment, in men, and those with higher quantity and quality of education and highlight the importance of considering these factors.
