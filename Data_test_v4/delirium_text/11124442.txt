11124442|a|Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is a neurodegenerative condition that has been principally associated with frontal lobe dementia. In this study, we compared neuropathological abnormalities in frontal, hippocampal, and calcarine cortices from patients assigned a diagnosis of FTD, normal elderly and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Densities of Nissl-stained neurons and lesions which were immunolabeled for tau, beta-amyloid (Abeta), alpha- and beta-synuclein, ubiquitin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and CD68 antigen were determined using computer-assisted, non-biased quantitative microscopy. We found that FTD frontal and hippocampal regions exhibited marked neuron loss, abundant ubiquitin-immunoreactive (ir) dystrophic neurites, GFAP-ir astrocytes, and CD68-ir microglia, while calcarine cortex was spared. No alpha- or beta-synuclein-ir lesions were observed, and neither the density of tau-ir neurofibrillary tangles nor that of Abeta-ir plaques in FTD exceeded normal controls. In addition, there were no neuropathological differences between FTD subjects who presented clinically with a frontal lobe dementia versus an AD-like dementia. These findings indicate that FTD is a category of neurodegnerative dementias with varying clinical presentations that is characterized by the progressive degeneration of select populations of cortical neurons. The molecular neurodegenerative mechanisms that lead to FTD remain to be elucidated.
