33849651|a|BACKGROUND: The repair of critical-sized bone defects is always a challenging problem. Electromagnetic fields (EMFs), used as a physiotherapy for bone defects, have been suspected to cause potential hazards to human health due to the long-term exposure. To optimize the application of EMF while avoiding its adverse effects, a combination of EMF and tissue engineering techniques is critical. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of the mechanism of action of EMF will lead to better applications in the future. METHODS: In this research, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) seeded on 3D-printed scaffolds were treated with sinusoidal EMFs in vitro. Then, 5.5 mm critical-sized calvarial defects were created in rats, and the cell scaffolds were implanted into the defects. In addition, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which EMFs regulate BMSCs were explored with various approaches to gain deeper insight into the effects of EMFs. RESULTS: The cell scaffolds treated with EMF successfully accelerated the repair of critical-sized calvarial defects. Further studies revealed that EMF could not directly induce the differentiation of BMSCs but improved the sensitivity of BMSCs to BMP signals by upregulating the quantity of specific BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) receptors. Once these receptors receive BMP signals from the surrounding milieu, a cascade of reactions is initiated to promote osteogenic differentiation via the BMP/Smad signalling pathway. Moreover, the cytokines secreted by BMSCs treated with EMF can better facilitate angiogenesis and osteoimmunomodulation which play fundamental roles in bone regeneration. CONCLUSION: In summary, EMF can promote the osteogenic potential of BMSCs and enhance the paracrine function of BMSCs to facilitate bone regeneration. These findings highlight the profound impact of EMF on tissue engineering and provide a new strategy for the clinical treatment of bone defects.
