7606927|t|High-resolution mapping of SNCA encoding alpha-synuclein, the non-A beta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor, to human chromosome 4q21.3-->q22 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
7606927|a|The human alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA) was previously identified as the non-A beta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor (NACP). A cosmid clone containing this gene has been isolated and mapped by FISH and high-resolution fluorescence banding to human chromosome 4q21.3-->q22.
