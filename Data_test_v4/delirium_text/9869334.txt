9869334|t|Lu 25-109, a combined m1 agonist and m2 antagonist, modulates regulated processing of the amyloid precursor protein of Alzheimer's disease.
9869334|a|To examine the effects of the combined muscarinic ml-agonist/m2-antagonist Lu 25-109 on regulated processing of the amyloid protein precursor (APP), we used both transfected cells expressing human muscarinic m1 or m2 acetylcholine receptors, and fresh rat hippocampal slices. Lu 25-109 readily stimulated APPs secretion from HEK 293 cells overexpressing m1, but not m2, receptors, as well as from the hippocampal brain slices. Time-course analyses revealed a rapid (5-35 minutes), and a delayed (55-75 minutes) secretory response to Lu 25-109 with distinct concentration profiles suggesting two distinct cell biological mechanisms. Both responses appeared to reflect post-translational mechanisms because levels of APP message were unchanged after 60 minutes of stimulation with Lu 25-109. In comparison to carbachol, Lu 25-109 had a significantly lower intrinsic activity at muscarinic m1 receptors, compatible with a pharmacological profile as a partial agonist at recombinantly expressed m1 receptors. In as much as stimulation of APPs secretion is associated with reduced formation of A beta peptides, Lu 25-109 may be useful to reduce A beta generation, and thus, slow amyloid plaque formation. Moreover, Lu 25-109 may be useful in promoting the known neurotrophic and neuroprotective biological functions of secreted APPs.
