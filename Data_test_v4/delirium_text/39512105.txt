39512105|a|Amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) are key indicators of Alzheimer's disease and are also linked to cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. This study explored the accumulation of Abeta in a standard 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of PD. We unilaterally injected 6-OHDA into the substantia nigra of Wistar rats to induce dopaminergic cell degeneration and death, a characteristic of PD. The goal was to detect Abeta protein in tissues and blood vessels showing inflammation or degeneration from the 6-OHDA injection. Our results showed that 6-OHDA injection produced a statistically significant rise in Abeta concentration at the injection site 60 minutes after injection, which was slightly reduced 24 hours post-injection but still significantly higher than in controls. We also tried Gp120 injection in the same zone but it only produced effects comparable to control needle trauma. The presence of Abeta in tissues and blood vessel walls after injection was confirmed through ELISA tests and was supported by immunohistochemical staining of injection areas. We found that the increased Abeta concentration was visible in and around blood vessels and inside blood vessel walls, and also, to a lesser extent in some cells, most probably neurons, in the area. This research highlights the connection between dopaminergic cell poisoning and the accumulation of Abeta, offering insights into the progression of PD to cognitive disorders and dementia.
