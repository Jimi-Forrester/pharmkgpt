34219729|a|BACKGROUND: While amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and tau tangles are the well-recognized pathologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD), they are more often observed in healthy individuals than in AD patients. This discrepancy makes it extremely challenging to utilize these two proteinopathies as reliable biomarkers for the early detection as well as later diagnosis of AD. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize and provide preliminary evidence that topographically overlapping Abeta and tau within the default mode network (DMN) play more critical roles in the underlying pathophysiology of AD than each of the tau and/or Abeta pathologies alone. METHODS: We used our newly developed quantification methods and publicly available neuroimaging data from 303 individuals to provide preliminary evidence of our hypothesis. RESULTS: We first showed that the probability of observing overlapping Abeta and tau is significantly higher within than outside the DMN. We then showed evidence that using Abeta and tau overlap can increase the reliability of the prediction of healthy individuals converting to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to a lesser degree converting from MCI to AD. Finally, we provided evidence that while the initial accumulations of Abeta and tau seems to be started independently in the healthy participants, the accumulations of the two pathologies interact in the MCI and AD groups. CONCLUSION: These findings shed some light on the complex pathophysiology of AD and suggest that overlapping Abeta and tau pathologies within the DMN might be a more reliable biomarker of AD for early detection and later diagnosis of the disease.
