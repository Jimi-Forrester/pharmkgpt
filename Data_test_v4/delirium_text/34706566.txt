34706566|t|Implementing Telehealth Music Therapy Services in an Integrative Oncology Setting: A Case Series.
34706566|a|Providing music therapy in a medical setting has necessarily undergone major changes during the COVID-19 world pandemic. Many programs had to discontinue while others were able to transition to a telehealth model. This paper describes the process of conducting telehealth-based music therapy sessions within an integrative oncology setting in a large cancer hospital. Patients provide feedback regarding benefits and challenges of inpatient, outpatient, and group music therapy using a telehealth model. Benefits include anxiety reduction, increased coping skills, and increased social support. Unique challenges include technology limitations. We share examples of how we successfully adapted our workflows to provide telehealth-based music therapy in inpatient, outpatient, and group settings.
