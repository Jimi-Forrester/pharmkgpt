33817451|a|Neurological symptoms occur in approximately one-third of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among these symptoms, hypoxic encephalopathy develops in one-fifth of severe cases, while ischemic strokes due to thrombotic complications are common in one-third of COVID-19 intensive care patients. Brain involvement of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is eventuated by several routes, including hematogenous spread, transsynaptic entry through infected neurons, olfactory nerve, ocular epithelium, vascular endothelium, and impaired blood-brain barrier. Besides the high angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) binding affinity, and FURIN preactivation, SARS-CoV-2 maintains efficient neuronal entry while evading immune surveillance by using basigin and neuropilin-1 receptors. However, the neurological manifestations and their pathogenic mechanisms are still debated in COVID-19 patients.
