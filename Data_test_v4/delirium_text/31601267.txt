31601267|a|BACKGROUND: One of the major challenges in diagnosing dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the common co-morbid presence of amyloid pathology. To understand the putative role of altered amyloid-beta (Abeta) metabolism in dementia with DLB, we analyzed levels of different cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta peptides (Abeta38, Abeta40, Abeta42) in DLB, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cognitively normal controls. METHODS: CSF from patients with DLB (n = 72; age 68 +- 6 years; 10%F; Mini-mental State examination (MMSE) 23 +- 4), AD (n = 38; age 68 +- 6 years; 8%F; MMSE 22 +- 5), and cognitively normal controls (n = 38; age 67 +- 7 years; 13%F; MMSE 29 +- 2) was analyzed using the Meso Scale Discovery assay for human Abeta peptides. We performed general linear models to compare CSF Abeta peptide levels between groups. Associations between CSF Abeta peptides and MMSE score at baseline and longitudinal changes over time were assessed with linear mixed models. RESULTS: For all three CSF Abeta peptides and compared to controls (Abeta38 2676 +- 703 pg/ml, Abeta40 6243 +- 1500 pg/ml, and Abeta42 692 +- 205 pg/ml), we observed lower levels in DLB (Abeta38 2247 +- 638, Abeta40 5432 +- 1340, and Abeta42 441 +- 185, p < 0.05), whereas AD patients showed only lower Abeta42 levels (304 +- 71, p < 0.001). The observed differences in Abeta38 and Abeta40 were independent of co-morbid AD pathology (CSF tau/Abeta42 > 0.52) and APOE genotype. Finally, lower Abeta peptide levels were associated with lower MMSE score (beta = 1.02-1.11, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated different profiles of CSF Abeta reduction in DLB and AD. In particular, while AD is characterized by an isolated drop in Abeta42, DLB comes with reductions in Abeta38, Abeta40, and Abeta42. This suggests that amyloid metabolism is affected in DLB, even in the absence of co-morbid AD pathology.
