38338484|t|Multiscale Modeling of Macromolecular Interactions between Tau-Amylin Oligomers and Asymmetric Lipid Nanodomains That Link Alzheimer's and Diabetic Diseases.
38338484|a|The molecular events of protein misfolding and self-aggregation of tau and amylin are associated with the progression of Alzheimer's and diabetes, respectively. Recent studies suggest that tau and amylin can form hetero-tau-amylin oligomers. Those hetero-oligomers are more neurotoxic than homo-tau oligomers. So far, the detailed interactions between the hetero-oligomers and the neuronal membrane are unknown. Using multiscale MD simulations, the lipid binding and protein folding behaviors of hetero-oligomers on asymmetric lipid nanodomains or raft membranes were examined. Our raft membranes contain phase-separated phosphatidylcholine (PC), cholesterol, and anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) or ganglioside (GM1) in one leaflet of the lipid bilayer. The hetero-oligomers bound more strongly to the PS and GM1 than other lipids via the hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, respectively, in the raft membranes. The hetero-tetramer disrupted the acyl chain orders of both PC and PS in the PS-containing raft membrane, but only the GM1 in the GM1-containing raft membrane as effectively as the homo-tau-tetramer. We discovered that the alpha-helical content in the heterodimer was greater than the sum of alpha-helical contents from isolated tau and amylin monomers on both raft membranes, indicative of a synergetic effect of tau-amylin interactions in surface-induced protein folding. Our results provide new molecular insights into understanding the cross-talk between Alzheimer's and diabetes.
