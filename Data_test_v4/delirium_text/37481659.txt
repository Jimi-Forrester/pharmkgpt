37481659|t|Association between urinary caffeine and caffeine metabolites and stroke in American adults: a cross-sectional study from the NHANES, 2009-2014.
37481659|a|This study investigates the potential correlation between urinary caffeine levels and the occurrence of stroke, a serious cerebrovascular disease that can lead to disability or death. The data used in this study was obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between 2009 and 2014. The study analyzed a total of 5,339 individuals, divided into a control group (n = 5,135) and a stroke group (n = 162). The researchers utilized multiple logistic regression and smoothed curve fitting to examine the relationship between urinary caffeine and caffeine metabolites and the incidence of stroke. The study found that higher urinary caffeine levels were associated with a lower risk of stroke in Mexican American participants (odds ratio [OR] = 0.886, 95% confidence interval [CI]: (0.791, 0.993), P = 0.037). After adjusting for certain participant characteristics, it was also found that higher urinary paraxanthine levels were associated with a lower risk of stroke incidence (OR = 0.991, 95% CI (0.984, 0.999), P = 0.027). Meanwhile, the highest urinary paraxanthine levels group had 43.7% fewer strokes than the lowest level group (OR = 0.563, 95% CI (0.341, 0.929), P = 0.025). In this study, we showed a negative link between urine paraxanthine levels and the risk of stroke. Meanwhile, urinary caffeine levels were negatively associated with the incidence of stroke in Mexican Americans, but no correlation in other populations. Our findings may have predictive and diagnostic implications in clinical practice. Further extensive prospective investigations are still needed to validate our conclusions.
