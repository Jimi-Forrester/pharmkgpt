39435722|t|Differential temporal decline of cerebral oxytocin and mu-opioid receptor density during the aging process in mice.
39435722|a|Aging is often associated with changes in social, sexual, emotional and pain functioning, as well as with the increased prevalence of certain psychopathologies. However, the neurodevelopmental basis underpinning these age-related changes remains to be determined. Considering the key roles of oxytocin (OTR) and mu-opioid (MOPr) receptor systems in regulating social, sexual, pain, reward and emotional processing, it seems plausible that they are also implicated in age-related behavioural alterations. Although the ontogeny of both receptors has been well characterized in rodent brains from early development till adulthood, little is known concerning the neuroadaptations occurring from middle age to old age. Therefore, we mapped the neuroadaptations in OTR and MOPr in the brains of mice at those developmental endpoints. Quantitative OTR and MOPr autoradiographic binding was carried out in the brains of male mice at 2, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months of age. A significant whole brain decline in OTR density was detected between 2 and 6 months of age, with no additional decline thereafter. Interestingly, for MOPrs, the decline in density was not detected until 9 months of age. Region-specific age-related decline in OTR density was concentrated in the lateral anterior olfactory nuclei (AOL) and, for MOPr, in the AOL and the nucleus accumbens for MOPr. Identifying the tipping point of these age-related variations in both receptors may assist with our understanding of the neurobiology underlining age-related changes in social, pain and emotional functioning/processing. It may also help us target interventions to specific developmental windows to abrogate certain age-related psychopathologies.
