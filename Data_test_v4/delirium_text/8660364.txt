8660364|t|Amyloid beta protein and its 3-kDa fragment are present in the axoplasm fraction of the white matter in human brain.
8660364|a|Production of the soluble amyloid beta-protein (A beta) precedes abnormal accumulation of A beta amyloid in the brains of subjects with Alzheimer's disease. To determine the cellular source and generating mechanisms of soluble A beta in the human brain, we separated an axoplasm fraction from the cerebral white matter and analyzed it. The axoplasm fraction contained secretory isoforms of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and 11.5 kDa A beta-bearing carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP. Furthermore, soluble 4 kDa A beta and 3 kDa fragments of A beta (p3) were obtained from the axoplasm fraction. These results suggest that amyloidogenic 4 kDa A beta is intracellularly produced in cerebral neurons and carried through the axons in human brain.
