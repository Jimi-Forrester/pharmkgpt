36643097|t|Knowledge and awareness on neurolept anesthesia among dental students.
36643097|a|N20 omission or addition to the combination of an opioid and neuroleptic is referred to as neuroleptanalgesia and neuroleptanesthesia, respectively. Conscious sedation is the result of this evolution. The requirement for high-quality anesthesia that is also related with speedier recovery, improved comfort, and lower costs all support the concept of neuroleptanesthesia. A set of eight questions was formulated and circulated among the undergraduate and postgraduate students of Saveetha Dental College. Responses were collected and the data were entered into MS Excel sheet and transferred to SPSS for the analysis. Results were made into graphs and interpreted. In the present study, among the students who took part in the study, 36.3% of the students were postgraduates and 63.7% of them were undergraduates. About 45.2% of the students were not aware and 54.8% of the students were aware that neuroleptanalgesia refers to the combination of a potent sedative analgesic agent and a tranquillizer. Many of the students were not aware of what neuroleptic esthetic is and how it evolved. The current study showed that most students did not have enough knowledge about neurolept anesthesia. However, dentists should make efforts to improve knowledge, awareness of neurolept anesthesia for further advancement, and the need for high-quality anesthesia.
