33105274|t|Pediatric delirium: epidemiology and outcomes.
33105274|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Delirium is a frequent complication of serious medical illness in children. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent data on the epidemiology and outcomes related to pediatric delirium, and discuss prevention strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: Delirium rates in the pediatric ICU are greater than 25%. Delirium in children is associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and hospital length of stay, increased costs, and excess mortality. Pediatric delirium may affect postdischarge cognition and quality of life. Recent initiatives targeting universal screening, early mobilization, and minimization of benzodiazepine-based sedation have shown reduction in delirium prevalence. SUMMARY: Widespread screening is needed in critically ill children to detect and mitigate delirium. The identification of modifiable risk factors has provided an opportunity for delirium prevention. Large-scale longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the long-term sequelae of delirium in children.
