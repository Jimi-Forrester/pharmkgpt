35959820|t|[Electroconvulsive therapy used for somatic-triggered delirium].
35959820|a|Delirium is an acute and somatic-triggered condition that complicates hospitalisation on somatic wards. Antipsychotics are used as a treatment of delirium in the case of severe degree of a psychomotor agitation. In Denmark, ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) is rarely applied for treatment-refractory delirium, despite a relatively frequent occurrence and despite the lack of absolute contraindications. This case report presents a medical history in order to bring to attention the lack of precise guidelines regarding the use of ECT in acute conditions as well as the need for further research in this field.
