34382141|t|Microglia and Stem-Cell Mediated Neuroprotection after Neonatal Hypoxia-Ischemia.
34382141|a|Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia encephalopathy (HIE) refers to a brain injury in term infants that can lead to death or lifelong neurological deficits such as cerebral palsy (CP). The pathogenesis of this disease involves multiple cellular and molecular events, notably a neuroinflammatory response driven partly by microglia, the brain resident macrophages. Treatment options are currently very limited, but stem cell (SC) therapy holds promise, as beneficial outcomes are reported in animal studies and to a lesser degree in human trials. Among putative mechanisms of action, immunomodulation is considered a major contributor to SC associated benefits. The goal of this review is to examine whether microglia is a cellular target of SC-mediated immunomodulation and whether the recruitment of microglia is linked to brain repair. We will first provide an overview on microglial activation in the rodent model of neonatal HI, and highlight its sensitivity to developmental age. Two complementary questions are then addressed: (i) do immune-related treatments impact microglia and provide neuroprotection, (ii) does stem cell treatment modulates microglia? Finally, the immune-related findings in patients enrolled in SC based clinical trials are discussed. Our review points to an impact of SCs on the microglial phenotype, but heterogeneity in experimental designs and methodological limitations hamper our understanding of a potential contribution of microglia to SC associated benefits. Thorough analyses of the microglial phenotype are warranted to better address the relevance of the neuroimmune crosstalk in brain repair and improve or advance the development of SC protocols in humans.
