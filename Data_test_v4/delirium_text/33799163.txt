33799163|a|We propose the intravenous administration of autologous adipose-derived stem cells as a new treatment for Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesize that the stem cells will secrete neprilysin in the brain to break down and remove amyloid deposits in the Alzheimer's brain. We have shown a case of skin amyloid deposition that disappeared after stem cell administration and confirmed that the stem cells administered had neprilysin activity. In addition to neprilysin secretion, other mechanisms of action of stem cells include nerve regeneration, nerve repair, growth factor secretion, anti-inflammatory effects, and angiogenesis. The harvesting of adipose-derived stem cells is minimally invasive, and intravenous administration can be safely repeated. We hope that the efficacy of this new treatment will be verified and that it will bring a ray of hope to patients suffering from this incurable disease.
