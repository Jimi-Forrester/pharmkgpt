30701513|a|BACKGROUND: To perform a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent endoscopic atraumatic coronary artery off-pump bypass grafting (EACAB) in a single center over a period of 11 years. METHODS: Data was acquired from the hospital registry and patient medical records. In order to determine changes in clinical profile, patients were subdivided into three groups regarding year of surgery: 1998-2002 (group 1), 2003-2005 (group 2), 2006-2009 (group 3). In-hospital analysis up to 30 days and long-term observation were conducted. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 714 patients (581 male). Procedural success accounted for 99% of all patients. No mortality was observed up to 30 days. Complications in the early period included pleural effusion (7.6%), cardiac arrhythmias (3.6%), bleeding related revision (2.7%) and wound infection (1.6%). Mean follow-up was 6 years (2132 +- 1313 days; median: 1918.5). Nineteen (2.7%) patients died, of which 52.6% (10 patients) were due to heart related conditions. Overall frequency of major adverse cerebral and cardiovascular events (MACCE) was 10.8% (77 patients). The Kaplan-Meyer analysis defined survival rate and event-free survival in long-term observation of 96.1% and 85.3%, respectively. Ejection fraction (EF) < 50% was the only independent factor of mortality (OR: 3.35). Regarding cumulative MACCE, older age (OR: 1.72), lower EF (OR: 3.03), the history of percutaneous coronary intervention (OR: 2.13) and higher New York Heart Association class (OR: 2.63) influenced the incidence rate. CONCLUSIONS: The presented short and very long-term results confirm that EACAB is an efficient alternative for patients requiring revascularization of the left anterior descending artery. The elimination of cardiopulmonary bypass significantly reduces the number of complications.
