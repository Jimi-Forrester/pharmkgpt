32169325|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of major neurocognitive disorders in older adults, affecting millions of individuals worldwide and leading to irreversible cognitive decline. The main neuropathological features of AD are brain amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles. The biomarkers of AD are highly accurate in detecting these pathophysiological and neuropathological changes, up to several decades before the onset of cognitive impairment. They specifically reflect the presence of abnormal proteins in the brain, and can be measured reliably in the cerebrospinal fluid of affected individuals and in plasma for research purposes. Their implementation in clinical practice, together with neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, strongly increases diagnostic precision. Thus, amyloid and tau biomarkers can help rule out differential diagnoses such as vascular cognitive impairment or frontotemporal lobar degeneration. They also enable earlier diagnosis and are used in research to characterize the preclinical stage of AD. The new definition of AD has highlighted the usefulness of these biomarkers, shifting the focus from symptoms to biological and brain changes in living patients. Recent longitudinal studies demonstrated the ability of these biomarkers to predict future cognitive decline, regardless of the stage of the disease. Ongoing drug trials against AD systematically require diagnostic confirmation with biomarkers. Apart from clinical research, they have been increasingly used for several years in clinical practice, in secondary and tertiary-referral memory clinics. Nevertheless, their use has been raising ethical issues, in particular in the oldest old or in patients with multimorbidity. Their interpretation in patients older than 90 years is limited by the lack of evidence. The implications of a misdiagnosis of AD should be taken into account. Besides, there may be discrepancies between the biological diagnosis and the clinical course of the disease. In the absence of clear guidelines for their utilization, we hereby discuss their potential interests and limitations in older individuals.
