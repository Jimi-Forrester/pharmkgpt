31553929|t|Electroretinography in psychiatry: A systematic literature review.
31553929|a|This review aims to consolidate the available information on use of electroretinography as a diagnostic tool in psychiatry. The electroretinogram (ERG) has been found to have diagnostic utility in cocaine withdrawal (reduced light-adapted b-wave response), major depressive disorder (reduced contrast gain in pattern ERG), and schizophrenia (reduced a- and b-wave amplitudes). This review examines these findings as well as the applicability of ERG to substance use disorder, Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder, panic disorder, eating disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and medication use. While there have been promising results, current research suffers from a lack of specificity. Further research that quantifies anomalies in ERG present in psychiatric illness is needed.
