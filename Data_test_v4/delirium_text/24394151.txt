24394151|t|Type 2 diabetes and cognitive impairment: contributions from neuroimaging.
24394151|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and Alzheimer disease (AD) are major public health burdens associated with aging. As the age of the population rapidly increases, a sheer increase in the incidence of these diseases is expected. Research has identified T2D as a risk factor for cognitive impairment and potentially AD, but the neurobiological pathways that are affected are only beginning to be understood. The rapid advances in neuroimaging in the past decade have added significant understanding to how T2D affects brain structure and function and possibly lead to AD. This article provides a review of studies that have utilized structural and functional neuroimaging to identify neural pathways that link T2D to impaired cognitive performance and potentially AD. A primary focus of this article is the potential for neuroimaging to assist in understanding the mechanistic pathways that may provide translational opportunities for clinical intervention.
