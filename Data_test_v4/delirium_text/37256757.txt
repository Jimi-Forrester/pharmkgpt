37256757|t|Navigating the Complexities of Dementia Care: The Lived Experiences of Black American Family Caregivers.
37256757|a|Black American individuals have a higher rate of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) diagnoses compared to other racial/ethnic groups, and their family caregiver population is expected to increase rapidly over the next 2 decades. The current study aimed to explore Black American women's experiences caring for family members with ADRD. An interpretative phenomenology approach was used to gain a deeper understanding of the caregiving experiences of Black American women. Participants in the study were all Black American married women aged 63 to 81 years (mean = 71.3 years, SD = 6.6 years). Key themes that emerged from the study included: (a) Family Care Obligation, (b) Caregiving Journey, (c) Prioritizing Health Concerns, (d) Coping Behaviors, and (e) Support Needs and Challenges. Family caregivers require ongoing support, education, and guidance. Implications for nursing practice include focusing on family assessments, increased education and awareness, and collaboration with interdisciplinary teams to provide the best resources.
