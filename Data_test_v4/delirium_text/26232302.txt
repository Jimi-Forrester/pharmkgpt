26232302|t|Prediction of Postoperative Complications Using Multidimensional Frailty Score in Older Female Cancer Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Class 1 or 2.
26232302|a|BACKGROUND: Even low-risk, elderly patients are at increased risk for postoperative morbidity compared with their younger counterparts. We sought to evaluate the role of a scoring model in predicting adverse surgical outcomes in low-risk, older, female cancer patients. STUDY DESIGN: From October 2011 to May 2014, two hundred and eighty-one low-risk female patients (aged 65 years and older, American Society of Anesthesiologists class 1 or 2) undergoing curative cancer surgery were included. The Multidimensional Frailty Score (MFS) was calculated by comprehensive geriatric assessment. The primary end point was postoperative complication (eg, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, delirium, acute pulmonary thromboembolism, and unplanned ICU admission). Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay and institutionalization. RESULTS: Twenty patients experienced postoperative complications and 15 patients were discharged to nursing facilities. The fully adjusted odds ratio (OR) per 1-point increase in MFS was 1.412 (95% CI, 1.012-1.969; p = 0.042) for postoperative complications, 1.377 (95% CI, 0.935-2.026; p = 0.105) for institutionalization, and 1.411 (95% CI, 1.110-1.793; p = 0.005) for prolonged hospital stay. The high-risk group (MFS >=7) showed an increased risk for postoperative complications (OR = 8.513; 95% CI, 2.210-32.785; p = 0.002), institutionalization (OR = 1.291; 95% CI, 0.324-5.152; p = 0.717), and prolonged hospital stay (OR = 2.336; 95% CI, 1.090-5.006; p = 0.029) compared with the low-risk group (MFS <7), after adjusting confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Multidimensional Frailty Score based on a preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment is useful for predicting postoperative complications and prolonged hospital stay, even in low-risk elderly women who are undergoing cancer surgery.
