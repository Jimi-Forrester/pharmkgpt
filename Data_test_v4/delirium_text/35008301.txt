35008301|a|There is no consensus on the effect of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions on patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between RBC administration and the occurrence of distant metastases (M+) after surgical treatment of OSCC. All medical records of patients who underwent primary surgery for OSCC in our department (2003-2019) were analyzed retrospectively (n = 609). Chi and Cox regression models were used to analyze the influence of transfusion on the development of M+, and survival rates. Kaplan-Meier curves were used for graphical presentation. A multitude of patient-specific factors showed a statistical impact in univariate analysis (transfusion, age, gender, diabetes, pT, pN, L, V, Pn, G, UICC, adjuvant therapy, free microvascular transplant, preoperative hemoglobin level). Transfusion status and pN stage were the only variables that showed a significant correlation to M+ in the multivariate Cox model. The hazard ratios for the occurrence of M+ were 2.42 for RBC transfusions and 2.99 for pN+. Administration of RBC transfusions was identified as a significant prognostic parameter for the occurrence of distant metastases after surgical treatment of OSCC. Hence, the administration of RBC transfusions should be considered carefully in the perioperative management.
