39007569|t|From Traditional Typing to Intelligent Insights: A Narrative Review of Directions Toward Targeted Therapies in Delirium.
39007569|a|Delirium is a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by an acute change in level of consciousness that is associated with inattention and disorganized thinking. Delirium affects most critically ill patients and is associated with poor patient-oriented outcomes such as increased mortality, longer ICU and hospital length of stay, and worse long-term cognitive outcomes. The concept of delirium and its subtypes has existed since nearly the beginning of recorded medical literature, yet robust therapies have yet to be identified. Analogous to other critical illness syndromes, we suspect the lack of identified therapies stems from patient heterogeneity and prior subtyping efforts that do not capture the underlying etiology of delirium. The time has come to leverage machine learning approaches, such as supervised and unsupervised clustering, to identify clinical and pathophysiological distinct clusters of delirium that will likely respond differently to various interventions. We use sedation in the ICU as an example of how precision therapies can be applied to critically ill patients, highlighting the fact that while for some patients a sedative drug may cause delirium, in another cohort sedation is the specific treatment. Finally, we conclude with a proposition to move away from the term delirium, and rather focus on the treatable traits that may allow precision therapies to be tested.
