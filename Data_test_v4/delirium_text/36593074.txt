36593074|a|Coprophagia or the ingestion of faeces has been associated with medical conditions (seizure disorders, cerebral atrophy and tumours) and psychiatric disorders (mental retardation, alcoholism, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, fetishes, delirium and dementia). The case of a woman in her 30s presenting with coprophagia and psychotic symptoms following hypoxic brain injury is reported. The case is discussed and literature is reviewed. We investigate cariprazine, a relatively new atypical antipsychotic for treating coprophagia, associated with psychotic symptoms. Psychiatric evaluation revealed cognitive dysfunction and psychotic symptoms. Physical examination and laboratory evaluation were unremarkable. She was treated with haloperidol resulting in resolution of coprophagia. Attempts at switching to alternative antipsychotics, due to side effects, resulted in recurrence of coprophagia. Subsequent relapses required higher doses of haloperidol for remission of coprophagia and psychotic symptoms. She finally responded to cariprazine. While firm conclusions are not possible from the experience of a single case, we suggest cariprazine may also be a treatment option for coprophagia, particularly in patients with psychotic symptoms.
