22005070|a|Oxidative damage can lead to neuronal dysfunction in the brain due to modifications to proteins, lipids and DNA/RNA. In both human and canine brain, oxidative damage progressively increases with age. In the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, oxidative damage is further exacerbated, possibly due to increased deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in senile plaques. These observations have led to the hypothesis that antioxidants may be beneficial for brain aging and AD. Aged dogs naturally develop AD-like neuropathology (Abeta) and cognitive dysfunction and are a useful animal model in which to test antioxidants. In a longitudinal study of aging beagles, a diet rich in antioxidants improved cognition, maintained cognition and reduced oxidative damage and Abeta pathology in treated animals. These data suggest that antioxidants may be beneficial for human brain aging and for AD, particularly as a preventative intervention. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Antioxidants and Antioxidant Treatment in Disease.
