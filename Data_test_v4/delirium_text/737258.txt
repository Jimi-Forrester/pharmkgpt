737258|t|Aluminum levels in brain in Alzheimer's disease.
737258|a|In both human Alzheimer's disease and aluminum encephalopathy of animals, changes are observed in neurofibrillary structures. We have found that brains from Alzheimer patients contain approximately 1.4 times the aluminum level found in a control series. Some possible methodological problems are discussed. We have proposed a plausible chemical mechanism for the changes of aluminum encephalopathy.
