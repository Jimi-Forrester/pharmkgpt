36829803|t|A Review of the Role of Curcumin in Metal Induced Toxicity.
36829803|a|Metal toxicity poses a potential global threat to the environment and living beings. Their numerous agricultural, medical, industrial, domestic, and technological applications result in widespread distribution in the environment which raises concern on the potential effects of metals in terms of health hazards and environmental pollution. Chelation therapy has been the preferred medical treatment for metal poisoning. The chelating agent bounds metal ions to form complex cyclic structures known as 'chelates' to intensify their excretion from the body. The main disadvantage of synthetic chelators is that the chelation process removes vital nutrients along with toxic metals. Natural compounds are widely available, economical, and have minimal adverse effects compared to classical chelators. Herbal preparations can bind to the metal, reduce its absorption in the intestines, and facilitate excretion from the body. Curcumin, a bioactive substance in turmeric, is widely used as a dietary supplement. Most studies have shown that curcumin protects against metal-induced lipid peroxidation and mitigates adverse effects on the antioxidant system. This review article provides an analysis to show that curcumin imparts promising metal toxicity-ameliorative effects that are related to its intrinsic antioxidant activity.
