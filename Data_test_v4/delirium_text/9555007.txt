9555007|t|Laminin inhibits Abeta42 fibril formation in vitro.
9555007|a|In the present study, we investigated whether or not laminin inhibits Abeta42 fibril formation in the same manner as Abeta40. Both a thioflavine-T fluorometric assay and electron microscopy by negative staining demonstrated laminin to have a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on Abeta42 fibril formation. The amyloid fibril formation was inhibited approximately by 70% due to the presence of 1.0 mg/ml laminin co-incubated with 1. 0 mg/ml Abeta42 peptide (molar ratio; Abeta42 peptide:laminin=200:1). These results thus suggested that laminin or its derivatives may be effective as therapeutic agents to either prevent or slow down the progression of amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's disease.
