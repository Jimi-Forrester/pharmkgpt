30416441|t|Astrocytes and Aging.
30416441|a|By 2050, the aging population is predicted to expand by over 100%. Considering this rapid growth, and the additional strain it will place on healthcare resources because of age-related impairments, it is vital that researchers gain a deeper understanding of the cellular interactions that occur with normal aging. A variety of mammalian cell types have been shown to become compromised with age, each with a unique potential to contribute to disease formation in the aging body. Astrocytes represent the largest group of glial cells and are responsible for a variety of essential functions in the healthy central nervous system (CNS). Like other cell types, aging can cause a loss of normal function in astrocytes which reduces their ability to properly maintain a healthy CNS environment, negatively alters their interactions with neighboring cells, and contribute to the heightened inflammatory state characteristic of aging. The goal of this review article is to consolidate the knowledge and research to date regarding the role of astrocytes in aging. In specific, this review article will focus on the morphology and molecular profile of aged astrocytes, the consequence of astrocyte dysfunction on homeostatic functions during aging, and the role of astrocytes in age-related neurodegenerative diseases.
