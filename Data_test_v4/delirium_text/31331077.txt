31331077|t|Dicarbonyl Stress at the Crossroads of Healthy and Unhealthy Aging.
31331077|a|Dicarbonyl stress occurs when dicarbonyl metabolites (i.e., methylglyoxal, glyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone) accumulate as a consequence of their increased production and/or decreased detoxification. This toxic condition has been associated with metabolic and age-related diseases, both of which are characterized by a pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant state. Methylglyoxal (MGO) is the most reactive dicarbonyl and the one with the highest endogenous flux. It is the precursor of the major quantitative advanced glycated products (AGEs) in physiological systems, arginine-derived hydroimidazolones, which accumulate in aging and dysfunctional tissues. The aging process is characterized by a decline in the functional properties of cells, tissues and whole organs, starting from the perturbation of crucial cellular processes, including mitochondrial function, proteostasis and stress-scavenging systems. Increasing studies are corroborating the causal relationship between MGO-derived AGEs and age-related tissue dysfunction, unveiling a previously underestimated role of dicarbonyl stress in determining healthy or unhealthy aging. This review summarizes the latest evidence supporting a causal role of dicarbonyl stress in age-related diseases, including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration.
