38386490|a|BACKGROUND: Levodopa-entacapone-carbidopa intestinal gel (LECIG) is a novel device assisted treatment option for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been available in Finland since 2020. There is paucity of scientific studies considering LECIG treatment in clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: Objectives of this study were to evaluate the changes in medication, adverse events and early discontinuations of LECIG treatment in real life clinical practice. METHODS: The records of 30 consecutive patients, who received LECIG between years 2020 and 2022 in Helsinki University Hospital, were retrospectively analyzed. Data considering changes in medication, discontinuations, and adverse events during the first six months of LECIG treatment was collected. RESULTS: Mean levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) rose significantly between baseline before LECIG and six months with treatment (1230 mg vs. 1570 mg, P = 0.001). Three patients were discarded during nasojejunal tube test phase and seven discontinued the treatment during six-month follow-up. Most common reasons for discontinuation were difficulty in finding suitable infusion rate and neuropsychiatric problems. Safety issues encountered were similar to those reported with levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) treatment. One case of rhabdomyolysis due to severe dyskinesia during LECIG treatment was observed. Patients were satisfied with the small size of the pump system. CONCLUSIONS: LEDD seems to increase during the first months of LECIG treatment. When compared to studies on LCIG, safety profile of LECIG appears similar, but early discontinuation rate is higher than expected. However, long-term studies are lacking. Only clear advantage to LCIG appears to be the smaller LECIG pump size.
