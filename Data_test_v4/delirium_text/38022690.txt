38022690|t|Exercise and microbiome: From big data to therapy.
38022690|a|Exercise is a vital component in maintaining optimal health and serves as a prospective therapeutic intervention for various diseases. The human microbiome, comprised of trillions of microorganisms, plays a crucial role in overall health. Given the advancements in microbiome research, substantial databases have been created to decipher the functionality and mechanisms of the microbiome in health and disease contexts. This review presents an initial overview of microbiomics development and related databases, followed by an in-depth description of the multi-omics technologies for microbiome. It subsequently synthesizes the research pertaining to exercise-induced modifications of the microbiome and diseases that impact the microbiome. Finally, it highlights the potential therapeutic implications of an exercise-modulated microbiome in intestinal disease, obesity and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and immune/inflammation-related diseases.
