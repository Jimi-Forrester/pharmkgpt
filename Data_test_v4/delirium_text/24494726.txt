24494726|a|The in vivo experimental simulation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been a field of paramount importance for Experimental Medicine and Neuroscience for more than 20 years. We herein provide a short overview of an experimental approach to sporadic AD that is based on the insulin-resistant state induced in the brains of animals following the intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of streptozotocin (STZ) at low doses. The icv administration of STZ is considered as an established, standardized and reproducible approach to sporadic AD, central aspects of the pathology of which it can reliably simulate.
