9884321|a|Biotransformation of the M1-muscarinic agonist Lu 25-109 (5-(2-ethyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1-methyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) , in development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, was investigated to obtain information on the identity of human hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes involved in its metabolism. The identification of these P-450s was accomplished through studies using 1) simple regression analysis with 14 phenotyped human liver samples, 2) selective chemical inhibitors, and 3) microsomes containing cDNA-expressed enzymes. The production of some metabolites is enhanced in vitro when the pH of the incubation media is shifted from pH 7.4 to 8.5. The metabolite production in human liver microsomes was NADPH-dependent, suggesting that the metabolism of Lu 25-109 in human liver microsomes is primarily P-450-dependent. Lu 25-109 was metabolized by human liver microsomes to Lu 31-126 (de-ethyl Lu 25-109) mainly by CYP2D6; to Lu 29-297 [3-(2-ethyltetrazol-5-yl)-1-methyl-pyridinium] and Lu 25-077 (demethyl Lu 25-109) mainly by CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4; and to Lu 32-181 (Lu 25-109 N-oxide) by CYP1A2 and possibly by CYP2C19. One metabolite, Lu 32-181 (N-oxide), could be reduced back to Lu 25-109, a reaction not inhibited by the applied cytochrome P-450 inhibitors. This study did not indicate any involvement of FMO3 or MAO in the in vitro metabolism of Lu 25-109 in human liver microsomes.
