33368054|t|MicroRNA: An Emerging Predictive, Diagnostic, Prognostic and Therapeutic Strategy in Ischaemic Stroke.
33368054|a|Stroke continues to be the third-leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The limited availability of diagnostic tools approved therapeutics and biomarkers that help monitor disease progression or predict future events remain as the major challenges in the field of stroke medicine. Hence, attempts to discover safe and efficacious therapeutics and reliable biomarkers are of paramount importance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that play important roles in regulating gene expression. Since miRNAs also play important roles in key mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of stroke, including energy failure, inflammation and cell death, it is possible that miRNAs may serve as reliable blood-based markers for risk prediction, diagnosis and prognosis of ischaemic stroke. Discovery of better neurological outcome and smaller cerebral infarcts in animal models of ischaemic stroke treated with miRNA agomirs or antagomirs indicate that miRNAs may also play a cerebrovascular protective role after an ischaemic stroke. Nonetheless, further evidences on the optimum time for treatment and route of administration are required before effective translation of these findings into clinical practice. Bearing these in mind, this paper reviews the current literature discussing the involvement of miRNAs in major pathologies associated with ischaemic stroke and evaluates their value as reliable biomarkers and therapeutics for ischaemic stroke.
