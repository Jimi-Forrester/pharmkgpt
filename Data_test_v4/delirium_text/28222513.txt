28222513|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia frequently presents with aggression, agitation, and disorganized behavior for which current treatment is partially effective and is associated with significant adverse effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to retrospectively assess the clinical effectiveness and tolerability of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in a sample of patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia (NPS) and to explore factors associated with response and with cognitive adverse effects. METHODS: We examined the clinical records of 25 patients with dementia and a pre-existing psychiatric disorder treated with ECT at an academic mental health hospital between April 1, 2010 and January 28, 2016. Twenty-nine acute ECT courses and fifteen maintenance courses were reviewed. We assessed treatment effectiveness and cognitive adverse effects as well as factors associated with response to treatment, including pre-existing psychiatric disorders, concomitant pharmacological treatment and types of dementia. RESULTS: ECT resulted in a clinically meaningful response in 72% of acute treatment courses. Cognitive adverse effects affecting functioning were reported in 7% of the acute treatment courses. Maintenance treatment was effective in sustaining the response in 87% of treatment courses with two reports of significant cognitive adverse effects. One patient fell and experienced a hip fracture a day after treatment. Use of antipsychotic or antidepressant medications, pre-existing psychiatric disorder, or gender were not associated with response. CONCLUSION: This study shows meaningful clinical effectiveness and good tolerability of ECT in patients with severe NPS of dementia. Furthermore, maintenance ECT was effective in sustaining treatment response.
