18945600|t|Atrophy and decreased activation of fronto-parietal attention areas contribute to higher visual dysfunction in posterior cortical atrophy.
18945600|a|Voxel-based morphometry and functional magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated severe atrophy and decreased activation of visual attention areas and occipital lobes in a patient with early posterior cortical atrophy compared with healthy controls and patients with early Alzheimer's disease. Our complex approach indicates that structures responsible for attention can be damaged early in posterior cortical atrophy and may contribute to the characteristic decline in higher visual functions.
