33630269|t|Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approach to Sleep Disorders, High Blood Pressure and Cardiovascular Diseases: A Consensus Document by the Italian Society of Hypertension (SIIA).
33630269|a|Hypertension is a major contributor to fatal/nonfatal cardiovascular diseases, and timely identification and appropriate management of factors affecting hypertension and its control are mandatory public health issues. By inducing neurohormonal alterations and metabolic impairment, sleep disorders have an impact on a variety of cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, and ultimately increase the risk of cardiovascular events. There is evidence that qualitative and quantitative sleep disorders are associated with resistant hypertension and with impaired circadian blood pressure variations. However, sleep disturbances are often unrecognized, or heterogeneity exists in their management by non-specialists in the field. This document by the Italian Society of Hypertension summarizes the updated evidence linking sleep disorders to hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, the major underlying mechanisms, and the possible management strategies. A simplified, evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for comorbid hypertension and common sleep disorders, namely obstructive sleep apnoea and insomnia, is proposed.
