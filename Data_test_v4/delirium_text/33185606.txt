33185606|a|BACKGROUND: Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), an important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, induces long-term hippocampal damage and hyperexcitability. On the other hand, studies support that propylparaben (PPB) induces hippocampal neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases. OBJECTIVE: Experiments were designed to evaluate the effects of subchronic treatment with PPB on TBI-induced changes in the hippocampus of rats. METHODS: Severe TBI was induced using the lateral fluid percussion model. Subsequently, rats received subchronic administration with PPB (178 mg/kg, TBI+PPB) or vehicle (TBI+PEG) daily for 5 days. The following changes were examined during the experimental procedure: sensorimotor dysfunction, changes in hippocampal excitability, as well as neuronal damage and volume. RESULTS: TBI+PEG group showed sensorimotor dysfunction (p < 0.001), hyperexcitability (64.2%, p < 0.001), and low neuronal preservation ipsi- and contralateral to the trauma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis revealed lower volume (17.2%; p < 0.01) and great damage to the ipsilateral hippocampus. TBI+PPB group showed sensorimotor dysfunction that was partially reversed 30 days after trauma. This group showed hippocampal excitability and neuronal preservation similar to the control group. However, MRI analysis revealed lower hippocampal volume (p < 0.05) when compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: The present study confirms that post-TBI subchronic administration with PPB reduces the long-term consequences of trauma in the hippocampus. Implications of PPB as a neuroprotective strategy to prevent the development of Alzheimer's disease as consequence of TBI are discussed.
