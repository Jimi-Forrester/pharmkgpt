30062395|a|BACKGROUND: We measured whole body distribution of 11C-BU99008, a new PET biomarker for non-invasive identification of the imidazoline2 binding site. The purpose of this phase I study was to evaluate the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of 11C-BU99008 in healthy human subjects. METHODS: A single bolus injection of 11C-BU99008 (296 +- 10.5 MBq) was administered to four healthy subjects who underwent whole-body PET/CT over 120 min from the cranial vertex to the mid-thigh. Volumes of interest were drawn around visually identifiable source organs to generate time-activity curves (TAC). Residence times were determined from time-activity curves. Absorbed doses to individual organs and the whole body effective dose were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 1.1 for each subject. RESULTS: The highest measured activity concentration was in the kidney and spleen. The longest residence time was in the muscle at 0.100 +- 0.023 h, followed by the liver at 0.067 +- 0.015 h and lungs at 0.052 +- 0.010 h. The highest mean organ absorbed dose was within the heart wall (0.028 +- 0.002 mGy/MBq), followed by the kidneys (0.026 +- 0.005 mGy/MBq). The critical organ was the heart wall. The total mean effective dose averaged over subjects was estimated to be 0.0056 +- 0.0004 mSv/MBq for an injection of 11C-BU99008. CONCLUSIONS: The biodistribution of 11C-BU99008 has been shown here for the first time in humans. Our dosimetry data showed the total mean effective dose over all subjects was 0.0056 +- 0.0004 mSv/MBq, which would result in a total effective dose of 1.96 mSv for a typical injection of 350 MBq of 11C-BU99008. The effective dose is not appreciably different from those obtained with other 11C tracers.
