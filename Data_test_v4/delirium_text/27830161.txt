27830161|a|Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been reported to be effective for alleviation of neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions as well as enhancement of memory and cognition. Despite the positive effects of tDCS in humans, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Recently, we reported that astrocytes, a major glial cell type in the brain, show an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels during tDCS in the cerebral cortex of the awake mouse. This tDCS-induced elevation in astrocytic Ca2+ has subsequently been demonstrated to be important for cortical plasticity. In this commentary article, we discuss possible interpretations and implications of our findings from the viewpoint of neuron-glia interactions.
