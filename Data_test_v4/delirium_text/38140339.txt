38140339|t|A Comprehensive Review of the Effects of Glycemic Carbohydrates on the Neurocognitive Functions Based on Gut Microenvironment Regulation and Glycemic Fluctuation Control.
38140339|a|Improper glycemic carbohydrates (GCs) consumption can be a potential risk factor for metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes, which may lead to cognitive impairment. Although several potential mechanisms have been studied, the biological relationship between carbohydrate consumption and neurocognitive impairment is still uncertain. In this review, the main effects and mechanisms of GCs' digestive characteristics on cognitive functions are comprehensively elucidated. Additionally, healthier carbohydrate selection, a reliable research model, and future directions are discussed. Individuals in their early and late lives and patients with metabolic diseases are highly susceptible to dietary-induced cognitive impairment. It is well known that gut function is closely related to dietary patterns. Unhealthy carbohydrate diet-induced gut microenvironment disorders negatively impact cognitive functions through the gut-brain axis. Moreover, severe glycemic fluctuations, due to rapidly digestible carbohydrate consumption or metabolic diseases, can impair neurocognitive functions by disrupting glucose metabolism, dysregulating calcium homeostasis, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and accumulating advanced glycation end products. Unstable glycemic status can lead to more severe neurological impairment than persistent hyperglycemia. Slow-digested or resistant carbohydrates might contribute to better neurocognitive functions due to stable glycemic response and healthier gut functions than fully gelatinized starch and nutritive sugars.
