38077175|t|Investigating the Glucagon-like Peptide-1 and Its Receptor in Human Brain: Distribution of Expression, Functional Implications, Age-related Changes and Species Specific Characteristics.
38077175|a|Introduction: Emerging evidence has shown that the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist can be used to treat Alzheimer disease; however, knowledge of its neural targets is limited. To understand the neural substrates of GLP-1, we have done whole brain mapping for GLP-1 and its receptor (GLP-1R), in 30 human brains. Methods: GLP-1 expression was studied by immuno-histochemistry and confirmed by the western blot method. The GLP-1R gene expression was studied by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: GLP-1 expression was observed in most of the cortical areas (maximum in frontal, prefrontal and parietal cortex), diencephalon, and brainstem, but not in the cerebellum. Protein expression studies validated these results. The highest expression of GLP-1R was found in the frontal cortex. The orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellum had negligible expression. Hippocampus demonstrated a significant presence of GLP-1R but patchy immunoreactivity to GLP-1. GLP-1R presence in most of the human cortical regions and absence in the cerebellum is the major deviation from the animal brain. Sites that might be of interest in Alzheimer have been identified. GLP-1 demonstrated an age-related decline in most of the areas after the fifth decade. At 60 years, GLP-1 was not found in any of the cortical areas except in the prefrontal cortex; however, it was present in the sub-cortical areas. Conclusion: Age-related profiling of GLP-1 in various brain areas has been analyzed, which can have an important bearing on understanding Alzheimer disease. This study provides a detailed description of GLP-1 and an brain mapping for the first time and may lead to novel treatment options targeting the GLP-1 receptors. Highlights: Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist can be used for treating Alzheime'rs disease.GLP-1 gene expression was seen in cortical areas, diencephalon and brainstem, but not in cerebellum.Hippocampus demonstrated significant presence of GLP-1R but patchy immunoreactivity to GLP-1.GLP-1 demonstrated age related decline in most of the areas after fifth decade.A detailed description of GLP-1 and amp; GLP-1R locations was given which may lead to novel treatment options. Plain Language Summary: Emerging evidence has shown that the glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP1-1) agonist can be used for treating Alzheimer's disease but knowledge of its neural targets is limited. To understand the neural substrates of GLP-1, we have done whole brain mapping for GLP-1 and its receptor (GLP-1R), in 30 human brains. GLP-1 expression was studied by immuno-histochemistry and confirmed by western blot method. GLP-1R gene expression was studied by RT-PCR. GLP-1 expression was seen in most of the cortical areas (maximum in frontal, prefrontal & amp; parietal cortex), diencephalon and brainstem, but not in cerebellum. Protein expression studies validated these results. Highest expression of GLP-1R was found in the frontal cortex. The orbito-frontal cortex and cerebellum had negligible expression. Hippocampus demonstrated significant presence of GLP-1R but patchy immunoreactivity to GLP-1. GLP-1R presence in most of the human cortical regions and absence in cerebellum is the major deviation from the animal brain. Sites which might be of interest in Alzheimer's have been identified. GLP-1 demonstrated age related decline in most of the areas after 5 th decade. At 60 years GLP-1 was not found in any of the cortical areas except in the prefrontal cortex but it was present in the sub-cortical areas. Age related profiling of GLP-1 in various brain areas has been analysed, which can have important bearing on understanding the Alzheimer's. This study provides detailed description of GLP-1 and ations by complete human brain mapping for the first time and may lead to novel treatment options targeting the GLP-1 receptors.
