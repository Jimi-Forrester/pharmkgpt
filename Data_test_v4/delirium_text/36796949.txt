36796949|t|Neurodegenerative disorders: From clinicopathology convergence to systems biology divergence.
36796949|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are multifactorial. This means that several genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors contribute to their emergence. Therefore, for the future management of these highly prevalent diseases, it is necessary to change perspective. If a holistic viewpoint is assumed, the phenotype (the clinicopathological convergence) emerges from the perturbation of a complex system of functional interactions among proteins (systems biology divergence). The systems biology top-down approach starts with the unbiased collection of sets of data generated through one or more -omics techniques and has the aim to identify the networks and the components that participate in the generation of a phenotype (disease), often without any available a priori knowledge. The principle behind the top-down method is that the molecular components that respond similarly to experimental perturbations are somehow functionally related. This allows the study of complex and relatively poorly characterized diseases without requiring extensive knowledge of the processes under investigation. In this chapter, the use of a global approach will be applied to the comprehension of neurodegeneration, with a particular focus on the two most prevalent ones, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The final purpose is to distinguish disease subtypes (even with similar clinical manifestations) to launch a future of precision medicine for patients with these disorders.
