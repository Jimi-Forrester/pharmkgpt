34950812|t|Proximal femoral fracture outcomes in inpatients and community patients: A comparative study.
34950812|a|OBJECTIVES: 7% of proximal femoral fractures occur in patients admitted to hospital for unrelated medical and surgical presentations. This comparative study will assess morbidity and mortality in patients sustaining proximal femoral fractures both as inpatients and in the community. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients admitted to a regional specialist hip unit with fracture of the proximal femur sustained both from the community and other inpatient settings. Patient demographics, risk factors and outcomes were recorded and analysed - with focus on 30-day and 1-year mortality. RESULTS: 3445 patients were admitted over a 10-year period, 292 of which sustained proximal femoral fractures as an inpatient. 30-day and 1-year mortality was 23.7% and 47.9% respectively in the inpatient group, compared to 6.9% and 22.4% respectively in the community group. Mean time from presentation to operating room was 27.8 hours for the inpatient group, compared to 25.2 hours for the community group. CONCLUSION: Inpatients who sustain a proximal femoral fracture have significantly higher 30-day and 1-year mortality rates when compared to patients in the community sustaining the same injury. There is also a noted delay to theatre in this patient group.
