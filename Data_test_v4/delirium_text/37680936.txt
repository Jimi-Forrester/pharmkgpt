37680936|a|Background: Anticoagulants prevent thrombosis in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and venous thromboembolism but increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications. If severe bleeding occurs with anticoagulant use, discontinuation and rapid reversal are essential. However, the optimal timing for resuming anticoagulants after using reversal agents remains unclear. Here, we report early cerebral infarction following the use of andexanet alfa (AA), a specific reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors, in a patient with traumatic acute subdural hematoma (ASDH). The possible causes of thromboembolic complication and the optimal timing for anticoagulant resumption are discussed. Case Description: An 84-year-old woman receiving rivaroxaban for AF presented with impaired consciousness after a head injury. Computed tomography (CT) revealed right ASDH. The patient was administered AA and underwent craniotomy. Although the hematoma was entirely removed, she developed multiple cerebral infarctions 10 h after the surgery. These infarctions were considered cardiogenic cerebral embolisms and rivaroxaban was therefore resumed on the same day. This case indicates the possibility of early cerebral infarction after using a specific reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors. Conclusion: Most studies suggest that the safest time for resuming anticoagulants after using reversal agents is between 7 and 12 days. The present case showed that embolic complications may develop much earlier than expected. Early readministration of anticoagulant may allow for adequate prevention of the acute thrombotic syndromes.
