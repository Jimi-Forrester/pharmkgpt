23583480|t|Longitudinal white matter changes in Alzheimer's disease: a tractography-based analysis study.
23583480|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) classically presents with gray matter atrophy, as well as feature significant white matter abnormalities. Previous evidence indicates the overall burden of these pathological changes continues to advance as the disease progresses. The aim of this study was to investigate whether pathological alterations of white matter tracts correlate with the course of AD disease progression. 35 AD patients and 29 normal controls were recruited to the study and administered baseline magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) acquisition and a cognitive function assessment at the time of initial evaluation. Subjects were re-evaluated with secondary DTI scan and cognitive function assessment at intervals of about 1.5 years on average. For the DTI acquired scans, we calculated diffusion tensor parameters, fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), radial diffusivity (DR), and axial diffusivity (DA) along with the uncinate fasciculus (UNC), the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus (IOFF). Compared to baseline, a significant mean FA reduction of the bilateral UNC, as well as a significant mean DR increase of the left UNC, was evident in AD patients at follow-up. Compared with normal controls, AD patients exhibited significant diffusion parameter abnormalities in their UNC, ILF, and IOFF. Taken together, these results indicate that progressive pathological white matter alterations can be quantified using the DTI parameters utilized here and may prove to be a useful biological marker for monitoring the pathophysiological course of AD.
