36918870|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, is caused by loss of neurons and synapses in central nervous system. Several causes for neuronal death in AD have been introduced, the most important of which are extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation and aggregated tau proteins. Increasing evidence suggest that targeting the process of Abeta production to reduce its deposition can serve as a therapeutic option for AD management. In this regard, therapeutic interventions shown that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein (ADAM) 10, involved in non-amyloidogenic pathway of amyloid precursor protein processing, is known to be a suitable candidate. Therefore, this review aims to examine the molecular properties of ADAM10, its role in AD, and introduce it as a therapeutic target to reduce the progression of the disease. Video abstract.
