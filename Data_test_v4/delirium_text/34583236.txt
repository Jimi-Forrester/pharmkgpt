34583236|t|The association among apathy, leisure activity participation, and severity of dementia in nursing home residents with Alzheimer's disease: A cross-sectional study.
34583236|a|The purpose of this study was to examine 1) the relationship between apathy and leisure activity participation in nursing home residents with Alzheimer disease (AD) and 2) the moderator effect of the severity of dementia on this relationship. Data were collected from 290 residents with AD using the Apathy Evaluation Scale-informant version (AES-I), Leisure Activities Questionnaire (LAQ), and Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR). The multiple linear regression model showed that leisure activity participation (beta=-0.452, p<0.001) was negatively associated with apathy, while the severity of dementia (beta=0.515, p<0.001) was positively associated with apathy. The severity of dementia moderated the effect of leisure activity participation on apathy (beta=-0.108, p=0.015). The results indicate that the effects of leisure activity participation on apathy diminish with the aggravation of AD. The severity of dementia should be considered when designing and delivering leisure activity interventions to manage apathy in nursing home residents with AD.
