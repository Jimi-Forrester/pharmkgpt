1136536|a|There is an increasing occurrence of drug-intoxications in infancy, thus psychopathological changes due to intoxication also occur more frequently in children. 6 children were described with cases of acute and reversible toxic psychoses whose--mainly visual--hallucinations together with conditions of excitation and hyperactivity were the most striking features of the psychopathological picture; in contrast to the more frequent delirious confusion (delirium) disturbances of consciousness and orientation were missing. The phenomenological characteristics of halucinosis in children-a condition so far not specified in the case of infants and children-have been elaborated with regard to other psychotic phenomena during infancy and adult age. Relevant neurophysiological and psychodevelopmental findings lead to the following four theorems: 1. Drugs with hallucinotic effects facilitate the occurrence of "internal" pictures independent of external perceptions which are described phenomenologically as hallucinations. This theory is based on the fact that hallucinogenic drugs intensify the electrical potentials which are evoked by optic stimulation in the visual area, while an intracortical impulse propagation is inhibited. 2. A change in emotion either caused by situation or by exogenous or endogenous factors facilitates the development of hallucinations, especially if emotions dominate to such a degree that rational control of reality is being suppressed. Since hallucinogenic drugs exert their effects not only on the sensory system but also on brain structures which influence directly or indirectly emotional functions, hallucinations might also be evoked via this mechanism. 3. Brain stem has-apart from its importance in emotional processes-a filter effect and a controlling function of sensoric stimuli originating in the periphery. Hallucinogenic drugs can influence this screening function and have a disinhibitory effect which cause an inundation of the brain cortex by sensoric stimuli which again facilitate hallucinations. 4. The neurophysiological actions discussed above which are caused by intoxications have a synergistic effect together with the psycho-developmental facts relevant to infancy. This synergism can explain the frequent occurrence of fever hallucinoses as well as the fact that agents primarily not hallucinogenic as e.g. benzydamine can also cause hallucinations in infancy.
