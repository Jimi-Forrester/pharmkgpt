32082082|a|The occurrence of neurodegenerative disease is increasingly raised. From physiopathological aspect, the emergence of auto-reactive antibodies against the nervous system antigens contributes to de-myelination in Multiple sclerosis (MS). These features cause the nervous system dysfunction. The follow-up of molecular alterations could give us a real-state vision about intracellular status during pathological circumstances. In this review, we focus on the autophagic response during MS progression and further understand the relationship between autophagy and MS and its modulatory effect on the MS evolution. The authors reviewed studies published on the autophagy status in neurodegenerative disease and on the autophagy modulation in MS prognosis, diagnosis, and possible therapies. The inevitable role of autophagy was shown in the early-stage progression of MS. Due to critical role of autophagy in different stage of cell activity in nervous system, the distinct role of autophagy should not be neglected in the development, pathogenesis, and treatment of MS.
