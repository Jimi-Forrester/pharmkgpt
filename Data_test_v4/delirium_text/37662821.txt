37662821|t|Nutritional, pharmacological, and sensory properties of maple syrup: A comprehensive review.
37662821|a|Maple syrup is a naturally sweet product consumed directly or introduced in the preparation of various maple-derived food products. Several studies have described the chemical isolation and identification of maple syrup compounds, with some presenting pharmacological properties. However, a detailed review on maple syrup nutritional properties has not been undertaken. This review presents detailed information about the nutritional, organoleptic, and pharmacological properties of maple syrup. Studies carried out on animal models and a limited number of human models emphasize the potential benefits of maple syrup as a substitute for refined sugars, indicating that it could contribute to improved metabolic health when used in moderation. However, further medical and nutritional health studies based on human health assessments are needed to better understand the mechanisms of action of the various components of maple syrup and its potential therapeutic properties to demonstrate a stronger justification for its consumption relative to refined sugars. In addition, we compare maple syrup and common sweeteners to provide a further critical perspective on the potential nutritional and health benefits of maple syrup.
