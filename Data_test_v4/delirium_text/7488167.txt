7488167|t|The role of iron in beta amyloid toxicity.
7488167|a|There is evidence that oxidative damage plays a causative role in Alzheimer's disease and amyloid beta protein (A beta) toxicity. Iron is frequently a potent facilitator of free radical production due to its ability to mediate the conversion of H2O2 to hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction or by virtue of hypervalent iron compounds. It is shown here that iron facilitates A beta toxicity to cultured cells.
