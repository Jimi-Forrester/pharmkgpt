37571270|t|Exploring the Effects of a Mediterranean Diet and Weight Loss on the Gut Microbiome and Cognitive Performance in Older, African American Obese Adults: A Post Hoc Analysis.
37571270|a|African American adults have a higher prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) than non-Hispanic Whites. The impact of a Mediterranean Diet (Med Diet) and intentional weight loss (IWL) on the gut microbiome may alter AD risk. A post hoc analysis of the Building Research in Diet and Cognition (BRIDGE) trial was performed to determine whether participation in an 8-month Med Diet lifestyle intervention with (n = 35) or without IWL (n = 31) was associated with changes in gut microbiota structure, abundance, and function and whether these changes were related to changes in cognitive performance. The results showed that family and genus alpha diversity increased significantly in both groups combined (p = 0.0075 and p = 0.024, respectively). However, there were no other significant microbially related within- or between-group changes over time. Also, an increase in Med Diet adherence was significantly associated with a decrease in alpha diversity at the phylum level only (p = 0.049). Increasing alpha diversity was associated with decreasing cognitive performance, but this association was attenuated after controlling for Med Diet adherence. In sum, an 8-month Med Diet lifestyle intervention with or without IWL did not appreciably alter the gut microbiome.
