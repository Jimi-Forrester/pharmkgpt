30817919|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium affects up to 50% of patients undergoing esophagectomy and is associated with negative outcomes. The perioperative risk factors for delirium in this population are not well understood. We conducted this study to assess perioperative risk factors for postoperative delirium among esophagectomy patients. METHODS: We performed a secondary data analysis of patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of haloperidol prophylaxis postoperatively in reducing delirium among esophagectomy patients. Postoperative delirium was assessed twice daily using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the association between perioperative variables and development of postoperative delirium. RESULTS: Of 84 consecutive esophagectomy patients, postoperative delirium developed in 27 (32%). These patients had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (22.1 [SD, 6.5] vs 17.4 [SD, 6.8]; p = 0.003), longer mechanical ventilation days (1.7 [SD, 1.4] days vs 1.0 [SD, 1.1] days; p = 0.001), and longer intensive care unit (ICU) days (5.1 [SD, 2.6] days vs 2.6 [SD, 1.6] days; p < 0.001). In a logistic regression model, only ICU length of stay had a significant association with postoperative delirium (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 2.25). CONCLUSIONS: ICU length of stay was significantly associated with postoperative delirium. Other perioperative factors, including duration of procedure, blood loss, and hemoglobin levels, were not significantly associated with postoperative delirium.
