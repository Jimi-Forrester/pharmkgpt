39070111|a|There are very few treatments in psychiatry, even in medicine, that have experienced longevity and effectiveness such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), despite the controversies and stigma that accompany it. The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to strengthen mental health systems in most countries, given that depression is one of the leading health problems and that there is an evident shortage of psychiatrists worldwide. The Fourth Industrial Revolution, has witnessed great progress in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which opens up the possibility of its application both in the diagnosis and in the therapy of mental disorders. It is no exaggeration to suggest that tools such as AI, neuroimaging and blood tests will bring significant change to psychiatry in the coming years, but even so, treating severe mental disorders remains a challenge. The present review summarized the development of ECT over time, its application in clinical practice, neurobiological correlates and mechanisms of action and sheds light on the important place of ECT in the era of technological development, considering that ECT is still the most effective therapy for the treatment of severe mental disorders, especially depressive disorder.
