The aim of the present study was to detect whether increased inflammatory activity at baseline could predict cognitive and functional decline in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or AD dementia after 2 years. METHODS: Serum samples from 242 memory clinic patients with an aMCI (n=88) or AD dementia (n=154) were analyzed for C-reactive protein and for 14 other inflammatory markers [interleukin (IL)-1beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-17a, IL-18, IL-22, IL-33, tumor necrosis factor, cluster of differentiation 40 ligand, interferon-gamma, chemokine ligand (CCL) 2, and CCL4] by bead-based multiplex immunoassay. Disease progression was measured by the annual increase in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and annual decrease in the score on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). RESULTS: No association between increased levels of the inflammatory markers and change on the CDR-SB or MMSE score was found, but there was a significant difference in baseline IL-6 and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist levels between aMCI and AD dementia groups. CONCLUSION: Increased levels of inflammatory markers were not associated with faster progression as measured by the annual change on the CDR-SB or MMSE score.
