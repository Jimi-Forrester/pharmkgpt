This article reviews the current understanding of how vascular dysfunction contributes to cognitive impairment and dementia risk in older individuals and includes updated diagnostic criteria and treatment recommendations. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: Clinical and research criteria have been evolving to more accurately determine the full prevalence of vascular cognitive impairment. The Boston Criteria version 2.0 for cerebral amyloid angiopathy now includes multiple punctate MRI T2 white matter hyperintensities and MR-visible perivascular spaces in addition to previously described T2* hemorrhagic signatures. MR-visible perivascular spaces are associated with both vascular cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease, potentially linking cerebrovascular dysfunction to neurodegenerative disorders through its role in brain waste clearance. The American Heart Association's goal for cardiovascular health promotion, "Life's Essential 8," has been updated to include sleep health and acknowledges psychological well-being and social determinants of health as fundamental components necessary to achieve optimal cardiovascular health for all adults. ESSENTIAL POINTS: Vascular cognitive impairment is a common and often underrecognized contributor to cognitive impairment in older individuals, with heterogeneous etiologies requiring individualized treatment strategies. Effective cerebrovascular disease risk factor modification starting in midlife is critical to reducing the risk of Alzheimer disease and related dementias, with the goal of preventing vascular brain injury and maintaining cognitive reserve in the presence of nonvascular age-related brain pathologies.
