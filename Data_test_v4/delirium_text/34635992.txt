34635992|a|Numerous studies observed a link between the herpes smplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and Alzheimer's disease. However, the exact viral and cellular dynamics that lead from an HSV-1 infection to Alzheimer's disease are unknown. In this paper, we use the microcompetition model to formulate these dynamics by connecting seemingly unconnected observations reported in the literature. We concentrate on four pathologies characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. First, we explain how an increase in the copy number of HSV-1 during latency can decrease the expression of BECN1/Beclin1, the degradative trafficking protein, which, in turn, can cause a dysregulation of autophagy and Alzheimer's disease. Second, we show how an increase in the copy number of the latent HSV-1 can decrease the expression of many genes important for mitochondrial genome metabolism, respiratory chain, and homeostasis, which can lead to oxidative stress and neuronal damage, resulting in Alzheimer's disease. Third, we describe how an increase in this copy number can reduce the concentration of the NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2b (Grin1 and Grin2b genes), and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which can cause an impaired synaptic plasticity, Abeta accumulation and eventually Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we show how an increase in the copy number of HSV-1 in neural stem/progenitor cells in the hippocampus during the latent phase can lead to an abnormal quantity and quality of neurogenesis, and the clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease. Since the current understanding of the dynamics and homeostasis of the HSV-1 reservoir during latency is limited, the proposed model represents only a first step towards a complete understanding of the relationship between the copy number of HSV-1 during latency and Alzheimer's disease.
