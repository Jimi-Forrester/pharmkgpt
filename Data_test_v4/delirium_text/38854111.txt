38854111|t|Endogenous tau released from human ReNCell VM cultures by neuronal activity is phosphorylated at multiple sites.
38854111|a|Tau is an intracellular protein but also known to be released into the extracellular fluid. Tau release mechanisms have drawn intense attention as these are known to play a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, tau can also be released under physiological conditions although its physiological function and release mechanisms have been poorly characterized, especially in human neuronal cells. We investigated endogenous tau release in ReNCell VM, a human neuroprogenitor cell line, under physiological conditions and found that tau is spontaneously released from cells. To study activity-dependent release of endogenous tau, human ReNCell VM culture was stimulated by 100muM AMPA or 50mM KCl for one-hour, tau was actively released to the culture medium. The released tau was highly phosphorylated at nine phosphorylation sites (pSites) detected by phospho-specific tau antibodies including AT270 (T175/T181), AT8 (S202/T205), AT100 (T212/S214), AT180 (T231), and PHF-1 (S396/S404), showing that these pSites are important for activity-dependent tau release from human ReNCell VM. Intracellular tau showed various phosphorylation status across these sites, with AT270 and PHF-1 highly phosphorylated while AT8 and AT180 were minimally phosphorylated, suggesting that AT8 and AT180 pSites exhibit a propensity for secretion rather than being retained intracellularly. This activity-dependent tau release was significantly decreased by inhibition of GSK-3beta, demonstrating that GSK3beta-dependent phosphorylation of tau plays an important role in its release by neuronal activity. In this study, we showed that ReNCell VM serves as a valuable model for studying endogenous physiological tau release. Further, ReNCell model can be also used to study pathological release of human tau that will contribute to our understanding of the progression of AD and related dementias.
