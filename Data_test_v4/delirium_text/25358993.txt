25358993|a|The negative effects of hospital admission for older people are well known. Hospital-acquired delirium is possibly the most influential risk factor for falls and fractures, incontinence, pressure ulcers, increased mortality, long-term institutionalisation, long-term cognitive decline, extensive length of hospital stay and associated financial cost ( National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2010 , Kostas and Rudolph 2013 ). If carried out consistently, multicomponent intervention to address preventable risk factors, for example, immobility, dehydration, constipation, malnutrition and disorientation, will reduce incidence of new cases and duration of the condition ( Inouye et al 1999 , 2000 ).
