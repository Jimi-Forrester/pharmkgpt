38830998|a|INTRODUCTION: Cemented hip hemiarthroplasty is a routine surgical option for elderly neck of femur (NOF) fractures. It is uncertain if quality of cementing has any effect on functional outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine if the quality of cementing would affect short term functional outcomes in elderly neck of femur fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 637 single-centre cemented hip hemiarthroplasties from 2014 to 2021 was performed. Each post-operative radiograph was double-read by 2 authors (1 resident and 1 fellowship trained surgeon) to determine quality of cementing via the Barrack grading. Disagreements were reviewed by a third reader. Cement grades were grouped as Optimal (Barrack grade A-B), or Suboptimal (Barrack grade C-D). Functional outcomes were compared using mobility (community- or home-ambulant), assistance required for mobility, and Modified Barthel Index (MBI). Surgical parameters were compared between the groups. RESULTS: There were 429 Optimal and 208 Suboptimal cases of cementing performed. There was no difference in age, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, mobility, assistance required, and MBI score pre-operatively (p > 0.05). Patients in the "Suboptimal" cementing group had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score (p < 0.001). At 1 year post-operation, there was no significant difference between "Optimal" and "Suboptimal" cementing with regards to the proportion of community ambulators (30.2% vs. 25.7%, p = 0.252), walking independence (independent walkers (19.8% vs.17.3%), independent walkers with aids (41.3%vs.42.1%), walker with caregiver assistance (29.2%vs.33.7%), wheelchair-bound (9.6%vs.6.9%), p = 0.478), and distribution of MBI score (81.1%vs.82.2% achieving MBI > 60, p = 0.767). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with postoperative delirium (7.9% vs. 5.8, p = 0.324) or 1-year mortality rates (3.5% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.685). Except for stem design (12.2% tapered vs 20.1% collared; p = 0.011), no other surgical parameters were significantly different. The kappa value for inter-reader agreement was "substantial" at 0.727 (95% CI 0.682-0.772) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Quality of cementing in cemented hip hemiarthroplasty for elderly NOF fractures does not affect the short-term functional outcomes. In low demand patients and patients at risk of BCIS, optimal cementing may not be necessary to achieve similar short-term functional outcomes. Further studies should be conducted to determine the effect of sub-optimal cementing on long-term functional outcomes.
