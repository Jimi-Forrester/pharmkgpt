11823923|a|The treatment of the cognitive deficits has been the major focus in patients with Alzheimer's disease (DAT) so far. Recently there is increasing interest in Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD), which can place much burden on DAT patients and their caregivers. With the introduction of Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors (AChEI) of the second generation the therapeutic armament has been extended. The clinical evaluation of AChEI has found growing evidence that these compounds do not only improve cognitive abilities and activities of daily living (ADL), but also BPSD. The given data regarding the three AChEI available on the market allow the conclusion that there is a general improvement in BPSD. Beside these particularly positive effects on hallucinations, mood symptoms, aggressiveness, and agitation seem possible but need further clarification.
