31117310|t|Chitosan-based (Nano)materials for Novel Biomedical Applications.
31117310|a|Chitosan-based nanomaterials have attracted significant attention in the biomedical field because of their unique biodegradable, biocompatible, non-toxic, and antimicrobial nature. Multiple perspectives of the proposed antibacterial effect and mode of action of chitosan-based nanomaterials are reviewed. Chitosan is presented as an ideal biomaterial for antimicrobial wound dressings that can either be fabricated alone in its native form or upgraded and incorporated with antibiotics, metallic antimicrobial particles, natural compounds and extracts in order to increase the antimicrobial effect. Since chitosan and its derivatives can enhance drug permeability across the blood-brain barrier, they can be also used as effective brain drug delivery carriers. Some of the recent chitosan formulations for brain uptake of various drugs are presented. The use of chitosan and its derivatives in other biomedical applications is also briefly discussed.
