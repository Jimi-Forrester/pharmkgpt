30501965|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent chronic neurodegenerative disease. Current approved therapies are symptomatic treatments having some effect on cognitive function. Therapies that target beta-amyloid (Abeta) have been the focus of efforts to develop a disease modification treatment for AD but these approaches have failed to show any clinical benefit so far. Beyond the 'Abeta hypothesis', there are a number of newer approaches to treat AD with neuroinflammation emerging as a very active area of research based on risk gene analysis. This short review will summarize approved drug therapies, recent clinical trials and new approaches for the treatment of AD.
