36852244|a|Objectives: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder associated with insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, and sub-infertility. Virgin coconut oil (VCO) has been reported to have health benefits, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and antiviral properties. This study investigated the effects of dietary VCO supplementation on memory and cognitive impairment in female rats with letrozole induced PCOS. Methods: Thirty female rats were randomly divided into five groups. All rats except controls were treated with letrozole for 21 days to induce PCOS and were subsequently treated for 14 days with 10% VCO, clomiphene (CLO), or VCO + CLO. Three neurobehavioral tests were conducted: elevated plus maze, Y maze, and novel object recognition tests. Results: Our results indicated statistically elevated serum concentrations of sex hormones in rats with PCOS, compared with the control and treated groups. In addition, all treated groups showed significant reversal of the low serum concentrations of catalase and down-regulated gene expression of Nrf2 in the hippocampus seen in the PCOS rats. In addition, gene expression of acetylcholine esterase was up-regulated in PCOS rats, and was statistically reverted in the VCO treated groups. Conclusion: Anxiety-like behavior and impaired short-term memory were observed in PCOS rats; however, VCO supplementation reversed these effects by modulating the gene expression of Nrf2 and AchE.
