26880665|t|Efficient MoS2 Exfoliation by Cross-beta-Amyloid Nanotubes for Multistimuli-Responsive and Biodegradable Aqueous Dispersions.
26880665|a|Herein, we report the efficient exfoliation of MoS2 in aqueous medium by short cationic peptide nanotubes featuring the nucleating core (17) LVFFA(21) of beta-amyloid (Abeta 1-42), a sequence associated with Alzheimer's disease. The role of morphology, length, and nature of the amyloid surface on exfoliation/dispersions of MoS2 were investigated through specific mutations of the amyloid sequences. Notably, owing to the properties of both the constituents, self-assembled soft nanostructures and MoS2 , the hybrid dispersions responded reversibly to various stimuli, including temperature, pH, and light. Addition of a protease resulted in loss of the dispersions, which are otherwise stable for months at ambient conditions. The design flexibility of the peptide sequences, along with the stimuli-responsiveness and biodegradability, can complement the applications of MoS2 in diverse fields.
