34880207|a|MicroRNA-132/212 has been supposed as a critical gene related to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) protection after stroke, but its regulation pathway including the upstream regulator and downstream targets is still unclear. Herein, we demonstrated the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivator-1 (CRTC1) to be the upstream regulator of miRNA-132/212 using CRTC1 knockout and wild-type mice. CRTC1 deletion led to the reduction of miRNA-132/212 expression in mice brain after ischemic stroke, significantly increased infarct volume, and aggravated BBB permeability with worsening neurological deficits. Furthermore, we identified that miRNA-132 repressed Claudin-1, tight junction-associated protein-1 (TJAP-1), and RNA-binding Fox-1 (RBFox-1) by directly binding to their respective 3'-untranslated regions, which alleviated the ischemic damage by enhancing neuronal survival and BBB integrity. Moreover, the co-culture of endothelial cells with CRTC1-deficient neurons aggravated the cell vulnerability to hypoxia, also supporting the idea that miRNA-132/212 cluster is regulated by CRTC1 and acts as a crucial role in the mitigation of ischemic damage. This work is a step forward for understanding the role of miRNA-132/212 in neurovascular interaction and may be helpful for potential gene therapy of ischemic stroke.
