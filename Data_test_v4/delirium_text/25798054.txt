25798054|a|BACKGROUND: Past studies have shown that aspirin and statins decrease the rate and severity of exacerbation, the rate of hospitalization, and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although these studies are relatively new, there is evidence that new therapeutic strategies could prevent exacerbation of COPD. TRIAL DESIGN: This article examines retrospectively the possibility of using aspirin and statins to prevent exacerbation and infection in patients with COPD. METHODS: All patients with COPD were identified from hospital charts in the Department of Internal Medicine, Saarland University Medical Center, Germany, between 2004 and 2014. RESULTS: The study examined 514 medical reports and secured a study population of 300 with COPD. The mean age was 69 +- 10 years (206 men, 68.7%, 95% CI, 63.4-73.9; 94 women, 31.3%, 95% CI, 26.1-36.6). The study results did not show a causal relationship between aspirin and statins and prevention of exacerbation and infection in patients with COPD. CONCLUSION: In contrast, in this study, the exacerbation and infection rates increased under medication with aspirin and statins (p = 0.008).
