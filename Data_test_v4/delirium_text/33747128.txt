33747128|t|An update on magnetic resonance imaging markers in AD.
33747128|a|The purpose of the present review is to provide an update of the available recent scientific literature on the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). MRI is playing an increasingly important role in the characterization of the AD signatures, which can be useful in both the diagnostic process and monitoring of disease progression. Furthermore, this technique is unique in assessing brain structure and function and provides a deep understanding of in vivo evolution of cerebral pathology. In the reviewing process, we established a priori criteria and we thoroughly searched the very recent scientific literature (January 2018-March 2020) for relevant articles on this topic. In summary, we selected 73 articles out of 1654 publications retrieved from PubMed. Based on this selection, this review summarizes the recent application of MRI in clinical trials, defining the predementia stages of AD, the clinical utility of MRI, proposal of novel biomarkers and brain regions of interest, and assessing the relationship between MRI and cognitive features, risk and protective factors of AD. Finally, the value of a multiparametric approach in clinical and preclinical stages of AD is discussed.
