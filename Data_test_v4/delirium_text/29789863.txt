29789863|a|It is a long-standing paradigm in the field of virology that naked viruses cause lysis of infected cells to release progeny virus. However, recent data indicate that naked virus types of the Picornaviridae and Hepeviridae families can also leave cells via an alternative route involving enclosure in fully host-derived lipid bilayers. The resulting particles resemble extracellular vesicles (EV), which are 50 nm-1 mum vesicles released by all cells. These EV contain lipids, proteins, and RNA, and generally serve as vehicles for intercellular communication in various (patho)physiological processes. EV can act as carriers of naked viruses and as invisibility cloaks to evade immune attacks. However, the exact combination of virions and host-derived molecules determines how these virus-containing EV affect spread of infection and/or triggering of antiviral immune responses. An underexposed aspect in this research area is that infected cells likely release multiple types of virus-induced and constitutively released EV with unique molecular composition and function. In this review, we identify virus-, cell-, and environment-specific factors that shape the EV population released by naked virus-infected cells. In addition, current findings on the formation and molecular composition of EV induced by different virus types will be compared and placed in the context of the widely proven heterogeneity of EV populations and biases caused by different EV isolation methodologies. Close interactions between the fields of EV biology and virology will help to further delineate the intricate relationship between EV and naked viruses and its relevance for viral life cycles and outcomes of viral infections.
