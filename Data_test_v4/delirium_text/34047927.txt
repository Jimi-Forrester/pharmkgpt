34047927|t|Adiponectin: a potential target for obesity-associated Alzheimer's disease.
34047927|a|Obesity and dementia are two growing problems worldwide. Obesity act as a crucial risk factor for various diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several preclinical studies showed that middle-age obesity can be act as a possible feature of mild cognitive impairment in later years. Some studies have also demonstrated that a high-fat diet causes AD pathology, including extracellular amyloid-beta accumulation, hyperphosphorylation of tau, and cognition impairment. The correlation and molecular mechanism related to obesity-associated AD needs to be better evaluated. Presently, obesity results in an altered expression of several hormones, growth factors, and adipokines. Multiple signaling pathways such as leptin, insulin, adiponectin, and glutamate are involved to regulate vital functions in the brain and act as neuroprotective mediators for AD in a normal state. In obesity, altered adiponectin (APN) level and its associated downstream pathway could result in multiple signaling pathway disruption. Presently, Adiponectin and its inducers or agonist are considered as potential therapeutics for obesity-associated AD. This review mainly focuses on the pleiotropic effects of adiponectin and its potential to treat obesity-associated AD.
