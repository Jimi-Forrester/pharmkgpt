34121615|t|In silico analysis of glycosylation pattern in 5th-6th repeat sequence of reelin glycoprotein.
34121615|a|Reelin is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that plays a key role in cortical development, maturation, synaptic plasticity, and memory formation in the adult mammalian brain. Glycosylation is a significant post- and co-translational modification of proteins. Although glycosylation contributes to the characteristic of proteins from their production to molecular interactions, the knowledge about the glycosylation pattern of reelin is very limited. In this study, we aimed to predict the potential glycosylation pattern of the 5th-6th repeat of central reelin fragment that responsible for their signaling, by using in silico methods. We found that the predicted glycosylation pattern of the 5th-6th repeat of human reelin was highly conserved between vertebrate species. However, this conservation was not observed in analyzed invertebrates. For the first time, we described the sites of glycosylation at a three-dimensional protein structure in human reelin. Because the sites were very closed to EGF-like repeats and receptor binding sites, they could contribute the interaction with a partner of reelin in addition to the effect of thermostability to protein. Many of the residues related glycosylation were also conserved in analyzed species. These findings may guide biochemical, genetic, and glycobiology base on further experiments about reelin glycosylation. The understanding of reelin glycosylation might change the point of view of treatment for many pathological conditions in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
