38199510|a|Extensive preclinical evidence demonstrates a causative link between insulin signaling dysfunction and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and diabetic drugs may represent a promising approach to fighting AD. However, it remains to be determined which antidiabetic drugs are more effective in preventing cognitive impairment. Thus, the present study investigated the effect of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor linagliptin on cognitive impairment in middle-aged mice by comparing it with the effect of metformin. We found that DPP-4 activity increased in the hippocampus of middle-aged mice, and DPP-4 was mainly expressed by microglia rather than astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. DPP-4 directly regulated M1/M2 microglia polarization following LPS or IL-4 stimulation, while DPP-4 inhibitor, linagliptin, suppressed M1-polarized activation and induced M2-polarized activation. Both linagliptin and metformin enhanced cognitive ability, increased hippocampal synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, and decreased age-related oxidative stress and inflammation by regulating microglia polarization in the hippocampus of middle-aged mice. The combination of linagliptin and metformin showed a maximum protective effect compared to the individual drugs alone. Loss of macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), a DPP-4 substrate, abrogated the cognitive protection and anti-inflammation effects of linagliptin. Therefore, the current investigation exhibits a potential utility for DPP-4 inhibition in attenuating microglia-mediated inflammation and preventing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in middle-aged mice, and the effect was partly mediated by MIP-1alpha.
