28335215|a|Recently, the use of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, in particular rapamycin (Rp), has been suggested to improve the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, as Rp is a strong immunosuppressant, specific delivery to the brain has been postulated to avoid systemic exposure. In this work, we fabricated new Rp loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (Rp-SLN) stabilized with polysorbate 80 (PS80), comparing two different methods and lipids. The formulations were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and particle tracking. In vitro release and short-term stability were assessed. Biological behavior of Rp-SLN was tested in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The inhibition of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) was evaluated over time by a pulse-chase study compared to free Rp and Rp nanocrystals. Compritol Rp-SLN resulted more stable and possessing proper size and surface properties with respect to cetyl palmitate Rp-SLN. Rapamycin was entrapped in an amorphous form in the solid lipid matrix that showed partial crystallinity with stable Lbeta, sub-Lalpha and Lbeta' arrangements. PS80 was stably anchored on particle surface. No drug release was observed over 24 h and Rp-SLN had a higher cell uptake and a more sustained effect over a week. The mTORC1 inhibition was higher with Rp-SLN. Overall, compritol Rp-SLN show suitable characteristics and stability to be considered for further investigation as Rp brain delivery system.
