17557548|a|Psychotic conditions of iatrogenic nature form a non-negligible portion of psychiatric practice. In this paper we present a case of a 62-year-old patient with the primary diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis-induced cirrhosis who following the orthotopic liver transplantation developed an episode of depressive psychosis. The appearance of symptoms and signs directly correlated with the administration of the maximal dose of cyclosporine. The dose was upwardly titrated because the laboratory results (an increase in transaminase level) had indicated the transplant rejection. Because psychiatric and neurological examinations prior to the episode showed no abnormalities, other plausible causative factors such as the level of cholesterol and magnesium and the concomitant therapy were also analysed. In contrast to the more frequent cyclosporine-induced delirium, cyclosporine-induced depressive psychosis has been rarely reported in the literature.
