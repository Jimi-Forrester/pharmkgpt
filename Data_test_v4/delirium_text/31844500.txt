31844500|a|There are contradictory results or lack of validity studies concerning the naming function and brain laterality. Although anomia is a frequent symptom of memory impairment, and the most relevant symptom of aphasia, few studies have been conducted to evaluate its validity for detecting patients with left-hemisphere damage (LD), as per the MeSH definition. OBJECTIVE: To validate a paper-and-pencil confrontation naming test (CNT) according to side of brain injury; to select a valid and reliable abbreviated CNT wherein the effect of demographic variables is minimized; and to use the selected CNT to develop a computer-aided confrontation-naming evaluation (CACNE). METHODS: Control data were obtained from 213 healthy participants (HP) aged 15 to 89 years. A subsample of 106 HP was demographically matched to 39 patients with LD and 40 patients with right-hemisphere damage (RD). Anomia definition and CNT cues were considered for the CACNE. RESULTS: Test-retest and inter-rater reliability, internal consistency, and validity for detecting LD were demonstrated. A significant age effect was observed in HP. The CACNE was developed to detect anomia in interaction with environmental interventions. CONCLUSION: The inconsistencies observed in the CNT studies were probably due to the presence of anomia in almost 50% of the RD patients.
