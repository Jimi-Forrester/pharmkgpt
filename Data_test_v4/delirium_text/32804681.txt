32804681|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease that leads to significant morbidities in elderly. The major pathological hallmark of AD is beta-amyloid plaques (Abeta) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) deposition in hippocampus of the brain. These abnormal protein deposition damages neuronal cells resulting in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. As a result of limited treatment options available for this disease, there is huge economic burden for patients and social health care system. Thus, alternative approaches (lifestyle intervention) to prevent this disease are extremely important. In this systemic review, we summarized epidemiological evidence of lifestyle intervention and the mechanisms involved in delaying and/or preventing AD. Lifestyle interventions include education, social engagement and cognitive stimulation, smoking, exercise, depression and psychological stress, cerebrovascular disease (CVD), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity and diet. The methods are based on a literature review of available sources found on the research topic in four acknowledged databases: Web of Science, Scopus, Medline and PubMed. Results of the identified original studies revealed that lifestyle interventions have significant effects and our conclusion is that combination of early lifestyle interventions can decrease the risk of developing AD.
