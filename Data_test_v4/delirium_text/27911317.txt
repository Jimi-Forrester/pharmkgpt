27911317|t|Alzheimer's Disease Histological and Behavioral Manifestations in Transgenic Mice Correlate with Specific Gut Microbiome State.
27911317|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative brain disease and is the most common form of dementia. In recent years, many studies indicated the association of gut microbiota changes with metabolic diseases. However, the gut microbiota of AD has not been investigated. The present study aims to compare the gut microbiota in APP/PS1 transgenic mice of AD and C57/Bl6 wild-type (WT) mice by pyrosequencing the V3 and V4 regions of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes. The 3-, 6-, and 8-month-old APP/PS1 and WT mice were used to explore the effects of age on the gut microbiota. First, the results indicated that impaired spatial learning and memory appeared in 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice and was further aggravated in the 8-month-old group, which was consistent with immunohistochemical studies of amyloid plaque. Second, AD histological and behavioral manifestations in the APP/PS1 mice were found to be correlated with a specific gut microbiome state. Third, the microbiota diversity of APP/PS1 mice decreased with increased age. Fourth, further inspection showed that the abundance of Helicobacteraceae and Desulfovibrionaceae at the family level and Odoribacter and Helicobacter at the genus level increased significantly in APP/PS1 mice than in WT mice, while Prevotella abundance in WT mice was significantly higher than in APP/PS1 mice. More human studies are warranted to explore the potential of gut microbiota as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic target for AD.
