38324515|a|We aimed to examine the potential effect of sex on the longitudinal association of baseline serum uric acid levels with brain amyloid accumulation over time among older adults with and without abnormal amyloid. At baseline, the study sample comprised 499 older adults, including 276 men and 223 women. Linear mixed-effects regression models were fitted to estimate the individual slopes of change in brain amyloid accumulation [as measured by AV45 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR)] over time. At baseline, we did not observe a relationship between serum uric acid levels and brain amyloid deposition in women or men regardless of amyloid status. Among amyloid negative subjects, women and men did not differ in the relationship between baseline serum uric acid and the annual change in amyloid accumulation in subjects with normal amyloid levels. In amyloid positive women, serum uric acid levels were not associated with the annual change in amyloid accumulation (unstandardized beta = 0.0005, SE = 0.0006, p value = 0.4179). However, in amyloid positive men, serum uric acid levels were negatively associated with the annual change in amyloid accumulation (unstandardized beta = -0.0015, SE = 0.0005, p value = 0.0048). These findings support a potential sex-specific effect on the relationship between serum uric acid levels and amyloid accumulation among amyloid positive older adults.
