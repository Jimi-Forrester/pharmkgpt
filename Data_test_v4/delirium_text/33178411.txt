33178411|t|Follow-Up of Advanced Parkinson's Disease Patients after Clinical or Surgical Emergencies: A Practical Approach.
33178411|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced stage Parkinson's disease (PD) typically present with a myriad of motor and nonmotor symptoms in addition to comorbidities and, as a consequence, polypharmacy. OBJECTIVE: To analyze a series of cases of advanced PD in which a clinical or surgical emergency played a trigger role in the irreversible progression of landmarks of the course of the disease. METHODS: Data were collected during a 13-month observational period of a cohort of 230 PD patients, in 751 medical appointments. We included a total of 13 (5.65% of the total number) patients with advanced PD defined by Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage >=3 who presented with various clinical and surgical complications which, with the contribution of drug interventions, led to significant worsening of patients' overall clinical condition. RESULTS: Hip fractures and infections were the most common complications identified. As part of this scenario, most patients presented with delirium, often requiring treatment with dopamine receptor blocking agents and/or had dopaminergic treatment withdrawn. Upon reassessment after 3 months, all patients remained bed or wheel chair bound (H&Y 5) and presented significant worsening of their UPDRS part III score of at least 10 points (mean 51.5 +- 3.3; paired t-test two-tailed p < 0.0001 compared to baseline). The mean dose of levodopa at baseline was 907.7 +- 149.8 mg (600-1200) and significantly higher (paired t-test two-tailed p < 0.0001) on follow-up, 1061.5 +- 175.8 mg (700-1300). CONCLUSION: Clinical and surgical emergencies are major determinants for a progression of PD to more advanced stages.
