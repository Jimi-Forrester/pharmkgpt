35606712|a|BACKGROUND: Physical activity guidelines for adults with disability, chronic conditions, and pregnancy (i.e., specific populations) have been developed to provide guidance for engaging in physical activity. However, specific populations remain considerably less physically active compared to the general population, presenting a knowledge-practice gap. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic scoping review was to identify and evaluate strategies for disseminating and implementing physical activity guidelines among specific populations and/or stakeholders (e.g., healthcare professionals) in Canada. METHODS: Five search approaches (peer-reviewed literature databases, grey literature database, custom Google search engines, targeted web-based searches, and content expert consultation) identified records documenting and/or evaluating strategies that had been used to disseminate or implement guidelines from a predetermined list. Systematic and scoping review protocols were followed. Risk of bias assessments were conducted for all studies that evaluated strategies. RESULTS: Eighty-one records reported dissemination strategies (n = 42), implementation strategies (n = 28), or both (n = 11). Twenty-two studies reporting on 29 evaluated strategies were deemed "serious" or "high" risk of bias. Common guideline dissemination and implementation strategies are deliberated and recommendations for future practice are made. CONCLUSIONS: Findings may inform future dissemination and implementation efforts for physical activity guidelines in Canada or similar countries.
