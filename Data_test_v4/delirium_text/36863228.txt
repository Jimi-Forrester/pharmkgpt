36863228|t|New insights in the development of positive allosteric modulators of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors belonging to 3,4-dihydro-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine 1,1-dioxides: Introduction of (mono/difluoro)methyl groups at the 2-position of the thiadiazine ring.
36863228|a|Positive allosteric modulators of the AMPA receptors (AMPAR PAMs) have been proposed as new drugs for the management of various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, and schizophrenia. The present study explored new AMPAR PAMs belonging to 3,4-dihydro-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine 1,1-dioxides (BTDs) characterized by the presence of a short alkyl substituent at the 2-position of the heterocycle and by the presence or absence of a methyl group at the 3-position. The introduction of a monofluoromethyl or a difluoromethyl side chain at the 2-position instead of the methyl group was examined. 7-Chloro-4-cyclopropyl-2-fluoromethyl-3,4-dihydro-4H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine 1,1-dioxide (15e) emerged as the most promising compound associating high in vitro potency on AMPA receptors, a favorable safety profile in vivo and a marked efficacy as a cognitive enhancer after oral administration in mice. Stability studies in aqueous medium suggested that 15e could be considered, at least in part, as a precursor of the corresponding 2-hydroxymethyl-substituted analogue and the known AMPAR modulator 7-chloro-4-cyclopropyl-3,4-dihydro-4H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine 1,1-dioxide (3) devoid of an alkyl group at the 2-position.
