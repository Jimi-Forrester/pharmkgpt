35175442|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in clinical presentations and the impact of healthcare organization on outcomes of neurological COVID-19 patients admitted during the first and second pandemic waves. METHODS: In this single-center cohort study, we included all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to a Neuro-COVID Unit. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were compared between patients admitted during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-three patients were included, of whom 112 and 111 were hospitalized during the first and second pandemic waves, respectively. Patients admitted during the second wave were younger and exhibited pulmonary COVID-19 severity, resulting in less oxygen support (n = 41, 36.9% vs n = 79, 70.5%, p < 0.001) and lower mortality rates (14.4% vs 31.3%, p = 0.004). The different healthcare strategies and early steroid treatment emerged as significant predictors of mortality independently from age, pre-morbid conditions and COVID-19 severity in Cox regression analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in healthcare strategies during the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic probably explain the differences in clinical outcomes independently of disease severity, underlying the importance of standardized early management of neurological patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
