31758499|a|Immunization against beta-amyloid (Abeta) is pursued as a possible strategy for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In clinical trials, Abeta 1-42 proved poorly immunogenic and caused severe adverse effects; therefore, safer and more immunogenic candidate vaccines are needed. Multimeric protein (1-11)E2 is able to induce an antibody response to Abeta, immunological memory, and IL-4 production, with no concomitant anti-Abeta T cell response. Antisera recognize Abeta oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils. In this study, we evaluated the effect of prophylactic immunization with three doses of (1-11)E2 in alum in the 3xTg mouse model of AD. Immunization with (1-11)E2 efficiently induced anti-Abeta antibodies, but afforded no protection against Abeta accumulation and neuroinflammation. The identification of the features of the anti-Abeta immune response that correlate with the ability to prevent Abeta accumulation remains an open problem that deserves further investigation.
