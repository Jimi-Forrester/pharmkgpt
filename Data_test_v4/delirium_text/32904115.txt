32904115|t|Association Between Common Infections and Incident Post-Stroke Dementia: A Cohort Study Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.
32904115|a|PURPOSE: To investigate the association between common infections and post-stroke dementia in a UK population-based cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60,392 stroke survivors (51.2% male, median age 74.3 years, IQR 63.9-82.4 years) were identified using primary care records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) with no history of dementia. Primary exposure was any GP-recorded infection (lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), urinary tract infection (UTI) requiring antibiotics, skin and soft tissue infection requiring antibiotics) occurring after stroke. The primary outcome was incident all-cause dementia recorded in primary care records. In sensitivity analyses, we restricted to individuals with linked hospital records and expanded definitions to include ICD-10 coded hospital admissions. We used multivariable Cox regression to investigate the association between common infections and dementia occurring from 3 months to 5 years after stroke. RESULTS: Of 60,392 stroke survivors, 20,969 (34.7%) experienced at least one infection and overall 4512 (7.5%) developed dementia during follow-up. Early dementia (3 months to 1-year post-stroke) risk was increased in those with at least one GP-recorded infection (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.21-1.71), with stronger associations when hospitalised infections were included (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.58-2.14). Late dementia (1-5 years) was only associated with hospitalised, but not with GP-recorded, infections. CONCLUSION: There was evidence of an association between common infections and post-stroke dementia, strongest in the 3-12 months following stroke. Better understanding of this relationship could help inform knowledge of pathways to dementia post-stroke and targeting of preventive interventions.
