36384493|a|BACKGROUND: Delayed-onset post stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) results from secondary neurodegeneration induced by stroke. Whereas targeted prevention or treatment strategies are still missing due to lack of evidences. This trial aims to evaluate the preventive effects of DL-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) on delayed-onset PSCI. METHODS: Effects of NBP on Delayed-onset Post Stroke Cognitive Impairment (End-PSCI) is a prospective, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment. Hospital patients with acute cerebral infarction (within 2 weeks of onset) will be randomized into either standard medical therapy group or standard medical therapy combined NBP treatment group (NBP 200 mg, three times per day for 24 weeks). The primary outcome is the difference of incidence of delayed-onset PSCI between two groups. The secondary outcomes include difference of white matter degeneration, cognitive scores and prevalence of early-onset PSCI between two groups. DISCUSSION: End-PSCI trial will provide evidences for NBP preventing delayed-onset PSCI. The secondary outcomes will also provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of delayed-onset PSCI and mechanism of NBP's actions.
