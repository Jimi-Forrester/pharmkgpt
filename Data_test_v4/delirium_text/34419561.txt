34419561|a|The natural product Huperzine A isolated from Huperzia serrata is a targeted inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase that has been approved for clinical use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Given the large demand for natural sources of Huperzine A  (Hup. A), efforts have been made to explore whether it is also produced by endophytic fungi from H. serrata and, if so, identify its biosynthetic pathway. These studies have indicated that endophytic fungi from H. serrata represent a huge and largely untapped resource for natural products (including Hup. A) with chemical structures that have been optimized by evolution for biological and ecological relevance. To date, more than three hundred endophytic fungi have been isolated from H. serrata, of which 9 strains can produce Hup. A, whilst more than 20 strains produce other important metabolites, such as polyketones, xanthones, alkaloids, steroids, triterpenoids, furanone derivatives, tremulane sesquitepenes and diterpenoids. In total, 200 secondary metabolites have been characterized in endophytic fungi from H. serrata to date. Functionally, some have cholinesterase-inhibitory or antibacterial activity. This review also considers the different classes of secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungi, along with their possible applications. We systematically describe the taxonomy, biology, and chemistry of these secondary metabolites. It also summarizes the biosynthetic synthesis of metabolites, including that of Hup. A. The review will aid researchers in obtaining a clearer understanding of this plant-endophyte relationship to better exploit the excellent resources it offers that may be utilized by pharmaceutical industries.
