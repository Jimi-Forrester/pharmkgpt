30182268|t|[Trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures].
30182268|a|Proximal femoral fractures are one of the most common fractures, particularly in older people. The most common cause is a falling event due to dizziness and gait insecurity. In most cases prompt surgical treatment is necessary to achieve early mobilization and to reduce the risk of mortality. The aim is a stable osteosynthesis and patient-centered care. A great variety of implants are available for this purpose. Furthermore, perioperative management is important to prevent further problematic events, such as delirium, reoccurrence of falling events and to diagnose and adequately treat a pre-existing osteoporosis.
