38454549|t|Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Older Adults: What We Know and What We Have Yet to Learn.
38454549|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the growing use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems by older adults and explore additional areas integration that could benefit adults with frailty. BACKGROUND: The use of CGM devices has expanded rapidly in the last decade. This has been supported by substantial data showing significant benefit in glycemic metrics: hemoglobin A1c improvements, less hypoglycemia, and improved quality of life. However, sub-populations, such as older persons, exist where available data are limited. Furthermore, frail older adults represent a heterogeneous population with their own unique challenges to the management of diabetes. This group has some of the poorest outcomes related to the sequela of diabetes. For example, hypoglycemia resulting in significant morbidity and mortality is more frequent in older person with diabetes than in younger persons with diabetes. METHOD: We present a concise literature review on CGM use in the older adult as well as expand upon glycemic and non-glycemic benefits of CGM for patients, caregivers, and providers. Retrospective analysis of inpatient glycemic data of 16,935 older adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist indicated those with fraility managed with insulin or sulfonylurea had the highest rates of delirium (4.8%), hypoglycemia (3.5%), cardiovascular complications (20.2%) and ED visits/hospitalizatoins (49%). In addition, we address special consideration of specific situations including inpatient, palliative and long term care settings. CONCLUSION: This review article summarizes the available data for CGM use in older adults, discusses the benefits and obstacles with CGM use in this population, and identifies areas of future research needed for improved delivery of care to older persons with diabetes.
