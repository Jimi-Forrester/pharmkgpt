37981012|a|Obesity is a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction and neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The gut microbiota-brain axis is altered in obesity and linked to cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we targeted obesity-induced cognitive impairment by testing the impact of the probiotic Clostridium butyricum, which has previously shown beneficial effects on gut homeostasis and brain function. Firstly, we characterized and analyzed the gut microbial profiles of participants with obesity and the correlation between gut microbiota and cognitive scores. Then, using an obese mouse model induced by a Western-style diet (high-fat and fiber-deficient diet), the effects of Clostridium butyricum on the microbiota-gut-brain axis and hippocampal cognitive function were evaluated. Finally, fecal microbiota transplantation was performed to assess the functional link between Clostridium butyricum remodeling gut microbiota and hippocampal synaptic protein and cognitive behaviors. Our results showed that participants with obesity had gut microbiota dysbiosis characterized by an increase in phylum Proteobacteria and a decrease in Clostridium butyricum, which were closely associated with cognitive decline. In diet-induced obese mice, oral Clostridium butyricum supplementation significantly alleviated cognitive impairment, attenuated the deficit of hippocampal neurite outgrowth and synaptic ultrastructure, improved hippocampal transcriptome related to synapses and dendrites; a comparison of the effects of Clostridium butyricum in mice against human AD datasets revealed that many of the genes changes in AD were reversed by Clostridium butyricum; concurrently, Clostridium butyricum also prevented gut microbiota dysbiosis, colonic barrier impairment and inflammation, and attenuated endotoxemia. Importantly, fecal microbiota transplantation from donor-obese mice with Clostridium butyricum supplementation facilitated cognitive variables and colonic integrity compared with from donor obese mice, highlighting that Clostridium butyricum's impact on cognitive function is largely due to its ability to remodel gut microbiota. Our findings provide the first insights into the neuroprotective effects of Clostridium butyricum on obesity-associated cognitive impairments and neurodegeneration via the gut microbiota-gut-brain axis.
