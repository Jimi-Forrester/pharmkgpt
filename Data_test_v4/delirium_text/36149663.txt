36149663|a|Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by excessive amyloid beta protein-induced neurotoxicity. However, drugs targeting amyloid beta protein production face many problems, such as the low utilization rate of drugs by cells and the difficulty of drugs in penetrating the blood-brain barrier. A tetrahedral framework nucleic acid is a new type of nanonucleic acid structure that functions as a therapy and drug carrier. Here, we synthesized a BACE1 aptamer-modified tetrahedral framework nucleic acid and tested its therapeutic effect on Alzheimer's disease in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated that the tetrahedral framework nucleic acid could be used as a carrier to deliver the BACE1 aptamer to the brain to reduce the production of amyloid beta proteins. It also played an antiapoptotic role by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, this nanomaterial is a potential drug for Alzheimer's disease.
