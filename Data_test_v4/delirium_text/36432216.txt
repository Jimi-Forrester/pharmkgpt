36432216|t|Recent Progress in Morphology-Tuned Nanomaterials for the Electrochemical Detection of Heavy Metals.
36432216|a|Heavy metals are one of the most important classes of environmental pollutants which are toxic to living beings. Many efforts are made by scientists to fabricate better sensors for the identification and quantification of heavy metal ions (HMI) in water and food samples to ensure good health. Electrocatalysts have been demonstrated to play an important role in enhancing the sensitivity and selectivity of HMI detection in electrochemical sensors. In this review, we presented morphologically well-tuned nanomaterials used as efficient sensor materials. Based on the molecular dimensions, shapes, and orientation, nanomaterials can be classified into 0-D, 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D nanomaterials. Active surface areas with significant exposure of active sites and adsorption-desorption abilities are extensively varied with dimensionality, which in turn ultimately influence the sensing performance for HMI.
