26746670|t|Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Protects Neurons from Ischemic Damage via Upregulation of Superoxide Dismutase 3.
26746670|a|Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has been shown to protect oligodendrocytes from ischemia by upregulating endogenous antioxidants. The goal of this study was to determine whether LIF protects neurons during stroke by upregulating superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3). Animals were administered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 125 mug/kg LIF at 6, 24, and 48 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion or sham surgery. Neurons were isolated from rat pups on embryonic day 18 and used between 7 and 15 days in culture. Cells were treated with LIF and/or 10 muM Akt inhibitor IV with PBS and 0.1 % DMSO acting as vehicle controls. Neurons transfected with scrambled or SOD3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) were subjected to 24-h ischemia after PBS or LIF treatment. LIF significantly increased superoxide dismutase activity and SOD3 expression in ipsilateral brain tissue compared to PBS. Following 24-h ischemia, LIF reduced cell death and increased SOD3 messenger RNA (mRNA) in vitro compared to PBS. Adding Akt inhibitor IV with LIF counteracted the decrease in cell death. Partially silencing the expression of SOD3 using siRNA prior to LIF treatment counteracted the protective effect of LIF-alone PBS treatment. These results indicate that LIF protects neurons in vivo and in vitro via upregulation of SOD3.
