11434421|a|Myeloperoxidase (MPO), an enzyme found in lysosomes of phagocytes, causes hydroxy radicals linked to DNA damage and activation of smoking related carcinogens. A -463 G/A polymorphism in the promoter region of the MPO gene results in reduced gene expression, which would imply lower susceptibility of esophageal cancer in mutant carriers. We conducted case-control study to test this hypothesis. Cases were 91 patients with esophageal cancer and controls were 241 non-cancer outpatients. MPO genotypes were examined by PCR-RFLP. The allele frequency for MPO -463A was found to be 8.2% for cases and 10.5% for controls. The age, sex, smoking and drinking status adjusted odds ratio for all subjects for MPO -463 GG/GA as compared to the AA was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.28-1.32). The adjusted odds ratio for the GG/GA genotype was significantly low (0.15; 0.03-0.76, P=0.022) for those aged 61 years or older who had a significantly higher odds ratio for smoking than younger subjects. No difference was observed in disease risk when prevalent and incident cases were compared. Although there are limitations for interpretation of this study because of prevalent case-control study and partial statistical significance, these results suggest that MPO -463 A allele reduce the risk of esophageal cancer.
