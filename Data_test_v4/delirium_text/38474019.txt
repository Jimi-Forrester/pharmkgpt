38474019|t|Proteomic Analysis of a Rat Streptozotocin Model Shows Dysregulated Biological Pathways Implicated in Alzheimer's Disease.
38474019|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive impairment, affecting 35 million individuals worldwide. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of low to moderate doses of streptozotocin (STZ) in adult male Wistar rats can reproduce classical physiopathological hallmarks of AD. This biological model is known as ICV-STZ. Most studies are focused on the description of behavioral and morphological aspects of the ICV-STZ model. However, knowledge regarding the molecular aspects of the ICV-STZ model is still incipient. Therefore, this work is a first attempt to provide a wide proteome description of the ICV-STZ model based on mass spectrometry (MS). To achieve that, samples from the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) of the ICV-STZ model and control (wild-type) were used. Differential protein abundance, pathway, and network analysis were performed based on the protein identification and quantification of the samples. Our analysis revealed dysregulated biological pathways implicated in the early stages of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), based on differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). Some of these DAPs had their mRNA expression further investigated through qRT-PCR. Our results shed light on the AD onset and demonstrate the ICV-STZ as a valid model for LOAD proteome description.
