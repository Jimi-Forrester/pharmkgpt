29561417|t|Myoclonic movement after general anesthesia: A case report and review of the literature.
29561417|a|RATIONALE: Myoclonic movement is a rare side effect after general anesthesia. Since we use various intravenous agents during general anesthesia recently, it is troublesome to find out the exact cause of this neurologic complication. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 31-year-old female patient without any past medical history underwent hip arthroscopic surgery under general anesthesia. DIAGNOSES: Although there was no specific event during the operation, she showed a sudden myoclonic movement confined to left upper extremity in recovery room. INTERVENTIONS: We administered anticonvulsant agents intrvenously, the myoclonus was stopped shortly but recurred over again. As we stopped the patient-controlled analgesia due to nausea, the symptom halted. OUTCOMES: There was no significant abnormality in electroencephalography or brain diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, which was taken after the event. LESSONS: Clinicians should carefully consider the pharmacologic characteristics and neurologic adverse effects of all administered agents when myoclonus occurs after general anesthesia.
