29607417|t|Prognosis of Treatment Outcomes by Cognitive and Physical Scales.
29607417|a|The aim of this study was to assess the possibility of using scales for measuring cognitive and physical functions for a prognosis of care outcomes in elderly patients. METHODOLOGY: The survey was carried out in one of the Vilnius City Hospitals for Nursing and Support Treatment. A total number of 177 respondents were involved in the study. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), The Barthel Index (BI) and The Morse Fall Scale were used. RESULTS: A statistically significant correlation was revealed between the scores of MMSE and BI (Pearson R = 0.41, p < 0.01); those with severe cognitive impairment were more dependent. A statistically significant correlation (Pearson R = -0.181, p < 0.01) was reported between the scores of MMSE and the Morse Fall Scale - the risk of falling was higher in patients with severe cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: The Morse Fall Scale was not suitable for the prognosis of outcomes. The MMSE was suitable for the prognosis of a patient's discharge. The Barthel Index should be considered as the most suitable tool for the prognosis of care outcomes: the sum-score of the Barthel Index above 25 may suggest that the patient would be discharged home; the sum-score below this level was associated with a higher likelihood of patient death.
