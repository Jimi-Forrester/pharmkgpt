35935317|t|The Correlation between Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Retinal Vein Obstruction: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review.
35935317|a|Despite of inadequate evidence, previous studies have demonstrated a potential correlation between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO). In this study, a meta-analysis is conducted to investigate the correlation between OSA and RVO. Databases are searched for relevant literatures up to July 14, 2021, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, CNKI, WanFang, VIP, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM). The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) are estimated to evaluate the correlation between OSA and RVO. Six articles were finally enrolled, including 36,086 subjects from 5 case-controlled studies and 1 cohort study. It is clearly evident that the RVO risk is higher among OSA patients than non-OSA patients (OR = 3.24, 95% CI = 3.24). The results of sensitivity analysis indicate that the present meta-analysis is robust and reliable. Furthermore, Egger's test for publication bias is performed with P = 0.195, and the results reveal no significant publication bias. The findings demonstrate that OSA is significantly correlated with RVO, and OSA is a risk factor for RVO.
