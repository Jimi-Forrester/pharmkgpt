8910899|a|The expression of the presenilin 1 (PS-1) gene has been investigated by in situ hybridization in early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal control brain. Mutations in this gene are responsible for chromosome 14-linked FAD. We have found that presenilin 1 mRNA is present throughout the human brain with a distribution consistent with both a glial and neuronal localization. The in situ hybridization pattern was similar for the controls, the early onset FAD cases and the late onset AD cases. However, one of the two forms of the mRNA for PS-1, the long form (which contains a sequence encoding a four amino acid (VRSQ) insert at its 5' end) was significantly reduced in early onset FAD brain compared with late onset AD. We suggest that this long transcript may alter the normal pathway for processing of amyloid precursor protein, the protein which appears to be central in the pathogenesis of AD.
