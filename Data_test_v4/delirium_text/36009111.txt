36009111|t|Prediction of Cognitive Degeneration in Parkinson's Disease Patients Using a Machine Learning Method.
36009111|a|This study developed a predictive model for cognitive degeneration in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) using a machine learning method. The clinical data, plasma biomarkers, and neuropsychological test results of patients with PD were collected and utilized as model predictors. Machine learning methods comprising support vector machines (SVMs) and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to obtain a cognitive classification model. Using 32 comprehensive predictive parameters, the PCA-SVM classifier reached 92.3% accuracy and 0.929 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Furthermore, the accuracy could be increased to 100% and the AUC to 1.0 in a PCA-SVM model using only 13 carefully chosen features.
