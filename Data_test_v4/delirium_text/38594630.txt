38594630|t|Machine learning approach for predicting post-intubation hemodynamic instability (PIHI) index values: towards enhanced perioperative anesthesia quality and safety.
38594630|a|BACKGROUND: Adequate preoperative evaluation of the post-intubation hemodynamic instability (PIHI) is crucial for accurate risk assessment and efficient anesthesia management. However, the incorporation of this evaluation within a predictive framework have been insufficiently addressed and executed. This study aims to developed a machine learning approach for preoperatively and precisely predicting the PIHI index values. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the valid features were collected from 23,305 adult surgical patients at Peking Union Medical College Hospital between 2012 and 2020. Three hemodynamic response sequences including systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and heart rate, were utilized to design the post-intubation hemodynamic instability (PIHI) index by computing the integrated coefficient of variation (ICV) values. Different types of machine learning models were constructed to predict the ICV values, leveraging preoperative patient information and initiatory drug infusion. The models were trained and cross-validated based on balanced data using the SMOTETomek technique, and their performance was evaluated according to the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and R-squared index (R2). RESULTS: The ICV values were proved to be consistent with the anesthetists' ratings with Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.877 (P < 0.001), affirming its capability to effectively capture the PIHI variations. The extra tree regression model outperformed the other models in predicting the ICV values with the smallest MAE (0.0512, 95% CI: 0.0511-0.0513), RMSE (0.0792, 95% CI: 0.0790-0.0794), and MAPE (0.2086, 95% CI: 0.2077-0.2095) and the largest R2 (0.9047, 95% CI: 0.9043-0.9052). It was found that the features of age and preoperative hemodynamic status were the most important features for accurately predicting the ICV values. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the potential of the machine learning approach in predicting PIHI index values, thereby preoperatively informing anesthetists the possible anesthetic risk and enabling the implementation of individualized and precise anesthesia interventions.
