37664253|a|Scrub typhus is a vector-borne disease caused by gram-negative bacilli, Orientia tsutsugamushi. The vector of scrub typhus is the mite. The clinical manifestations often present with either a simple fever or life-threatening multi-organ dysfunction. Neurological manifestations also vary, and the incidence of neurological manifestations is unknown. Cerebellitis is one of the rare neurological manifestations associated with scrub typhus. In this case report, we present the case of a 35-year-old man who tested positive for scrub typhus (IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) blood test) with a history of fever and cerebellar signs and symptoms. He was managed with antibacterial agents and made a good recovery.
