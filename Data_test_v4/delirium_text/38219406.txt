We investigated relationships between motor-cortical plasticity and biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis in subjects with cognitive decline. METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive subjects who complained of memory problems participated in this study. We applied transcranial quadripuse stimulation with an interstimulus interval of 5 ms (QPS5) to induce LTP-like plasticity. Motor-evoked potentials were recorded from the right first-dorsal interosseous muscle before and after QPS5. Cognitive functions, Abeta42 and tau levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured. Amyloid positron-emission tomography (PET) with11C-Pittsburg compound-B was also conducted. We studied correlations of QPS5-induced plasticity with cognitive functions or AD-related biomarkers. RESULTS: QPS5-induced LTP-like plasticity positively correlated with cognitive scores. The degree of LTP-like plasticity negatively correlated with levels of CSF-tau, and the amount of amyloid-PET accumulation at the precuneus, and correlated with the CSF-Abeta42 level positively. In the amyloid-PET positive subjects, non-responder rate of QPS5 was higher than the CSF-tau positive rate. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that QPS5-induced LTP-like plasticity is a functional biomarker of AD. QPS5 could detect abnormality at earlier stages than CSF-tau in the amyloid-PET positive subjects. SIGNIFICANCE: Assessing motor-cortical plasticity could be a useful neurophysiological biomarker for AD pathology.
