38560678|t|Effect of butylphthalide on prevention and treatment of high altitude cerebral edema in rats.
38560678|a|3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) contains one of the main active ingredients of celery seed. It has a series of pharmacological mechanisms, including reconstitution of microcirculation, protection of mitochondrial function, inhibition of oxidative stress, and inhibition of neuronal apoptosis. Based on the complex multi-targeting of NBP pharmacological mechanisms, the clinical applications of NBP are increasing, and more and more clinical studies and animal experiments have focused on NBP. In this study, we used male Sprague Dawley rats as an animal model to elucidate the intervention effect of butylphthalide on high altitude cerebral edema (HACE), and also compared the effect of butylphthalide and rhodiola rosea on HACE. Firstly, we measured the changes of body weight and brain water content and observed the pathological changes of brain tissues. In addition, the contents of inflammatory factors, oxidative stress and brain neurotransmitters were assessed by enzyme-linked immunoassay kits, and finally, the expression of apoptotic proteins in brain tissues was determined by western blotting. The results showed that NBP reduced brain water content, attenuated brain tissue damage, altered inflammatory factors, oxidative stress indicators, and brain neurotransmitter levels, and in addition NBP inhibited the expression of Caspase-related apoptotic proteins. Therefore, NBP has the potential to treat and prevent HACE.
