37807776|a|BACKGROUND: The correlation between plasma adipose factor levels and Alzheimer's patients is not entirely clear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate associations between AD and plasma levels of three adipokines including plasma adiponectin, leptin, and resistin. METHODS: A single-center, cross-sectional study recruited AD patients (n = 148) and cognitively normal (CN) controls (n = 110). The multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to determine associations of adiponectin, leptin, and resistin with the presence of AD. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was employed to determine the diagnostic power of adiponectin, leptin and resistin for AD. RESULTS: After adjusted for the conventional risk factors, plasma levels of leptin (OR = 0.417, 95% CI: 0.272-0.638, p <  0.0001) and adiponectin (OR = 1.249, 95% CI: 1.151-1.354, p <  0.0001) were associated with the presence of AD. In total participants, the plasma adiponectin level was negatively correlated with MMSE scores (p <  0.0001) and was positively with CDR scores (p <  0.0001) and age (p <  0.0001). The plasma level of leptin was negatively correlated with CDR scores (p <  0.0001) and positively correlated with MMSE scores (p <  0.0001). Both adiponectin (p <  0. 0001) and leptin (p <  0. 0001) featured higher AUC than the random chance. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma adiponectin and leptin were associated with the presence, symptomatic severity, and diagnostic power of AD, suggesting a potential role of adipokines in the pathogenesis of AD.
