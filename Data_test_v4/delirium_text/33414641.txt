33414641|t|Saturated Fatty Acid Intake Is Associated With Increased Inflammation, Conversion of Kynurenine to Tryptophan, and Delta-9 Desaturase Activity in Healthy Humans.
33414641|a|Saturated fat ingestion has previously been linked to increases in inflammation. However the relationship between saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake and the kynureine:tryptophan ratio ([Kyn]:[Trp]), a marker of inflammation, has not been previously investigated. This study evaluated in healthy, middle aged, individuals (men = 48, women = 52), potential relationships between SFA intake, red blood cell (RBC) membrane SFAs and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), the [Kyn]:[Trp] ratio, C-reactive protein (CRP), TNF-alpha and Delta9 desaturase activity. [Kyn]:[Trp] was positively associated with increases in Total fat (P = .034) intake, including Total SFA (P = .029) and Total MUFA (P = .042) intakes. Unexpectedly the [Kyn]:[Trp] ratio was inversely associated with the percentage of Total SFA (P = .004) and positively associated with percentage of Total MUFA (P = .012) present in the RBC membrane. We found a positive association between Delta9 desaturase activity, responsible for the desaturation of a various SFAs to MUFAs, and [Kyn]:[Trp] (P = .008). [Kyn]:[Trp] was also positively associated with CRP (P = .044), however no significant relationship between [Kyn]:[Trp] and TNF-alpha was found. This study shows for the first time that SFA consumption increases inflammatory pathways linked to increased tryptophan to kynurenine conversion, even in healthy humans. Our data also suggests that SFA linked increases in inflammation occur concomitantly with an upregulation of Delta9 desaturase activity resulting in increased desaturation of SFA substrates to their MUFA derivatives.
