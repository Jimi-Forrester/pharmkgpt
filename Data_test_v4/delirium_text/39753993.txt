39753993|a|BACKGROUND: Adenosine deaminase action on RNA 1 (ADAR1) can convert the adenosine in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into inosine in a process known as A-to-I RNA editing. ADAR1 regulates gene expression output by interacting with RNA and other proteins; plays important roles in development, including growth; and is linked to innate immunity, tumors, and central nervous system (CNS) diseases. RESULTS: In recent years, the role of ADAR1 in tumors has been widely discussed, but its role in CNS diseases has not been reviewed. It is worth noting that recent studies have shown ADAR1 has great potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, but the mechanisms are still unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to elaborate on the role of ADAR1 in CNS diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we focus on the effects and mechanisms of ADAR1 on CNS diseases such as Aicardi-AicardiGoutieres syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, glioblastoma, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and autism. We also evaluate the impact of ADAR1-based treatment strategies on these diseases, with a particular focus on the development and treatment strategies of new technologies such as microRNAs, nanotechnology, gene editing, and stem cell therapy. We hope to provide new directions and insights for the future development of ADAR1 gene editing technology in brain science and the treatment of CNS diseases.
