29278202|t|Neuroprotective Effects of Flavonoid Compounds on Neuronal Death Associated to Alzheimer's Disease.
29278202|a|Alzheimer's disease is an increasing neurodegenerative pathology related to age in many societies. Some aspects of the disease are related to the loss of neuronal cells derived by the formation of extracellular neuritic plaques and the appearance of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, altogether generating an inflammatory and oxidative status. The accumulation of amyloids in cells induces the activation of the apoptotic cascade which implies caspases activation. Alzheimer's disease is treated with acetylcholine esterase inhibitors, although their effects are still far away to reduce or eliminate the problems associated with the pathology. The lack of effective treatment has led to the search for new therapeutic alternatives based on natural products. Flavonoids comprise a group of phenolic compounds that have gained great interest since they present great diversity of biological activities. In the present work, we review the potential uses of flavonoids and the proposed mechanisms of action as a new therapeutic strategy in neurological cell death associated with Alzheimer's disease.
