38328708|t|Preimplantation genetic testing for embryos predisposed to hereditary cancer: Possibilities and challenges.
38328708|a|Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), which was developed as an alternative to prenatal genetic testing, allows couples to avoid pregnancies with abnormal chromosomes and the subsequent termination of the affected fetus. Originally used for early onset monogenic conditions, PGT is now used to prevent various types of inherited cancer conditions based on the development of PGT technology, assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs), and in vitro fertilization (IVF). This review provides insights into the potential benefits and challenges associated with the application of PGT for hereditary cancer and provides an overview of the existing literature on this test, with a particular focus on the current challenges related to laws, ethics, counseling, and technology. Additionally, this review predicts the future potential applications of this method. Although PGT may be utilized to predict and prevent hereditary cancer, each case should be comprehensively evaluated. The motives of couples must be assessed to prevent the misuse of this technique for eugenic purposes, and non-pathogenic phenotypes must be carefully evaluated. Pathological cases that require this technology should also be carefully considered based on legal and ethical reasoning. PGT may be the preferred treatment for hereditary cancer cases; however, such cases require careful case-by-case evaluations. Therefore, this study concludes that multidisciplinary counseling and support for patients and their families are essential to ensure that PGT is a viable option that meets all legal and ethical concerns.
