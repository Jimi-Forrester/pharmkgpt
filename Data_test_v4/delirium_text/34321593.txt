34321593|t|A genetic basis for friendship? Homophily for membrane-associated PDE11A-cAMP-CREB signaling in CA1 of hippocampus dictates mutual social preference in male and female mice.
34321593|a|Although the physical and mental benefits of friendships are clear, the neurobiological mechanisms driving mutual social preferences are not well understood. Studies in humans suggest friends are more genetically similar, particularly for targets within the 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) cascade. Unfortunately, human studies can not provide conclusive evidence for such a biological driver of friendship given that other genetically related factors tend to co-segregate with friendship (e.g., geographical proximity). As such, here we use mice under controlled conditions to test the hypothesis that homophily in the cAMP-degrading enzyme phosphodiesterase 11A4 (PDE11A4) can dictate mutual social preference. Using C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ mice in two different behavioral assays, we showed that mice with two intact alleles of Pde11a prefer to interact with Pde11 wild-type (WT) mice of the same genetic background over knockout (KO) mice or novel objects; whereas, Pde11 KO mice prefer to interact with Pde11 KO mice over WT mice or novel objects. This mutual social preference was seen in both adult and adolescent mice, and social preference could be eliminated or artificially elicited by strengthening or weakening PDE11A homodimerization, respectively. Stereotactic delivery of an isolated PDE11A GAF-B domain to the mouse hippocampus revealed the membrane-associated pool of PDE11A-cAMP-CREB signaling specifically within the CA1 subfield of hippocampus is most critical for regulating social preference. Our study here not only identifies PDE11A homophily as a key driver of mutual social preference across the lifespan, it offers a paradigm in which other mechanisms can be identified in a controlled fashion.
