37301324|t|Ketamine: A Practical Review for the Consultation-Liaison Psychiatrist.
37301324|a|BACKGROUND: Ketamine is a non-competitive NMDA-receptor antagonist often used for sedation and management of acute agitation in general hospital settings. Many hospitals now include ketamine as part of their standard agitation protocol, and consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatrists frequently find themselves treating patients who have received ketamine, despite lack of clear recommendations for management. OBJECTIVE: Conduct a non-systematic, narrative regarding the use of ketamine for agitation and continuous sedation, including benefits and adverse psychiatric effects. Comparison of ketamine to more traditional agents of agitation control. Provide C-L psychiatrists with a summary of available knowledge and recommendations for managing patients receiving ketamine. METHODS: A literature review was performed using PubMed querying published articles from inception to March 2023 for articles related to use of ketamine for agitation or continuous sedation and side effects including psychosis and catatonia. RESULTS: A total of 37 articles were included. Ketamine was found to have multiple benefits, including shorter time to adequate sedation for agitated patients when compared to haloperidol +/- benzodiazepines and unique advantages for continuous sedation. However, ketamine carries significant medical risks including high rates of intubation. Ketamine appears to induce a syndrome that mimics schizophrenia in healthy controls, and such effects are more pronounced and longer-lasting in patients with schizophrenia. Evidence regarding rates of delirium with ketamine for continuous sedation is mixed and requires further investigation before the agent is widely adopted for this purpose. Finally, the diagnosis of "excited delirium" and use of ketamine to treat this controversial syndrome warrants critical evaluation. CONCLUSION: Ketamine carries many potential benefits and can be an appropriate medication for patients with profound undifferentiated agitation. However, intubation rates remain high, and ketamine may worsen underlying psychotic disorders. It is essential that C-L psychiatrists understand the advantages, disadvantages, biased administration, and areas of limited knowledge regarding ketamine.
