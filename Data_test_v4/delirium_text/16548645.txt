16548645|t|Unique problems of dementia in the younger patient.
16548645|a|While dementia is often thought of as a problem unique to the elderly patient, nearly one in ten patients with dementia is younger than 65. The etiologies of dementia in this population are varied, including a genetically inherited form of Alzheimer's disease, as well as dementia related to other problems such as Parkinson's disease, Down syndrome, and cerebrovascular disease. Health care practitioners may have difficulty diagnosing early onset dementia because the diagnostic tools and the disease manifestation differ from those of the elderly patient. In addition, treatment of early-onset dementia can also pose unique challenges related to the speed of progression of the disease, depression, and behavioral disturbances, which often plague younger patients with dementia.
