29660945|t|TRPC1 Null Exacerbates Memory Deficit and Apoptosis Induced by Amyloid-beta.
29660945|a|The transient receptor potential cation (TRPC) channels are widely expressed in nervous system but their functions remain largely unclear. Here, we found that TRPC1 deletion did not affect learning and memory in physiological conditions, while it aggravated learning and memory deficits induced by amyloid-beta (Abeta), the major component of the senile plaques observed in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Further studies demonstrated that TRPC1 deletion did not affect cell apoptosis in physiological condition, but it exacerbated the Abeta-induced cell death in mouse hippocampus. Moreover, the level of TRPC1 was decreased in AD cell and mouse models, and upregulation of TRPC1 decreased Abeta levels with attenuation of apoptosis in the cells stably overexpressing amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP). Finally, the transmembrane domain of TRPC1 could bind to AbetaPP and thus decreased Abeta production. These findings indicate that loss of TRPC1 exacerbates Abeta-induced memory deficit and cell apoptosis, though it does not impair cognitive function or induce cell death in physiological conditions.
