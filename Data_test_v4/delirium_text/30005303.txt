30005303|t|Evaluating the risk profile of quetiapine in treating delirium in the intensive care adult population: A retrospective review.
30005303|a|PURPOSE: Dosing regimens of quetiapine to treat delirium in critically ill patients are titrated to effect, and may utilize doses higher than previously reported. This study aimed to assess the safety of quetiapine for this indication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective medical chart review was conducted, identifying 154 critically ill adults that were initiated on quetiapine to treat delirium and monitored for QTc prolongation. RESULTS: The median average daily dose was 150 mg (79-234) and median max dose was 225 mg (100-350). The overall range was 25-800 mg daily. The time to peak dose was 3 days (1-8). Patients with QTc prolongation were significantly older (age 54 +- 11 vs 45 +- 17 years (p = 0.002)) and with higher baseline QTc (454 +- 33 vs 442 +- 30 (p = 0.045)). Regression analysis revealed only dose as a significant factor (OR = 1.006 (1.003-1.009) (p < 0.001)). CONCLUSION: The dose of quetiapine has very little correlation with QTc and change from baseline. A small number of side effects were observed. Overall, titrating quickly to large doses of quetiapine is safe for treating delirium.
