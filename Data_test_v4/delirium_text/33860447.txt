33860447|a|Inflammation is the biological response of immune system to protect living organisms from injurious factors. However, excessive and uncontrolled inflammation is implicated in a variety of devastating chronic diseases including atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Improved understanding of inflammatory response has unveiled a rich assortment of anti-inflammatory therapeutics for the treatment and management of relevant chronic diseases. Notwithstanding these successes, clinical outcomes are variable among patients and serious adverse effects are often observed. Moreover, there exist some limitations for clinical anti-inflammatory therapeutics such as aqueous insolubility, low bioavailability, off-target effects, and poor accessibility to subcellular compartments. To address these challenges, the rational design of inflammation-specific drug delivery systems (DDSs) holds significant promise. Moreover, as compared to normal tissues, inflamed tissue-associated pathological milieu (e.g., oxidative stress, acidic pH, and overexpressed enzymes) provides vital biochemical stimuli for triggered delivery of anti-inflammatory agents in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of anti-inflammatory DDSs with built-in pathological inflammation-specific responsiveness for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.
