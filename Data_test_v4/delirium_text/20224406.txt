20224406|t|Persistent delirium in older hospital patients.
20224406|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There are two contradictory views on the prognosis of delirium in older hospital patients. On one hand, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), describes delirium as a transient cognitive disorder, the majority of affected individuals having a full recovery. On the other hand, longitudinal studies of delirium in this population report that the outcomes are poor. This review proposes to reconcile these two contradictory views. RECENT FINDINGS: In older hospital patients, delirium appears to persist in 44.7% of patients at discharge and in 32.8, 25.6 and 21% of patients at 1, 3 and 6 months, respectively. The outcomes (cognition, function, nursing home placement, mortality) of patients with persistent delirium are consistently worse than the outcomes of patients who recover from delirium. SUMMARY: The majority of older hospital patients with delirium may recover but the persistence of delirium in a substantial minority of patients may account, in large part, for the poor outcomes of delirium in this population. This proposal has potentially important implications for clinical practice and research.
