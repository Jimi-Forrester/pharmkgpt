39840053|a|Background: The reversible splenial lesion syndrome is frequently associated with systemic and central nervous system infections. Whether an infection associated with the occurrence of the reversible splenial lesion syndrome could play a role in the later development of multiple sclerosis is unknown. Methods: Case Report. Results: A 27-year-old woman developed an infection-related reversible splenial lesion syndrome. Diagnostic findings did not establish a specific type of infection, but revealed evidence for a potential disposition towards autoimmunity. 32 months after the initial presentation, new clinical and radiological manifestations developed that led to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Conclusions: In susceptible individuals, infectious disease processes involving the central nervous system, such as described in this case, might be a factor in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. More research on the prodromal stage of multiple sclerosis is needed to better understand the relationship between infections and autoimmunity.
