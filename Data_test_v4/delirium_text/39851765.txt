39851765|t|The Potential of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes to Treat Diabetes Mellitus.
39851765|a|Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a fatal metabolic disease characterized by persistent hyperglycemia. In recent studies, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes, which are being investigated clinically as a cell-free therapy for various diseases, have gained attention due to their biomimetic properties that closely resemble natural cellular communication systems. These MSC-derived exosomes inherit the regenerative and protective effects from MSCs, inducing pancreatic beta-cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis, as well as ameliorating insulin resistance by suppressing the release of various inflammatory cytokines. Consequently, MSC-derived exosomes have attracted attention as a novel treatment for DM as an alternative to stem cell therapy. In this review, we will introduce the potential of MSC-derived exosomes for the treatment of DM by discussing the studies that have used MSC-derived exosomes to treat DM, which have shown therapeutic effects in both type 1 and type 2 DM.
