36993042|a|Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mental disorder characterized by impairment in mood regulation, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt, low self-worth, disturbed sleep and appetite, feelings of tiredness, and poor concentration. It is estimated to be the third leading cause of disability and about 350 million people suffer from depression worldwide. Treatment selection include consideration of the patient's personal history of medication response, side effects, drug preference, coexisting psychiatric disorders, accessibility, cultural, social, and situational factors. The main objectives in this study are to analyze prescription pattern of antidepressants, to assess treatment outcomes and partial remission in depression, and to evaluate the side effects in patients receiving antidepressant medications. The investigators will obtain the patient demographic data, disease information, medical issues, and other relevant patient information by interviewing them and referring patient medical records in the hospital (both inpatients and outpatients) documented in a self-designed case report form along with assessment of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HMDR), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Morisky Green Levine Medication Adherence questionnaire (MGLMAQ). Adherence to medications was assessed using Morisky Green Levine Scale in 70 previously diagnosed subjects. Most of the subjects (32.85%) were found to have low adherence to medications, whereas 20.00% were highly adherent. There was a high rate of antidepressant discontinuation without consultation with physician. A closer communication between patients and physicians should be encouraged to enhance persistence to medications and improve outcomes. Recognition of depression as a significant risk factor for noncompliance with medical treatment carries the potential to improve medical practice, reduce patient disability, enhance patient functioning, and improve healthcare outcomes.
