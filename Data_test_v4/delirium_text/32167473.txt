32167473|t|Supramammillary nucleus synchronizes with dentate gyrus to regulate spatial memory retrieval through glutamate release.
32167473|a|The supramammillary nucleus (SuM) provides substantial innervation to the dentate gyrus (DG). It remains unknown how the SuM and DG coordinate their activities at the circuit level to regulate spatial memory. Additionally, SuM co-releases GABA and glutamate to the DG, but the relative role of GABA versus glutamate in regulating spatial memory remains unknown. Here we report that SuM-DG Ca2+ activities are highly correlated during spatial memory retrieval as compared to the moderate correlation during memory encoding when mice are performing a location discrimination task. Supporting this evidence, we demonstrate that the activity of SuM neurons or SuM-DG projections is required for spatial memory retrieval. Furthermore, we show that SuM glutamate transmission is necessary for both spatial memory retrieval and highly-correlated SuM-DG activities during spatial memory retrieval. Our studies identify a long-range SuM-DG circuit linking two highly correlated subcortical regions to regulate spatial memory retrieval through SuM glutamate release.
