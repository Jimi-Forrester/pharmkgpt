31867965|t|Self-Assembly of Supramolecular Polymers of N-Centered Triarylamine Trisamides in the Light of Circular Dichroism: Reaching Consensus between Electrons and Nuclei.
31867965|a|The self-assembly of chiral supramolecular polymers is an intricate process that spans a wide range of length scales. Circular dichroism techniques are ideal to study this process as they provide information on the molecular scale but are at the same time also sensitive probes of the long-range interactions that control the growth and morphology of these polymers. As yet, Electronic Circular Dichroism that uses electronic transitions as a probe has by far been the method of choice while Vibrational Circular Dichroism, which uses vibrational transitions to probe structure, is much less employed. Here, we report experimental and theoretical studies of the self-assembly of helical supramolecular polymers of (S)-triarylamine tris-amides ((S)-TATA) in which both techniques are applied in concert. Theoretical studies based on quantum chemical calculations and on simplified models that allow for extrapolation to "infinitely" long polymers provide a solid basis for interpreting results from each of the two techniques that on their own would appear to be contradictory. In the particular case of (S)-TATA it is shown that upon equilibration the initially formed fibers undergo a conformational transition that becomes only "visible" by the combination of the two techniques. Our studies thus show that combining electronic and vibrational domains offers a unique and complementary means to probe these polymers, precisely because they are sensitive to different aspects of molecular and polymeric structure.
