37891921|a|In this review, we explored the potential of a zebrafish model to investigate the antioxidant effects of key components of the Mediterranean diet, namely, olive oil and wine, in the context of preventing age-related diseases, particularly cardiovascular conditions. This paper explores the spectrum of observational studies to preclinical investigations and ultimately converges toward potential translational insights derived from animal experimentation. This review highlights the potential and underutilization of zebrafish as an experimental model in this domain. We highlighted the genetic proximity of zebrafish to humans, offering a unique opportunity for translational insights into the health benefits of olive oil and wine. Indeed, we wanted to focus on the potential of zebrafish to elucidate the health benefits of olive oil and wine while calling for continued exploration to unlock its full potential to advance our knowledge of age-related disease prevention within the Mediterranean diet framework.
