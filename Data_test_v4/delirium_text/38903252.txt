38903252|a|Background and Aims: Postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction (PNCD) commonly occurs after surgery and prolongs hospital stays. Both direct noxious stimuli to the central nervous system and systemic inflammation have been implicated. Due to their potent anti-inflammatory effects, corticosteroids have been utilised to attenuate the incidence and severity of PNCD. This systematic review and meta-analysis strived to evaluate the prophylactic role of perioperative corticosteroids for PNCD. Methods: A search was run in pre-defined databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the role of corticosteroids in preventing PNCD. The incidence of PNCD within 1 month was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the use of antipsychotic medications for the treatment, postoperative infection, and hospital length of stay. The results are exhibited as odds ratio (OR) and the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Fifteen RCTs comprising 15,398 patients were included. The incidence of PNCD was significantly lower in the corticosteroid group than in the control group, with a pooled OR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.58, 0.96; P = 0.02; I2 = 66%). Trial sequential analysis showed the clinical benefit of corticosteroids in preventing PNCD; however, the requisite information size is still inadequate. The sub-group analysis supported the prophylactic effect of corticosteroids on delirium prevention but not on delayed neurocognitive recovery. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis revealed statistically significant protective effects of corticosteroids on the incidence of PNCD. However, further studies are still needed to confirm the protective role of this commonly used and relatively safe strategy for preventing PNCD.
