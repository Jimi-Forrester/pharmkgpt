33212853|a|Research on the Abeta cascade and alternations of biomarkers in neuro-inflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal injury followed by Abeta have progressed. But the question is how to use the biomarkers. Here, we examine the evidence and pathogenic implications of protein interactions and the time order of alternation. After the deposition of Abeta, the change of tau, neurofilament light chain (NFL), and neurogranin (Ng) is the main alternation and connection to others. Neuro-inflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal injury function is exhibited prior to the structural and metabolic changes in the brain following Abeta deposition. The time order of such biomarkers compared to the tau protein is not clear. Despite the close relationship between biomarkers and plaque Abeta deposition, several factors favor one or the other. There is an interaction between some proteins that can predict the brain amyloid burden. The Abeta cascade hypothesis could be the pathway, but not all subjects suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD) within a long follow-up, even with very elevated Abeta. The interaction of biomarkers and the time order of change require further research to identify the right subjects and right molecular target for precision medicine therapies.
