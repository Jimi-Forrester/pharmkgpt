33777168|a|INTRODUCTION: Studies have previously shown that Cyclin H (CCNH) is involved in the tumorigenesis and development of many cancers. The increasing research in CCNH is associated with the poor prognosis of most human cancers. Early diagnosis and clinical treatment are still the main challenges for lung cancer treatment. However, the exact role of CCNH in the tumorigenesis of lung cancer remains unclear. METHODS: The Tumor Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Association (CPTAC) database were analyzed to detect key genes that might play an important role in lung cancer. The biological functions of CCNH were further revealed through bioinformatics experiments. The Kaplan-Meier method was applied to explore the relationship between CCNH expression and prognosis. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression levels of CCNH in 6 lung cancer tissues and 3 cancer cell lines. The effect of CCNH expression on lung cancer progression was studied by in vitro functional experiments. RESULTS: Database analysis screened out candidate oncogenes, and CCNH was of great significance to the tumorigenesis of lung cancer. The higher the expression of CCNH was, the lower the survival rate of lung cancer patients were. The qRT-PCR data illustrated that the CCNH expression level was largely increased in lung cancer tissues and cells. The reduction of CCNH inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. CONCLUSION: CCNH was related to poor prognosis, suggesting that CCNH regulated the tumorigenesis and development of lung cancer. Our study suggested that CCNH was a promising biomarker and target in the treatment of lung cancer.
