24613734|a|Of the problems that complicate child-bearing, hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), or severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), is likely one of the most painful with unrelenting retching and vomiting that can lead to measurable injuries such as Mallory-Weiss Syndrome and esophageal rupture, and/or subtle maternal cognitive impairments related to starvation and dehydration. Recognized hallmarks of HG include dehydration, ketonuria, weight loss over 5%, and electrolyte abnormalities not attributable to other causes. Historically providers regarded the hyperemetic as a difficult to treat patient with potentially underlying psychological problems. Sick patients who experience pain and suffering present challenges to care, not excepting NVP. Ill patients can be demanding and agitated. Agitation can be one of the early signs of delirium or altered mental status (AMS). AMS can include previously diagnosed psychiatric conditions as well as new onset of Wernicke's encephalopathy, deliria, insomnia, hallucinations and autoscopy, resulting from various etiologies including and not limited to medications, pain including pain from hunger, vomiting and retching, constipation, dehydration, altered electrolytes, hypoglycemia, malnutrition and sleep deprivation. AMS may have a subtle waxing and waning trajectory, making the condition difficult to diagnosis in early stages. What have not been well elucidated in AMS are subjective images and/or experiences. Whether all AMS experiences are similar is unknown. We believe there may be a transient alteration of cognitive status or "altered sensorium gestosis" (ASG), attributed to the direct insults of hyperemesis gravidarum which will be discussed herein. How prevalent ASG might be is unknown and needs further investigation.
