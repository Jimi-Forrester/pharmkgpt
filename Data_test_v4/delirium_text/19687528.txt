19687528|t|Current awareness of delirium in the intensive care unit: a postal survey in the Netherlands.
19687528|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium in the ICU can compromise the recovery process, prolong ICU and hospital stay and increase mortality. Therefore, recognition of delirium is of utmost importance. METHODS: To ascertain current attitude pertaining to delirium in critically ill patients a simple questionnaire was sent to all intensive care units (ICUs) throughout the Netherlands. RESULTS: Seventy-five questionnaires were sent and 44 returned. A delirium protocol was present in the majority of cases (n=35, 80%), although implementation had occurred in only 22 ICUs (50%). The reported general incidence of delirium varied widely (25% of ventilated patients (n=33, 75%) and in patients older than 70 (n=38, 86%). Most participating centres reported that they could certainly (n=9, 20%) or most certainly (n=22, 50%) identify delirium. A geriatrician or a psychiatrist predominantly diagnosed delirium (n=30, 68%), while a diagnostic instrument such as the CAM -ICU was used in a minority of cases (n=11, 25%). A geriatrician or a psychiatrist was consulted when patients were agitated (n=40, 90%), or when routine pharmacological treatment had failed (n=40, 91%). CONCLUSION: In the Netherlands, delirium is considered an important problem in the ICU, although its incidence is estimated to be low by the ICU team. The diagnosis of delirium is most frequently established by a geriatrician or psychiatrist after consultation, while diagnostic instruments are infrequently used. Efforts should be undertaken to implement delirium protocols and a routinely applied diagnostic instrument in the ICU.
