37727299|t|Risk Factors of the 2-Year Mortality after Bipolar Hemiarthroplasty for Displaced Femoral Neck Fracture.
37727299|a|Purpose: This study investigates the relationship between preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LCR), albumin, and 2-year mortality in elderly patients having hemiarthroplasty for displaced femoral neck fracture (FNF). Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 284 elderly patients who underwent hemiarthroplasty for Garden type IV FNF from September 2014 to September 2020. Using the receiver operating characteristic curve, optimal cutoff values for LCR, NLR, and albumin were established, and patients were categorized as low or high. Associations with 2-year mortality were evaluated through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Results: Of the 284 patients, 124 patients (45.9%) died within 2 years post-surgery. The optimal cutoff values were: LCR at 7.758 (specificity 58.5%, sensitivity 25.0%), NLR at 3.854 (specificity 39.2%, sensitivity 40.0%), and albumin at 3.750 (specificity 65.9%, sensitivity 21.9%). Patients with low LCR (<7.758), high NLR (>=3.854), and low albumin (<3.750) had a statistically significant reduced survival time compared to their counterparts. Conclusion: Lower preoperative LCR and albumin levels, along with higher NLR, effectively predict 2-year mortality and 30-day post-surgery complications in elderly patients with Garden type IV FNF undergoing hemiarthroplasty.
