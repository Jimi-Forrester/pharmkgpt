36543694|a|Family caregivers in Canadian long-term care homes are estimated to provide 10 h per week of direct care to approximately 30% of residents through roles including mobility support, mealtime assistance, personal care, social interaction, psychological care, care coordination, and advocacy. Despite these contributions, they continue to be viewed as visitors rather than as key participants in the interdependent relationships that support the long-term care sector. Their marginalization was evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, as Canadian public health policy focused on preventing them from entering long-term care, rather than supporting personal risk management, symptom screening, personal protective equipment, and other mechanisms for safe involvement in care. Several iatrogenic resident outcomes have been attributed to this, including decreased cognitive function, decreased mobility, increased incontinence, weight loss, increased depression and anxiety, increased responsive behaviours amongst those living with dementia, and increased delirium. In this commentary article, we argue that family caregiver presence was conflated as a risk when instead, it contributed to unintended harm. We identify nine well-known human social cognitive predispositions that may have contributed to this. We then examine their implications for trust in long-term care, and consider how quality and safety can be further fostered in long-term care by working in partnership with family caregivers to rebuild trust through enquiry and collaboration. We advocate incorporating trust as an essential measure of quality health service.
