35207662|a|Huntington's Disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by a combination of motor, cognitive, and behavioral disorders. The social and behavioral symptoms observed in HD patients impact their quality of life and probably explain their relational difficulties, conflicts, and social withdrawal. In this study, we described the development of the Social Relationship Self-Questionnaire (SRSQ), a self-reporting questionnaire that assesses how HD patients perceived their social relationships. The scale was proposed for 66 HD patients at an early stage of the disease, 32 PreHD patients (individuals carrying the mutant gene without motor symptoms), and 66 controls. The HD patients were included in a prospective longitudinal follow-up for an average of 1.07 years with motor, functional, cognitive, and behavioral assessments. Based on the HD patients' answers at baseline, we identified two domains in the SRSQ. The first domain was related to social motivation and correlated with cognitive performance. The second domain was related to emotional insight and correlated with behavioral symptoms such as apathy, anxiety, and irritability. We discovered that both SRSQ domain scores at baseline predicted future motor, functional, and cognitive decline in HD.
