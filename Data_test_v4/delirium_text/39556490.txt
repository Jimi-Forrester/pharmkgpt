39556490|t|Chlorella vulgaris as a food substitute: Applications and benefits in the food industry.
39556490|a|Chlorella vulgaris, a freshwater microalga, is gaining attention for its potential as a nutritious food source and dietary supplement. This review aims to provide a comprehensive discussion on C. vulgaris, evaluating its viability as a food substitute in the industry by exploring the nutritional value and application of C. vulgaris in the food industry. Rich in protein, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals, Chlorella offers substantial nutritional benefits, positioning it as a valuable food substitute. Its applications in the food industry include incorporation into smoothies, snacks, and supplements, enhancing the nutritional profile of various food products. The health benefits of Chlorella encompass antioxidant activity, immune system support, and detoxification, contributing to overall well-being. Despite these advantages, the commercialization of Chlorella faces significant challenges. These include variability in antibacterial activity due to strain and growth conditions, high production costs, contamination risks, and sensory issues such as unpleasant taste and smell. Additionally, Chlorella can accumulate heavy metals from its environment, necessitating stringent quality control measures. Future prospects involve improving Chlorella strains through genetic manipulation to enhance nutrient content, developing cost-effective culture systems, and exploring advanced processing techniques like pulsed electric fields for better digestibility. Addressing sensory issues through flavor-masking strategies and employing environmental management practices will further support Chlorella's integration into the food industry. Although C. vulgaris shows great potential as a nutritious food ingredient, overcoming existing challenges and optimizing production methods would be crucial for its successful adoption and widespread use.
