29123406|t|Prophylactic Iron Supplementation in Pregnancy: A Controversial Issue.
29123406|a|In our world today, iron deficiency (ID) is the most frequent nutritional deficiency and it is being considered as an epidemic public health crisis. Women of reproductive age and infants are at particular risk of ID, especially in underdeveloped countries. During pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia is a specific risk factor associated with negative maternal and perinatal outcomes. Many countries have iron supplementation (IS) programs-as recommended by the World Health Organization-during pregnancy; however, IS clinical benefits and risks are unclear. This review aims to discuss the threats and benefits of routine IS on maternal and infant outcomes.
