30925549|t|Association between serum uric acid and large-nerve fiber dysfunction in type 2 diabetes: a cross-sectional study.
30925549|a|BACKGROUND: Large-nerve fiber dysfunction, as assessed by vibration perception threshold (VPT) predicts risks of ulceration, amputation, and mortality in diabetes. Serum uric acid (UA) is closely associated with various metabolic disorders, especially diabetes. Thus, we sought to investigate the clinical relevance of UA to large-nerve fiber dysfunction, among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: Medical records of consecutive patients with T2D who were admitted to Beijing Friendship Hospital Pinggu Campus between May 2014 and December 2016 were collected. Data for the 824 eligible patients included in the final analysis were extracted using a structured form. A VPT value >=15 in either foot was defined as abnormal. We compared the clinical characteristics between patients with abnormal VPT and those with normal VPT (VPT value <15 in both feet) in the overall population and in gender subgroups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the association of abnormal VPT with UA level. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare VPT values across four UA quartiles. RESULTS: UA levels were significantly lower in T2D patients with abnormal VPT than in those with normal VPT (294.5 +- 84.0 vs. 314.9 +- 92.8 mumol/L, P < 0.01), especially among male patients (311.7 +- 85.2 vs. 336.9 +- 89.6 mumol/L, P < 0.01). From the logistic regression analysis, hyperuricemia (males >420 mumol/L; females >360 mumol/L) was associated with a reduced risk of abnormal VPT (odds ratio [OR], 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.91; P < 0.05). This association was robust in male patients (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24-0.76; P < 0.01) but not in female patients (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.47-1.82; P = 0.816), even after adjustment for confounding factors. For the younger male subgroup (age <65 years), VPT values decreased as the UA level increased (P for trend = 0.002), but this trend was not significant in older male subgroup (age >=65 years; P for trend = 0.400). CONCLUSIONS: Low serum UA levels showed a significant association with an increased risk of large-nerve fiber dysfunction in male patients with T2D, but not in female patients with T2D. In addition, in only the younger subgroup of male patients (<65 years), lower levels of UA also correlated with higher VPT values.
