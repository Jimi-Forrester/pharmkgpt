38954414|a|Importance: Older adults who are hospitalized for COVID-19 are at risk of delirium. Little is known about the association of in-hospital delirium with functional and cognitive outcomes among older adults who have survived a COVID-19 hospitalization. Objective: To evaluate the association of delirium with functional disability and cognitive impairment over the 6 months after discharge among older adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study involved patients aged 60 years or older who were hospitalized with COVID-19 between June 18, 2020, and June 30, 2021, at 5 hospitals in a major tertiary care system in the US. Follow-up occurred through January 11, 2022. Data analysis was performed from December 2022 to February 2024. Exposure: Delirium during the COVID-19 hospitalization was assessed using the Chart-based Delirium Identification Instrument (CHART-DEL) and CHART-DEL-ICU. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were disability in 15 functional activities and the presence of cognitive impairment (defined as Montreal Cognitive Assessment score <22) at 1, 3, and 6 months after hospital discharge. The associations of in-hospital delirium with functional disability and cognitive impairment were evaluated using zero-inflated negative binominal and logistic regression models, respectively, with adjustment for age, month of follow-up, and baseline (before COVID-19) measures of the respective outcome. Results: The cohort included 311 older adults (mean [SD] age, 71.3 [8.5] years; 163 female [52.4%]) who survived COVID-19 hospitalization. In the functional disability sample of 311 participants, 49 participants (15.8%) experienced in-hospital delirium. In the cognition sample of 271 participants, 31 (11.4%) experienced in-hospital delirium. In-hospital delirium was associated with both increased functional disability (rate ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.05-1.66) and increased cognitive impairment (odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.38-4.82) over the 6 months after discharge from the COVID-19 hospitalization. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of 311 hospitalized older adults with COVID-19, in-hospital delirium was associated with increased functional disability and cognitive impairment over the 6 months following discharge. Older survivors of a COVID-19 hospitalization who experience in-hospital delirium should be assessed for disability and cognitive impairment during postdischarge follow-up.
