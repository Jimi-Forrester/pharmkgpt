35887694|t|Influence of Preoperative Handgrip Strength on Length of Stay after Lumbar Fusion Surgery.
35887694|a|Preoperative sarcopenic status can affect length of hospital stay and patient outcomes after surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the impacts of preoperative handgrip strength (HGS) on length of stay (LOS) and outcomes after lumbar fusion surgery. HGS was measured preoperatively, and the cut-off value for low HGS was <28 kg for men and <18 kg for women. Perioperative patient outcomes were compared between patients with low and normal HGS. A total of 225 patients, consisting of 86 and 139 patients in the low and normal HGS groups, respectively, fully satisfied the study criteria for analysis. A longer LOS (median 10 vs. 8 days, p = 0.013) and a higher incidence of serious postoperative complications (15.1 vs. 3.6%, p = 0.002) were observed in the low HGS group. In the multivariate analysis, a low HGS (odds ratio (OR) = 1.917, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.046-3.513, p = 0.035) was significantly associated with a longer LOS after surgery. Preoperative HGS below the reference values by sex appeared to be an independent factor associated with longer LOS after lumbar fusion surgery.
