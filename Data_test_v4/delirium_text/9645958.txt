9645958|t|Enhancement of beta-amyloid precursor protein transcription and expression by the soluble interleukin-6 receptor/interleukin-6 complex.
9645958|a|We investigated a potential role for the soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R) in modulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) function in the central nervous system by assessing IL-6 and sIL-6R effects on beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) transcription and expression in cells of human neuronal origin. Cells transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing a 3.8 kb DNA fragment of the beta-APP promoter were shown to have inducible promoter activity when treated with phorbol ester or basic fibroblast growth factor, but not when treated with lipopolysaccharide or Il-6. PCR amplification analysis revealed the presence of mRNA encoding the signaling subunit of the Il-6 receptor complex, the gp130 subunit, at levels approximating that found in human cortical tissue. The mRNA encoding the IL-6 receptor, however, was poorly expressed and was detectable only at high amplification cycles. When purified sIL-6R protein was added together with IL-6, there was a rapid induction of promoter activity within 2 h of stimulation followed by elevations in protein levels of both cell-associated and secreted beta-APP. Analysis of mRNA transcripts from human cortical brain tissue and cell cultures derived from fetal human brain demonstrated the presence of an alternatively spliced secreted form of the IL-6 receptor mRNA, suggesting that cells of the central nervous system may themselves be a source of sIL-6R protein. The capacity for sIL-6R to enhance IL-6 function and broaden the IL-6 target cell population in the brain has implications for the regulation of beta-APP expression in disease states such as Alzheimer's disease where elevations in brain IL-6 levels have been reported.
