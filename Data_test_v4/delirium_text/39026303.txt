39026303|a|BACKGROUND: Parenteral fluid (PF) therapy of patients in end-of-life (EOL) is controversial. The purpose of this study was to assess associations between PF, quality of the EOL care process and symptom burden in dying cancer patients, using a population-based approach. METHODS: This was a nationwide retrospective register study of all adult cancer deaths with documented information on PF in the last 24 h of life as reported to the Swedish Register of Palliative Care during a three-year period (n = 41,709). Prevalence and relief of symptoms during the last week of life as well as EOL care process quality indicators were assessed in relation to PF in those patients who had a documented decision to focus on EOL care (immediately dying, n = 23,112). Odds ratios were calculated, adjusting for place of death (hospital vs. non-hospital). RESULTS: PF was administered to 30.9% of immediately dying patients in hospitals compared to 6.5% outside of hospitals. PF was associated with a higher likelihood for breathlessness and nausea. In patients screened for EOL symptoms with a validated instrument, PF was inversely associated with the likelihood of complete relief of breathlessness, respiratory secretions, anxiety, nausea and pain. Several palliative care quality indicators were inversely associated with PF, including EOL conversations and prescriptions of injectable drugs as needed. These associations were more pronounced in hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Parenteral fluid therapy in the last 24 h of life was associated with inferior quality of the EOL care process and with increased symptom burden in imminently dying cancer patients.
