27262755|a|BACKGROUND: In recent years, more elderly patients have undergone surgery for pancreatic cancer, although the safety and efficacy of performing complex pancreatic resections in patients older than 80 years remain controversial. METHODS: Patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent curative surgical treatment were divided into 2 subgroups: the younger group (<80 years) and the octogenarian group (>=80 years). RESULTS: From March 2005 to December 2013, 194 consecutive surgically curable patients with diagnosed pancreatic cancer were studied, among which 34 (17.5%) were of 80 years or older. There were no significant differences in postoperative severe complication rates for younger and octogenarian groups (16% vs 20%, respectively) or perioperative mortality rates (1.3% vs .0%). The incidence of postoperative delirium in the octogenarian group was greater than that in the younger group (23.5% vs 3.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Octogenarian pancreatic cancer patients should not be denied a priori the opportunity for surgery, particularly if the patient represents an ideal candidate and if the co-operation of the family can be obtained.
