21574434|a|Part 2 of this review concerns the application of melatonin (Mt) to the treatment of aged patients with cardiovascular diseases and other pathology with reference to its genoprotective and anticarcinogenic action. Effects of Mt on the cardiovascular system are underlain by its antioxidative, vasodilating, and sedative activities, the ability to regulate the heart rate and inhibit platelet aggregation. Certain authors report negative correlation between Mt production and blood cholesterol level. Mt was shown to protect from cardiac lesions associated with ischemia and reperfusion. Mt inhibits carcinogenesis and is active at systemic, tissue, cellular and subcellular levels. At the systemic level, Mt decreases hormonal production, stimulates immune activity, and prevents the development of metabolic syndrome. It inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis of tumour cells but suppresses it the nervous tissue. Mt activates telomerase. It decreases expression of oncogens and interferes with the action of mutagens and clastogens at the genetic level. Extensive studies of Mt protective action in nervous diseases are underway with special reference to spinal cord, brain, neuron and glial cell lesions; experimental cerebral stroke, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Similar studies concern the role of Mt in the protection against ionizing radiation, the development of renal pathology, and ophthalmology (glaucoma, cataract). Mt is shown to influence practically all organ systems by inhibiting mutagenesis and maintaining correlation between circadian rhythms of different biological processes throughout human evolution.
