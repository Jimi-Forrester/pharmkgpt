31680886|t|Intraoperative Low Alpha Power in the Electroencephalogram Is Associated With Postoperative Subsyndromal Delirium.
31680886|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (PD) and subsyndromal delirium (PSSD) are frequent complications in older patients associated with poor long-term outcome. It has been suggested that certain electroencephalogram features may be capable of identifying patients at risk during surgery. Thus, the goal of this study was to characterize intraoperative electroencephalographic markers to identify patients prone to develop PD or PSSD. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory observational study in older patients scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery. Intraoperative 16 channels electroencephalogram was recorded, and PD/PSSD were diagnosed after surgery with the confusion assessment method (CAM). The total power spectra and relative power of alpha band were calculated. RESULTS: PD was diagnosed in 2 patients (6.7%), and 11 patients (36.7%) developed PSSD. All of them (13 patients, PD/PSSD group) were compared with patients without any alterations in CAM (17 patients, control group). There were no detectable power spectrum differences before anesthesia between both groups of patients. However, PD/PSSD group in comparison with control group had a lower intraoperative absolute alpha power during anesthesia (4.4 +- 3.8 dB vs. 9.6 +- 3.2 dB, p = 0.0004) and a lower relative alpha power (0.09 +- 0.06 vs. 0.21 +- 0.08, p < 0.0001). These differences were independent of the anesthetic dose. Finally, relative alpha power had a good ability to identify patients with CAM alterations in the ROC analysis (area under the curve 0.90 (CI 0.78-1), p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: In conclusion, a low intraoperative alpha power is a novel electroencephalogram marker to identify patients who will develop alterations in CAM - i.e., with PD or PSSD - after surgery.
