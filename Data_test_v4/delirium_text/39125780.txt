39125780|t|Bioenergetic and Inflammatory Alterations in Regressed and Non-Regressed Patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
39125780|a|Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with multiple physiological abnormalities. Current laboratory and clinical evidence most commonly report mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and immunological imbalance in almost every cell type of the body. The present work aims to evaluate oxygen consumption rate (OCR), extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), and inflammation-related molecules such as Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), chitinase 3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), Interleukin-9 (IL-9) in ASD children with and without regression compared to healthy controls. Children with ASD (n = 56) and typically developing children (TDC, n = 12) aged 1.11 to 11 years were studied. Mitochondrial activity was examined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from children with ASD and from the control group, using a metabolic analyzer. Gene and protein levels of IL-1beta, IL-9, COX-2, and YKL-40 were investigated in parallel. Our results showed that PBMCs of the ASD subgroup of regressed patients (ASD R(+), n = 21) had a specific pattern of mitochondrial activity with significantly increased maximal respiration, respiratory spare capacity, and proton leak compared to the non-regressed group (ASD R(-), n = 35) and TDC. Furthermore, we found an imbalance in the studied proinflammatory molecules and increased levels in ASD R(-) proving the involvement of inflammatory changes. The results of this study provide new evidence for specific bioenergetic profiles of immune cells and elevated inflammation-related molecules in ASD. For the first time, data on a unique metabolic profile in ASD R(+) and its comparison with a random group of children of similar age and sex are provided. Our data show that mitochondrial dysfunction is more significant in ASD R(+), while in ASD R(-) inflammation is more pronounced. Probably, in the group without regression, immune mechanisms (immune dysregulation, leading to inflammation) begin initially, and at a later stage mitochondrial activity is also affected under exogenous factors. On the other hand, in the regressed group, the initial damage is in the mitochondria, and perhaps at a later stage immune dysfunction is involved.
