29264414|t|Risk of vascular events in different manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease: A 2-year follow-up study with a control group.
29264414|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Natural course of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) has not yet been thoroughly studied. The aim of the single center study was to establish risk of vascular events or death in different manifestations of CSVD. METHODS: 150 consecutive, functionally independent patients with marked MRI features of CSVD and with recent lacunar stroke (n = 52, LS), deep hemorrhagic stroke (n = 20, HS), vascular parkinsonism (n = 28, VaP), vascular dementia (n = 50, VaD) and 55 controls (CG) with high atherothrombotic risk free of cerebrovascular events were prospectively recruited and followed for 24 months. RESULTS: Mean age and sex distribution were similar in CSVD and CG but patients with CSVD were less likely to have CAD (19% vs 40%, p = 0.02) and tended to have higher prevalence of diabetes (54% vs 37%, p = 0.11). The risk of vascular events or death was increased in any patients with moderate to severe white matter lesions at baseline MRI (HR 2.0; 95% CI 0.85-7.2), in CSVD (4.56; 95% CI 1.3-14.9) vs CG, regardless of its clinical manifestation: LS or HS (HR 4.70; 95% CI 1.3-16.2) and VaD or VaP (HR 4.59; 95% CI 1.3-15.7). Adjustment for confounders did not change the results substantially. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with symptomatic CSVD regardless of the clinical (acute or chronic) manifestation had more than fourfold the risk of vascular events or death in 24 months of observation compared with controls with high atherothrombotic risk free of cerebrovascular events.
