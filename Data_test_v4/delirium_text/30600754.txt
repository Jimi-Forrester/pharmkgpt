30600754|t|The effect of preoperative nefopam treatment on postoperative catheter-related bladder discomfort in patients undergoing transurethral bladder tumor resection: a randomized double-blind study.
30600754|a|BACKGROUND: Catheter-related bladder discomfort (C.R.B.D.) is a risk factor for emergence agitation and delirium in postoperative phase. It may be resistant to conventional analgesic therapy such as opioids. This study evaluated the role of preoperative treatment using intravenous 20 mg nefopam in reducing the incidence and severity of C.R.B.D. during the first postoperative 24 h after urinary catheterization when compared with placebo. METHODS: Seventy adult males undergoing elective transurethral resection of bladder tumor requiring urinary bladder catheterization intraoperatively were randomly divided into two groups of 35 patients. In the intervention group (Group N), intravenous 20 mg nefopam in 100 mL normal saline was administered before spinal anesthesia. The placebo group (Group P) received intravenous normal saline 100 mL instead. The incidence and severity of side-effects, including C.R.B.D. at 1, 2, 6, and 24 h after surgery, was evaluated. RESULTS: The incidence of C.R.B.D. was reduced in Group N compared with Group P during the first postoperative 24 h (6/33 [18.2%] vs 22/35 [62.9%], Group N vs Group P, p = .000). The severity of C.R.B.D. also varied significantly at postoperative 1, 2, and 6 h. The use of postoperative analgesics was reduced in Group N compared with Group P (8/33 [24.2%] vs 25/35 [71.4%], Group N vs Group P, p = .000). CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative administration of single-dose intravenous nefopam reduced the incidence and severity of C.R.B.D. in the early postoperative period in patients undergoing T.U.R.-B. under spinal anesthesia.
