36911940|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposition. Abeta accumulation induces oxidative stress, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and so forth. Octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), a diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI)-derived peptide, has been reported to have antioxidant properties. However, it is unclear whether ODN has neuroprotective effects in AD. OBJECTIVE: To profile the potential effects of ODN on AD. METHODS: We established a mouse model of AD via microinjection of Abeta in the lateral ventricle. Utilizing a combination of western blotting assays, electrophysiological recordings, and behavioral tests, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of ODN on AD. RESULTS: DBI expression was decreased in AD model mice and cells. Meanwhile, ODN decreased Abeta generation by downregulating amyloidogenic AbetaPP processing in HEK-293 cells stably expressing human Swedish mutant APP695 and BACE1 (2EB2). Moreover, ODN could inhibit Abeta-induced oxidative stress in primary cultured cells and mice, as reflected by a dramatic increase in antioxidants and a decrease in pro-oxidants. We also found that ODN could reduce oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular Ca2 + and cleaved caspase-3 levels in Abeta-treated primary cultured cells and mice. More importantly, intracerebroventricular injection of ODN attenuated cognitive impairments as well as long-term potentiation in Abeta-treated mice. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ODN may exert a potent neuroprotective effect against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and memory decline via its antioxidant effects, indicating that ODN may be a potential therapeutic agent for AD.
