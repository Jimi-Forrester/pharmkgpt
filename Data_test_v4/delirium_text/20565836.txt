20565836|t|Sparing brain damage in severe sepsis: a beginning.
20565836|a|Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) resembles metabolic encephalopathies but with a difference: there is the potential for enduring brain damage/dysfunction. The pathogenesis of SAE is likely multifactorial. However, the severity of SAE parallels the severity of the septic illness and the brain's microcirculation is probably affected in a similar manner to that of other organs. Mild cases of SAE are often completely reversible, but there is increasing evidence that severe cases have neurological sequelae. A better understanding of the mechanisms may lead to brain-sparing, protective strategies.
