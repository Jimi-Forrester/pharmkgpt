36507077|a|[Purpose] With the innovation of healthcare delivery systems, a need for early determination of patients' discharge outcomes arises after proximal femur fracture surgery, to reduce the burden on healthcare infrastructure. Several studies have examined the extent of walking ability early in the postoperative period to predict the outcome destination. In this study, as an additional validation of these studies, we examined the effect of walking ability on the hospital discharge prognosis of patients in the first week after proximal femur fracture surgery in Japan. [Participants and Methods] Medical records of 228 patients with proximal femur fractures, aged >=75 years old, admitted between April 2015 and March 2019, were retrospectively analyzed. The objective variable was discharge destination. The main evaluation factor was walking ability one-week post-surgery. [Results] Good walking ability and the company of a relative living together one week post-surgery were significant determining factors of discharge destination. [Conclusion] The ability to walk and the presence of a co-resident one week after surgery increased the likelihood of proximal femur fracture patients to be discharged directly to home. Our findings may help rehabilitation professionals make better decisions regarding discharge destination.
