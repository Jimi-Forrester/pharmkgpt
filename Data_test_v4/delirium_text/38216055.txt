38216055|t|APOE genotype dictates lipidomic signatures in primary human hepatocytes.
38216055|a|Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genetic variants are most notably known for their divergent impact on the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. While APOE genotype has been consistently shown to modulate lipid metabolism in a variety of cellular contexts, the effect of APOE alleles on the lipidome in hepatocytes is unknown. In this study, we investigated the contribution of APOE alleles to lipidomic profiles of donor-derived primary human hepatocytes from 77 subjects. Lipidomic data obtained by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were analyzed across epsilon2/epsilon3, epsilon3/epsilon3, and epsilon3/epsilon4 genotypes to reveal how APOE modulates lipid relative levels over age and between groups. Hepatic APOE concentration, measured by ELISA, was assessed for correlation with lipid abundance in subjects grouped as per APOE genotype and sex. APOE genotype-specific differential lipidomic signatures associated with age for multiple lipid classes but did not differ between sexes. Compared to epsilon2/epsilon3, epsilon3/epsilon4 hepatocytes had higher abundance of acylcarnitines (AC) and acylphosphatidylglycerol (AcylPG) as a class, as well as higher medium and long-chain ACs, AcylPG, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate (BMP), monoacylglycerol (MG) and diacylglycerol (DG) species. The epsilon3/epsilon4 hepatocytes also exhibited a higher abundance of medium and long-chain ACs compared to the epsilon3/epsilon3 hepatocytes. Only in the epsilon3/epsilon4 hepatocytes, APOE concentration was lower and showed a negative correlation with BMP levels, specifically in females. APOE genotype dictates a differential lipidome in primary human hepatocytes. The lipids involved suggest mitochondrial dysfunction with accompanying alterations in neutral lipid storage, reflective of a general disturbance of free fatty acid metabolism in human hepatocytes with the epsilon4 allele.
