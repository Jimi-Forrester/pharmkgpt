38174265|t|Construction and characterization of a magnetic nanoparticle-supported Cu complex: a stable and active nanocatalyst for synthesis of heteroaryl-aryl and di-heteroaryl sulfides.
38174265|a|Diaryl and di-heteroaryl sulfides exist in the structure of many drugs and important biological compounds, also these compounds are well-known in medicinal chemistry due to important biological and pharmaceutical activities. Therefore, the development of novel, ecofriendly and efficient catalytic systems for the preparation of diaryl and di-heteroaryl sulfides is a very attractive and important challenge in organic synthesis. In this attractive methodology, we wish to introduce Fe3O4-supported 3-amino-4-mercaptobenzoic acid copper complex (Fe3O4@AMBA-CuI) nanomaterials as a novel and efficient magnetically recoverable catalyst for the preparation of heteroaryl-aryl and di-heteroaryl sulfides with high yields through reaction of heteroaryl halides with aryl or heteroaryl boronic acids and S8 as the sulfur source under ecofriendly conditions. This catalytic system was very efficient and practical for a diverse range of heteroaryl substrates including benzothiazole, benzoxazole, benzimidazole, oxadiazole, benzofuran, and imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine, because the desired diaryl and di-heteroaryl sulfides were prepared with high yields. The reusability-experiments revealed that the Fe3O4@AMBA-CuI nanocatalyst can be magnetically separated and reused at least six times without a significant decrease in its catalytic activity. VSM and ICP-OES analyses confirmed that despite using the Fe3O4@AMBA-CuI nanocatalyst 6 times, the magnetic properties and stability of the catalyst were still maintained. Although all the obtained heteroaryl-aryl and di-heteroaryl sulfide products are known and previously reported, the synthesis of this number of heteroaryl-aryl and di-heteroaryl sulfides has never been reported by any previouse methods.
