22475795|a|Autophagy is a homeostatic process involved in the turnover or elimination of cytoplasmic components, damaged organelles, and protein aggregates via a lysosomal degradation mechanism. Autophagy also provides a mechanism of innate immunity, known as xenophagy, designed to protect cells from intracellular pathogens, but it may unfortunately be subverted to act as a pro-viral pathway facilitating the replication of certain viruses. Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) is a neurotropic virus that remains latent in host neurons; it is the most common cause of sporadic viral encephalitis. Moreover, HSV-1 has been related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. HSV-1 can modulate the autophagic process through a mechanism mediated by the viral protein ICP34.5. Here we report that HSV-1 induces a strong increase in GFP-LC3 and endogenous LC3 lipidation, and triggers the accumulation of intracellular autophagic compartments (mainly autophagosomes) without enhancing autophagic long-lived protein degradation in the late stages of infection. Autophagy inhibition mediated by ATG5 gene silencing had no effect on viral growth. The present results suggest that HSV-1 infection activates the host autophagic machinery and strongly controls the autophagic process, blocking the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. These events might be important in the neurodegenerative process associated with HSV-1 infection.
