37552326|a|INTRODUCTION: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a good treatment for end-stage knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Approximately 60% of the patients are females, and 40% are males. This study analyzed pre- and postoperative angle differences in the range of motion (ROM), and the occurrence of complications with traditional posterior stabilization versus kinematic TKA in relation to gender. METHODS: Data from 434 patients with primary cemented total knee arthroplasty from 2018 to 2021 were collected. Alpha and beta angles were determined pre- and postsurgery. The ROM was collected pre- and postoperatively and during follow-up. Additionally, perioperative complications, revision rate, and blood transfusion management were investigated. RESULTS: The pre- and postoperative alpha-angle between men and women was significantly different, as was the level of alpha-angle correction between men and women (p = 0.001; p = 0.003). Same-gender differences in pre- to postoperative alpha-angles between traditional and kinematic TKA were shown (women (w): p = 0.001; men (m); p = 0.042). High postoperative alpha angles led to less ROM in traditional TKA for women (p = 0.008). No significant gender differences in ROM, perioperative complications, or revision surgery and transfusion rates were found. CONCLUSION: Despite high gender differences in pre- and postoperative angles, only female patients with traditional arthroplasty and high postoperative alpha angles showed less ROM in the follow-up. This leads to the assumption that gender-related pre- and postoperative angle differences, and the degree of angle correction, do not influence the ROM or perioperative occurrence of complications. Both designs present safe procedures for both genders with a wide spectrum of axis deformities.
