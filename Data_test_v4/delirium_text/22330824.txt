22330824|a|New criteria related to prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been proposed to overcome the issue of heterogeneity of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to better define patients in early stage AD. Only few therapeutic trials, if any, have been reported using this newly defined population. The objective of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of a novel pro-cholinergic drug (V0191) in patients with prodromal AD. Two hundred forty two (242) patients with a diagnosis of prodromal AD were randomized in an approximately 1 : 1 ratio to receive either 1500 mg V0191 or matching placebo once daily for 24 weeks. Changes in global cognitive functioning were assessed using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog; responder rate as primary efficacy measure). Standardized measures of memory, executive function, attention, functional capacity, and apathy were also obtained. Despite some interesting trends at week 12 and conversion rates favoring V0191, no statistically significant differences in cognitive function between V0191 and placebo were noted. In addition to the absence of drug efficacy on this population, several design features may have hindered this study, including insufficient powering to assess changes in cognition over time, a relatively short duration of treatment, and the lack of validated clinical trial measures designed to assess the prodromal AD population. Lessons learned in AD study design optimization, including those presented in this paper, could be valuable for further investigation with pro-cholinergic drugs such as V0191.
