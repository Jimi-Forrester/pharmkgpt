22333440|a|The key neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease are abnormal deposition of Abeta plaques and insoluble Abeta peptides in extracellular brain and intracellular neurofibril tangles induced by abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation. mu-Calpain is one of the factors that bridge these Abeta- and hyperphosphorylated tau-mediated pathological pathways. Undecylenic acid (UDA), a naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acid, was discovered as a mu-calpain inhibitor by screening a chemical library using a substrate specific mu-calpain assay method. UDA inhibited Abeta oligomerization and Abeta fibrillation and reversed Abeta-induced neuronal cell death. In addition, UDA scavenged ROS and reversed the levels of proapoptotic proteins induced by ROS in SH-SY5Y cells. UDA inhibited mu-calpain activity with better potency than the known peptide-like mu-calpain inhibitor, MDL28170, in SH-SY5Y and HEK293T cells transfected with the catalytic subunit of mu-calpain. These results suggest that UDA is a novel non-peptide-like mu-calpain inhibitor with good cell permeability and potent neuroprotective effect.
