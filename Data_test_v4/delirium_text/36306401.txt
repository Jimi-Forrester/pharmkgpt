36306401|t|COVID-19 and myasthenia gravis: A review of neurological implications of the SARS-COV-2.
36306401|a|INTRODUCTION: This review highlights the potential mechanisms of neuromuscular manifestation of COVID-19, especially myasthenia gravis (MG). METHODS: An extensive literature search was conducted by two independent investigators using PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar from its inception to December 2020. RESULTS: Exacerbations of clinical symptoms in patients of MG who were treated with some commonly used COVID-19 drugs has been reported, with updated recommendations of management of symptoms of neuromuscular disorders. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can induce the immune response to trigger autoimmune neurological disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Further clinical studies are warranted to indicate and rather confirm if MG in the setting of COVID-19 can pre-existent subclinically or develop as a new-onset disease.
