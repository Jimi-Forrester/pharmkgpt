36009763|t|Sensitivity and Specificity of Patient-Reported Clinical Manifestations to Diagnose COVID-19 in Adults from a National Database in Chile: A Cross-Sectional Study.
36009763|a|(1) Background: The diagnosis of COVID-19 is frequently made on the basis of a suggestive clinical history and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory secretions. However, the diagnostic accuracy of clinical features is unknown. (2) Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of patient-reported clinical manifestations to identify cases of COVID-19. (3) Methodology: Cross-sectional study using data from a national registry in Chile. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed using RT-PCR in all cases. Anonymised information regarding demographic characteristics and clinical features were assessed using sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to combine epidemiological risk factors and clinical features. (4) Results: A total of 2,187,962 observations were available for analyses. Male participants had a mean age of 43.1 +- 17.5 years. The most common complaints within the study were headache (39%), myalgia (32.7%), cough (31.6%), and sore throat (25.7%). The most sensitive features of disease were headache, myalgia, and cough, and the most specific were anosmia and dysgeusia/ageusia. A multivariable model showed a fair diagnostic accuracy, with a ROC AUC of 0.744 (95% CI 0.743-0.746). (5) Discussion: No single clinical feature was able to fully confirm or exclude an infection by SARS-CoV-2. The combination of several demographic and clinical factors had a fair diagnostic accuracy in identifying patients with the disease. This model can help clinicians tailor the probability of COVID-19 and select diagnostic tests appropriate to their setting.
