22567943|a|Results of examination and treatment of 130 patients with severe alcoholic intoxication and toxic hepatopathy in conjunction with metabolic disorders are presented Inclusion of remaxol in therapy of alcoholic intoxication improved its clinical course (reduction in the frequency of secondary pulmonary complications from 18.5 to 3. 1%, the frequency and duration of alcoholic delirium from 33.9 to 10.8%, the duration of stay in an intensive therapy ward from 7.3+/-0.6 to 5.6+/-0.3 days and the overall duration of therapy from11.8+/-1.05 to 5.6+/-0.3 days). Moreover, remaxol and ademetionine improved biochemical characteristics of the patients deteriorated as a result of hepatic toxicosis. This effect of remaxol was more pronounced than that of ademetionine.
