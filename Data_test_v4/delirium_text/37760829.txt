37760829|t|Porcine Astrocytes and Their Relevance for Translational Neurotrauma Research.
37760829|a|Astrocytes are essential to virtually all brain processes, from ion homeostasis to neurovascular coupling to metabolism, and even play an active role in signaling and plasticity. Astrocytic dysfunction can be devastating to neighboring neurons made inherently vulnerable by their polarized, excitable membranes. Therefore, correcting astrocyte dysfunction is an attractive therapeutic target to enhance neuroprotection and recovery following acquired brain injury. However, the translation of such therapeutic strategies is hindered by a knowledge base dependent almost entirely on rodent data. To facilitate additional astrocytic research in the translatable pig model, we present a review of astrocyte findings from pig studies of health and disease. We hope that this review can serve as a road map for intrepid pig researchers interested in studying astrocyte biology.
