37857768|a|PURPOSE: To provide updated evidence on the association of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)/sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) with risk of all-cause cognitive impairment/dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: A systematic literature search was done in PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus databases for cohort studies (retrospective or prospective) that documented the association of SDB/OSA with the risk of cognitive impairment or all-cause dementia or AD. Only studies that were published in the year 2000 and onwards were included. The random-effects model was used for all the analyses and effect sizes were reported as hazards ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Of 15 studies were included in the meta-analysis, SDB/OSA was diagnosed with at-home polysomnography in six studies, while five studies relied on self-report or questionnaires. In the remaining studies, International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes determined the diagnosis of SDB. The overall pooled analysis showed that patients with SDB/OSA had higher risk of cognitive impairment and/or all-cause dementia (HR 1.52, 95% CI: 1.32, 1.74), when compared to patients without SDB/OSA. However, when studies with diagnosis of SDB based on polysomnography were pooled together, the strength of association for all-cause cognitive impairment was weaker (HR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.74). CONCLUSION: Findings suggest a possible association of SDB/OSA with risk of all-cause cognitive impairment and/or dementia. However, careful interpretation is warranted as the majority of the studies did not rely on objective assessment based on polysomnography.
