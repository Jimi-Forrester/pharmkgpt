16816793|t|Non-motor aspects of Parkinson's disease.
16816793|a|Parkinson's disease is primarily considered to be a movement disorder and is defined by its motor signs. Yet, the behavioral manifestations of the disease are often more debilitating than its motor complications. This review will focus on the non-motor aspects of Parkinson's disease, including mood, psychosis, cognitive, sleep, fatigue, apathy, delirium, and repetitive disorders, that may occur. The phenomenology, pathology, and treatment of the behavioral symptoms of Parkinson's disease will be discussed.
