34288784|t|Experiences of Daughters Caring for a Parent With Alzheimer's Disease Living at Home.
34288784|a|The current study used purposeful and snowball sampling to interview 12 daughters who were care-givers to their parents with Alzheimer's disease. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews and were analyzed using Colaizzi's descriptive phenomenological approach. Caregiving years ranged from 1 to 10 years, with a mean of 5 years. Six themes were uncovered: (a) Where Are You When I Need You?; (b) Safety First; (c) I Don't Know What to Say or How to Say It; (d) They Are Beautiful People, but They Aren't Trained; (e) Letting Go of Who They Were; and (f) It Affects Every Area of My Life. Findings suggest that caregiver daughters of parents with AD living at home are struggling and indicate a need for better support of caregivers. Implications for nursing practice, research, and education are significant and require a greater focus on the support of informal caregivers of persons with AD.
