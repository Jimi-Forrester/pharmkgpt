36464726|t|Angiotensin Type 2 Receptor Pharmacological Agonist Relieves Neurocognitive Deficits via Reducing Neuroinflammation and Microglial Engulfment of Dendritic Spines.
36464726|a|Mechanically ventilated patients suffering critical illness are at high risk of developing neurocognitive impairments. Angiotensin type 2 receptor (AGTR2) has been demonstrated to be anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective. The present study thus aimed to investigate whether AGTR2 can alleviate cerebral dysfunction in mice subjected to cochallenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mechanical ventilation (MV), and to reveal the underlying mechanism. We utilized a mice model that received a single injection of LPS (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) followed 2 h later by MV (10 ml/kg, lasting for 2 h). Pretreatment with the AGTR2 pharmacological agonist C21 (0.03, 0.3, and 3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, once daily, lasting for 10 days). Locomotor activity and behavioral deficits were evaluated 24 h post-MV by open-field and fear-condition tests. Brain hippocampus and prefrontal cortex tissues were collected for immunofluorescence staining and western blotting to evaluate the resulting impacts on microglia, including morphological traits, functional markers, synaptic engulfment, superoxide production, and signaling molecules. Compared with vehicle-control, pre-administrated C21 reduced the branch endpoints and length of microglia processes in a dose-dependent manner in mice subjected to LPS/MV. The neuroprotective effect of AGTR2 was behaviorally confirmed by the improvement of memory decline in LPS/MV-treated mice following C21 pretreatment. In addition to morphological alterations, C21 reduced microglial functional markers and reduced microglial-dendrite contact and microglial engulfment of synaptic protein markers. In terms of the underlying molecular mechanism, AGTR2 stimulation by C21 leads to activation of protein phosphatase 2A, which subsequently mitigates microglial PKCdelta and NF-kappaB activation, and inhibites NOX2-derived ROS production. The AGTR2 agonist C21 alleviates behavioral deficits in those mice subjected to LPS/MV, via mechanisms that involve reactive microglia and abnormal synaptic plasticity in NOX2-derived ROS and the PKCdelta-NFkappaB pathway.
