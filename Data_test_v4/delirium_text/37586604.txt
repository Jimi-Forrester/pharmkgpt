37586604|t|PCSK9 and the nervous system: a no-brainer?
37586604|a|In the past 20 years, PCSK9 has been shown to play a pivotal role in LDL cholesterol metabolism and cardiovascular health, by inducing the lysosomal degradation of the LDL receptor. PCSK9 was discovered by the cloning of genes up-regulated after apoptosis induced by serum deprivation in primary cerebellar neurons, but despite its initial identification in the brain, the precise role of PCSK9 in the nervous system remains to be clearly established. The present manuscript is a comprehensive review of studies published or in print before July 2023, that have investigated the expression pattern of PCSK9, its effects on lipid metabolism, as well as its putative roles specifically in the central and peripheral nervous systems, with a special focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.
