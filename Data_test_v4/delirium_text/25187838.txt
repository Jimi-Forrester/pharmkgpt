25187838|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ginsenoside compound K on beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide clearance in primary astrocytes. Abeta degradation in primary astrocytes was determined using an intracellular Abeta clearance assay. Aggregated LC3 in astrocyte cells, which is a marker for the level of autophagy, was detected using laser scanning confocal microscope. The effect of compound K on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/autophagy pathway was determined using western blot analysis, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for Abeta detection. The results demonstrated that compound K promoted the clearance of Abeta and enhanced autophagy in primary astrocytes. In addition, it was found that phosphorylation of mTOR was inhibited by compound K, which may have contributed to the enhanced autophagy. In conclusion, compound K promotes Abeta clearance by enhancing autophagy via the mTOR signaling pathway in primary astrocytes.
