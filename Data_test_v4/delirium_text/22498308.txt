22498308|a|The deposition of beta-amyloid protein(Abeta) and loss of neurons within the brain are the pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Apoptosis is a crucial pathway in neuronal loss in AD. Tanshinone IIA (tanIIA) is one of ingredients of tanshinone which is the major component of the traditional Chinese herb Danshen. The present study explores the effects of tanIIA on Abeta(1-42)-induced cytotoxicity. Cultured cortical neurons that were treated with 4 muM Abeta(1-42) showed shrunken perikaryon with loss of neurite processes; the survival rate of neurons decreased almost to 57% and the apoptotic rate of neurons increased to 47%. In addition, the level of gene bcl-xl mRNA and Bcl-xL protein decreased significantly. These changes, however, were prevented by pretreatment of neurons with tanIIA for 24h before Abeta(1-42), which markedly increased neuron survival rate compared to neurons treated with Abeta(1-42) alone; the apoptotic rate of neurons decreased to 15%, and the decrease in level of gene bcl-xl mRNA and Bcl-xL protein in Abeta-treated neurons, were prevented. Thus, we conclude that tanIIA might serve as an obvious neuroprotection. TanIIA protected neurons against the Abeta-induced cytotoxicity most likely via activation of the Bcl-xL pathway.
