31905923|a|Quercetin is a flavonoid with notable pharmacological effects and promising therapeutic potential. It is widely distributed among plants and found commonly in daily diets predominantly in fruits and vegetables. Neuroprotection by quercetin has been reported in several in vitro studies. It has been shown to protect neurons from oxidative damage while reducing lipid peroxidation. In addition to its antioxidant properties, it inhibits the fibril formation of amyloid-beta proteins, counteracting cell lyses and inflammatory cascade pathways. In this review, we provide a synopsis of the recent literature exploring the relationship between quercetin and cognitive performance in Alzheimer's disease and its potential as a lead compound in clinical applications.
