30341696|a|In early 1920s, tyramine oxidase was discovered that metabolized tyramine and in 1933 Blaschko demonstrated that this enzyme also metabolized adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine. Zeller gave it the name monoamine oxidase (MAO) to distinguish it from the enzyme that oxidatively deaminated diamines. MAO was recognized as an enzyme of crucial interest to pharmacologists because it catalyzed the major inactivation pathway for the catecholamines (and, later, 5-hydroxytryptamine, as well). Within the few decade, the inhibitors of MAO were discovered and introduced for the treatment of depressive illness which was established clinically. However, the first clinical use exposed serious side effects, pharmacological interest in, and investigation of, MAO continued, resulting in the characterization of two forms, distinct forms, MAO-A and -B, and selective inhibitors for them. Selective inhibitors of MAO-B (selegiline, rasagiline and safinamide) have found a therapeutic role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and reversible inhibitors of MAO-A offered antidepressant activity without the serious side effects of the earlier nonselective MAO inhibitors. Subsequent molecular pharmacological have also generated the concept of neuroprotection, reflecting the possibility of slowing, halting and maybe reversing, neurodegeneration in Parkinson's or Alzheimer's diseases. Increased levels of oxidative stress through the accumulation of iron in the Parkinsonian and Alzheimer brains has been suggested to be critical for the initiation and progress of neurodegeneration. Selective inhibition of brain MAO could contribute importantly to lowering such stress, preventing the formation of hydrogen peroxide. Interaction of Iron with hydrogen peroxide and lead to Fenton reaction and production of the most reactive radical, namely hydroxyl radical. There are complex interactions between free iron levels in brain and MAO, and cascade of neurotoxic events may have practical outcomes for depressive disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. As consequence recent novel therapeutic drugs for neurodegenerative diseases has led to the development of multi target drugs, that possess selective brain MAO A and B inhibitory moiety, iron chelating and antioxidant activities and the ability to increase brain levels of endogenous neurotrophins, such as BDNF, GDNF VEGF and erythropoietin and induce mitochondrial biogenesis.
