21696875|t|Domain or not domain? That is the question: longitudinal semantic deterioration in Alzheimer's disease.
21696875|a|Category specific semantic impairment (e.g. living versus nonliving things) has been reported in association with various pathologies, including herpes simplex encephalitis and semantic dementia. However, evidence is inconsistent regarding whether this effect exists in diseases progressively impacting diverse cortical regions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ceiling effects producing non-Gaussian distributions and poor control for confounds such as nuisance variables (e.g. familiarity) may contribute to this discrepancy. Fourteen AD patients were longitudinally studied examining category effects on three semantic tasks (picture naming, naming to description and word to picture matching) matched across domain on all known nuisance variables (NV). To address non-Gaussian distributions, we run bootstrap analyses to determine whether NV, semantic domain or control performance best predicted AD patient performance. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses revealed that, whilst NV accounted for most of the explained variance in patients in the three tasks, the influence of semantic domain was substantially lower. Individual logistic regression demonstrated a significant category effect in only a few patients and healthy controls. No significant qualitative changes were observed in patients over time. Our results confirm the importance of NVs as predictors of AD patient performance, suggesting that the role of semantic domain is not a useful predictor of the progressive deterioration in AD.
