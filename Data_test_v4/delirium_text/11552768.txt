11552768|t|A 28-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with Cerebrolysin in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
11552768|a|Cerebrolysin (Cere) is a compound with neurotrophic activity which has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in earlier trials. The efficacy and safety of repeated treatments with Cere were investigated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. One hundred and forty-nine patients were enrolled (76 Cere; 73 placebo). Patients received i.v. infusions of 30 ml Cere or placebo 5 days per week for 4 weeks. This treatment was repeated after a 2-month therapy-free interval. Effects on cognition and clinical global impressions were evaluated 4, 12, 16, and 28 weeks after the beginning of the infusions using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subpart (ADAS-cog). All assessments, including the 28-week follow-up visit were performed under double-blind conditions. At week 16, the responder rate of the Cere group was 63.5% on the CGI, compared to 41.4% in the placebo group (P < 0.004). In the ADAS-cog, an efficacy difference of 3.2 points in favour of Cere was observed (P < 0.0001). Notably, improvements were largely maintained in the Cere group until week 28, 3 months after the end of treatment. Adverse events were recorded in 43% of Cere and 38% of placebo patients. Cere treatment was well tolerated and led to significant improvement in cognition and global clinical impression. A sustained benefit was still evident 3 months after drug withdrawal.
