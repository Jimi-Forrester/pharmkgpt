10207721|t|A genealogical study of Alzheimer disease in the Saguenay region of Quebec.
10207721|a|We performed an analysis of inbreeding and kinship among the ascending genealogies of 205 autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer disease (AD) subjects recruited in the Saguenay area of Quebec. We hypothesized that if some traits pertaining to the disease were determined by inherited factors, and if the corresponding genes were not too frequent in the population, it might be possible to detect some clusters of patients related to common ancestors and presenting a level of kinship and/or inbreeding higher than is observed in the unaffected population of the same age. In view of the heterogeneity of the disease, we also verified if some of the factors investigated could be associated more specifically with subsets of cases based on age of onset and on apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Results were compared with those obtained on 205 controls matched for gender, place and year of birth. We found that late-onset AD cases with an APOE-epsilon 4 were significantly more inbred than controls and that this increase was explained by the high level of inbreeding of a few cases whose parents were related at the first-cousin level. This could possibly indicate the implication of a recessive element in a small subset of AD cases in the Saguenay population. We also found that late-onset epsilon 4+ cases were significantly more closely related among themselves than with controls. This increase in kinship may be attributable to the presence of the epsilon 4 allele or to some other unidentified genetic factor possibly acting in conjunction with APOE-epsilon 4.
