31363435|a|In light of the opioid epidemic, cardiac complications following a loperamide overdose are a growing concern for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Here, we present the case of a 35-year-old male with long QT syndrome who presented following a loperamide overdose and was receiving multiple shocks because of the resulting arrhythmias and electrolyte disturbances. It is necessary for emergency physicians to be aware of loperamide overdoses because cases have been increasing over the past several years and the cardiac complications can be life-threatening.
