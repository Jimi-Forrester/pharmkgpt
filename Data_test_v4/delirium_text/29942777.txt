29942777|t|A rare case of influenza A in a hospitalized adult presenting with encephalitis and a seizure.
29942777|a|Influenza A in hospitalized adults uncommonly may present with neurologic manifestations, e.g., encephalitis. Encephalitis is the most common influenza related neurologic complication in adults, However, seizures in hospitalized adults due to influenza are extremely rare. This is a case of a 58 year old female hospitalized for influenza A. On admission, she was confused and obtunded. Her EEG showed diffuse global slowing indicative of encephalitis. On hospital day (HD) #2, she had a seizure. She had no history of a seizure disorder, and was not febrile at the time of the seizure. While seizures are not uncommon in children (febrile seizures) with influenza B, but in adults with influenza A, only a few cases of seizures have been reported. This case was most interesting in having both encephalitis and seizure complicating influenza A. If present, neuropsychiatric manifestations may be due to ostelamivir, but encephalitis and seizures are not among the neurologic adverse effects of ostelamivir. In adults hospitalized with influenza A, clinicians should be alert to the possibility of neurologic complications.
