32894185|t|Efficacy and safety of CD19 CAR T constructed with a new anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor in relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
32894185|a|BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that resistance to CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cell therapy may be due to the presence of CD19 isoforms that lose binding to the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) in current use. As such, further investigation of CARs recognize different epitopes of CD19 antigen may be necessary. METHODS: We generated a new CD19 CAR T (HI19alpha-4-1BB-zeta CAR T, or CNCT19) that includes an scFv that interacts with an epitope of the human CD19 antigen that can be distinguished from that recognized by the current FMC63 clone. A pilot study was undertaken to assess the safety and feasibility of CNCT19-based therapy in both pediatric and adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL). RESULTS: Data from our study suggested that 90% of the 20 patients treated with infusions of CNCT19 cells reached complete remission or complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CR/CRi) within 28 days. The CR/CRi rate was 82% when we took into account the fully enrolled 22 patients in an intention-to-treat analysis. Of note, extramedullary leukemia disease of two relapsed patients disappeared completely after CNCT19 cell infusion. After a median follow-up of 10.09 months (range, 0.49-24.02 months), the median overall survival and relapse-free survival for the 20 patients treated with CNCT19 cells was 12.91 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.74-18.08 months) and 6.93 months (95% CI, 3.13-10.73 months), respectively. Differences with respect to immune profiles associated with a long-term response following CAR T cell therapy were also addressed. Our results revealed that a relatively low percentage of CD8+ naive T cells was an independent factor associated with a shorter period of relapse-free survival (p = 0.012, 95% CI, 0.017-0.601). CONCLUSIONS: The results presented in this study indicate that CNCT19 cells have potent anti-leukemic activities in patients with R/R B-ALL. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the percentage of CD8+ naive T cells may be a useful biomarker to predict the long-term prognosis for patients undergoing CAR T cell therapy.
