38256430|t|Autoimmune Implications in a Patient with Graves' Hyperthyroidism, Pre-eclampsia with Severe Features, and Primary Aldosteronism.
38256430|a|Background and Objectives: Graves' disease (GD) and primary aldosteronism (PA) are two pathologies that can cause significant morbidity and mortality. GD is mediated by autoantibodies, and recent studies have shown autoantibody involvement in the pathophysiology behind both PA and pre-eclampsia. The coexistence of GD and PA, however, is reportedly rare. This report describes a unique case of Graves' hyperthyroidism and concomitant PA in a patient with a history of pre-eclampsia with severe features. Case Presentation: The patient presented at 17 weeks pregnancy with mild hyperthyroidism, negative TSH receptor antibodies, and a low level of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI). Her TSH became detectable with normal thyroid hormone levels, and therefore, no anti-thyroid medication was administered. At 34 weeks she developed pre-eclampsia with severe features, and a healthy child was delivered; her TSH returned to normal. Seven months after delivery, she presented emergently with severe hyperthyroidism, hypertensive crisis, and a serum potassium of 2.5 mmol/L. Her hypertension was uncontrolled on multiple anti-hypertensives. Both TSI and TSH receptor antibodies were negative. The aldosterone(ng/dL)/renin(ng/mL/h ratio was (13/0.06) = 216.7, and abdominal CT imaging demonstrated normal adrenal glands; thus, a diagnosis of PA was made. Her blood pressure was subsequently controlled with only spironolactone at 50 mg 2xday. Methimazole was started but discontinued because of an allergic reaction. Consequently, a thyroidectomy was performed, and pathology revealed Graves' disease. The patient remained well on levothyroxine at 125 mcg/day and spironolactone at 50 mg 2xday three months after the thyroidectomy. Conclusions: This patient manifested severe GD with antibodies undetectable by conventional TSI and TSH receptor assays and accelerated hypertension from PA simultaneously. These conditions were successfully treated separately by spironolactone and thyroidectomy. Autoimmune PA was considered likely given the clinical picture. The diagnosis of PA should be considered in hypertension with GD.
