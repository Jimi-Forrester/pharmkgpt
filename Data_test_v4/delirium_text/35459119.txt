35459119|t|Frontotemporal EEG as potential biomarker for early MCI: a case-control study.
35459119|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies using EEG (electroencephalography) as biomarker for dementia have attempted to research, but results have been inconsistent. Most of the studies have extremely small number of samples (average N = 15) and studies with large number of data do not have control group. We identified EEG features that may be biomarkers for dementia with 120 subjects (dementia 10, MCI 33, against control 77). METHODS: We recorded EEG from 120 patients with dementia as they stayed in relaxed state using a single-channel EEG device while conducting real-time noise reduction and compared them to healthy subjects. Differences in EEG between patients and controls, as well as differences in patients' severity, were examined using the ratio of power spectrum at each frequency. RESULTS: In comparing healthy controls and dementia patients, significant power spectrum differences were observed at 3 Hz, 4 Hz, and 10 Hz and higher frequencies. In patient group, differences in the power spectrum were observed between asymptomatic patients and healthy individuals, and between patients of each respective severity level and healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: A study with a larger sample size should be conducted to gauge reproducibility, but the results implied the effectiveness of EEG in clinical practice as a biomarker of MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and/or dementia.
