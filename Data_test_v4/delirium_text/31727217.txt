31727217|a|Brain tumors and paraneoplastic syndromes can cause various neuropsychiatric symptoms. Rarely, psychiatric symptoms may be the initial presentation of the underlying neurologic lesion. Brain imaging studies are crucial in the diagnosis of brain tumors. Paraneoplastic syndromes are mostly immune-mediated, and antineuronal antibodies may be detected in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Clinical suspicion is very important in assisting the diagnostic workup. Treatment of the psychiatric symptoms depends on the nature of the symptoms. Selection of the psychotropic agent has to be done carefully to minimize complications such as seizures and delirium secondary to anticholinergic toxicity. With advances in targeted therapies, immunology, and genetics, the future appears more promising.
