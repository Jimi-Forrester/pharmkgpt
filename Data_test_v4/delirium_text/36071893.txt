36071893|t|Association between risk polymorphisms for neurodegenerative diseases and cognition in colombian patients with frontotemporal dementia.
36071893|a|Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease of presenile onset. A better characterization of neurodegenerative disorders has been sought by using tools such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), where associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and cognitive profiles could constitute predictive biomarkers for these diseases. However, in FTD, associations between genotypes and cognitive phenotypes are yet to be explored. Here, we evaluate a possible relationship between genetic variants and some cognitive functions in an FTD population. Methodology: A total of 47 SNPs in genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases were evaluated using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform along with their possible relationship with performance in neuropsychological tests in 105 Colombian patients diagnosed with FTD. Results and discussion: The SNPs rs429358 (APOE), rs1768208 (MOBP), and rs1411478 (STX6), were identified as risk factors for having a low cognitive performance in inhibitory control and phonological verbal fluency. Although the significance level was not enough to reach the corrected alpha for multiple comparison correction, our exploratory data may constitute a starting point for future studies of these SNPs and their relationship with cognitive performance in patients with a probable diagnosis of FTD. Further studies with an expansion of the sample size and a long-term design could help to explore the predictive nature of the potential associations we identified.
