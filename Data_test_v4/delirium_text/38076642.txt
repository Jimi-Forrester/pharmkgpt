38076642|t|Updates in Characteristics and Survival Rates of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in a Nationwide Cohort of Real-World US Patients, 2003-2021.
38076642|a|Background & Aim: Causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may change as treatments become available for some liver diseases. We examined the distribution of HCC cause and survival of a nationwide cohort of insured patients. Methods: Optum's de-identified Clinformatics  Data Mart Database (CDM), 2003-2021. Results: A total of 34707 patients with HCC were included: mean age: 68.3+-11.6 years, 61% male, 62% Caucasian, 74% cirrhosis. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was the most common etiology (38.9%), then hepatitis C virus (HCV) (25.3%), cryptogenic (18.0%), alcohol-associated liver disease (9.4%), other liver diseases (5.8%) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) at 2.6%. NAFLD patients were the oldest (mean age 71.1+-11.2) and had the highest Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (mean 10.5+-3.9), while HCV were the youngest (mean age 64.2+-9.2 years) and HBV had the lowest CCI (mean 7.2+-4.4) (both P<0.0001). The overall 5-year survival was 18.8% (95% CI 18.2-19.3) but was lower in the recent 2014-2021 period vs 2003-2013 (18.1% vs 19.5%, P=0.003). The 2014-2021 cohort (inclusive of HCV treatment advances) was significantly older, with more females, fewer Caucasians, more African Americans, more Hispanics, fewer Asians, more cirrhosis, more NAFLD, and higher CCI (all P<0.001). On multivariable analysis, males (aHR: 1.13), Caucasians (aHR: 1.46), African Americans (aHR: 1.53) and Hispanics (aHR: 1.28) vs Asians, 2014-2021 (vs 2003-2013) cohort (aHR: 1.12), NAFLD (aHR: 1.14) or cryptogenic liver disease (aHR: 1.45) were associated with increased mortality (all P<0.001). Conclusion: HCC patients in more recent time 2014-2021 were more likely to be older, more likely to have nonviral etiology, and had worse survival compared to those from 2003 to 2013.
