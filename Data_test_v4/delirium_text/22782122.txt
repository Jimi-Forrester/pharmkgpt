22782122|t|Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure in delirious patients: understudied, underreported, or underappreciated? A systematic review and meta-analysis.
22782122|a|BACKGROUND: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to determine the prevalence of delirium in patients receiving noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) for acute respiratory failure and to quantify the prognostic impact of delirium with respect to NPPV failure. METHOD: We searched the databases EMBASE (1996 to present), MEDLINE (1996 to present), PsycINFO( ) (2002 to present) and CINAHL (1992 to present). A Google  search and hand searching of bibliographies or relevant articles were also performed. We searched for prospective observational studies conducted in a setting where patients with acute respiratory failure receiving NPPV were screened for delirium. All authors independently assessed references for inclusion and extracted data. Information was collated regarding study design, baseline characteristics of included patients, and the prevalence of delirium. Where prognostic information regarding NPPV failure was reported, a risk ratio for the association between delirium and NPPV failure was derived. These values were pooled in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Three articles were retrieved by the search strategy. These included 239 patients receiving noninvasive ventilation who were assessed for delirium. The prevalence of delirium was recorded at between 33 and 38 % with a pooled prevalence of 37 %. Two studies reported prognostic data and the risk ratios for noninvasive ventilation failure in delirium were calculated as 1.79 (95 % CI 1.09-2.94) and 3.28 (95 % CI 1.60-6.73). A meta-analysis was performed and the pooled risk ratio was found to be 2.12 (95 % CI 1.41-3.18). CONCLUSIONS: The data in this context was scarce and of low quality. A diagnosis of delirium was made in 9 patients and inferred in 80. Despite the current lack of high-quality data and studies, the high reported prevalence of delirium and the association with noninvasive ventilation failure lends support for more awareness amongst health-care professionals and more routine screening. More focused primary research is necessary in this area. Adherence to NICE guidelines regarding delirium in these patients should be a standard of care.
