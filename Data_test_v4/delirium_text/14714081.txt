14714081|a|Phagocytic activity of peripheral blood neutrophils underwent phase changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Neutrophils retained the ability to engulf microbes, but their digestive activity decreased at the early stage of Alzheimer's disease. At the late stage we observed a decrease in the count of phagocytizing neutrophils, reduction of myeloperoxidase activity, and increase in the content of cationic proteins.
