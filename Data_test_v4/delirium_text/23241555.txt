23241555|t|Downregulation of AbetaPP enhances both calcium content of endoplasmic reticulum and acidic stores and the dynamics of store operated calcium channel activity.
23241555|a|The amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is a type-1 transmembrane protein involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has become increasingly evident that AbetaPP, its protein-protein interactions, and its proteolytical fragments may affect calcium homeostasis and vice versa. In addition, there is evidence that calcium dysregulation contributes to AD. To study the role of AbetaPP in calcium homeostasis, we downregulated its expression in SH-SY5Y cells using shRNA (SH-SY5Y/AbetaPP-) or increased expression of AbetaPP695 by transfection (SH-SY5Y/AbetaPP+). The levels of cytosolic Ca2+ after treatment with thapsigargin, monensin, activation of capacitative calcium entry (CCE), and treatment with SKF, a store operated channel (SOCs) inhibitor, were measured by fura-2AM fluorimetry. SH-SY5Y/AbetaPP+ cells show reduced response to thapsigargin and reduced CCE, although this reduction is not statistically significant. On the other hand, we found that, relative to SH-SY5Y, SH-SY5Y/AbetaPP- cells show a significant increase in the response to thapsigargin but not in CCE and their SOCs were more susceptible to SKF inhibition. Additionally, downregulation of AbetaPP resulted in increased response to monensin that induces calcium release from acidic stores. The increase of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum and the acidic stores, when AbetaPP is downregulated, could be attributed to elevated Ca2+ content or to a dysregulation of Ca2+ transfer through their membranes. These data, along with already existing evidence regarding the role of AbetaPP in calcium homeostasis and the early occurring structural and functional abnormalities of endosomes, further substantiate the role of AbetaPP in calcium homeostasis and in AD.
