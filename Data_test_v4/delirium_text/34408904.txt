34408904|t|Cognitive functioning in everyday life: The development of a questionnaire on instrumental activities of daily living in multiple sclerosis.
34408904|a|Neuropsychological test scores in people with MS (PwMS) do not fully reflect cognitive functioning in daily life. Therefore, we developed a questionnaire based on instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), using the Amsterdam IADL-Q  for Alzheimer's disease as starting point. Forty-eight items were evaluated on relevance and clarity by (inter)national experts (n = 30), PwMS (n = 61) and proxies (n = 30). Consequently, four items were omitted, two items were merged and seven items were added. Fifty items were included in the IADL questionnaire specific to cognitive functioning in MS (the MS-IADL-Q). Future studies are warranted to assess the psychometric properties of the MS-IADL-Q.
