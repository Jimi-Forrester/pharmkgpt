35075415|t|Clinical Applications of Aspirin as a Multi-potent Drug Beyond Cardiovascular Implications: A Proof of Concept for Anesthesiologists- A Narrative Review.
35075415|a|To the best of our knowledge, aspirin (ASA) is known as a commonly used medication worldwide. Although the cardiovascular aspects of ASA are well-established, recently, it has been identified that ASA can yield multiple extra-cardiovascular therapeutic potencies in facing neurodegenerative disorders, various cancers, inflammatory responses, and the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we aimed to highlight the proven role of ASA administration in the variety of non-cardiovascular diseases, particularly in the field of anesthesiology.
