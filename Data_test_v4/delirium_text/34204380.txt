34204380|t|Neuropsychiatric and Cognitive Deficits in Parkinson's Disease and Their Modeling in Rodents.
34204380|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with a large burden of non-motor symptoms including olfactory and autonomic dysfunction, as well as neuropsychiatric (depression, anxiety, apathy) and cognitive disorders (executive dysfunctions, memory and learning impairments). Some of these non-motor symptoms may precede the onset of motor symptoms by several years, and they significantly worsen during the course of the disease. The lack of systematic improvement of these non-motor features by dopamine replacement therapy underlines their multifactorial origin, with an involvement of monoaminergic and cholinergic systems, as well as alpha-synuclein pathology in frontal and limbic cortical circuits. Here we describe mood and neuropsychiatric disorders in PD and review their occurrence in rodent models of PD. Altogether, toxin-based rodent models of PD indicate a significant but non-exclusive contribution of mesencephalic dopaminergic loss in anxiety, apathy, and depressive-like behaviors, as well as in learning and memory deficits. Gene-based models display significant deficits in learning and memory, as well as executive functions, highlighting the contribution of alpha-synuclein pathology to these non-motor deficits. Collectively, neuropsychiatric and cognitive deficits are recapitulated to some extent in rodent models, providing partial but nevertheless useful options to understand the pathophysiology of non-motor symptoms and develop therapeutic options for these debilitating symptoms of PD.
