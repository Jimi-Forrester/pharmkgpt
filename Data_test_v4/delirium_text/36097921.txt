36097921|t|[Non-pharmacological prevention and treatment of delirium in the intensive care unit].
36097921|a|Delirium is an acute brain dysfunction that is a common and difficult-to-eliminate problem in the ICU. It is an important factor leading to prolonged hospital stay, increased treatment costs, and long-term cognitive impairment. Nonetheless, compared with the treatment of respiratory failure and its primary disease, the prevention and treatment measurements of delirium have not received enough attention, and its management strategies are still controversial. Evidence-based medicine currently does not support pharmacological approaches to preventing or treating delirium. Instead, it adopts a combination of multiple nonpharmacological methods to manage delirium in ICU patients through standardized evaluation and monitoring under the guidance of doctors and the cooperation of patients and their families.
