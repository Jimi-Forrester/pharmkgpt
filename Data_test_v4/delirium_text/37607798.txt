37607798|t|Protocol for developing a set of performance measures to monitor and evaluate delirium care quality for older adults in the emergency department using a modified e-Delphi process.
37607798|a|INTRODUCTION: Older adults are at high risk of developing delirium in the emergency department (ED). Delirium associated with an ED visit is independently linked to poorer outcomes such as increased length of hospital stay and mortality. Performance measures (PMs) are needed to identify variations in the quality of delirium care to help focus improvement efforts where they are most needed. A preliminary list of 11 quality statements and 24 PMs was developed based on a synthesis of high-quality clinical practice guidelines. The purpose of this study is to gain consensus on a subset of PMs that can be used to evaluate delirium care quality for older ED patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol for a modified e-Delphi study is informed by the Guidance on Conducting and REporting DElphi Studies. Clinical experts from across Canada and internationally will be recruited through peer referral, professional organisations and social media calls for expressions of interest. A minimum of 17 participants will be recruited. The primary survey for each round will consist of closed-ended questions with the opportunity to provide comments to justify decisions and clarify understanding. Using 9-point Likert scales, participants will rate each quality statement according to the concepts of importance and actionability, then its associated PMs according to the concept of necessity. Results will be fed back to participants in subsequent rounds. A priori stopping criteria have been defined in terms of consensus and stability. A minimum of three rounds will be undertaken to allow participants to have feedback, revise previous responses, then stabilise responses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was provided at the University of Manitoba Health Research Ethics Board (ID HS25728 (H2022:340)). Informed consent will be obtained electronically using the Research Electronic Data Capture secure online platform. Knowledge translation and dissemination will be done through traditional (eg, conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications) and non-traditional (eg, ED Grand Rounds) strategies.
