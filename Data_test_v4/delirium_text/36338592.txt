36338592|a|Aim: The influence of frailty on outcomes after hepatectomy for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHCC) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of frailty on the incidence of postoperative complications and survival after major hepatectomy for PHCC. Methods: A total of 87 patients who had undergone surgery for PHCC between 2007 and 2020 were enrolled in this study. Frailty was scored retrospectively using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). The survival and incidence of postoperative complications were compared based on the degree of frailty, and their risk factors were analyzed. Results: The overall survival of the CFS score 1-2 group was significantly higher than that of the CFS score 3-7 group (P = .01). The survival benefit was especially observed in stage I or II PHCC. Furthermore, there were significant differences between the CFS score 1-3 group and the CFS score 4-7 group in the incidence of Clavien-Dindo classification grade >= IIIa (39.4% vs 70.6%; P = .03). Frailty was an independent risk factor for severe postoperative complications (odds ratio, 4.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-15.20; P = .03) and the incidence of systemic complications (P < .01). Conclusion: Frailty is a predictive factor for short- and long-term outcomes in patients who have undergone major hepatectomy for PHCC.
