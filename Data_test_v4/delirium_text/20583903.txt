20583903|t|Schizophrenia and apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism in Serbian population.
20583903|a|Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene variants are associated with alterations in brain function and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and conflicting results have been reported in schizophrenia. Our results showed no significant differences in APOE allele or genotype frequencies between the Serbian schizophrenic patients and control individuals. However, we observed a possible association between particular subtypes of schizophrenia and APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype (p = .01221) and epsilon4 allele showed a tendency toward positive association with responding to typical neuroleptics. APOE genotypes have no major influence on risk of schizophrenia, treatment and response to conventional antipsychotics, and age of onset in schizophrenia.
