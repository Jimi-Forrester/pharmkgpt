15711269|a|PURPOSE: We report our experience with salvage radical surgery as palliative treatment in patients with bulky recurrence of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy (RP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: From files at the department of urology we identified 5 patients who had biopsy confirmed, bulky recurrence of prostate cancer after initial RP and subsequent salvage radiation therapy (4), prior to presentation at our cancer center. Positive surgical margins were present in all 5 patients. All received androgen ablation and 4 also received systemic chemotherapy. Due to persistent bulky tumors in the 5 patients and debilitating unrelenting symptoms, including refractory hematuria, obstructive uropathy and pelvic pain in 4, salvage radical surgery was performed. Total pelvic exenteration was done in 4 patients and wide tumor resection with continent urinary diversion was done in 1. RESULTS: Four patients were permanently relieved of local symptoms following surgery and another had entero-urethral fistula formation. Revision of a continent urinary diversion was necessary in another patient who was otherwise free of cancer and of local pelvic symptoms. Long-term symptom-free survival was achieved in 2 patients following surgery at 26 and 56 months, respectively. One patient died of metastatic disease 3.5 months after surgery but he had been rendered free of local symptoms by surgery. The other 2 patients are currently free of local symptoms 5 and 7 months following surgery, respectively. Wound infection, delirium and prolonged ileus occurred in 1 patient each. Otherwise surgery was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Salvage radical surgery is feasible and it provides effective palliation in patients with bulky local recurrence following RP.
