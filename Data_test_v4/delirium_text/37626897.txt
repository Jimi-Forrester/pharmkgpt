37626897|t|Alzheimer's Disease-like Pathological Features in the Dorsal Hippocampus of Wild-Type Rats Subjected to Methionine-Diet-Evoked Mild Hyperhomocysteinaemia.
37626897|a|Multifactorial interactions, including nutritional state, likely participate in neurodegeneration's pathogenesis and evolution. Dysregulation in methionine (Met) metabolism could lead to the development of hyperhomocysteinaemia (hHcy), playing an important role in neuronal dysfunction, which could potentially lead to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathological features. This study combines proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) with immunohistochemical analysis to examine changes in the metabolic ratio and histomorphological alterations in the dorsal rat hippocampus (dentate gyrus-DG) subjected to a high Met diet. Male Wistar rats (420-480 g) underwent hHcy evoked by a Met-enriched diet (2 g/kg of weight/day) lasting four weeks. Changes in the metabolic ratio profile and significant histomorphological alterations have been found in the DG of hHcy rats. We have detected increased morphologically changed neurons and glial cells with increased neurogenic markers and apolipoprotein E positivity parallel with a diminished immunosignal for the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor 1 in hHcy animals. A Met diet induced hHcy, likely via direct Hcy neurotoxicity, an interference with one carbon unit metabolism, and/or epigenetic regulation. These conditions lead to the progression of neurodegeneration and the promotion of AD-like pathological features in the less vulnerable hippocampal DG, which presents a plausible therapeutic target.
