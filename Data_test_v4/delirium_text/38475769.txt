38475769|a|BACKGROUND: The increasing aging population has led to a shortage of geriatric chronic disease caregiver, resulting in inadequate care for elderly people. In this global context, many older people rely on nonprofessional family care. The credibility of existing health websites cannot meet the needs of care. Specialized health knowledge bases such as SNOMED-CT and UMLS are also difficult for nonprofessionals to use. Furthermore, professional caregiver in elderly care institutions also face difficulty caring for multiple elderly people at the same time and working handovers. As a solution, we propose a smart care system for the elderly based on a knowledge graph. METHOD: First, we worked with professional caregivers to design a structured questionnaire to collect more than 100 pieces of care-related information for the elderly. Then, in the proposed system, personal information, smart device data, medical knowledge, and nursing knowledge are collected and organized into a dynamic knowledge graph. The system offers report generation, question answering, risk identification and data updating services. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, we use the expert evaluation method to score the user experience. RESULTS: The results of the study showed that compared to existing tools (health websites, archives and expert team consultation), the system achieved a score of 8 or more for basic information, health support and Dietary information. Some secondary evaluation indicators reached 9 and 10 points. This finding suggested that the system is superior to existing tools. We also present a case study to help the reader understand the role of the system. CONCLUSION: The smart care system provide personalized care guidelines for nonprofessional caregivers. It also makes the job easier for institutional caregivers. In addition, the system provides great convenience for work handover.
