34724384|t|Artificial Chiral Interfaces against Amyloid-beta Peptide Aggregation: Research Progress and Challenges.
34724384|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by an imbalance between the production and clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) species. AD not only influences the life quality of the patients but also heavily burdens the families and society. Therefore, it is an urgent mission to research and develop some new anti-amyloid aggregation drugs. In recent years, there were research and development of engineered nanostructures as Abeta amyloid inhibitors have attracted extensive attention and become a new frontier in nanomedicine. The effects of nanostructural surface properties (e.g., morphology, charge, hydrophobicity) on inhibition of Abeta aggregation are modulated by adsorbed Abeta peptides. Nevertheless, chirality has been seldom considered in recognition of Abeta species and modulation of Abeta aggregations. Moreover, a more relevant question for chiral inhibitors is little known about the molecular mechanism of how to interface chiral effects Abeta targeting recognition and effective mitigation of amyloidosis at the molecular level. Herein, we review recent experimental and theoretical results acquired in the specific areas of artificial chiral nanostructure inhibitors. This article will be essential to provide a microlevel insight into the effects of chiral nanointerfaces on amyloidosis processes as well as the development of chiral inhibitor drugs against Abeta fibrillation.
