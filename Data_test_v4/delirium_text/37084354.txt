37084354|t|Mediating Medical Comorbidities in Geriatric Patients Undergoing Surgery for OVCF: From Preoperative Screening to Risk and Outcomes Optimization.
37084354|a|OBJECTIVES: Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) are a common increasing entity in elderly patients and represent a tremendous economic burden. Surgical treatment is related to high complication rates and little is known about patient-specific and internal risk factors associated with poor clinical results. METHODS: We carried out a comprehensive, systematic literature search according to the PRISMA checklist and algorithm. Risk factors for perioperative complications, for early inpatient readmission, for the duration of the hospital stay, the hospital mortality, the total mortality and the clinical result were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 739 potentially usable studies were identified. After considering all inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 studies with 15,515 patients were included. Non-adjustable risk factors were age >90 years (OR 3.27), male gender (OR 1.41), BMI less than 18.5 kg/m2 (OR 3.97), ASA score >3 (OR 2.7), activity of daily live (ADL) (OR 1.52), dependence (OR 5.68), inpatient admission status (OR 3.22), Parkinson disease (OR 3.63) and disseminated cancer (OR 2.98). Adjustable factors were insufficient kidney function (GFR <60 mL/min, and Creatinine Clearance below 60 mg/dl) (OR 4.4), nutrition status (hypalbuminemia (<3.5 g/dl)), liver function (OR 8.9) and further cardiac and pulmonary comorbidities. DISCUSSION: We identified a couple of non-adjustable risk factors, which should be considered preoperatively in terms of risk assessment. However, even more important were adjustable factors that can be influenced preoperatively. In conclusion, we recommend a perioperative interdisciplinary cooperation, especially with geriatricians, to achieve the best possible clinical results in geriatric patients undergoing surgery for OVCF.
