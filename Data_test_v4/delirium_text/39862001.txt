39862001|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common central neurodegenerative disease disorder characterized primarily by cognitive impairment and non-cognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms that significantly impact patients' daily lives and behavioral functioning. The pathogenesis of AD remains unclear and current Western medicines treatment are purely symptomatic, with a singular pathway, limited efficacy, and substantial toxicity and side effects. In recent years, as research into AD has deepened, there has been a gradual increase in the exploration and application of medicinal plants for the treatment of AD. Numerous studies have shown that medicinal plants and their active ingredients can potentially mitigate AD by regulating various molecular mechanisms, including the production and aggregation of pathological proteins, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurogenesis, neurotransmission, and the brain-gut microbiota axis. In this review, we analyzed the pathogenesis of AD and comprehensively summarized recent advancements in research on medicinal plants for the treatment of AD, along with their underlying mechanisms and clinical evidence. Ultimately, we aimed to provide a reference for further investigation into the specific mechanisms through which medicinal plants prevent and treat AD, as well as for the identification of efficacious active ingredients derived from medicinal plants.
