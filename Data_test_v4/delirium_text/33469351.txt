33469351|a|PURPOSE: Few data are available on the positive impact of photo-biomodulation (PBM) using low-level laser therapy as a complementary treatment for improving the cognitive function and optimizing the hemoglobin (Hb) level and oxygen carrying capacity in anemic elderly patients and consequently improving the quality-of-life. The present study aimed to evaluate a new, safe, and easy therapeutic approach to improve Alzheimer's disease-related symptoms that interfere with the whole life activities and social interaction of elderly patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this placebo-controlled clinical trial, 60 elderly patients suffering from anemia and mild cognitive dysfunction were randomly assigned into two equal groups to receive active or placebo low-level laser in addition to a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise over a 12-week period. Hb level as well as cognitive and functional tests were reassessed for any change after 12 weeks of intervention. RESULTS: By the end of this study, both groups showed significant improvements in Hb level, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCa - B basic), Quality-of-Life for Alzheimer's Disease scale, and Berg Balance scale scores along with significant reduction in body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) (P<0.0001). The experimental group which received active low-level laser in addition to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise showed more significant results compared to the control group which received placebo low-level laser in addition to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise in all the measured outcomes (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Combined low-level laser therapy and moderate-intensity aerobic exercises are more effective in improving the cognitive function and quality-of-life of Alzheimer's disease patients.
