24941596|t|Development of a neuroscience research registry.
24941596|a|There is little data on the long-term health outcomes of patients with neurological conditions treated at long-term acute care specialty hospitals. In order to learn more about these patients and the most effective way to care for them, Bethesda Hospital in St. Paul created a neuroscience research registry. The registry's target population is patients with complex neurological conditions such as aneurysm or intracranial bleed, stroke, seizures, delirium and confusion and traumatic brain injury. This article describes the development of the registry, which has enrolled 857 patients thus far, and what is being learned about those patients.
