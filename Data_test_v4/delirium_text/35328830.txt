35328830|t|Syndecan-3 as a Novel Biomarker in Alzheimer's Disease.
35328830|a|Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is of paramount importance in preserving the patient's mental and physical health in a fairly manageable condition for a longer period. Reliable AD detection requires novel biomarkers indicating central nervous system (CNS) degeneration in the periphery. Members of the syndecan family of transmembrane proteoglycans are emerging new targets in inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. Reviewing the growing scientific evidence on the involvement of syndecans in the pathomechanism of AD, we analyzed the expression of the neuronal syndecan, syndecan-3 (SDC3), in experimental models of neurodegeneration. Initial in vitro studies showed that prolonged treatment of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) increases SDC3 expression in model neuronal and brain microvascular endothelial cell lines. In vivo studies revealed elevated concentrations of TNF-alpha in the blood and brain of APPSWE-Tau transgenic mice, along with increased SDC3 concentration in the brain and the liver. Primary brain endothelial cells and peripheral blood monocytes isolated from APPSWE-Tau mice exhibited increased SDC3 expression than wild-type controls. SDC3 expression of blood-derived monocytes showed a positive correlation with amyloid plaque load in the brain, demonstrating that SDC3 on monocytes is a good indicator of amyloid pathology in the brain. Given the well-established role of blood tests, the SDC3 expression of monocytes could serve as a novel biomarker for early AD detection.
