22115601|t|In vitro study of magnetite-amyloid beta complex formation.
22115601|a|Biogenic magnetite (Fe(3)O(4)) has been identified in human brain tissue. However, abnormal concentration of magnetite nanoparticles in the brain has been observed in different neurodegenerative pathologies. In the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD), these magnetic nanoparticles have been identified attached to the characteristic brain plaques, which are mainly formed by fibrils of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta). However, few clues about the formation of the magnetite-Abeta complex have been reported. We have investigated the interaction between these important players in AD with superconducting quantum interference, scanning electron microscope, surface plasmon resonance, and magnetic force microscopy. The results support the notion that the magnetite-Abeta complex is created before the synthesis of the magnetic nanoparticles, bringing a highly stable interaction of this couple. .
