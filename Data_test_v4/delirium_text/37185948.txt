37185948|a|Dementia is on the rise due to increasing proportion of old people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Although dementia is misattributed to normal ageing or supernatural causes in SSA, it is a brain disease with well-established etiologies. Limited knowledge and understanding of dementia means that many older people are suffering without seeking help and are undiagnosed and untreated. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and factors associated with probable dementia and to describe the knowledge of the disease among adults 50 years and over attending a faith-based geriatric center in Uganda. This was a cross-sectional study using quantitative methods. A total of 267 adults 50 years and over attending a faith-based geriatric center in Mukono, Uganda were interviewed between 1 April and 15 May 2022. Interviews were administered using the Early Dementia Questionnaire (EDQ) and Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale (DKAS). Data on participants' socio-demographics, economic income, living arrangement, history of smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise and past medical history was collected using an additional questionnaire. Adults 50 years and over were included in the study. Logistic regression analyses were done. Probable dementia was 46.2% in the sample. The most common symptoms of probable dementia in the order of their severity were memory symptoms, (beta co-efficient beta 0.08, p < .001), physical symptoms (beta 0.08, p < .001), sleep disturbances (beta 0.81, p < .001) and emotions (beta 0.04, p < .027). The final degree of association as determined by adjusted PR in the multivariable model revealed that only older age (aPR = 1.88, p < .001) and occasional/non-believer (aPR = 1.61, p = .001) remained significantly related to probable dementia. The study also found that 8.0% of the participants had optimal knowledge of dementia. There is high burden of probable dementia among adults 50 years and over attending a faith-based geriatric center in Mukono, Uganda. Factors associated with probable dementia are older age and being an occasional/non-believer. Knowledge of dementia among older adults is low. There is need to promote integrated early dementia screening, care and educational program in primary care to reduce the disease burden. Spiritual support would be a rewarding investment in the lives of the ageing population.
