24160297|t|Synthesis and evaluation of multi-target-directed ligands against Alzheimer's disease based on the fusion of donepezil and ebselen.
24160297|a|A novel series of compounds obtained by fusing the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil and the antioxidant ebselen were designed as multi-target-directed ligands against Alzheimer's disease. An in vitro assay showed that some of these molecules did not exhibit highly potent cholinesterase inhibitory activity but did have various other ebselen-related pharmacological effects. Among the molecules, compound 7d, one of the most potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (IC50 values of 0.042 muM for Electrophorus electricus acetylcholinesterase and 0.097 muM for human acetylcholinesterase), was found to be a strong butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor (IC50 = 1.586 muM), to possess rapid H2O2 and peroxynitrite scavenging activity and glutathione peroxidase-like activity (nu0 = 123.5 muM min(-1)), and to be a substrate of mammalian TrxR. A toxicity test in mice showed no acute toxicity at doses of up to 2000 mg/kg. According to an in vitro blood-brain barrier model, 7d is able to penetrate the central nervous system.
