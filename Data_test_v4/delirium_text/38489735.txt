38489735|a|Currently, there are limited studies assessing ChatGPT ability to provide appropriate responses to medical questions. Our study aims to evaluate ChatGPT adequacy in responding to questions regarding osteoporotic fracture prevention and medical science. We created a list of 25 questions based on the guidelines and our clinical experience. Additionally, we included 11 medical science questions from the journal Science. Three patients, 3 non-medical professionals, 3 specialist doctor and 3 scientists were involved to evaluate the accuracy and appropriateness of responses by ChatGPT3.5 on October 2, 2023. To simulate a consultation, an inquirer (either a patient or non-medical professional) would send their questions to a consultant (specialist doctor or scientist) via a website. The consultant would forward the questions to ChatGPT for answers, which would then be evaluated for accuracy and appropriateness by the consultant before being sent back to the inquirer via the website for further review. The primary outcome is the appropriate, inappropriate, and unreliable rate of ChatGPT responses as evaluated separately by the inquirer and consultant groups. Compared to orthopedic clinicians, the patients' rating on the appropriateness of ChatGPT responses to the questions about osteoporotic fracture prevention was slightly higher, although the difference was not statistically significant (88% vs 80%, P = .70). For medical science questions, non-medical professionals and medical scientists rated similarly. In addition, the experts' ratings on the appropriateness of ChatGPT responses to osteoporotic fracture prevention and to medical science questions were comparable. On the other hand, the patients perceived that the appropriateness of ChatGPT responses to osteoporotic fracture prevention questions was slightly higher than that to medical science questions (88% vs 72 7%, P = .34). ChatGPT is capable of providing comparable and appropriate responses to medical science questions, as well as to fracture prevention related issues. Both the inquirers seeking advice and the consultants providing advice recognize ChatGPT expertise in these areas.
