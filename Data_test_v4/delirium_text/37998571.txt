37998571|a|BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting the central nervous system (CNS). Due to the different phenotypes of the disease and non-specific symptoms of MS, there is a great need for a validated panel of biomarkers to facilitate the diagnosis, predict disease progression, and evaluate treatment outcomes. METHODS: We determined the levels of the parameters of brain injury (NF-H, GPAF, S100B, and UCHL1) and the selected cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 101 patients diagnosed de novo with RRMS and 75 healthy controls. All determinations were made using the Bio-Plex method. RESULTS: We found higher levels of NF-H and GFAP in the relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) group compared to the controls. The concentrations of both molecules were significantly increased in patients with Gd+ lesions on brain MRI. The level of S100B did not differ significantly between the groups. UCHL1 concentrations were higher in the control group. We found some correlations between the selected cytokines, the levels of the parameters of brain injury, and the time from the first symptoms to the diagnosis of MS. CONCLUSIONS: The role of the above molecules in MS is promising. However, further research is warranted to define their precise functions.
