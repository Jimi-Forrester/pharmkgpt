38487342|a|Background: This study aimed to identify disruptions in white matter integrity in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients by utilizing the white matter tract integrity (WMTI) model, which describes compartment-specific diffusivities in the intra- and extra-axonal spaces, and to investigate the relationship between WMTI metrics and clinical and cognitive measurements. Methods: A total of 73 patients with T2DM and 57 healthy controls (HCs) matched for age, sex, and education level were enrolled and underwent diffusional kurtosis imaging and cognitive assessments. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and atlas-based region of interest (ROI) analysis were performed to compare group differences in diffusional metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axonal water fraction (AWF), intra-axonal diffusivity (Daxon), axial extra-axonal space diffusivity (De,//), and radial extra-axonal space diffusivity (De, ) in multiple white matter (WM) regions. Relationships between diffusional metrics and clinical and cognitive functions were characterized. Results: In the TBSS analysis, the T2DM group exhibited decreased FA and AWF and increased MD, De, , and De,  in widespread WM regions in comparison with the HC group, which involved 56.28%, 32.07%, 73.77%, 50.47%, and 75.96% of the mean WM skeleton, respectively (P < 0.05, TFCE-corrected). De,  detected most of the WM changes, which were mainly located in the corpus callosum, internal capsule, external capsule, corona radiata, posterior thalamic radiations, sagittal stratum, cingulum (cingulate gyrus), fornix (stria terminalis), superior longitudinal fasciculus, and uniform fasciculus. Additionally, De,  in the genu of the corpus callosum was significantly correlated with worse performance in TMT-A (beta = 0.433, P < 0.001) and a longer disease duration (beta = 0.438, P < 0.001). Conclusions: WMTI is more sensitive than diffusion tensor imaging in detecting T2DM-related WM microstructure abnormalities and can provide novel insights into the possible pathological changes underlying WM degeneration in T2DM. De,  could be a potential imaging marker in monitoring disease progression in the brain and early intervention treatment for the cognitive impairment in T2DM.
