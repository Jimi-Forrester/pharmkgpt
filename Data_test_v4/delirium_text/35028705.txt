35028705|t|Postoperative Delirium in Lung Cancer Anatomical Resection-Analysis of Risk Factors and Prognosis.
35028705|a|BACKGROUND: The incidence of postoperative delirium after anatomical lung resection ranges from 5 to 16%. This study aimed to analyze the risk factors and prognosis of postoperative delirium in anatomical lung resection for lung cancer. METHODS: This study included 1351 patients undergoing anatomical lung resection between April 2010 and October 2020. We analyzed the perioperative risk factors of postoperative delirium. We also compared postoperative complications and survival between the delirium and non-delirium groups. RESULTS: Postoperative delirium was identified in 44 (3.3%) of 1351 patients who underwent anatomical lung resection for lung cancer. Age, peripheral vascular disease, depression, and current smoking status were independent risk factors for postoperative delirium in the multivariate analysis. The percentage of postoperative delirium was 0.6% in never smokers and 6.0% in current smokers. The delirium and non-delirium groups showed significant differences in overall survival (p = 0.0144) and non-disease-specific survival (p = 0.0080). After propensity score matching, the two groups did not significantly differ in overall survival (p = 0.9136), non-disease-specific survival (p = 0.8146), or disease-specific survival (p = 0.6804). CONCLUSIONS: Age, peripheral vascular disease, depression, and current smoking status were considered independent risk factors for postoperative delirium in anatomical lung resection for lung cancer. Smoking cessation for at least four weeks before surgery is recommended for reducing incidence of post-operative delirium.
