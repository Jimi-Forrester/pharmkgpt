9805943|a|In an economic analysis one has not only to consider costs induced by hormonal substitution therapy (HRT) but also its impact health. Different therapy costs will be considered and related to potential benefits on health. HRT decreases the incidence of symptoms of the menopause, the risk of osteoporosis and perhaps the incidence of coronary hearth disease and the risk of Alzheimer disease but probably increases the incidence of breast cancer. For a majority of women, the favorable impact seems to dominate, increasing their life expectancy.
