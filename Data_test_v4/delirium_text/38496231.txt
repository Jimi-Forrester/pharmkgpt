38496231|a|Background: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted rapid changes in outpatient neurology services and there remain unanswered questions regarding its long-term impact. First, what are the lasting changes of the pandemic on demographics and outcomes of new referrals and patients reviewed at outpatient neurology clinics? Safety concerns about virtual consultations during the initial stages of the pandemic were also raised. Has the continual adoption of virtual consultations led to negative outcomes for patients? Methods: New referrals and first clinic appointments in 2019 (prepandemic baseline) and 2022 (postpandemic) in a tertiary referral centre were compared retrospectively. 7294 referrals (4946 clinic appointments) in 2019 and 6989 referrals (3976 clinic appointments) in 2022 were assessed. Outcomes investigated were rates of referrals accepted, time to clinic consultation, number of outpatient investigations per appointment, rates of discharge and the risk of reassessment. Results: There was a change in triaging practice postpandemic, with more patients being offered virtual assessments. Virtual appointments were offered to a specific suitable cohort of patients. This resulted in a faster time to consultation, fewer investigations, higher rates of discharge, with a reduced risk of reassessment compared with prepandemic patients, and patients postpandemic who were seen face to face. Conclusion: Outpatient neurology services have adapted postpandemic by effectively triaging referrals and allocating new patients appropriately to face-to-face or virtual clinics, improving patient outcomes and safety.
