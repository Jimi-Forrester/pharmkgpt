18512763|a|Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is one of the most prominent pathologic characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The microtubule-associated protein tau is the major component of NFTs, and its abnormal hyperphosphorylation leads to the destabilization of microtubules, impaired axonal transport, and eventual death of the neurons. The hematopoietic cytokine erythropoietin (Epo) is now considered as a viable agent with regard to central nervous system injury in a variety of cellular systems. Here we report that Epo prevented tau hyperphosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to the beta-amyloid peptide and that this effect may depend on the PI3K/Akt-GSK-3beta pathway. This study provides new molecular insight into the neuroprotective effect of Epo and suggests its possible therapeutic role in the management of AD.
