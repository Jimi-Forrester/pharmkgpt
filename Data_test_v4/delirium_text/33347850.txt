33347850|t|Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Lung Transplant Recipients.
33347850|a|We report risk factors, clinical manifestations, and treatment course of 2 lung transplant recipients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Both patients underwent an initial hospitalization and discharged home, followed by readmission several days later with significant worsening of respiratory status and infectious symptoms. The first patient underwent prolonged hospitalization requiring tracheostomy and feeding tube placement. The second patient declined intubation and expired. The early documented experiences of COVID-19 pneumonia in lung transplant recipients suggest that although recovery is achievable, the high rate of comorbid conditions and immunocompromised state may place these patients at higher risk for poor outcomes.
