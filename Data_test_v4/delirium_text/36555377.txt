36555377|a|Accumulating evidences suggest a strong correlation between metabolic changes and neurodegeneration in CNS demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Biotin, an essential cofactor for five carboxylases, is expressed by oligodendrocytes and involved in fatty acid synthesis and energy production. The metabolic effect of biotin or high-dose-biotin (MD1003) has been reported on rodent oligodendrocytes in vitro, and in neurodegenerative or demyelinating animal models. However, clinical studies, showed mild or no beneficial effect of MD1003 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or MS. Here, we took advantage of a mouse model of myelin deficiency to study the effects of MD1003 on the behavior of murine and grafted human oligodendrocytes in vivo. We show that MD1003 increases the number and the differentiation potential of endogenous murine oligodendroglia over time. Moreover, the levels of MD1003 are increased in the plasma and brain of pups born to treated mothers, indicating that MD1003 can pass through the mother's milk. The histological analysis of the grafted animals shows that MD1003 increased proliferation and accelerates differentiation of human oligodendroglia, but without enhancing their myelination potential. These findings provide important insights into the role of MD1003 on murine and human oligodendrocyte maturation/myelination that may explain the mitigated outcome of ALS/MS clinical trials.
