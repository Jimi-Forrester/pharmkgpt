34905145|t|Amyloid PET quantification using low-dose CT-guided anatomic standardization.
34905145|a|BACKGROUND: Centiloid (CL) scaling has become a standardized quantitative measure in amyloid PET because it facilitates the direct comparison of results across institutions, even when different analytical methods or tracers are used. Standard volumes of interest must be used to calculate the CL scale after the anatomic standardization of amyloid PET images using coregistered MRI; if the MRI is unavailable, the CL scale cannot be accurately calculated. This study sought to determine the substitutability of low-dose CT, which is used to correct PET attenuation in PET/CT equipment, by evaluating the measurement accuracy when low-dose CT is used as an alternative to MRI in the calculation of the CL scale. Amyloid PET images obtained using 18F-flutemetamol from 24 patients with possible or probable Alzheimer's disease were processed to calculate the CL scale using 3D T1-weighted MRI and low-dose CT of PET/CT. CLMRI and CLCT were, respectively, defined as the use of MRI and CT for anatomic standardization and compared. Regional differences in the CT-based and MRI-based standardized anatomic images were also investigated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Japan Registry of Clinical Trials, jRCTs031180321 (registered 18 March 2019, https://jrct.niph.go.jp/latest-detail/jRCTs031180321 ). RESULTS: A Bland-Altman plot showed that CLCT was slightly but significantly underestimated (mean +- standard deviation, - 1.7 +- 2.4; p < 0.002) compared with CLMRI. The 95% limits of agreement ranged from - 2.8 to - 0.7. Pearson correlation analysis showed a highly significant correlation of r = 0.998 between CLCT and CLMRI (p < 0.001). The linear regression equation was CLMRI = 1.027 x CLCT + 0.762. In a Bland-Altman plot, Spearman correlation analysis did not identify a significant association between the difference in CLMRI versus CLCT and CL load (rho =  - 0.389, p = 0.060). This slight underestimation of CLCT may derive from slightly higher uptake when the cerebellum is used as a reference area in CT-based anatomically standardized PET images versus MRI-based images. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose CT of PET/CT can substitute for MRI in the anatomic standardization used to calculate the CL scale from amyloid PET, although a slight underestimation occurs.
