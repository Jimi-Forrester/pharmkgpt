19118601|a|This study provides the first immunohistochemical evidence of the presence and distribution patterns in the rat spinal cord of alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn), a soluble acidic protein, widely expressed in the CNS and closely associated to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. We used two novel homemade monoclonal antibodies (2E3 and 3D5) recognizing two different epitopes of alpha-Syn. Both antibodies localized alpha-Syn within the nerve terminals, whereas 3D5 alone also localized it within the neuronal nuclei. alpha-Syn-immunoreactive nervous elements were widely recognized throughout rat spinal cord and in almost all the gray matter laminae. However, they appeared particularly concentrated within laminae I, II, VII and X and more scattered in the others. Double immunofluorescent labeling showed that alpha-Syn colocalized with synaptophysin in the presynaptic nerve terminals, with neuropeptide Y (NPY) in lamina I, II, IX and X, and had close relationships with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactive neurons in laminae VII and X. Interestingly, the alpha-Syn-immunoreactive nerve elements, in lamina X, contained little of calbindin-28KD and calretinin-31KD. Our findings could help in understanding the genesis of some early clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), such as pain and dysautonomic disorders, and indicate the spinal cord as their probable starting point, according to the ascending theory of PD, proposed by Braak.
