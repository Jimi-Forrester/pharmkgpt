29218230|a|Spondylodiscitis may involve the vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs, paravertebral structures and spinal canal, with potentially high morbidity and mortality rates.A rise in the susceptible population and improved diagnosis have increased the reported incidence of the disease in recent years.Blood cultures, appropriate imaging and biopsy are essential for diagnosis and treatment.Most patients are successfully treated by conservative means; however, some patients may require surgical treatment.Surgical indications include doubtful diagnosis, progressive neurological deficits, progressive spinal deformity, failure to respond to treatment, and unresolved pain.
