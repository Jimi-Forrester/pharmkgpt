33923275|t|Dynamic Interplay between Copper Toxicity and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease.
33923275|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide, a number expected to exponentially increase in the future since no effective treatments are available so far. AD is characterized by severe cognitive dysfunctions associated with neuronal loss and connection disruption, mainly occurring in specific brain areas such as the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and amygdala, compromising memory, language, reasoning, and social behavior. Proteomics and redox proteomics are powerful techniques used to identify altered proteins and pathways in AD, providing relevant insights on cellular pathways altered in the disease and defining novel targets exploitable for drug development. Here, we review the main results achieved by both -omics techniques, focusing on the changes occurring in AD mitochondria under oxidative stress and upon copper exposure. Relevant information arises by the comparative analysis of these results, evidencing alterations of common mitochondrial proteins, metabolic cycles, and cascades. Our analysis leads to three shared mitochondrial proteins, playing key roles in metabolism, ATP generation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Their potential as targets for development of innovative AD treatments is thus suggested. Despite the relevant efforts, no effective drugs against AD have been reported so far; nonetheless, various compounds targeting mitochondria have been proposed and investigated, reporting promising results.
