36923444|a|Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIB (MPS IIIB) is an ultrarare, fatal pediatric disease with no approved therapy. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding for lysosomal enzyme alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU). Tralesinidase alfa (TA) is a fusion protein comprised of recombinant NAGLU and a modified human insulin-like growth factor 2 that is being developed as an enzyme replacement therapy for MPS IIIB. Since MPS IIIB is a pediatric disease the safety/toxicity, pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of TA were evaluated in juvenile non-human primates that were administered up to 5 weekly intracerebroventricular (ICV) or single intravenous (IV) infusions of TA. TA administered by ICV slow-, ICV isovolumetric bolus- or IV-infusion was well-tolerated, and no effects were observed on clinical observations, electrocardiographic or ophthalmologic parameters, or respiratory rates. The drug-related changes observed were limited to increased cell infiltrates in the CSF and along the ICV catheter track after ICV administration. These findings were not associated with functional changes and are associated with the use of ICV catheters. The CSF PK profiles were consistent across all conditions tested and TA distributed widely in the CNS after ICV administration. Anti-drug antibodies were observed but did not appear to significantly affect the exposure to TA. Correlations between TA concentrations in plasma and brain regions in direct contact with the cisterna magna suggest glymphatic drainage may be responsible for clearance of TA from the CNS. The data support the administration of TA by isovolumetric bolus ICV infusion to pediatric patients with MPS IIIB.
