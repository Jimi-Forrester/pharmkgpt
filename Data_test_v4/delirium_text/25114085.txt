25114085|t|Cognitively-based methods of enhancing and maintaining functioning in those at risk of Alzheimer's disease.
25114085|a|Projections indicate that the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias will increase two to three fold in the coming decades. As a result, there has been considerable interest in identifying methods that maintain or enhance cognitive functioning in these older adults. Existing pharmacological agents are limited in this respect and disease-modifying agents are years away from being available. Cognitively based interventions (i.e., cognitive training, cognitive rehabilitation) hold particular promise for maximizing patients' functioning, are relatively inexpensive, and have virtually no side effects. Everyday life is complex and multifaceted, which means that a personalized approach is essential for maximizing and prolonging functioning in each patient. Unfortunately, little is known about the factors contributing to such an approach. The current review first identifies several lifestyle factors that have been shown to be neuroprotective as well as risk factors that may ultimately contribute to the efficacy of different cognitive intervention techniques. There is a critical need to understand the conditions under which individual techniques are effective; an issue examined through characteristic examples across the AD spectrum. While limited at this time, there is some evidence of the long-term benefits of cognitive intervention. We conclude by describing several critical areas of investigation and proposing a clinically oriented framework for both furthering cognitive intervention research and providing patient-centered care.
