30022180|t|Mesoporous silica nanoparticles in recent photodynamic therapy applications.
30022180|a|In this review, the use of mesoporous silica nanoparticles for photodynamic therapy (PDT) applications is described for the year 2017. Since the pioneering work in 2009, nanosystems involving mesoporous silica nanoparticles have gained in complexity with a sophisticated core-shell system able to perform multi-imaging and multi-therapies, not only for cancer diseases but also for anti-microbial therapy, atherosclerosis, or Alzheimer disease. Near-infrared, excitation light based on up-converting systems, X-rays or persistent luminescent systems are described for deeper tissue treatments.
