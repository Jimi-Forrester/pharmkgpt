15990446|a|The objective of this work is to provide a review of the mortality risk in dementia and potential influencing factors. In order to do so, studies on mortality in dementia based on population-based samples of the last 15 years published in PubMed, Web of Science and PSYNDEXplus were considered. Without exception, all types of dementia are associated with a considerably increased mortality risk. Moreover, the risk of death rises with advancing severity of the disorder. Often, a more favorable course of the disease can be found in Alzheimer's disease. Further questions, such as the influence of age and sex, cannot be answered conclusively. Very little information can be found on aspects concerning comorbidity, APOE polymorphism or depressive symptomatology.
