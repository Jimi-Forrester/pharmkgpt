39691427|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common cause of dementia characterized by the presence of two proteinaceous deposits in the brain. These pathologies may be a consequence of complex interactions between neurons and glia before the onset of cognitive impairments. Curcumin, a bioactive compound found in turmeric, is a promising candidate for AD because it alleviates neuropathologies in mouse models of the disease. Although its clinical efficacy has been hindered by low oral bioavailability, the development of new formulations may overcome this limitation. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a bioavailable curcumin formulation in a mouse model of AD. The formulation was administered to mice in drinking water after encapsulation into micelles using a previously validated method. A neuropathological assessment was performed to determine if it slows or alters the course of the disease. Cognitive performance was not included because it had already been assessed by a previous study. The bioavailable curcumin formulation was unable to alter the size or number of amyloid plaques in a transgenic mouse model. In addition, mechanisms that regulate amyloid beta production were unchanged, suggesting that the disease had not been altered. The number of reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus was not altered by curcumin. However, protein levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein were increased overall in the brain, suggesting that it may have aggravated neuroinflammation. Therefore, a higher dosage, despite its enhanced oral bioavailability, may have a potential risk for neuroinflammation.
