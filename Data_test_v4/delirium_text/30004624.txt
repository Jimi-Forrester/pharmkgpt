30004624|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence delirium is a common complication of sevoflurane anesthesia in children. AIMS: We examined the effects of maintaining remifentanil infusion during the recovery period on the incidence of emergence delirium in preschool-age children undergoing strabismus surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia. METHODS: Eighty children (aged 3-7 years) were randomly assigned to either the control group (group C; intraoperative remifentanil infusion) or the intervention group (group R; intraoperative remifentanil infusion followed by remifentanil maintenance during the recovery phase). Intraoperative remifentanil infusion (0.2 mug/kg/min) was discontinued upon surgery completion in the group C, and was maintained until the discharge criteria were met at a dose of 0.05 mug/kg/min in the group R. The incidence of emergence delirium was assessed using a five-point agitation scale and the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale after arrival in the postanesthesia care unit. Postoperative pain was assessed using the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale. RESULTS: The incidence of emergence delirium according to the five-point agitation scale (scores >= 4) was lower in the group R (33.3%) compared to the group C (68.3%) (odds ratio 0.206; 95% CI 0.080 to 0.531; P = 0.002). Similar results were obtained using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale (scores > 12), with an incidence of 5.1% in the group R and 34.0% in the control group (odds ratio 0.104; 95% CI 0.022 to 0.497; P = 0.001). The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale scores and occurrence of postoperative adverse events including laryngospasm, desaturation, nausea, and vomiting were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Maintaining a low dose of remifentanil (0.05 mug/kg/min) throughout the recovery phase attenuated the incidence of emergence delirium in children undergoing strabismus surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia.
