37283656|t|MicroRNA-19a-3p Decreases with Age in Mice and Humans and Inhibits Osteoblast Senescence.
37283656|a|Aging is a major risk factor for most chronic diseases, including osteoporosis, and is characterized by an accumulation of senescent cells in various tissues. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical regulators of bone aging and cellular senescence. Here, we report that miR-19a-3p decreases with age in bone samples from mice as well as in posterior iliac crest bone biopsies of younger versus older healthy women. miR-19a-3p also decreased in mouse bone marrow stromal cells following induction of senescence using etoposide, H2O2, or serial passaging. To explore the transcriptomic effects of miR-19a-3p, we performed RNA sequencing of mouse calvarial osteoblasts transfected with control or miR-19a-3p mimics and found that miR-19a-3p overexpression significantly altered the expression of various senescence, senescence-associated secretory phenotype-related, and proliferation genes. Specifically, miR-19a-3p overexpression in nonsenescent osteoblasts significantly suppressed p16 Ink4a and p21 Cip1 gene expression and increased their proliferative capacity. Finally, we established a novel senotherapeutic role for this miRNA by treating miR-19a-3p expressing cells with H2O2 to induce senescence. Interestingly, these cells exhibited lower p16 Ink4a and p21 Cip1 expression, increased proliferation-related gene expression, and reduced SA-beta-Gal+ cells. Our results thus establish that miR-19a-3p is a senescence-associated miRNA that decreases with age in mouse and human bones and is a potential senotherapeutic target for age-related bone loss.   2023 The Authors.
