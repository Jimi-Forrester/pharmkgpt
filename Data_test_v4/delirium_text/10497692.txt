10497692|a|Memory measures that permit pattern and error analysis are useful in the differential diagnosis of dementia. However, little is known about the relative utility or relations among verbal memory tests of different lengths. A 6-item verbal learning test (6-VLT) that assesses qualitative performance features was developed and compared to 3-word recall and the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Stronger correlations were observed between the 6-VLT and the CVLT. Significant relations were found between 6-VLT and CVLT indexes of learning, recall, and recognition (hits and false positive errors), although free recall errors were unrelated. Brief tasks such as the 6-VLT may provide more useful information regarding gross memory capacity than 3-word recall, although more challenging tasks may be required to elicit characteristic error patterns in Alzheimer's disease.
