37590829|t|Sleep Disorders in Patients with Neurologic Disease.
37590829|a|OBJECTIVE: This article provides an overview of the growing body of evidence showing bidirectional relationships between sleep and various neurologic disorders. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: Mounting evidence demonstrates that disrupted sleep can negatively impact various neurologic disease processes, including stroke, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, neuromuscular disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and headache syndromes. Abnormal sleep can also be a precursor to Alzheimer disease and neurodegenerative disease states such as Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Interventions to improve sleep and treat obstructive sleep apnea may play a vital role in preventing neurologic disease development and progression. ESSENTIAL POINTS: Sleep disorders are common among patients with neurologic disorders. To provide comprehensive care to patients with neurologic conditions, neurologists must ask patients about sleep issues that may warrant further diagnostic testing, treatment, and sleep medicine referral when indicated.
