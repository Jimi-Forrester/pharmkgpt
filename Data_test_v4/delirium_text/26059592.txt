26059592|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are among the most debilitating neurological disorders, and as life expectancy rises quickly around the world, the scientific and clinical challenges of dealing with them will also increase dramatically, putting increased pressure on the biomedical community to come up with innovative solutions for the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of these conditions. Despite several decades of intensive research, there is still little that can be done to prevent, cure, or even slow down the progression of NDs in most patients. There is an urgent need to develop new lines of basic and applied research that can be quickly translated into clinical application. One way to do this is to apply the tools of proteomics to well-characterized samples of human brain tissue, but a closer partnership must still be forged between proteomic scientists, brain banks, and clinicians to explore the maximum potential of this approach. Here, we analyze the challenges and potential benefits of using human brain tissue for proteomics research toward NDs.
