32963242|a|Preventing aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides is a promising strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and gold nanoparticles have previously been explored as a potential anti-Abeta therapeutics. Here we design and prepare 3.3 nm L- and D-glutathione stabilized gold nanoparticles (denoted as L3.3 and D3.3, respectively). Both chiral nanoparticles are able to inhibit aggregation of Abeta42 and cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) following intravenous administration without noticeable toxicity. D3.3 possesses a larger binding affinity to Abeta42 and higher brain biodistribution compared with its enantiomer L3.3, giving rise to stronger inhibition of Abeta42 fibrillation and better rescue of behavioral impairments in AD model mice. This conjugation of a small nanoparticle with chiral recognition moiety provides a potential therapeutic approach for AD.
