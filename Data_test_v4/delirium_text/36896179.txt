36896179|a|Introduction: Sleep deprivation (SD) and obesity are common in modern societies. SD and obesity frequently coexist, but research on the combined consequences of SD and obesity has been limited. In this study, we investigated the gut microbiota and host responses to SD and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. In addition, we attempted to identify key mediators of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups based on whether they were sleep deprived and whether they were fed a standard chow diet (SCD) or HFD. We then performed fecal microbiome shotgun sequencing, gut transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing, and brain mRNA expression analysis using the nanoString nCounter Mouse Neuroinflammation Panel. Results: The gut microbiota was significantly altered by the HFD, whereas the gut transcriptome was primarily influenced by SD. Sleep and diet are both important in the inflammatory system of the brain. When SD and the HFD were combined, the inflammatory system of the brain was severely disrupted. In addition, inosine-5' phosphate may be the gut microbial metabolite that mediates microbiota-gut-brain interactions. To identify the major drivers of this interaction, we analyzed the multi-omics data. Integrative analysis revealed two driver factors that were mostly composed of the gut microbiota. We discovered that the gut microbiota may be the primary driver of microbiota-gut-brain interactions. Discussion: These findings imply that healing gut dysbiosis may be a viable therapeutic target for enhancing sleep quality and curing obesity-related dysfunction.
