38003362|t|Searching for Metabolic Markers of Stroke in Human Plasma via NMR Analysis.
38003362|a|More than 12 million people around the world suffer a stroke every year, one every 3 s. Stroke has a variety of causes and is often the result of a complex interaction of risk factors related to age, genetics, gender, lifestyle, and some cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Despite this evidence, it is not possible to prevent the onset of stroke. The use of innovative methods for metabolite analysis has been explored in the last years to detect new stroke biomarkers. We use NMR spectroscopy to identify small molecule variations between different stages of stroke risk. The Framingham Stroke Risk Score was used in people over 63 years of age living in long-term care facilities (LTCF) to calculate the probability of suffering a stroke. Using this parameter, three study groups were formed: low stroke risk (LSR, control), moderate stroke risk (MSR) and high stroke risk (HSR). Univariate statistical analysis showed seven metabolites with increasing plasma levels across different stroke risk groups, from LSR to HSR: isoleucine, asparagine, formate, creatinine, dimethylsulfone and two unidentified molecules, which we termed "unknown-1" and "unknown-3". These metabolic markers can be used for early detection and to detect increasing stages of stroke risk more efficiently.
