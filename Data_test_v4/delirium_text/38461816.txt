38461816|t|Motoric cognitive risk syndrome and the risk of incident dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies.
38461816|a|Background Epidemiologic studies have indicated an association of Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome (MCR), a pre-dementia stage characterized by the presence of cognitive complaints and a slow gait, with increased risk of incident dementia. Objectives We aimed to clarify this association using meta-analysis. Methods We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to December 2022 for relevant studies that investigated the association between MCR and incident all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The random effects model was used to determine a pooled-effect estimate of the association. Results We identified seven articles that corresponded with nine cohort studies investigating the association between MCR and the risk of dementia. Pooled analysis showed that MCR was associated with a significantly increased risk of incident all-cause dementia (HR=2.28; 95% CI: 1.90-2.73) and AD (HR=2.05; 95% CI: 1.61-2.61). Sensitivity analysis showed that there was no evidence that individual studies influenced the pooled-effect estimate, verifying the robustness of the results. Conclusions Our results confirm that MCR is an independent risk factor of incident all-cause dementia and AD. Future studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying this association.
