39121126|t|Serial Cerebrospinal Fluid Sampling Reveals Trajectories of Potential Synaptic Biomarkers in Early Stages of Alzheimer's Disease.
39121126|a|Background: Synaptic dysfunction is closely associated with cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and is present already in an early stage of the disease. Objective: Using serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling, we aimed to investigate slopes of CSF synaptic proteins, and their relation with cognition along the AD continuum. Methods: We included subjects with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 50 amyloid-beta+ [A +], n = 50 A-) and 50 patients with AD dementia from the Amsterdam dementia cohort, with CSF at two time points (median[IQR] 2.1[1.4-2.7] years). We analyzed 17 synaptic proteins and neurofilament light (NfL). Using linear mixed models we assessed trajectories of protein levels, and associations with cognitive decline (repeated Mini-Mental State Examination). We used Cox regression models to assess predictive value of protein levels for progression to AD dementia. Results: At baseline most proteins showed increased levels in AD dementia compared to the other groups. In contrast NPTX2 levels were lower in AD dementia. Higher baseline levels of SNAP25, beta-syn, and 14-3-3 proteins were associated with faster cognitive decline (St.B[SE] -0.27[0.12] to -0.61[0.12]). Longitudinal analyses showed that SYT1 and NPTX levels decreased over time in AD dementia (st.B[SE] -0.10[0.04] to -0.15[0.05]) and SCD/MCI-A+ (St.B[SE] -0.07[0.03] to -0.12[0.03]), but not in SCD/MCI-A- (pinteraction < 0.05). Increase over time in NfL levels was associated with faster cognitive decline in AD dementia (St.B[SE] -1.75[0.58]), but not in the other groups (pinteraction < 0.05). Conclusions: CSF synaptic proteins showed different slopes over time, suggesting complex synaptic dynamics. High levels of especially SNAP-25 may have value for prediction of cognitive decline in early AD stages, while increase in NfL over time correlates better with cognitive decline in later stages.
