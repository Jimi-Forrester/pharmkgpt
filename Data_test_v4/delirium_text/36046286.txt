36046286|t|Ketamine and Its Emergence in the Field of Neurology.
36046286|a|The quest for a safe and effective anesthetic medication in the mid-20th century led to the discovery of CI-581, which was later named ketamine. Ketamine was labeled a "dissociative anesthetic" due to the state of sensory deprivation that it induces in the subjects receiving it. Although it enjoyed widespread use at the beginning of the Vietnam war, its use rapidly waned due to its psychedelic effect and it became more popular as a recreational drug, and in the field of veterinary medicine. However, as we gained more knowledge about its multiple sites of action, it has reemerged as a useful anesthetic/analgesic agent. In the last decade, the field of neurology has witnessed the growing use of ketamine for the treatment of several neurological conditions including migraine, status epilepticus, stroke, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Ketamine acts primarily as a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. The binding of ketamine to NMDA receptors leads to decreased frequency and duration of Ca+2 channel opening and thus inhibits glutaminergic transmission. This mechanism has proven to be neuroprotective in several neurological conditions. Ketamine does not increase intracranial pressure (ICP), and it maintains cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) by increasing cerebral blood flow. Ketamine has also been shown to inhibit massive slow waves of neurological depolarizations called cortical spreading depolarizations (CSD), usually seen during acute neurological injury and are responsible for further neurological deterioration. Unlike other anesthetic agents, ketamine does not cause cardiac or respiratory suppression. All these favorable mechanisms and cerebral/hemodynamic actions have led to increased interest among clinicians and researchers regarding the novel uses of ketamine. This review will focus on the use of ketamine for various neurological indications.
