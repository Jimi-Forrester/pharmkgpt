25253997|a|BACKGROUND: Sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) is the most commonly occurring acquired inflammatory myopathy in elderly people (>45 years); however, pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood and diagnostic tools are limited. In view of this, new therapeutic and diagnostic molecular markers for s-IBM need to be identified. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, the proteomes from three s-IBM cases were compared with those from three cases of neurogenic muscular atrophy (control). Proteins were separated by 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and profiled by mass spectrometric sequencing and subsequently validated by western blot. RESULTS: Differential expression was noted in 29 proteins (16 upregulated and 13 downregulated) in s-IBM compared with the control group. Functions of these proteins include oxidative stress response, regulation of apoptosis, signal transduction, and cytoskeleton. Expression of both amyloid precursor protein (APP) and alphaB-crystallin was increased in s-IBM cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a unique pattern of protein expression in s-IBM, which should be further investigated in a wider cohort of IBM patients to fully realize the potential diagnostic or therapeutic benefits.
