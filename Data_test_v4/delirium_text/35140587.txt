35140587|a|BACKGROUND: Constipation and dementia have similar epidemiological characteristics. Changes in intestinal flora and characteristics of the brain-gut axis play roles in the pathogeneses of the two diseases, suggesting that there may be a close connection between the two. Most of the studies on constipation in dementia patients have focused on the population with alpha-synucleinopathies [Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)]. Few studies have reported the prevalence of constipation in all-cause dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) populations. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of constipation in patients with all-cause dementia and MCI subtypes and to explore the association between constipation with dementia and MCI subtypes. METHODS: From May 2019 to December 2019, we conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey. A total of 11,743 participants aged 65 or older from nine cities in China were surveyed. Participants underwent a series of clinical examinations and neuropsychological measurements. Constipation, dementia, MCI and MCI subtype were diagnosed according to established criteria through standard diagnostic procedures. RESULTS: The overall age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of constipation in individuals aged 65 years and older was 14.8% (95% CI, 14.6-15.0). The prevalence rates of constipation were19.2% (95% CI, 17.3-21.0), 19.1% (95% CI, 16.8-21.5), 14.4% (95% CI, 12.8-15.9), and 13.8% (95% CI, 13.0-14.6) in the dementia, non-amnestic (na)-MCI, amnestic (a)-MCI and normal cognition populations, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher prevalence of constipation was associated with dementia (p = 0.0.032, OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.02-1.38) and na-MCI (p = 0.003, OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.09-1.54). CONCLUSION: The present study found a high prevalence of constipation in elderly individuals in China, and higher in patients with dementia and na-MCI.
