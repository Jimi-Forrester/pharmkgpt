31766897|a|Objective. We investigated the influence of functional impairment assessed by the Barthel index (BI) on the three-month outcomes after transfemoral-transcatheter aortic valve intervention (TF-TAVI) under general anesthesia. Design. We included retrospectively analyzed 336 patients undergoing TAVI between January 2017 and January 2018 in central hospital, Bad Berka, Germany. All patients were followed up at three-month in our center's outpatient clinic. We stratified the patients according to the BI. Results. At baseline, 76 patients had a BI <80. Patients with a BI <80 were characterized by advanced age (80.6 +- 5.6 vs. 83 +- 4.1 years. p = .027), diabetes mellitus on insulin and higher surgical risk scores. A prior cerebral ischemic event was recorded more in patients with a BI >=80. Regarding intermediate outcomes, three-month mortality was significantly higher in patients with a BI <80. Patients with a BI <80 developed significantly more postoperative cardiac decompensation, delirium and strokes. Patients with BI <80 had lower hemoglobin level preoperative and needed more blood transfusion postoperative. Other valve academic research consortiums (VARCs) complications were equally distributed in both groups. A BI <80 was associated with prolonged postoperative hospital stay and was an independent predictor of FT protocol failure (OR 4; CI 95% 1.3-11. p .02). Conclusions. A BI <80 is associated with increased mortality and risk of neurological events and cardiac decompensations after TF TAVI. A BI <80 is an independent predictor of failure in fast track TAVI.
