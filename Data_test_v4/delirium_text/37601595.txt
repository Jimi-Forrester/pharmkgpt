37601595|t|Construction of an optical sensor for copper determination in environmental, food, and biological samples based on the covalently immobilized 2-(2-benzothiazolylazo)-3-hydroxyphenol in agarose.
37601595|a|An optical chemical sensor has been developed for the quantitative spectrophotometric analysis of copper. The optode is dependent on covalent immobilization of 2-(2-benzothiazolylazo)-3-hydroxyphenol (BTAHP) in a transparent agarose membrane. The absorbance variation of immobilized BTAHP on agarose as a film upon the addition of 5 x 10-3 M aqueous solutions of Mn2+, Zn2+, Hg2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, La3+, Fe3+, Cr3+, Zr4+, Se4+, Th4+, and UO22+ revealed substantially higher changes in the Cu2+ ion content compared to other ions investigated here. The effects of various experimental parameters, such as the solution pH, the reaction time, and the concentration of reagents, on the quality of Cu2+ sensing were examined. Under ideal experimental circumstances, a linear response was achieved for Cu2+ concentrations ranging from 1.0 x 10-9 to 7.5 x 10-6 M with an R2 value of 0.9988. The detection (3sigma) and quantification (10sigma) limits of the procedure for Cu2+ analyses were 3.0 x 10-10 and 9.8 x 10-10 M, respectively. No observable interference was recorded in the detection of Cu2+ due to other inorganic cations. With no indication of BTAHP leaching, the membrane demonstrated good durability and quick response times. The optode was effectively used to determine the presence of Cu2+ in environmental water, food, and biological samples.
