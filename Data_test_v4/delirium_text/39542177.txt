39542177|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among elderly people. This disease imposes a significant burden on the healthcare system, society, and economy due to the increasing global aging population. Current trials with drugs or bioactive compounds aimed at reducing cerebral Amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and tau protein neurofibrillary tangles, which are the two main hallmarks of this devastating neurodegenerative disease, have not provided significant results in terms of their neuropathological outcomes nor met the expected clinical end-points. Ageing, genetic and environmental risk factors, along with different clinical symptoms suggest that AD is a complex and heterogeneous disorder with multiple interconnected pathological pathways rather than a single disease entity. In the present review, we highlight and discuss various non-canonical, Abeta-independent mechanisms, like gliosis, unhealthy dietary intake, lipid and sugar signaling, and cerebrovascular damage that contribute to the onset and development of AD. We emphasize that challenging the traditional "amyloid cascade hypothesis" may improve our understanding of this age-related complex syndrome and help fight the progressive cognitive decline in AD.
