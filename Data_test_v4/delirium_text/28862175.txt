28862175|t|Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase A1298C genetic variant& risk of schizophrenia: A meta-analysis.
28862175|a|BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an important enzyme of folate metabolism, whose role in schizophrenia is debatable. Numerous case-control studies have investigated the association of MTHFR A1298C polymorphism with schizophrenia, but results are controversial. The aim of the present study was to find the association between MTHFR A1298C gene polymorphism and schizophrenia. METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Springer link databases were searched for case-control association studies in which MTHFR A1298C polymorphism was investigated as a risk factor for schizophrenia. In all, 19 studies with 4049 cases and 5488 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95 per cent confidence intervals (CIs) were used as an association measure. RESULTS: The results of meta-analysis reported a significant association between A1298C polymorphism and schizophrenia risk in overall comparisons in all genetic models (C vs. A: OR=1.13, 95% CI=1.01-1.27, P=0.02; CC vs. AA: OR=1.20, 95% CI=1.03-1.39, P=0.02; AC vs. AA: OR=1.13, 95% CI=1.03-1.23, P=0.009; AC+CC vs. AA: OR=1.14, 95% CI=1.02-1.24, P=0.002; CC vs. AA+AC: OR=1.17, 95% CI=1.01-1.35, P=0.04). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: MTHFR A1298C polymorphism was found to be a risk factor for schizophrenia and might have played a significant role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
