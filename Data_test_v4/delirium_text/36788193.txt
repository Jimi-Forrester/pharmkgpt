36788193|a|PURPOSE: After acute hospital admission, patients with a hip fracture are frequently discharged to skilled nursing homes providing geriatric rehabilitation (GR). There are few evidence-based studies regarding specific treatment times and assessments during GR. This study aims to provide a description of care for hip fracture patients during GR in the Netherlands. METHODS: Descriptive study analyzing the care pathways from GR facilities, regarding healthcare professionals involved, allocated treatment time per profession, total length of rehabilitation stay, and assessment instruments. Based on the reimbursement algorithm (diagnostic treatment combination = DBCs), of 25 patients, the registered actual treatment time per profession was calculated. RESULTS: The care pathways pivoted on three groups of health care professionals: medical team (MT), physiotherapy (PT), and occupational therapy (OT). There was some discrepancy between the allocated time in the care pathways and the calculated mean actual treatment time from the DBCs. First week: MT 120-180 min, DBC 120 (SD: 59) minutes; PT 120-230 min, DBC 129 (SD: 58) minutes; and OT 65-165 min, DBC 93 (SD: 61) minutes. From week two onwards, MT 15-36 min, DBC 49 (SD: 29) minutes; PT 74-179 min, DBC 125 (SD: 50) minutes; and OT 25-60 min, DBC 47 (SD: 44) minutes. Dieticians, psychologists, and social workers were sporadically mentioned. There was heterogeneity in the assessment and screening tools. CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to define current standard care in GR after hip fracture in the Netherlands due to the diversity in care pathways and large practice variation. This is a problem in conducting randomized effectiveness research with care provided as control. TRIAL REGISTER AND DATE OF REGISTRATION: NL7491 04-02-2019.
