30924099|a|BACKGROUND: Psychosis is common in Parkinson's disease-related disorders and is associated with significant morbidity. Pimavanserin is a newly approved treatment for Parkinson's disease psychosis, but real-world experience with pimavanserin has been limited by small sample sizes and limited assessment of longitudinal outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to summarize the clinical experience with pimavanserin in a large cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease-related psychosis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who were prescribed pimavanserin at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the southeast United States between May 2016 and July 2018. We used Chi-squared analyses to compare efficacy and tolerability of pimavanserin, considering patient diagnosis, presence of dementia or delusions, use of deep brain stimulation, and prior antipsychotic failure. Additionally, we compared the clinical characteristics of patients who started treatment and those who did not, to evaluate safety outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 107 patients prescribed pimavanserin, and 91 began treatment. Clinical improvement in psychosis was documented in 76% of patients (69/91) and did not differ based on diagnosis, presence of dementia, delusions, use of deep brain stimulation, or prior antipsychotic failure. Adverse effects were reported in 20 patients (22%), the most common of which was worsening gait instability (5/91, 5%). Side effects led to cessation of therapy in 11 of the 91 patients (12%). At current follow-up, 50 (65%) of 77 living patients remain on treatment, with a mean treatment duration of 14.6 months. Although most of these patients are on pimavanserin monotherapy (33/50, 66%), 17 patients (34%) are on a dual-antipsychotic regimen. The living patients no longer on treatment stopped pimavanserin primarily because of a lack of perceived benefit (11/77, 14%), side effects (9/77, 12%), or both (1/77, 1%), though six patients (8%) stopped for reasons unrelated to medication effects, including the desire to reduce overall medication burden and negative media reporting on pimavanserin. CONCLUSIONS: Study results emphasize long-term efficacy and tolerability of pimavanserin for psychosis in Parkinson's disease-related disorders, including patients with dementia, delusions, deep brain stimulation use, or prior antipsychotic failure.
