15960295|a|Plasma alpha beta levels have been examined in sporadic Alzheimer's disease yielding conflicting results; both no difference and an increase in plasma concentrations of alpha beta42 and alpha beta40 in sporadic cases of AD as compared to controls have been reported. Elevated plasma alpha beta42 levels may be detected several years before the onset of symptoms (in mild cognitive impairment stadium). Levels of alpha beta40 and alpha beta42 were measured in plasma from 54 patients with AD, 39 subjects with MCI and 35 controls using a commercially available ELISA. Mean plasma alpha beta42 levels were significantly higher in MCI as compared to both AD (P < 0.001) and control subjects (P < 0.001), while alpha beta40 did not differ between the groups. No correlations were observed between alpha beta levels and age, MMSE scores or gender. According to ROC curve analysis the maximum accuracy in discriminating MCI versus both controls and AD subjects has been achieved using a cut-off value of 3.8.
