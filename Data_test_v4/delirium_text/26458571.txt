26458571|a|In neurological disorder related amyloidosis, several therapies have been developed in the recent decade. In AL and AA amyloidosis, novel chemotherapy and IL6 receptor antibody have been found to be effective, respectively. In addition to these amyloidosis, in transthyretin (TTR) related familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP), liver transplantation, tertial structure stabilizing drugs, and gene silencing drugs have been developing now. As neurological disorder related amyloidosis, systemic amyloidosis, such as AL amyloidosis, AA amyloidosis, dialysis related amyloidosis, FAP, senile systemic amyloidosis, and brain localized amyloidosis, such as Alzheimer's disease, and prion disease are listed. In this review, we mentioned diagnosis, pathogenesis and therapies of systemic amyloidosis.
