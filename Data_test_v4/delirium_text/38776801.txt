38776801|t|Strategies for measuring concentrations and forms of amyloid-beta peptides.
38776801|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is affecting more and more people worldwide without the effective treatment, while the existed pathological mechanism has been confirmed barely useful in the treatment. Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), a main component of senile plaque, is regarded as the most promising target in AD treatment. Abeta clearance from AD brain seems to be a reliably therapeutic strategy, as the two exited drugs, GV-971 and aducanumab, are both developed based on it. However, doubt still exists. To exhaustive expound on the pathological mechanism of Abeta, rigorous analyses on the concentrations and aggregation forms are essential. Thus, it is attracting broad attention these years. However, most of the sensors have not been used in pathological studies, as the lack of the bridge between analytical chemist and pathologists. In this review, we made a brief introduce on Abeta-related pathological mechanism included in beta-amyloid hypothesis to elucidate the detection conditions of sensor methods. Furthermore, a summary of the sensor methods was made, which were based on Abeta concentrations and form detections that have been developed in the past 10 years. As the greatest number of the sensors were built on fluorescent spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and Roman spectroscopy, detailed elucidation on them was made. Notably, the aggregation process is another important factor in revealing the progress of AD and developing the treatment methods, so the sensors on monitoring Abeta aggregation processes were also summarized.
