38898327|a|Periodontal disease affects supporting dental structures and ranks among one of the top most expensive conditions to treat in the world. Moreover, in recent years, the disease has also been linked to cardiovascular and Alzheimer's diseases. At present, there is a serious lack of accurate diagnostic tools to identify people at severe risk of periodontal disease progression. Porphyromonas gingivalis is often considered one of the most contributing factors towards disease progression. It produces the Arg- and Lys-specific proteases Rgp and Kgp, respectively. Within this work, a short epitope sequence of these proteases is immobilised onto a magnetic nanoparticle platform. These are then used as a template to produce high-affinity, selective molecularly imprinted nanogels, using the common monomers N-tert-butylacrylamide (TBAM), N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM), and N-(3-aminopropyl) methacrylamide hydrochloride (APMA). N,N-Methylene bis(acrylamide) (BIS) was used as a crosslinking monomer to form the interconnected polymeric network. The produced nanogels were immobilised onto a planar gold surface and characterised using the optical technique of surface plasmon resonance. They showed high selectivity and affinity towards their template, with affinity constants of 79.4 and 89.7 nM for the Rgp and Kgp epitope nanogels, respectively. From their calibration curves, the theoretical limit of detection was determined to be 1.27 nM for the Rgp nanogels and 2.00 nM for the Kgp nanogels. Furthermore, they also showed excellent selectivity against bacterial culture supernatants E8 (Rgp knockout), K1A (Kgp knockout), and W50-d (wild-type) strains in complex medium of brain heart infusion (BHI).
