37539357|a|Adrenal insufficiency in systemic lupus erythematosus is rarely detected, especially in male patients. Nevertheless, such coexistence can occur, and screening for systemic lupus erythematosus should be considered in primary adrenal insufficiency with symptoms of systemic multiorgan involvement. We report a 22-year-old Asian man, initially diagnosed with bicytopenia, developed severe unintentional weight loss, skin and mucosal hyperpigmentation, along with persistent fatigue. Laboratory examination showed positive antinuclear antibody-indirect immunofluorescence, elevated anti-double-stranded DNA, extremely low morning serum cortisol, and mildly elevated thyroid stimulating hormone with normal free T4. He was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, manifesting as chronic primary adrenal insufficiency, subclinical hypothyroidism, and bicytopenia. He was treated with mycophenolic acid of 180 mg b.i.d, methylprednisolone of 4 mg q.d, and vitamin D3 1000 IU q.d. Methylprednisolone was given for its anti-inflammatory property and as a simple once-daily regimen to supplement glucocorticoid deficiency. Levothyroxine was not prescribed for our patient since his thyroid stimulating hormone was only mildly elevated, and supplementation of levothyroxine in the setting of adrenal insufficiency might precipitate an adrenal crisis. At the 6-month follow-up, he was no longer fatigued, he regained his body weight, his skin and mucosal hyperpigmentation improved significantly, his thyroid stimulating hormone level normalized (without levothyroxine supplementation), and his complete blood count stabilized, remitting him from the need for transfusion.
