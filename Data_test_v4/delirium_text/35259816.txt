35259816|a|The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is increasing due to changing age demographics and the incidence of sports-related traumatic brain injury is tending to increase over time. Currently approved medicines for neurodegenerative diseases only temporarily reduce the symptoms but cannot cure or delay disease progression. Cell transplantation strategies offer an alternative approach to facilitating central nervous system repair, but efficacy is limited by low in vivo survival rates of cells that are injected in suspension. Transplanting cells that are attached to or encapsulated within a suitable biomaterial construct has the advantage of enhancing cell survival in vivo. A variety of biomaterials have been used to make constructs in different types that included nanoparticles, nanotubes, microspheres, microscale fibrous scaffolds, as well as scaffolds made of gels and in the form of micro-columns. Among these, Tween 80-methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles loaded with rhynchophylline had higher transport across a blood-brain barrier model and decreased cell death in an in vitro model of Alzheimer's disease than rhynchophylline or untreated nanoparticles with rhynchophylline. In an in vitro model of Parkinson's disease, trans-activating transcriptor bioconjugated with zwitterionic polymer poly(2-methacryoyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) and protein-based nanoparticles loaded with non-Fe hemin had a similar protective ability as free non-Fe hemin. A positive effect on neuron survival in several in vivo models of Parkinson's disease was associated with the use of biomaterial constructs such as trans-activating transcriptor bioconjugated with zwitterionic polymer poly(2-methacryoyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) and protein-based nanoparticles loaded with non-Fe hemin, carbon nanotubes with olfactory bulb stem cells, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres with attached DI-MIAMI cells, ventral midbrain neurons mixed with short fibers of poly-(L-lactic acid) scaffolds and reacted with xyloglucan with/without glial-derived neurotrophic factor, ventral midbrain neurons mixed with Fmoc-DIKVAV hydrogel with/without glial-derived neurotrophic factor. Further studies with in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are warranted especially using transplantation of cells in agarose micro-columns with an inner lumen filled with an appropriate extracellular matrix material.
