7986890|t|A review of GHRH stimulation test in psychiatry.
7986890|a|We critically reviewed controlled investigations of the growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) stimulation test in depression, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, panic disorder, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. Comparisons of GH responsiveness between patients and controls within each diagnostic category were equivocal and in some cases contradictory. Factors that may contribute substantially to the inconsistent findings within diagnostic categories include (1) the variability of GHRH-simulated GH among control groups; (2) the lack of uniformity in test procedures and outcome measures; and (3) the age and gender of subjects. In addition, the individual reproducibility of the GHRH stimulation test has not been adequately investigated and until the test's stability within subjects can be determined, the validity of interpretations resulting from the GHRH simulation test are in question.
