37241710|a|Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that play an important role in the nervous system's control of the body's physiological state and behaviour. Abnormal levels of neurotransmitters are closely associated with some mental disorders. Therefore, accurate analysis of neurotransmitters is of great clinical importance. Electrochemical sensors have shown bright application prospects in the detection of neurotransmitters. In recent years, MXene has been increasingly used to prepare electrode materials for fabricating electrochemical neurotransmitter sensors due to its excellent physicochemical properties. This paper systematically introduces the advances in MXene-based electrochemical (bio)sensors for the detection of neurotransmitters (including dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, tyrosine, NO, and H2S), with a focus on their strategies for improving the electrochemical properties of MXene-based electrode materials, and provides the current challenges and future prospects for MXene-based electrochemical neurotransmitter sensors.
