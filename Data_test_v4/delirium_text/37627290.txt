37627290|t|Mechanisms of Modulation of Mitochondrial Architecture.
37627290|a|Mitochondrial network architecture plays a critical role in cellular physiology. Indeed, alterations in the shape of mitochondria upon exposure to cellular stress can cause the dysfunction of these organelles. In this scenario, mitochondrial dynamics proteins and the phospholipid composition of the mitochondrial membrane are key for fine-tuning the modulation of mitochondrial architecture. In addition, several factors including post-translational modifications such as the phosphorylation, acetylation, SUMOylation, and o-GlcNAcylation of mitochondrial dynamics proteins contribute to shaping the plasticity of this architecture. In this regard, several studies have evidenced that, upon metabolic stress, mitochondrial dynamics proteins are post-translationally modified, leading to the alteration of mitochondrial architecture. Interestingly, several proteins that sustain the mitochondrial lipid composition also modulate mitochondrial morphology and organelle communication. In this context, pharmacological studies have revealed that the modulation of mitochondrial shape and function emerges as a potential therapeutic strategy for metabolic diseases. Here, we review the factors that modulate mitochondrial architecture.
