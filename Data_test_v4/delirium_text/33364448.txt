33364448|t|Acetoacetate enhancement of glucose mediated DNA glycation.
33364448|a|Acetoacetate (AA) is a ketone body, which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS production is impacted by the formation of covalent bonds between amino groups of biomacromolecules and reducing sugars (glycation). Glycation can damage DNA by causing strand breaks, mutations, and changes in gene expression. DNA damage could contribute to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including neurological disorders, complications of diabetes, and aging. Here we studied the enhancement of glucose-mediated DNA glycation by AA for the first time. The effect of AA on the structural changes, Amadori and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) formation of DNA incubated with glucose for 4 weeks were investigated using various techniques. These included UV-Vis, circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy, and agarose gel electrophoresis. The results of UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed that AA increased the DNA-AGE formation. The NBT test showed that AA also increased Amadori product formation of glycated DNA. Based on the CD and agarose gel electrophoresis results, the structural changes of glycated DNA was increased in the presence of AA. The chemiluminescence results indicated that AA increased ROS formation. Thus AA has an activator role in DNA glycation, which could enhance the adverse effects of glycation under high glucose conditions.
