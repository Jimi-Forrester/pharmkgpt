15977708|a|Alzheimer's disease is a frequent neurodegenerative disease, which affects more than one third of elderly persons over 80 years. No curative treatment is currently available for this disease, but symptomatic treatments have produced significant improvements in patients' condition. Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed for early and moderate stages and memantine for more severe stages of the disease. These drugs have an impact on cognitive performances, may delay functional decline and improve behaviour disturbances. From a preventive perspective, evidence of benefit from early management of vascular risk factors is accumulating. In the near future, the improved comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease will hopefully bring new treatments, thats will delay or modify its course.
