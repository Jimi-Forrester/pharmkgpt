33290061|t|Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of a Series of Oxazolone Carboxamides as a Novel Class of Acid Ceramidase Inhibitors.
33290061|a|Acid ceramidase (AC) is a cysteine hydrolase that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of lysosomal ceramides, important members of the sphingolipid family, a diversified class of bioactive molecules that mediate many biological processes ranging from cell structural integrity, signaling, and cell proliferation to cell death. In the effort to expand the structural diversity of the existing collection of AC inhibitors, a novel class of substituted oxazol-2-one-3-carboxamides were designed and synthesized. Herein, we present the chemical optimization of our initial hits, 2-oxo-4-phenyl-N-(4-phenylbutyl)oxazole-3-carboxamide 8a and 2-oxo-5-phenyl-N-(4-phenylbutyl)oxazole-3-carboxamide 12a, which resulted in the identification of 5-[4-fluoro-2-(1-methyl-4-piperidyl)phenyl]-2-oxo-N-pentyl-oxazole-3-carboxamide 32b as a potent AC inhibitor with optimal physicochemical and metabolic properties, showing target engagement in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and a desirable pharmacokinetic profile in mice, following intravenous and oral administration. 32b enriches the arsenal of promising lead compounds that may therefore act as useful pharmacological tools for investigating the potential therapeutic effects of AC inhibition in relevant sphingolipid-mediated disorders.
