28133043|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of pancreatic surgery for pancreatic cancer in elderly patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 9 patients underwent pancreatic surgery for pancreatic cancer between April 2005 and March 2014. The surgical complications were evaluated by Clavien-Dindo classification. RESULTS: The median operating time was 420(range: 354-503)min and the median blood loss was 640(range: 350-1,170)mL. Grade 2 or higher complications were observed in 3 patients. Pancreatic fistula(Grade 3b)was observed in 1 patient, delirium was observed(Grade 2)in 1 patient, and portal vein thrombosis(Grade 2)was observed in 1 patient. No surgical mortality was observed. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that pancreatic surgery is a safe and feasible treatment for pancreatic cancer in elderly patients.
