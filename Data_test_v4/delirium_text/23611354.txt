23611354|a|The effect of early onset frontotemporal dementias (FTD) on spouses and children is profound, requiring different types of support services from pre-existing Alzheimer's disease interventions already in place. This article explores how the needs of families living with FTD resulted in three programme initiatives developed at Baycrest (an academic health sciences centre focused on ageing, in Toronto, Canada) to meet the needs of this population. These included an Internet-based videoconferencing support group for spouses, a website that provides support and counsel for children and their parents, and an adult day programme designed for FTD patients. The strength of these interventions is that services were developed with involvement of stakeholders in FTD care from the start, to deal with gaps in services in a sustainable way.
