34924378|a|BACKGROUND: High day-to-day blood pressure variability (BPV) has been associated with an increased risk for cognitive decline and mortality in the general population. Whether BPV is associated with increased all-cause mortality in older people with cognitive impairment is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between day-to-day home BPV and all-cause mortality in older patients attending a memory clinic. METHODS: We included 279 patients attending a memory clinic, who measured home blood pressure (BP) for 7 consecutive days in the morning and evening. Within-subject BPV was defined as the variation independent of the mean (VIM). Time-to-death was verified through the Dutch population registry. Cox proportional hazard regression was used. Separate analyses were performed for morning-to-morning and evening-to-evening BPV. RESULTS: Mean age was 73+-9 years, dementia and mild cognitive impairment were diagnosed in 35% and 34% respectively, and mean home BP was 139/79 mmHg. After a mean follow-up of 3.2 years, 52 patients had died. Neither day-to-day systolic nor diastolic VIM were associated with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] systolic VIM: 0.99, 95% -CI 0.92-1.06, p = 0.770, HR diastolic VIM: 1.04, 95% -CI 0.93-1.17, p = 0.517). When morning and evening measurements were analyzed separately, systolic morning-to-morning VIM was associated with mortality (adjusted HR: 1.09, 95% -CI 1.01-1.18, p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: In this study, day-to-day BPV was not associated with all-cause mortality in patients attending a memory clinic. However, morning-to-morning BPV was. Due to the short assessment window, there is still a lack of clarity; hence future research is warranted to clarify the role of all BPV components in aging.
