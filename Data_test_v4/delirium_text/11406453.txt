11406453|t|Pharmacologic management of nonpain symptoms in surgical patients.
11406453|a|Palliative care patients present with multiple symptoms other than pain and cachexia. Asthenia, delirium, dyspnea, and chronic nausea and constipation cause significant distress to patients and families and frequently coexist in the same patient. A careful assessment frequently identifies reversible causes. When none are identified or there is no improvement, symptomatic pharmacologic interventions are available. The success rate is variable, and it is very high for symptoms such as chronic nausea or constipation and less effective for symptoms such as asthenia and delirium. More research on the mechanism and treatment of these symptoms is needed.
