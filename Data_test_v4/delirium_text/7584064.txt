7584064|a|The genetic modelling of human disease would be considerably facilitated if pathogenic mutations could be inserted into transgenes which were then expressed in an appropriate manner. Yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs), when used as transgenes appear to direct expression with the correct temporal and spatial distribution. Here we demonstrate that it is comparatively straightforward to introduce pathogenic mutations into such YACs by the use of the 'pop-in, pop-out' procedure, by inserting an Alzheimer-causing mutation (APP717Val-->lle) into an APP-containing YAC which has previously been used as a transgene. The significance of these procedures for the modelling of human disease is discussed.
