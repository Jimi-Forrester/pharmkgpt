32257920|t|Decrease of 14-3-3 proteins by glutamate exposure in the cerebral cortex of newborn rats.
32257920|a|Glutamate is a representative excitatory neurotransmitter. However, excessive glutamate exposure causes neuronal cell damage by generating neuronal excitotoxicity. Excitotoxicity in neonates caused by glutamate treatment induces neurological deficits in adults. The 14-3-3 family proteins are conserved proteins that are expressed ubiquitously in a variety of tissues. These proteins contribute to cellular processes, including signal transduction, protein synthesis, and cell cycle control. We proposed that glutamate induces neuronal cell damage by regulating 14-3-3 protein expression in newborn animals. In this study, we investigated the histopathological changes and 14-3-3 proteins expressions as a result of glutamate exposure in the neonatal cerebral cortex. Rat pups at post-natal day 7 were intraperitoneally administrated with vehicle or glutamate (10 mg/kg). Animals were sacrificed 4 h after treatment, and brain tissues were fixed for histological study. Cerebral cortices were isolated and frozen for proteomic study. We observed serious histopathological damages including shrunken dendrites and atypical neurons in glutamate-treated cerebral cortices. In addition, we identified that 14-3-3 family proteins decreased in glutamate-exposed cerebral cortices using a proteomic approach. Moreover, Western blot analysis provided results that glutamate treatment in neonates decreased 14-3-3 family proteins expressions, including the beta/alpha, zeta/delta, gamma, epsilon, tau, and eta isoforms. 14-3-3 proteins are involved in signal transduction, metabolism, and anti-apoptotic functions. Thus, our findings suggest that glutamate induces neonatal neuronal cell damage by modulating 14-3-3 protein expression.
