37609229|t|Spatiotemporal optical control of Galphaq-PLCbeta interactions.
37609229|a|Cells experience time-varying and spatially heterogeneous chemokine signals in vivo, activating cell surface proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The Galphaq pathway activation by GPCRs is a major signaling axis with a broad physiological and pathological significance. Compared to other Galpha members, GalphaqGTP activates many crucial effectors, including PLCbeta (Phospholipase Cbeta) and Rho GEFs (Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors). PLCbeta regulates many key processes, such as hematopoiesis, synaptogenesis, and cell cycle, and is therefore implicated in terminal - debilitating diseases, including cancer, epilepsy, Huntington's Disease, and Alzheimer's Disease. However, due to a lack of genetic and pharmacological tools, examining how the dynamic regulation of PLCbeta signaling controls cellular physiology has been difficult. Since activated PLCbeta induces several abrupt cellular changes, including cell morphology, examining how the other pathways downstream of Gq-GPCRs contribute to the overall signaling has also been difficult. Here we show the engineering, validation, and application of a highly selective and efficient optogenetic inhibitor (Opto-dHTH) to completely disrupt GalphaqGTP-PLCbeta interactions reversibly in user-defined cellular-subcellular regions on optical command. Using this newly gained PLCbeta signaling control, our data indicate that the molecular competition between RhoGEFs and PLCbeta for GalphaqGTP determines the potency of Gq-GPCR-governed directional cell migration.
