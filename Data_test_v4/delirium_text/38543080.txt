38543080|t|A Drug Safety Briefing (II) in Transplantation from Real-World Individual Pharmacotherapy Management to Prevent Patient and Graft from Polypharmacy Risks at the Very Earliest Stage.
38543080|a|For early and long-term patient and graft survival, drug therapy in solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation inevitably involves polypharmacy in patients with widely varying and even abruptly changing conditions. In this second part, relevant medication briefing is provided, in addition to the scores defined in the previously published first part on the design of the Individual Pharmacotherapy Management (IPM). The focus is on the growing spectrum of contemporary polypharmacy in transplant patients, including early and long-term follow-up medications. 1. Unlike the available drug-drug interaction (DDI) tables, for the first time, this methodological all-in-one device refers to the entire risks, including contraindications, special warnings, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and DDIs. The selection of 65 common critical drugs results from 10 years of daily IPM with real-world evidence from more than 60,800 IPM inpatient and outpatient medication analyses. It includes immunosuppressants and typical critical antimicrobials, analgesics, antihypertensives, oral anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics, antilipids, antidepressants, antipsychotics, antipropulsives, antiemetics, propulsives, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), sedatives, antineoplastics, and protein kinase inhibitors. As a guide for the attending physician, the drug-related risks are presented in an alphabetical overview based on the Summaries of Product Characteristics (SmPCs) and the literature. 2. Further briefing refers to own proven clinical measures to manage unavoidable drug-related high-risk situations. Drug-induced injuries to the vulnerable graft and the immunosuppressed comorbid patient require such standardized, intensive IPM and the comprehensive preventive briefing toolset to optimize the outcomes in the polypharmacy setting.
