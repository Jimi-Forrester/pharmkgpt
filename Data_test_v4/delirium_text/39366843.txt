39366843|a|Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) and Down syndrome (DS) constitute genetic forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study of these forms has been crucial in understanding the biomarker changes and disease progression, notably in advancing our knowledge of the natural history of AD. However, some specific characteristics of biomarkers in genetically determined forms and, most importantly, the near full penetrance and predictability of disease onset lead to a very different context of use for biomarkers in these populations. This article delves into the similarities and differences in biomarker profiles between genetically determined AD and sporadic cases, discussing the implications for research and clinical practice. It also emphasizes the need to account for factors that may affect biomarker reliability differently in genetically determined AD. Enhancing our understanding of the disease will pave the way for more personalized therapeutic approaches for affected individuals.
