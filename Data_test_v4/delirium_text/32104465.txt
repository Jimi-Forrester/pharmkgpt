32104465|t|The appliances and prospects of aurum nanomaterials in biodiagnostics, imaging, drug delivery and combination therapy.
32104465|a|Aurum nanomaterials (ANM), combining the features of nanotechnology and metal elements, have demonstrated enormous potential and aroused great attention on biomedical applications over the past few decades. Particularly, their advantages, such as controllable particle size, flexible surface modification, higher drug loading, good stability and biocompatibility, especially unique optical properties, promote the development of ANM in biomedical field. In this review, we will discuss the advanced preparation process of ANM and summarize their recent applications as well as their prospects in diagnosis and therapy. Besides, multi-functional ANM-based theranostic nanosystems will be introduced in details, including radiotherapy (RT), photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), immunotherapy (IT), and so on.
