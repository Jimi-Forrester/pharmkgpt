33121486|a|BACKGROUND: CREB-dependent transcription necessary for long-term memory is driven by interactions with CREB-binding protein (CBP), a multi-domain protein that binds numerous transcription factors potentially affecting expression of thousands of genes. Identifying specific domain functions for multi-domain proteins is essential to understand processes such as cognitive function and circadian clocks. We investigated the function of the CBP KIX domain in hippocampal memory and gene expression using CBPKIX/KIX mice with mutations that prevent phospho-CREB (Ser133) binding. RESULTS: We found that CBPKIX/KIX mice were impaired in long-term memory, but not learning acquisition or short-term memory for the Morris water maze. Using an unbiased analysis of gene expression in the dorsal hippocampus after training in the Morris water maze or contextual fear conditioning, we discovered dysregulation of CREB, CLOCK, and BMAL1 target genes and downregulation of circadian genes in CBPKIX/KIX mice. Given our finding that the CBP KIX domain was important for transcription of circadian genes, we profiled circadian activity and phase resetting in CBPKIX/KIX mice. CBPKIX/KIX mice exhibited delayed activity peaks after light offset and longer free-running periods in constant dark. Interestingly, CBPKIX/KIX mice displayed phase delays and advances in response to photic stimulation comparable to wildtype littermates. Thus, this work delineates site-specific regulation of the circadian clock by a multi-domain protein. CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide insight into the significance of the CBP KIX domain by defining targets of CBP transcriptional co-activation in memory and the role of the CBP KIX domain in vivo on circadian rhythms.
