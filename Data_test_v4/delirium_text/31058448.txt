31058448|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of zoledronic acid on the reduction of acute bone loss and fracture rate in elderly postoperative patients with intertrochanteric fracture. METHODS: From August 2012 to January 2015, a total of 482 patients with senile osteoporotic femoral intertrochanteric fracture, who accepted proximal femoral intramedullary fixation under anesthesia were analysed. The patients were divided into two groups. Treatment group (353 cases) were treated with 100 mL/5 mg of zoledronic acid injection in 1 week after operation, as well as orally taken 600 mg/d of calcium carbonate and active vitamin D3 400 IU/d. Control group (129 cases) were given the same dose of calcium carbonate and active vitamin D3 orally. Efficacy evaluation were conducted during different periods of medication RESULTS: Compared with pre-medication, indexes of bone metabolism (TARP-5b, CTX) in the treatment group were brought down, especially significantly statistically different after 12 months of medication. The treatment group performed superior to control group in alleviating the pain of back and posture changing (P < 0.05), improving bone density (P < 0.05), depressing re-fracture rate (P < 0.01) after 24 months of medication. In addition, BP, PF and MH dimension scores were demonstrated with statistical significance (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The application of zoledronic acidin elderly postoperative patients with intertrochanteric fracture can not only relieve acute bone loss, reduce the incidence rate of re-fracture, alleviate osteoporosis pain and the pain from osteoporotic fracture, but also improve bone metabolism and quality of life, which may offer an acceptable clinical opinion.
