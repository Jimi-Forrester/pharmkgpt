32238719|t|An Autopsy Case of Varicella Zoster Virus Encephalitis with Multiple Brain Lesions.
32238719|a|Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) encephalitis in the absence of vasculopathy may rarely occur in association with herpes zoster. We herein report the case of a 67-year-old woman with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma undergoing chemotherapy who presented with an acute alteration in consciousness. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed multiple and nonspecific lesions of hyperintensity with mild edema in the cortex and subcortex. She was treated with intravenous acyclovir. However, two days after admission, the patient died and was diagnosed with VZV encephalitis. This case highlights the risk of VZV reactivation with severe neurological complications in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.
