27924198|a|BACKGROUND: Shivering during spinal anesthesia is a frequent complication and is induced by the core-to-peripheral redistribution of heat. Nefopam has minimal side effects and prevents shivering by reducing the shivering threshold. Electroacupuncture is known to prevent shivering by preserving the core body temperature. We compared the efficacies of electroacupuncture and nefopam for the prevention of shivering during spinal anesthesia. METHODS: Ninety patients scheduled for elective urological surgery under spinal anesthesia were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly divided into the control group (Group C, n = 30), the electroacupuncture group (Group A, n = 30), and the nefopam group (Group N, n = 30). Groups C and A received 100 ml of isotonic saline intravenously for 30 minutes before spinal anesthesia, while Group N received nefopam (0.15 mg/kg) mixed in 100 ml of isotonic saline. Group A received 30 minutes of electroacupuncture before receiving anesthesia. Shivering scores, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, body temperature and side effects were recorded before, and at 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after spinal anesthesia. RESULTS: The incidence of postanesthetic shivering was significantly lower in Group N (10 of 30) and Group A (4 of 30) compared with that in Group C (18 of 30)(P < 0.017). Body temperature was higher in Group N and Group A than in Group C (P < 0.05). Hemodynamic parameters were not different among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: By maintaining body temperature during spinal anesthesia, electroacupuncture is as effective as nefopam in preventing postanesthetic shivering.
