32745994|a|INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have found associations between grey matter atrophy and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) of vascular origin with cognitive and motor deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we investigate these relationships in a sample of PD patients and age-matched healthy controls. METHODS: Data included 50 PD patients and 45 age-matched controls with T1-weighted and FLAIR scans at baseline, 18-months, and 36-months follow-up. Deformation-based morphometry was used to measure grey matter atrophy. SNIPE (Scoring by Nonlocal Image Patch Estimator) was used to measure Alzheimer's disease-like textural patterns in the hippocampi. WMHs were segmented using T1-weighted and FLAIR images. The relationship between MRI features and clinical scores was assessed using mixed-effects models. The motor subscore of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRSIII), number of steps in a walking trial, and Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) were used respectively as measures of motor function, gait, and cognition. RESULTS: Substantia nigra atrophy was significantly associated with motor deficits, with a greater impact in PDs (p < 0.05). Hippocampal SNIPE scores were associated with cognitve decline in both PD and controls (p < 0.01). WMH burden was significantly associated with cognitive decline and increased motor deficits in the PD group, and gait deficits in both PD and controls (p < 0.03). CONCLUSION: While substantia nigra atrophy and WMH burden were significantly associated with additional motor deficits, WMH burden and hippocampal atrophy were associated with cognitive deficits in PD patients. These results suggest an additive contribution of both grey and white matter damage to the motor and cognitive deficits in PD.
