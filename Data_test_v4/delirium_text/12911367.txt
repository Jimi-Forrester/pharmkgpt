12911367|t|The effect of variable-dose diazepam on dreaming and emergence phenomena in 400 cases of ketamine-fentanyl anaesthesia.
12911367|a|This randomised double-blind field study compared 400 anaesthetics using diazepam (0, 0.025, 0.5, 0.1, 0.175 mg.kg-1) with ketamine (1 mg.kg-1) and fentanyl (1 microg.kg-1) in Melanesian patients. Dreams were very common and generally positive in nature. A minimum of 0.1 mg.kg-1 of diazepam was needed to significantly reduce dreaming when compared with water (67.5% vs. 94.6%; p < 0.0001), and to significantly lower median (95% CI) emergence delirium scores (4 (3-4) vs. 6 (5-7)). Gender and age did not affect the rate of dreaming. Increasing the dose of diazepam did not improve the dream experience. Patient satisfaction scores were similar between groups. Increases in blood pressure and heart rate were greater in dreamers than in non-dreamers. All groups had high rate-pressure products but this was highest when diazepam was not used. Higher diazepam doses significantly reduced the increase in blood pressure and heart rate at 3 and 6 min postketamine. When used with ketamine and fentanyl, 0.1 mg.kg-1 of diazepam has favourable psychic and cardiovascular effects. Lower diazepam doses generally had little effect whereas larger doses did not enhance the benefits further.
