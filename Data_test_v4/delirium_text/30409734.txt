30409734|a|BACKGROUND: Frailty in patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) has been associated with an increased 1-year mortality rate but the relation of frailty and short term outcomes yields conflicting results. This study investigated the association of a novel and self-developed Erasmus Frailty Score with both short and long term outcomes after TAVI. METHODS: TAVI Care & Cure is an observational ongoing study, which includes consecutive patients undergoing TAVI at the Erasmus University Medical Centre. Prior to the TAVI, frailty status was assessed. The Erasmus Frailty Score (EFS) was defined as follows: 1 point assigned if: MMSE was <27 points, MUST >=2 points, grip strength <20 kg for females, <30 kg for males, KATZ index >=1 limited activity, Lawton and Brody index >=2 limited activity. The maximum score was 5. Patients were classified as frail when the score was >=3. Presence of delirium was evaluated by daily clinical assessment by a geriatrician pre- and post-TAVI. Mortality data were obtained from the Dutch Civil Registry. The impact of frailty on short and long term outcomes was evaluated. RESULTS: 213 patients were included for analysis. Frailty was present in 28.6% (n = 61), (EFS >= 3). Baseline frailty was associated with patients developing a delirium [OR 3.3 (95% CI 1,55-7,10), p = 0.002] and with increased risk of 1-year mortality [HR 2.1 (95% CI 1.01-4.52), p = 0.047]. CONCLUSION: The Erasmus Frailty Score is associated with delirium and 1 year mortality in older patients after TAVI and can be used as a complement to traditional risk factors.
