2158731|t|[Psychopathology and the clinical course of schizophrenia associated with obsessive disorders].
2158731|a|Based on psychopathological and clinicocatamnestic studies made in 96 patients suffering from schizophrenia associated with obsessions running mainly an attack-like course the psychopathological characteristics of obsessions were specified and their relation to other psychopathological disorders was determined. In part of cases, obsession underwent qualitative changes acquiring the character of disturbances similar to value judgements, delirium and catatonic stereotypies. The typology of obsessions associated with schizophrenia was elaborated; two types of obsessions were distinguished: obsessions with goal-oriented protection measures and obsessions with the development of disturbances superficially similar to catatonic stereotypies. Obsessions and their course were found to be related to the degree of personality changes.
