34756625|t|The Association Between Preoperative Frailty and Postoperative Delirium: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
34756625|a|PURPOSE: Identifying factors that place patients at high risk for developing postoperative delirium is an important first step to reduce incidence. Frailty is associated with poor postoperative outcomes. This meta-analysis aims to determine the association between preoperative frailty and postoperative delirium. DESIGN: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We used PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Web of Science as databases for the search up to April 23, 2020. We included cohort studies that assessed postoperative delirium as the outcome and described the prevalence of delirium among participants during the postoperative period. Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated to examine the association. FINDINGS: Twenty cohort studies met our inclusion criteria, which included a total of 4,568 patients. We found that preoperative frailty was significantly associated with an increased risk of postoperative delirium (crude odds ratio: 3.28; 95% confidence interval: 2.51 to 4.28; I2 = 46.7%) (adjusted odds ratio: 2.45; 95% confidence interval: 1.58 to 3.81; I2 = 88.6%). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that preoperative frailty is an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium. In patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery, there is a lower association between frailty and postoperative delirium. In patients with other types of surgery, preoperative frailty is closely related to postoperative delirium.
