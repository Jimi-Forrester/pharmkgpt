32778164|a|BACKGROUND: As the world population ages, the number of hip-related fractures in the elderly is steadily increasing. These fractures generate a major worldwide healthcare problem and frequently lead to deterioration of life quality, mobility and independence in activity of daily life of geriatric patients. At present, many studies have investigated and proved benefits of multidisciplinary orthogeriatric care for elderly hip-fracture patients. Only few studies however, have analyzed treatment concepts for those patients directly following discharge from hospital in specialized rehabilitation centers. The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of a multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation on the short- and long-term functional status of geriatric patients who suffered from hip fracture. METHODS: A total of 161 hip-fracture patients aged 80 years and above, or additionally 70 years and above suffering from age-typical multimorbidity were included in this study. Patients who had an initial Barthel Index lower than 30 points were excluded from this study, as most of these patients were not able to attend a therapy at the rehabilitation center due to a poor functional status. The patients were separated into two subgroups dependent on the availability of treatment spots at the rehabilitation center. No other item was used to discriminate between the groups. Group A (n = 95) stayed an average of 21 days at an inpatient rehabilitation center that specialized in geriatric patients. Group B (n = 66) underwent the standard postoperative treatment and were sent home with further treatment by their general practitioner, nursing staff and physiotherapists. To evaluate the patients' functional status over the course of time we used the Barthel Index, which was evaluated for every patient on the day of discharge, as well as during checkups after 3, 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: The average Barthel Index at the day of discharge was 57.79 +- 14.92 points for Group A and 56.82 +- 18.76 points for Group B (p = 0.431). After 3 months, the average Barthel Index was 82.43 points for Group A and 73.11 points for group B (p = 0.005). In the 6-month checkup Group A's average Barthel Index was 83.95 points and Group B's was 74.02 points (p = 0.002). After 12 months, patients from Group A had an average Barthel Index of 81.21 while patients from Group B had an average Barthel Index of 69.85 (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: The results of this study reveal a significantly better outcome concerning both, short-term and long-term functional status after 3, 6 and 12 months for geriatric hip-fracture patients, who underwent an inpatient treatment in a rehabilitation center following the initial therapy.
