35221646|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses the complex relationship between COVID-19 and dementia and how the pandemic has affected the management of patients with dementia. This population resulted particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its effects and also to the negative effects of the measures taken worldwide to control the spread of the virus. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with dementia were at increased risk for COVID-19 compared to patients without dementia, and diagnosis of dementia represents an independent risk factor for hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. Mortality due to SARS-CoV2 infection in subjects with dementia is 2-5 times higher than in the general population. Cognitive impairment and delirium have been described in COVID-19 survivors. SARS-COV2 pandemic exacerbates the vulnerability of dementia patients and their caregivers, due to the morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, the indirect effects of the pandemic on the social supports, and the effects on healthcare system on which they depend. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic requires people with dementia to move from traditional models of health care to innovative models for home care, to support caregivers' burden, and to improve long term care.
