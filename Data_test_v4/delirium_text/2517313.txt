2517313|t|[Aluminum toxicity].
2517313|a|In view of the increasing pollution of our environment and forest decline, growing interest has been focused on aluminum toxicity. Aluminum is one of the most abundant metals and commonly present in tap water, beverages, food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical preparations. Thus everybody is exposed to aluminum to a greater or lesser extent. It is now beyond any doubt that aluminum intoxication may cause encephalopathy, fracturing vitamin D resistant osteomalacia, and microcytic anemia in patients with chronic renal insufficiency as well as in experimental animals. The risk of aluminum intoxication has also to be considered in several other groups. These include elderly individuals with physiologically impaired excretory renal function who are treated with aluminum-containing antacids, patients with chronic liver disease, infants who are fed highly aluminum-contaminated formula at a time when their excretory renal function has not jet fully developed, patients on total parenteral nutrition, and, possibly, patients with Alzheimer's disease.
