34781153|a|OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of one-year hospital readmissions and post-discharge all-cause mortality in recovered COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the country-level prevalence of the outcomes was investigated. METHODS: An extensive search was performed in Medline (PubMed), Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases until the end of August 3rd, 2021. A manual search was also performed in Google and Google Scholar search engines. Cohort and cross-sectional studies were included. Two independent reviewers screened the papers, collected data, and assessed the risk of bias and level of evidence. Any disagreement was resolved through discussion. RESULTS: 91 articles were included. 48 studies examined hospital readmissions; nine studies assessed post-discharge all-cause mortality, and 34 studies examined both outcomes. Analyses showed that the prevalence of hospital readmissions during the first 30 days, 90 days, and one-year post-discharge were 8.97% (95% CI: 7.44, 10.50), 9.79% (95% CI: 8.37, 11.24), and 10.34% (95% CI: 8.92, 11.77), respectively. The prevalence of post-discharge all-cause mortality during the 30 days, 90 days and one-year post-discharge was 7.87% (95% CI: 2.78, 12.96), 7.63% (95% CI: 4.73, 10.53) and 7.51% (95% CI, 5.30, 9.72), respectively. 30-day hospital readmissions and post-discharge mortality were 8.97% and 7.87%, respectively. The highest prevalence of hospital readmissions was observed in Germany (15.5%), Greece (15.5%), UK (13.5%), Netherlands (11.7%), China (10.8%), USA (10.0%) and Sweden (9.9%). In addition, the highest prevalence of post-discharge all-cause mortality belonged to Italy (12.7%), the UK (11.8%), and Iran (9.2%). Sensitivity analysis showed that the prevalence of one-year hospital readmissions and post-discharge all-cause mortality in high-quality studies were 10.38% and 4.00%, respectively. CONCLUSION: 10.34% of recovered COVID-19 patients required hospital readmissions after discharge. Most cases of hospital readmissions and mortality appear to occur within 30 days after discharge. The one-year post-discharge all-cause mortality rate of COVID-19 patients is 7.87%, and the majority of patients' readmission and mortality happens within the first 30 days post-discharge. Therefore, a 30-day follow-up program and patient tracking system for discharged COVID-19 patients seems necessary.
