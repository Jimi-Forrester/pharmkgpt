23288655|t|Association of TOMM40 polymorphisms with late-onset Alzheimer's disease in a Northern Han Chinese population.
23288655|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction is an early defect in the pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). One interesting candidate gene for mitochondrial dysfunction in LOAD is the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog (TOMM40) gene. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within TOMM40 have been shown to affect susceptibility to LOAD in Caucasians, while there are no studies on the association of the polymorphisms with LOAD risk in Han Chinese. Here, the association of TOMM40 polymorphisms in LOAD was investigated in a large Northern Han Chinese cohort consisting of 1,578 individuals. Both allelic and genotypic associations of three SNPs (rs157580, rs2075650, and rs11556505) with LOAD risk were observed in the total sample as well as in the non- APOE epsilon4 carriers. For rs1160985, the allele and genotype frequencies differed significantly only in APOE epsilon4 carriers. After adjustment for age, gender, and APOE epsilon4 status, the association remained statistically significant only for the rs157580 but not for rs2075650 and rs11556505. In contrast, the rs1160985 exhibited significant risk effect after adjustment. In addition, haplotype analysis confirmed that the haplotypes derived from SNPs in rs2075650, rs11556505, and rs1160985 were associated with either risk or protective effects. In summary, our findings suggest that the TOMM40 polymorphisms may play a role in the pathogenesis of LOAD in Han Chinese.
