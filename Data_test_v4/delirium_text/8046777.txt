8046777|a|One of the pathological lesions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the amyloid or senile plaque. The plaque core is predominantly made up of amyloid beta peptide (A beta), a 42-43 amino acid peptide derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a membrane bound glycoprotein which is expressed ubiquitously in many cells. Although normal or pathological functions for APP are not well understood, several observations suggest that APP may play a role in cellular stress and inflammation at the endothelial cell/vascular barrier. APP is found in platelets and endothelial cells, it can inhibit a blood coagulation factor, and secreted APP can be neuroprotective. Changes in expression of APP during cellular stress or inflammation may contribute to pathological deposition of A beta. In the present studies, expression of APP in human endothelial cells was examined following heat shock. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to 42 degrees C for 30 min, there was a five- to eight-fold increase in APP mRNA levels which peaked at 4 hr. The increase in APP mRNA was followed by an increase in APP protein immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm in a perinuclear Golgi-like region, and in discrete granular cytoplasmic structures. Immunoblot analysis of APP in the cell media found a transient increase in APP which peaked at 1 hr after heat shock. These results suggest that cellular stress induces the secretion of APP from endothelial cells followed by a subsequent increase in APP mRNA and protein synthesis. The upregulation of APP mRNA and protein supports a cellular stress role for APP.
