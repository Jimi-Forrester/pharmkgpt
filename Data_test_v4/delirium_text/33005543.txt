33005543|t|An Unexpected Case of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome.
33005543|a|This study presents an 86-year-old gentleman who was admitted under the acute stroke team for a possible posterior cerebral infarct. Radiologic imaging revealed that the diagnosis was in fact posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Through a process of elimination by means of investigations, the most likely cause was found to be mild hypertension on a background of vascular dementia causing a possible exacerbation of PRES symptoms. A multidisciplinary approach was found to be beneficial, providing safe and effective care for this patient, allowing a brief recovery period and restoration of baseline function and thus minimising permanent sequelae.
