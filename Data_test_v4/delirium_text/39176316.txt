39176316|t|Incidence and Risk Factors of Developing Post-operative Delirium Among Elderly Patients in a Tertiary Care Hospital: A Retrospective Chart Review.
39176316|a|Introduction Delirium is an acute and fluctuating decline in attention and cognition caused by reversible neural disruption. Post-operative delirium (POD) may happen 10 minutes after anesthesia administration up to discharge. POD has been associated with increased days of mechanical ventilation, increased patients' functional decline, prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and prolonged hospital length of stay, which can lead to nosocomial complications, further investigations, and increased treatment costs. In this study, we aim to determine the prevalence of POD and identify demographic or surgical variables associated with POD. Materials and methods This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the National Guard Health Affairs Hospital (NGHA), a teaching tertiary care center in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study included all patients older than 65 who developed POD from January 2017 to January 2023 and a control group of the same time window. The data were analyzed using custom Python code. Results The study included 108 patients, 72 of whom were male patients. General anesthesia was most used compared to other anesthesia techniques (79.630%). Patients with hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM) each account for 75 cases. Elective surgeries account for 86.111% of cases. Our analysis showed a significant association between POD and advanced age, male gender, DM, HTN, congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).  Conclusion With our study, we hope to aid the process of better understanding POD to help healthcare providers identify high-risk patients, implement preventative measures, and enhance patient safety and satisfaction.
