24891706|t|Delirium: Predictors of delay in referral to consultation liaison psychiatry services.
24891706|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictors of delay in psychiatry referral for patients with delirium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The consultation liaison psychiatry registry and case notes of 461 patients referred to psychiatry consultation liaison services and diagnosed as having delirium were reviewed. Data pertaining to sociodemographic variables, clinical variables, Delirium Rating Scale-Revised 98 version, etiologies associated with delirium were extracted. RESULTS: Older age, presence of and higher severity of sleep disturbance, presence of and higher severity of motor retardation, presence of visuospatial disturbances, presence of fluctuation of symptoms, being admitted to medical ward/medical intensive care units, and absence of comorbid axis-1 psychiatry diagnoses were associated with longer duration of psychiatric referral after the onset of delirium. Of these only four variables (presence of sleep disturbance, presence of motor retardation, being admitted to medical ward intensive care units and absence of comorbid axis-1 psychiatry diagnoses) were associated with longer duration of psychiatric referral in the regression analysis. CONCLUSION: The variables associated with delay in psychiatry referral for delirium suggest that there is a need to improve the understanding of the physicians and surgeons about the signs and symptoms, risk factors, and prognostic factors of delirium.
