36422169|t|A Fatal Case of Chlorfenapyr Poisoning and the Therapeutic Implications of Serum Chlorfenapyr and Tralopyril Levels.
36422169|a|Chlorfenapyr is a new contact and stomach insecticide derived from natural pyrroles secreted by Streptomyces spp. It is a pro-insecticide and acts after metabolic transformation to its active metabolite tralopyril. Tralopyril is an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria of the target insects and of experiment animals, leading to the disruption of adenosine triphosphate synthesis and death. Several fatal human poisonings had been reported and no blood chlorfenapyr or tralopyril measurements were available. The treatment remains supportive. A 32-year-old healthy man ingested 200 mL of 10% chlorfenapyr as a suicide attempt. Unfortunately, he succumbed at 157 h post-ingestion, shortly after having fever and seizures. His serum level of chlorfenapyr at 4 h post-exposure was 77.4 ng/mL, and was undetectable at 113 and 156 h, respectively. The serum levels of tralopyril were 723.6, 14,179, and 9654.2 ng/mL at 4, 113, and 156 h post-ingestion, respectively. The delay in the rise of serum tralopyril levels was noticeable, which seems to correlate with the patient's signs and symptoms. The information may have therapeutic implications in the management of this deadly poisoning.
