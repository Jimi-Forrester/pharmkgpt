37192883|a|Background: Non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and diabetes contribute to the majority of deaths in India. Public health programmes on non-communicable diseases (NCD) prevention primarily target the behavioural risk factors of the population. Hereditary is known as a risk factor for most NCDs, specifically, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and hence, understanding of the genetic markers of T2DM may facilitate prevention, early case detection and management. Main body: We reviewed the studies that explored marker-trait association with type 2 diabetes mellitus globally, with emphasis on India. Globally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs7903146 of Transcription Factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene was common, though there were alleles that were unique to specific populations. Within India, the state-wise data were also taken to foresee the distribution of risk/susceptible alleles. The findings from India showcased the common and unique alleles for each region. Conclusion: Exploring the known and unknown genetic determinants might assist in risk prediction before the onset of behavioural risk factors and deploy prevention measures. Most studies were conducted in non-representative groups with inherent limitations such as smaller sample size or looking into only specific marker-trait associations. Genome-wide association studies using data from extensive prospective studies are required in highly prevalent regions worldwide. Further research is required to understand the singular effect and the interaction of genes in predicting diabetes mellitus and other comorbidities.
