34805409|t|Identification of Polyphenolics from Loranthus globosus as Potential Inhibitors of Cholinesterase and Oxidative Stress for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.
34805409|a|Mistletoes are considered to be the potential medicinal herbs due to their rich traditional uses. Loranthus globosus is a Bangladeshi mango mistletoe that has been reported as folk medicine for various ailments and diseases. In an attempt to explore its effectiveness in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we investigated the antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of L. globosus. We report that the crude methanol extract (CME) of the plant contains a good amount of polyphenolics and possesses antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibitory activity. Fractionation of CME with solvents of varying polarity revealed the highest activity and polyphenolic content in the ethylacetate fraction (EAF). Correlation analysis revealed a significant (P < 0.05) association of polyphenolics with the antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibitory properties. Using column chromatography with diaion resin, the polyphenolics (EAF-PP) were isolated from the EAF that displayed the potent antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibitory activities. Kinetic analysis showed that EAF-PP exhibited a competitive type of inhibition. A total of thirty-six compounds including catechin and its different derivatives were identified in the EAF-PP by LC/MS analysis. Bioactivity-guided separation approach afforded the isolation of the two major active compounds catechin and catechin dimer from the EAF-PP. Hence, EAF-PP represents a potential source of antioxidants and cholinesterase inhibitors, which can be used in the management of AD.
