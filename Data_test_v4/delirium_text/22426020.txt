22426020|a|The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship of changes in long term glucose levels as measured by Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) with simultaneous changes in cognition. The sample included in the present analysis consisted of 101 community dwelling non-diabetic elderly subjects participating in ongoing longitudinal studies of cognition. Subjects were included in this study if they were cognitively normal at baseline, had at least one co-temporaneous follow-up assessment of HbA1c and the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), and complete data on age, gender, race, and years of education. MMSE decline over time was the main outcome measure. In TOBIT mixed regression models, MMSE was the dependent variable and HbA1c the time-varying covariate. Sociodemographic (age, gender, and education), cardiovascular (hypertension and APOE4 status), and lifestyle (smoking and physical activity) covariates were included in the statistical model. After adjusting for age at follow-up, there was a decrease of 1.37 points in the MMSE (p = 0.0002) per unit increase in HbA1c. This result remained essentially unchanged after adjusting also for gender and education (p = 0.0005), cardiovascular factors (p = 0.0003), and lifestyle (p = 0.0006). Additionally, results remained very similar after excluding subjects with potentially incipient diabetes with HbA1c between 6 and 7. These findings suggest that in non-diabetic non-demented elderly subjects, an increase in HbA1c over time is associated with cognitive decline. Such results may have broad clinical applicability since manipulation of glucose control, even in non-diabetics, may affect cognitive performance, perhaps enabling preventive measures against dementia.
