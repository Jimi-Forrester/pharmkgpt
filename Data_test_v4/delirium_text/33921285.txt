33921285|t|Occurrence of Delirium during ECMO Therapy in a Critical Care Unit in Poland-A Cross-Sectional Pilot Study.
33921285|a|BACKGROUND: The problem of delirium during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy, which has rarely been studied, is an important issue since it is necessary to ensure patient safety during therapy. This study aimed to show the incidence of delirium in patients after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy and factors affecting the occurrence of delirium in this group of patients. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted. METHOD: The study involved a group of patients from an intensive cardiac care unit who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. The study lasted for more than two years, in the period from 2018 until 2020. The Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (NuDESC) and the Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOSS) were applied. Additionally, the patients were examined using Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), the Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS), and a thirst intensity scale; ultimately, relationships between these factors and delirium were examined. RESULTS: In patients who underwent ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) therapy, delirium was confirmed by the NuDESC in 68.75% of patients in the evening hours, while it was measured by the DOSS scale in 84.38% of patients in the morning. The study found that ECMO delirium was not associated with hyperactivity, sleep disturbance, sedation, pain, or thirst. CONCLUSION: Delirium in patients undergoing ECMO therapy was confirmed by both the NuDESC and DOSS. Factors such as thirst and sleep disturbance after ECMO therapy were shown to influence the occurrence of delirium. The diagnosis of delirium using standardized scales is possible provided that more tests are carried out. Research should be conducted to determine whether the NuDESC is equivalent to the DOSS.
