33149425|t|Review of Metallic Biomaterials in Dental Applications.
33149425|a|Titanium and its alloys are mainly used in manufacturing dental implants. The fact that titanium implants are immunologically very effective, new methods are being experimented to achieve utmost success rate as a biomaterial. One fundamental indicator for clinical achievement of implant is the decision of composition decided for the implant with the objective to improve osseointegration. The main objective of this study was to explore literature on dental materials used for implants, contrast them with titanium dental implants, with the aim to improve osseointegration and mechanical quality using Ti-Ga-Si dental implant.
