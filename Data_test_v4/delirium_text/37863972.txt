37863972|a|This study aims to explore changes in depression and pain for major depressive disorder (MDD) patients with somatic pain after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) using the event-related potentials (ERPs) technique. Eighty MDD patients with somatic pain were randomly assigned to drug therapy (DT) and combined therapy (CT) groups. CT group underwent intermittent theta burst stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with 800 pulses and 1 Hz over the right DLPFC with 800 pulses, 5 times a week for 3 weeks. All patients were given sertraline at 50-100 mg per day. All subjects were evaluated at baseline and at weeks three and six of therapy using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Numerical Rating Scales (NRS), and the latency and amplitude of P300 and mismatch negativity (MMN) were measured. There were no significant differences in all indices between groups at baseline. At 3 weeks, HAMD subscale scores of Cognitive Impairment and NRS scores were significantly lower in the CT group than in the DT group. At 6 weeks, NRS and HAMD total scores in the CT group decreased significantly in the CT group compared with the DT group, especially for anxiety and pain, and the MMN and P300 latencies and P300 amplitude showed greater improvements. Our findings highlight that rTMS in combination with antidepressants is a rapid method of symptom improvement in patients with somatic pain with MDD and is helpful for cognitive impairment and anxiety.
