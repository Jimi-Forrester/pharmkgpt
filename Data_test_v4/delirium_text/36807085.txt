36807085|a|INTRODUCTION: Dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with potential opioid sparing properties, is utilized in palliative medicine, but the knowledge base for this practice is limited. We describe concomitant use of dexmedetomidine and opioids in an acute palliative care unit. METHODS: We included all hospitalized palliative cancer care patients treated with dexmedetomidine from January 2019 to January 2021. Demographics, opioid doses, dexmedetomidine indications and dosing, reported effects and adverse responses, as well as treatment lengths were recorded. RESULTS: Three women and six men aged 42-66 years with metastatic cancer and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status I-IV used dexmedetomidine and opioids concomitantly. Indications for dexmedetomidine were pain (n = 7) and anxiety (n = 2). Dexmedetomidine was administered intravenously in two patients and subcutaneously in seven. All administrations were continuous infusions; initial doses ranged from 240 to 1344 microg/24 h with later doses from 240 to 2440 microg/24 h. Physicians reported relief from pain and anxiety, but two patients required neuraxial pain management during admission. At day 2 of dexmedetomidine treatment, the opioid dose was reduced in six out of nine patients. For all patients with available data at day 7, mean opioid dose was reduced to 74% of the initial dose. When excluding the two patients requiring neuraxial pain management, the corresponding number was 80%. Two patients had transient hypotension, but dexmedetomidine was well tolerated and in no cases withdrawn due to adverse effects. Mean dexmedetomidine treatment length was 40 days. CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine treatment decreased opioid consumption and was well tolerated in a retrospective study of nine palliative cancer care patients. It may represent a treatment option late in the disease trajectory.
