27818982|a|INTRODUCTION: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a procedure that aims to restore the function of the hip joint. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most prevalent comorbidities among patients undergoing THA. DM involves various immunological and metabolic aspects, which lead to limitations and surgical complications. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between THA complications and controlled DM during hospitalization period. METHODS: Cross-sectional research through the analysis of retrospective records of a private hospital in Salvador, Bahia. The chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used in SAS statistical program. RESULTS: Most patients were elderly females. The most prevalent comorbidities in the sample were hypertension and diabetes. The most frequent underlying pathology in the sample was coxarthrosis; among patients with DM, it was femoral neck fracture. The most common complications were changes in the hemolymphopoietic system, among which anemia was the most frequent complication. Cardiovascular, nervous, and blood glucose complications were positively associated with controlled DM. In turn, hemolymphopoietic, genitourinary, digestive, electrolyte, and infectious complications were not associated with DM. Having DM was a protective factor for thermal complications. There was no statistically significant difference between patients that had or did not have DM in each complication group studied. CONCLUSION: Patients with controlled DM did not present more complications than those without DM during hospitalization in the post THA.
