38509675|t|Beyond Conventional Therapies: Molecular Dynamics of Alzheimer's Treatment through CLOCK/BMAL1 Interactions.
38509675|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) represents a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive and behavioral impairments significantly hindering social and occupational functioning. Melatonin, a hormone pivotal in regulating the body's intrinsic circadian rhythm, also acts as a catalyst in the breakdown of beta-amyloid deposits, offering a promising therapeutic approach for AD. The upregulation of Brain and Muscle ARNT-Like 1 (Bmal1) gene expression, stimulated by melatonin, emerges as a potential contributor to AD intervention. Current pharmacological interventions, such as FDA-approved cholinesterase inhibitors and the recently authorized monoclonal antibody, Lecanemab, are utilized in AD management. However, the connection between these medications and Bmal1 remains insufficiently explored. <p> Objective: This study aims to investigate the molecular effects of FDA-endorsed drugs on the CLOCK: Bmal1 dimer. Furthermore, considering the interactions between melatonin and Bmal1, this research explores the potential synergistic efficacy of combining these pharmaceutical agents with melatonin for AD treatment. <p> Methods: Using molecular docking and MM/PBSA methodologies, this research determines the binding affinities of drugs within the Bmal1 binding site, constructing interaction profiles. <p> Results: The findings reveal that, among FDA-approved drugs, galanthamine and donepezil demonstrate notably similar binding energy values to melatonin, interacting within the Bmal1 binding site through analogous amino acid residues and functional groups. <p> Conclusion: A novel therapeutic approach emerges, suggesting the combination of melatonin with Lecanemab as a monoclonal antibody therapy. Importantly, prior research has not explored the effects of FDA-approved drugs on Bmal1 expression or their potential for synergistic effects.
