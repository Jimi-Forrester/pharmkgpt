36892703|t|Dopamine removal from water by advanced oxidative processes with Fe/N-doped carbon nanotubes.
36892703|a|Dopamine (DA) is an important neurotransmitter in the human body, and a subnormal level is associated with some neurological problems, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Its use as medicine has progressively increased, as well as its appearance in water bodies, such as domestic or hospital effluents. Dopamine has been found to produce neurological and cardiac damage to the animals that have consumed water with its content, so the removal of dopamine from water is of utmost importance to ensure water safety. Advanced oxidative processes (AOPs) are one of the most effective technologies to eliminate hazardous and toxic compounds in wastewater. In this work, Fe-based multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were synthesized by aerosol-assisted catalytic chemical vapor deposition to be applied in the AOP of DA. MWCNTs (carbon nanotubes) exhibited high catalytic activity in removing DA with 99% of elimination.By increasing 4 times the initial concentration of DA, the removal percentage of the molecule was lower than the original one, which was attributed to the DA saturation of active sites. Even so, the percentage of degradation was high (76.2%).
