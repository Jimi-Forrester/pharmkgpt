36034127|a|This study aimed to investigate the effect of cognitive reserve (CR) on the rate of cognitive decline and cerebral glucose metabolism in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using the Study on Diagnosis of Early Alzheimer's Disease-Japan (SEAD-J) dataset. The patients in SEAD-J underwent cognitive tests and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). MCI to be studied was classified as amnestic MCI due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) with neurodegeneration. A total of 57 patients were visually interpreted as having an AD pattern (P1 pattern, Silverman's classification). The 57 individuals showing the P1 pattern were divided into a high-education group (years of school education >=13, N = 18) and a low-education group (years of school education <=12, N = 39). Voxel-based statistical parametric mapping revealed more severe hypometabolism in the high-education group than in the low-education group. Glucose metabolism in the hippocampus and temporoparietal area was inversely associated with the years of school education in the high- and low-education groups (N = 57). General linear mixed model analyses demonstrated that cognitive decline was more rapid in the high-education group during 3-year follow-up. These results suggest that the cerebral glucose metabolism is lower and cognitive function declines faster in patients with high CR of amnestic MCI due to AD defined by FDG-PET.
