37959682|t|The Green Tea Polyphenol Epigallocatechin-Gallate (EGCG) Interferes with Microcin E492 Amyloid Formation.
37959682|a|Microcin E492 (MccE492) is an antimicrobial peptide and proposed virulence factor produced by some Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, which, under certain conditions, form amyloid fibers, leading to the loss of its antibacterial activity. Although this protein has been characterized as a model functional amyloid, the secondary structure transitions behind its formation, and the possible effect of molecules that inhibit this process, have not been investigated. In this study, we examined the ability of the green tea flavonoid epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) to interfere with MccE492 amyloid formation. Aggregation kinetics followed by thioflavin T binding were used to monitor amyloid formation in the presence or absence of EGCG. Additionally, synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to study the secondary structure, thermal stability, and morphology of microcin E492 fibers. Our results showed that EGCG significantly inhibited the formation of the MccE492 amyloid, resulting in mainly amorphous aggregates and small oligomers. However, these aggregates retained part of the beta-sheet SRCD signal and a high resistance to heat denaturation, suggesting that the aggregation process is sequestered or deviated at some stage but not completely prevented. Thus, EGCG is an interesting inhibitor of the amyloid formation of MccE492 and other bacterial amyloids.
