35315217|t|Acrolein, an endogenous aldehyde induces synaptic dysfunction in vitro and in vivo: Involvement of RhoA/ROCK2 pathway.
35315217|a|Acrolein, an unsaturated aldehyde, is increased in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and identified as a potential inducer of sporadic AD. Synaptic dysfunction, as a typical pathological change occurring in the early stage of AD, is most closely associated with the severity of dementia. However, there remains a lack of clarity on the mechanisms of acrolein inducing AD-like pathology and synaptic impairment. In this study, acrolein-treated primary cultured neurons and mice were applied to investigate the effects of acrolein on cognitive impairment and synaptic dysfunction and their signaling mechanisms. In vitro, ROCK inhibitors, Fasudil, and Y27632, could attenuate the axon ruptures and synaptic impairment caused by acrolein. Meanwhile, RNA-seq distinct differentially expressed genes in acrolein models and initially linked activated RhoA/Rho-kinase2 (ROCK2) to acrolein-induced synaptic dysfunction, which could regulate neuronal cytoskeleton and neurite. The Morris water maze test and in vivo field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) were performed to evaluate spatial memory and long-term potential (LTP), respectively. Acrolein induced cognitive impairment and attenuated LTP. Furthermore, the protein level of Synapsin 1 and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95) and dendritic spines density were also decreased in acrolein-exposed mice. These changes were improved by ROCK2 inhibitor Fasudil or in ROCK2+/- mice. Together, our findings suggest that RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway plays a critical role in acrolein-induced synaptic damage and cognitive dysfunction, suggesting inhibition of ROCK2 should benefit to the early AD.
