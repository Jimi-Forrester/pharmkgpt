28738418|t|Molecular Pathway to Protection From Age-Dependent Photoreceptor Degeneration in Mef2 Deficiency.
28738418|a|Purpose: Photoreceptor degeneration in the retina is a major cause of blindness in humans. Elucidating mechanisms of degenerative and neuroprotective pathways in photoreceptors should afford identification and development of therapeutic strategies. Methods: We used mouse genetic models and improved methods for retinal explant cultures. Retinas were enucleated from Mef2d+/+ and Mef2d-/- mice, stained for MEF2 proteins and outer nuclear layer thickness, and assayed for apoptotic cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed MEF2 binding, and RT-qPCR showed levels of transcription factors. We used AAV2 and electroporation to express genes in retinal explants and electroretinograms to assess photoreceptor functionality. Results: We identify a prosurvival MEF2D-PGC1alpha pathway that plays a neuroprotective role in photoreceptors. We demonstrate that Mef2d-/- mouse retinas manifest decreased expression of PGC1alpha and increased photoreceptor cell loss, resulting in the absence of light responses. Molecular repletion of PGC1alpha protects Mef2d-/- photoreceptors and preserves light responsivity. Conclusions: These results suggest that the MEF2-PGC1alpha cascade may represent a new therapeutic target for drugs designed to protect photoreceptors from developmental- and age-dependent loss.
