33492294|t|Clinical and Paraclinical Measures Associated with Outcome in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy with Related Inflammation.
33492294|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy with related inflammation (CAA-ri) is a rare age-associated disorder characterized by an inflammatory response to amyloid in cerebral blood vessels. CAA-ri is often treated with corticosteroids, but response to treatment is variable. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between clinical and paraclinical measures and outcomes in patients with CAA-ri treated with high doses of methylprednisolone. METHODS: Longitudinal clinical course, and results from serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing, electroencephalography, and neuroimaging were reviewed from 11 prospectively-accrued CAA-ri patients diagnosed, treated, and followed at Barnes Jewish Hospital (St. Louis, MO, USA). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes were quantified using a scoring system validated in cases of amyloid related imaging abnormality (ARIA-E). Clinical outcomes were assessed as change in modified Rankin Scale (DeltamRS) from baseline to final assessment (median 175 days from treatment with high doses of methylprednisolone; range, 31-513). RESULTS: Worse outcomes following methylprednisolone treatment were associated with requirement for intensive care unit admission (median DeltamRS, 5 versus 1.5; p = 0.048), CSF pleocytosis (median DeltamRS 4.5 versus 1; p = 0.04), or lower CSF Abeta40 at presentation (rho = -0.83; p = 0.02), and diffusion restriction (median DeltamRS 4 versus 1.5; p = 0.03) or higher late ARIA-E scores (rho = 0.70; p = 0.02) on MRI, but not preexisting cognitive decline (median DeltamRS 2 versus 2; p = 0.66). CONCLUSION: Clinical and paraclinical measures associated with outcomes may inform clinical counseling and treatment decisions in patients with CAA-ri. Baseline cognitive status was not associated with treatment responsiveness.
