25155537|t|Promoting sleep in the adult surgical intensive care unit patients to prevent delirium.
25155537|a|Ensuring adequate sleep for hospitalized patients is important for reducing stress, improving healing, and decreasing episodes of delirium. The purpose of this project was to implement a Sleep Program for stable patients in the surgical intensive care unit, thereby changing sleep management practices and ensuring quality of care using an evidence-based practice approach. Improving patient satisfaction with sleep by 28 percentage points may be attributed to a standardized process of providing a healing environment for patients to sleep.
