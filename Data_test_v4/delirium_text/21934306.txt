21934306|t|Saitohin and APOE polymorphisms influence cognition and function in persons with advanced Alzheimer Disease.
21934306|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by variability in the onset and progression of cognitive, functional and behavioral symptoms. The purpose of this study was to identify genetic correlates of symptom variability in persons with moderate-to-advanced AD. METHODS: Repeated measures of cognition, function and behavior were collected from institutionalized persons with AD over 12 months. Candidate genes were assayed. RESULTS: Single polymorphisms within the saitohin and APOE genes were associated with increased cognitive impairment and functional dependence. The APOE-epsilon4 allele was associated with increased baseline physical agitation. CONCLUSION: The development of predictive profiles for the clinical symptoms of AD may increase our ability to identify clinical subgroups for more targeted intervention.
