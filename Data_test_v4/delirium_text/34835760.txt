34835760|t|Small-Sized Co-Polymers for Targeted Delivery of Multiple Imaging and Therapeutic Agents.
34835760|a|Research has increasingly focused on the delivery of high, often excessive amounts of drugs, neglecting negative aspects of the carrier's physical preconditions and biocompatibility. Among them, little attention has been paid to "small but beautiful" design of vehicle and multiple cargo to achieve effortless targeted delivery into deep tissue. The design of small biopolymers for deep tissue targeted delivery of multiple imaging agents and therapeutics (mini-nano carriers) emphasizes linear flexible polymer platforms with a hydrodynamic diameter of 4 nm to 10 nm, geometrically favoring dynamic juxtaposition of ligands to host receptors, and economic drug content. Platforms of biodegradable, non-toxic poly(beta-l-malic acid) of this size carrying multiple chemically bound, optionally nature-derived or synthetic affinity peptides and drugs for a variety of purposes are described in this review with specific examples. The size, shape, and multiple attachments to membrane sites accelerate vascular escape and fast blood clearance, as well as the increase in medical treatment and contrasts for tissue imaging. High affinity antibodies routinely considered for targeting, such as the brain through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), are replaced by moderate affinity binding peptides (vectors), which penetrate at high influxes not achievable by antibodies.
