38004006|t|Cancer Pain and Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation-A Narrative Review.
38004006|a|Background and Objectives: Pain is the most prevalent symptom in cancer patients. There is a paucity of data regarding non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) for the treatment of chronic pain in patients with cancer. The purpose of this article is to review the techniques of NIBS and present the published experiences of the oncological population. Materials and Methods: Databases including MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for articles on cancer patients with pain that was managed with non-invasive brain stimulation techniques. We included articles in English that were published from inception to January 2023. As studies were limited in number and had different designs and methodologies, a narrative review was considered as the best option to integrate data. Results: Four studies focusing on transcranial magnetic stimulation, six articles on transcranial direct current stimulation, and three articles regarding cranial electric stimulation were found and reviewed. Conclusions: Data are limited and not robust. Further studies in this field are required. Guidelines on NIBS for non-malignant chronic pain conditions provide good premises for cancer-related chronic pain.
