38821162|t|Eicosanoid signaling in neuroinflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease.
38821162|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative condition affecting a substantial portion of the global population. It is marked by a complex interplay of factors, including the accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles within the brain, leading to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Recent studies have underscored the role of free lipids and their derivatives in the initiation and progression of AD. Eicosanoids, metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids like arachidonic acid (AA), emerge as key players in this scenario. Remarkably, eicosanoids can either promote or inhibit the development of AD, and this multifaceted role is determined by how eicosanoid signaling influences the immune responses within the brain. However, the precise molecular mechanisms dictating the dual role of eicosanoids in AD remain elusive. In this comprehensive review, we explore the intricate involvement of eicosanoids in neuronal function and dysfunction. Furthermore, we assess the therapeutic potential of targeting eicosanoid signaling pathways as a viable strategy for mitigating or halting the progression of AD.
