38197930|a|RATIONALE: The beta-secretase BACE1 initiates amyloid-beta (Abeta) generation and represents a long-standing prime therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, BACE1 inhibitors tested to date in clinical trials have yielded no beneficial outcomes. In fact, prior BACE1 inhibitor trials targeted at ~ 50-90% Abeta reductions in symptomatic or prodromal AD stages have ended in the discontinuation due to futility and/or side effects, including cognitive worsening rather than expected improvement at the highest dose. OBJECTIVES: We tested whether a combination strategy with the selective BACE1 inhibitor GRL-8234 and the FDA-approved symptomatic drug memantine may provide synergistic cognitive benefits within their safe dose range. METHODS: The drug effects were evaluated in the advanced symptomatic stage of 5XFAD mice that developed extensive cerebral Abeta deposition. RESULTS: Chronic combination treatment with 33.4-mg/kg GRL-8234 and 10-mg/kg memantine, but not either drug alone, rescued cognitive deficits in 5XFAD mice at 12 months of age (the endpoint after 60-day drug treatment), as assessed by the contextual fear conditioning, spontaneous alternation Y-maze and nest building tasks. Intact baseline performances of wild-type control mice on three cognitive paradigms demonstrated that combination treatment did not augment potential cognitive side effects of individual drugs. Biochemical and immunohistochemical examination showed that combination treatment did not synergistically reduce the beta-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein or Abeta levels in 5XFAD mouse brains. CONCLUSIONS: A combination strategy with BACE1 inhibitors and memantine may be able to increase the effectiveness of individual drugs within their safe dose range in AD therapy.
