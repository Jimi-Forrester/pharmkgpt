35685722|t|Dexmedetomidine Combined with Low-Dose Propofol Declines Learning and Memory Impairment and Neural Cell Injury in Developing Rats.
35685722|a|Background: General anesthesia in early childhood may affect all aspects of neurodevelopment, resulting in learning and behavior defects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find safe anesthetics or put forward more comprehensive anesthesia schemes to solve the negative effects caused by existing anesthetics. The objective of this study is to explore the impact of dexmedetomidine (Dex) incorporated with low-dose propofol (PRO) on learning and memory ability and neural cells in developing rats. Methods: Eighty SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups including the Sham group, Lipid group, L-PRO group, and Dex + L-PRO group. After treatment, the spatial learning and memory ability of rats in each group were assessed by the water maze test and the passive avoidance test. The damage of hippocampal tissues was assessed by Nissl staining; the apoptosis, the levels of inflammatory factors, and the level of oxidative stress were measured by Tunel staining, ELISA, and biochemical assays, respectively. Besides, qRT-PCR and Western Blot determined the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, neurotrophic factors, and MAPK signaling pathway-related proteins in the hippocampus. Results: Compared with the L-PRO group, the Dex + L-PRO group had better spatial learning and memory ability. Administration of Dex and L-PRO greatly alleviated neural cell damage in the hippocampus and decreased the levels of IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha. Besides, it significantly decreased the content of ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), when up-regulating the levels of IL-10, antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) and BDNF, receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) related to hearing function and significantly lower activity of MAPK signaling pathway. Conclusion: Dex combined with low-dose PRO can significantly inhibit inflammation, oxidative stress response, neuronal apoptosis, MAPK signaling pathway activity and promote the secretion of neurokines in hippocampus to reduce neural cell damage and avoid the learning and memory impairment caused by anesthetics in developing rats.
