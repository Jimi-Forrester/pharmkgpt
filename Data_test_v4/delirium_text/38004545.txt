38004545|t|Recent Strategies for Cancer Therapy: Polymer Nanoparticles Carrying Medicinally Important Phytochemicals and Their Cellular Targets.
38004545|a|Cancer is a leading cause of death in the world today. In addition to the side effects of the chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat cancer, the development of resistance to the drugs renders the existing drugs ineffective. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel anticancer agents. Medicinally important phytochemicals such as curcumin, naringenin, quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate, thymoquinone, kaempferol, resveratrol, genistein, and apigenin have some drawbacks, including low solubility in water, stability and bioavailability issues, despite having significant anticancer effects. Encapsulation of these natural compounds into polymer nanoparticles (NPs) is a novel technology that could overcome these constraints. In comparison to the free compounds, phytochemicals loaded into nanoparticles have greater activity and bioavailability against many cancer types. In this review, we describe the preparation and characterization of natural phytochemical-loaded polymer NP formulations with significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, their in vitro and in vivo anticancer activities, as well as their possible cellular targets.
