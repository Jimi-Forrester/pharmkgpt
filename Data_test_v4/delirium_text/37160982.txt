37160982|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of arterial hypertension (AH) and of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on cognitive course in the neurocognitive disorder (NCD) cohort RIFADE which enrolled patients with NCD due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular NCD (vNCD), and mixed NCD (AD + vNCD = mNCD). Multiple risk factors (RF), including AH and OSA, that contribute to the development of various kinds of dementia have been identified in previous studies. Studies that observed AH lacked investigation of long-term effects and did not isolate it from other RF. Studies involving OSA as a risk factor did not include participants with all stages of NCD. 126 subjects were screened for AH and OSA. Repeated cognitive measurements were performed with the DemTect as primary outcome and the clock drawing test as secondary outcome measure. 90 patients had AH (71.4%) and 40 patients had OSA (31.7%). RF-status had a significant effect on cognitive outcome in models with RF as single factors (AH p = 0.027, OSA p < 0.001), a 2-factor analysis with AH x OSA (AH as main factor p = 0.027) as well as a model including the 3 factors AH x OSA x diagnosis (p = 0.038). Similarly, a 3-factor model was significant for the clock-drawing test, whereas single factor-models remained insignificant. AH and OSA appear to be risk factors in common NCD and cognitive decline can be mitigated by treatment of these RF.
