38814377|t|Central Nervous System Medications: Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Considerations for Older Adults.
38814377|a|Most drugs have not been evaluated in the older population. Recognizing physiological alterations associated with changes in drug disposition and with the ultimate effect, especially in central nervous system-acting drugs, is fundamental. While considering pharmacokinetics, it should be noted that the absorption of most drugs from the gastrointestinal tract does not change in advanced age. There are only few data about the effect of age on the transdermal absorption of medications such as fentanyl. Absorption from an intramuscular injection may be similar in older adults as in younger patients. The distribution of lipophilic drugs (such as diazepam) is increased owing to a relative increase in the percentage of body fat, causing drug accumulation and prolonged drug elimination following cessation. Phase I drug biotransformation is variably decreased in aging, impacting elimination, and hepatic drug clearance has been shown to decrease in older individuals by 10-40% for most drugs studied. Lower doses of phenothiazines, butyrophenones, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants (citalopram, mirtazapine, and tricyclic antidepressants), and benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) achieve the same extent of exposure. For renally cleared drugs with no prior metabolism (such as gabapentin), the glomerular filtration rate appropriately estimates drug clearance. Important pharmacodynamic changes in older adults include an increased sedative effect of benzodiazepines at a given drug exposure, and a higher sensitivity to mu opiate receptor agonists and to opioid adverse effects. Artificial intelligence, physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation, and concentration-effect modeling enabling a differentiation between the pharmacokinetic and the pharmacodynamic effects of aging might help to close some of the gaps in knowledge.
