2540884|a|The binding of D-[3H]aspartate to glutamate uptake sites was measured in post-mortem brains from subjects with Down's syndrome (DS) and age-matched controls. DS brains had substantially reduced D-[3H]aspartate binding in the frontal and temporal cortex, hippocampus and caudate nucleus. There was no correlation between the numbers of Alzheimer-like plaques and tangles or clinically-assessed dementia and D-[3H]aspartate binding in DS brains. The binding of [3H]N-(1-[2-thienyl]cyclohexyl)piperidine ([3H]TCP) to postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate sites was normal in DS brains. This study suggests that the reduction in glutamate uptake sites in DS is more substantial and widespread than in Alzheimer's disease.
