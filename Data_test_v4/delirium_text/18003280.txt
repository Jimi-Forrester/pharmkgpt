18003280|t|A standardized method to automatically segment amyloid plaques in Congo Red stained sections from Alzheimer transgenic mice.
18003280|a|Automated detection of amyloid plaques (AP) in post mortem brain sections of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) or in mouse models of the disease is a major issue to improve quantitative, standardized and accurate assessment of neuropathological lesions as well as of their modulation by treatment. We propose a new segmentation method to automatically detect amyloid plaques in Congo Red stained sections based on adaptive thresholds and a dedicated amyloid plaque/tissue modelling. A set of histological sections focusing on anatomical structures was used to validate the method in comparison to expert segmentation.
