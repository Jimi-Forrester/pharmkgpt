16198225|t|Modification of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores by select oxidants produces changes reminiscent of those in cells from patients with Alzheimer disease.
16198225|a|Abnormalities in calcium homeostasis and oxidative processes occur in fibroblasts from patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and in fibroblasts and neurons from transgenic mice bearing a presenilin-1 (PS-1) mutation. Bombesin-releasable endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores (BRCS) are exaggerated in all of these cells. Our previous studies show that H2O2 exaggerates BRCS. The goal of the present study was to determine whether select reactive species exaggerate BRCS in cultured human fibroblasts and to determine if the ability of fibroblasts to handle these specific oxidant species is altered in cells from AD patients. Two fluorescent indicators were used to distinguish different reactive oxygen species (ROS): 6-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, di(acetoxymethyl ester) (c-DCF) and 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF-FM). ROS were produced by a variety of oxidants, including tert-butyl-hydroxyperoxide (t-BHP), hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, 3-morpholinosydnonimine, and sodium nitroprusside. Different oxidants selectively induced various ROS in distinct patterns. These oxidants also induced selective modification in [Ca2+]i and/or BRCS. Of the several oxidants tested, t-BHP was most specific for exaggerating BRCS without affecting basal [Ca2+]i and inducing only c-DCF-detectable ROS. On the other hand, the results show that NO that reacted with DAF-FM was not responsible for alterations in BRCS. Furthermore, the c-DCF-detectable ROS production induced by t-BHP was higher in fibroblasts from AD patients bearing a PS-1 mutation (n = 7) than in those from aged controls (n = 8). The higher production of c-DCF-detectable ROS may underlie the exaggeration of BRCS in fibroblasts from AD patients. Thus, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that abnormalities in selective cellular ROS cause AD-related changes in intracellular calcium regulation.
