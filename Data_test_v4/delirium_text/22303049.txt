22303049|a|Long lists of psychiatric illness or symptoms have been documented to be caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. We describe an atypical case of a young adult who presented with predominant negative symptoms followed by neurological symptoms consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency. The symptoms showed complete remission after vitamin B12 supplementation. The uniqueness of this case is that vitamin B12 deficiency presented with predominant negative symptoms without other psychotic and manic symptoms, which has not been reported previously.
