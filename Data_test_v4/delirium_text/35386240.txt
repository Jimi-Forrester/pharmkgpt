35386240|a|Purpose: Adult spinal deformity incidence increases accordingly as the population ages. Even though surgery is the best option for the treatment, the complications due to surgery are pretty challenging. This study aims to review the complication rates of adult spinal deformity surgery. Methods: A literature review of the last decade was performed searching for the query "Adult spine deformity and complication." This search yielded 2781 results, where 79 articles were chosen to investigate the complications of adult spinal deformity surgery. In addition, the demographic data, surgical interventions, and complications were extracted from the publications. Results: A total of 26,207 patients were analyzed, and 9138 complications were found (34.5%). Implant failure, including screw loosening, breakage, distal and proximal junctional kyphosis, were the most common complications. The neurologic complications were about 10.8%, and the infection rate was 3.6%. Cardiac and pulmonary complications were about 4.8%. Discussion: Age, body mass index, smoking, osteoporosis, and other comorbidities are the significant risk factors affecting adult spinal deformity surgery. Presurgical planning and preoperative risk factor assessment must be done to avoid complications. Furthermore, intra and postoperative complications affect the patients' quality of life and length of stay, and hospital readmissions. Revision surgery also increases the risk of complications. Conclusion: Good patient evaluation before surgery and careful planning of the surgery are essential in avoiding complications of adult spinal deformity.
