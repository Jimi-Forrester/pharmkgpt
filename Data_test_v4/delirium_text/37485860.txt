37485860|a|In searching for a new and efficient therapeutic agent against Alzheimer's disease, a Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) was derived for 45 Flavonoid derivatives recently synthesized and evaluated as cholinesterase inhibitors. The multiple linear regression method (MLR) was adopted to develop an adequate mathematical model that describes the relationship between a variety of molecular descriptors of the studied compounds and their biological activities (cholinesterase inhibitors). Golbraikh and Tropsha criteria were applied to verify the validity of the built model. The built MLR model was statistically reliable, robust, and predictive (R2 = 0.801, Q2cv = 0.876, R2test = 0.824). Dreiding energy and Molar Refractivity were the major factors that govern the Anti-cholinesterase activity. These results were further exploited to design a new series of Flavonoid derivatives with higher Anti-cholinesterase activities than the existing ones. Thereafter, molecular docking and molecular dynamic studies were performed to predict the binding types of the designed compounds and to investigate their stability at the active site of the Butyrylcholinesterase BuChE protein. The negative and low binding affinity calculated for all designed compounds shows that designed compound 1 has a favorable affinity for the 4TPK. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulation studies confirmed the stability of designed compound 1 in the active pocket of 4TPK over 100 ns. Finally, the ADMET analysis was incorporated to analyze the pharmacokinetics and toxicity parameters. The designed compounds were found to meet the ADMET descriptor criteria at an acceptable level having respectable intestinal permeability and water solubility and can reach the intended destinations.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
