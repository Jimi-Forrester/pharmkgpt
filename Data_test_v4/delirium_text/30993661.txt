30993661|t|Relationship between comorbidities and treatment decision-making in elderly hip fracture patients.
30993661|a|BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are at a higher risk for hip fracture. Moreover, hospitalized elderly patients with hip fracture are vulnerable to adverse outcomes including higher mortality rate and long-term disability. Treatment decision-making with respect to surgical procedure and perioperative management of these patients is typically challenging owing to the presence of multiple comorbid conditions. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between comorbidities in elderly patients with hip fracture and the treatment decision-making. METHODS: 884 geriatric patients (age >= 60 years) with hip fracture were included. Comorbidities related to age were measured using the Charlson Co-morbidity Index (CCI) and age-adjusted CCI. The CCI of each geriatric hip fracture patient was calculated based on data retrieved from the medical records. The relationship of CCI and age-adjusted CCI with surgical procedure, time-to-surgery, length of hospital stay, and perioperative management (transfusion, anti-coagulation, and analgesia) was assessed. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 78.01 +- 8.62 years. The mean CCI was 0.79 +- 0.036; the mean age-adjusted CCI was 4.15 +- 0.047. The CCI was significantly associated with time-to-surgery (P = 0.004), surgical treatment (P < 0.001), and transfusion (P = 0.023). The age-adjusted CCI was significantly associated with surgical treatment (P < 0.001), analgesia (P = 0.003) and transfusion (P < 0.001). The length of hospital stay was associated with both CCI (P = 0.041), age-adjusted CCI (P = 0.002), and hypertension (P = 0.012). Hospital expenses showed a significant association with CCI (P = 0.000), age-adjusted CCI (P = 0.029), osteoprosis (P = 0.007), and hypertension (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this study, comorbidities were positively associated with surgical procedure and perioperative management of elderly patients with hip fracture.
