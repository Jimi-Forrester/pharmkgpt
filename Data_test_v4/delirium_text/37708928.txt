37708928|a|Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) is a group of inherited disorders, caused by mutations in the genes coding for proteins involved (directly or indirectly) in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) degradation. A lack or drastically decreased residual activity of a GAG-degrading enzyme leads to the storage of these compounds, thus damaging proper functions of different cells, including neurons. The disease leads to serious psycho-motor dysfunctions and death before reaching the adulthood. Until now, induction of the autophagy process was considered as one of the therapeutic strategies for treatment of diseases caused by protein aggregation (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases). However, this strategy has only been recently suggested as a potential therapy for MPS. In this work, we show that the pharmacological stimulation of autophagy, by using valproic acid and lithium chloride, led to accelerated degradation of accumulated GAGs. Cytotoxicity tests indicated the safety of the use of the investigated compounds. We observed an increased number of lysosomes and enhanced degradation of heparan sulfate (one of GAGs). Induction of the autophagy process was confirmed by measuring abundance of the marker proteins, including LC3-II. Moreover, inhibition of this process resulted in abolition of the valproic acid- and LiCl-mediated reduction in GAG levels. This is the first report on the possibility of using valproic acid and lithium chloride for reducing levels of GAGs in neuronopathic forms of MPS.
