30706414|a|Adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders, like Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), that share the accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein (alphaSynagg) as their hallmark molecular pathology are collectively known as alpha-synucleinopathies. Diagnosing alpha-synucleinopathies requires the post-mortem detection of alphaSynagg in various brain regions. Recent efforts to measure alphaSynagg in living patients include quantifying alphaSynagg in different biofluids as a biomarker for PD. We adopted the real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay to detect very low levels of alphaSynagg. We first optimized RT-QuIC for sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility by using monomeric recombinant human wild-type alphaSyn as a substrate and alphaSynagg as the seed. Next, we exposed mouse microglia to alphaSyn pre-formed fibrils (alphaSynPFF) for 24 h. RT-QuIC assay revealed that the alphaSynPFF is taken up rapidly by mouse microglia, within 30 min, and cleared within 24 h. We then evaluated the alphaSyn RT-QuIC assay for detecting alphaSynagg in human PD, DLB, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) post-mortem brain homogenates (BH) along with PD and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and then determined protein aggregation rate (PAR) for alphaSynagg. The PD and DLB BH samples not only showed significantly higher alphaSynagg PAR compared to age-matched healthy controls and AD, but RT-QuIC was also highly reproducible with 94% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Similarly, PD CSF samples demonstrated significantly higher alphaSynagg PAR compared to age-matched healthy controls, with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Overall, the RT-QuIC assay accurately detects alphaSynagg seeding activity, offering a potential tool for antemortem diagnosis of alpha-synucleinopathies and other protein-misfolding disorders.
