38202603|t|Network Proximity Analysis Deciphers the Pharmacological Mechanism of Osthole against D-Galactose Induced Cognitive Disorder in Rats.
38202603|a|Osthole, a natural coumarin found in various medicinal plants, has been previously reported to have neuroprotective effects. However, the specific mechanism by which Osthole alleviates dysmnesia associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective properties of Osthole against cognitive impairment in rats induced by D-galactose and elucidate its pharmacological mechanism. The rat model was established by subcutaneously injecting D-galactose at a dose of 150 mg/kg/day for 56 days. The effect of Osthole on cognitive impairment was evaluated by behavior and biochemical analysis. Subsequently, a combination of in silico prediction and experimental validation was performed to verify the network-based predictions, using western blot, Nissl staining, and immunofluorescence. The results demonstrate that Osthole could improve memory dysfunction induced by D-galactose in Sprague Dawley male rats. A network proximity-based approach and integrated pathways analysis highlight two key AD-related pathological processes that may be regulated by Osthole, including neuronal apoptosis, i.e., neuroinflammation. Among them, the pro-apoptotic markers (Bax), anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2), the microgliosis (Iba-1), Astro-cytosis (GFAP), and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-R1) were evaluated in both hippocampus and cortex. The results indicated that Osthole significantly ameliorated neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammation in D-galactose-induced cognitive impairment rats. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the pharmacological mechanism of Osthole in mitigating D-galactose-induced memory impairment and identifies Osthole as a potential drug candidate for AD treatment, targeting multiple signaling pathways through network proximity and integrated pathways analysis.
