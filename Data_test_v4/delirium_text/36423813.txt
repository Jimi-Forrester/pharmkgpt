36423813|t|Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics Analysis of Human Substantia Nigra From Parkinson's Disease Patients Identifies Multiple Pathways Potentially Involved in the Disease.
36423813|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) of the brain. Despite decades of studies, the precise pathogenic mechanism of PD is still elusive. An unbiased proteomic analysis of PD patient's brain allows the identification of critical proteins and molecular pathways that lead to dopamine cell death and alpha-synuclein deposition and the resulting devastating clinical symptoms. In this study, we conducted an in-depth proteome analysis of human SN tissues from 15 PD patients and 15 healthy control individuals combining Orbitrap mass spectrometry with the isobaric tandem mass tag-based multiplexing technology. We identified 10,040 proteins with 1140 differentially expressed proteins in the SN of PD patients. Pathway analysis showed that the ribosome pathway was the most enriched one, followed by gamma-aminobutyric acidergic synapse, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, cell adhesion molecules, morphine addiction, Prion disease, and PD pathways. Strikingly, the majority of the proteins enriched in the ribosome pathway were mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (mitoribosomes). The subsequent protein-protein interaction analysis and the weighted gene coexpression network analysis confirmed that the mitoribosome is the most enriched protein cluster. Furthermore, the mitoribosome was also identified in our analysis of a replication set of ten PD and nine healthy control SN tissues. This study provides potential disease pathways involved in PD and paves the way to study further the pathogenic mechanism of PD.
