To advance this area of research, we characterized experiences of discrimination in a cohort of older adults, contributing data to a national research sample. METHOD: An electronic survey was completed by cognitively unimpaired participants (n = 135) in the UPenn ad Research Center clinical cohort. The Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) asks 10 questions about lifetime experiences with discrimination. Self-report questionnaires gathered sociodemographic data, including age, race, disability, sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Associations between EDS items and sociodemographic characteristics were examined. RESULTS: The sample of 135 older adults averaged 74 years old, had 17 years of schooling, and were mostly women (61%) and white (71%). Half (49%) reported having discriminatory experiences including receiving less respect (35%), lower quality service (35%), less courtesy (34%), and being treated as inferior (35%) or less smart (22%). The most common reasons for discrimination were race (29%), gender (22%), skin color (18%), age (17%), and ancestry (16%). Black participants comprised the majority who reported receiving lower service (68%), being treated as less smart (60%), and with less courtesy (56%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest older adults enrolled in brain aging research experience many types of discrimination, which disproportionately affect Black individuals. Their experiences make a valuable contribution to ad science, helping researchers to study how discrimination may correspond to ad outcomes. They also highlight the importance of researchers being well-trained to be culturally informed when interacting with individuals who have been, and may continue to be, impacted by discrimination.
