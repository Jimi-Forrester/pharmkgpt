38903901|t|Mid-life sleep is associated with cognitive performance later in life in aging American Indians: data from the Strong Heart Study.
38903901|a|Background: Sleep-related disorders have been associated with cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. American Indians are at increased risk for dementia. Here, we aim to characterize, for the first time, the associations between sleep characteristics and subsequent cognitive performance in a sample of aging American Indians. Methods: We performed analyses on data collected in two ancillary studies from the Strong Heart Study, which occurred approximately 10 years apart with an overlapping sample of 160 American Indians (mean age at follow-up 73.1, standard deviation 5.6; 69.3% female and 80% with high school completion). Sleep measures were derived by polysomnography and self-reported questionnaires, including sleep timing and duration, sleep latency, sleep stages, indices of sleep-disordered breathing, and self-report assessments of poor sleep and daytime sleepiness. Cognitive assessment included measures of general cognition, processing speed, episodic verbal learning, short and long-delay recall, recognition, and phonemic fluency. We performed correlation analyses between sleep and cognitive measures. For correlated variables, we conducted separate linear regressions. We analyzed the degree to which cognitive impairment, defined as more than 1.5 standard deviations below the average Modified Mini Mental State Test score, is predicted by sleep characteristics. All regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex, years of education, body mass index, study site, depressive symptoms score, difference in age from baseline to follow-up, alcohol use, and presence of APOE e4 allele. Results: We found that objective sleep characteristics measured by polysomnography, but not subjective sleep characteristics, were associated with cognitive performance approximately 10 years later. Longer sleep latency was associated with worse phonemic fluency (beta = -0.069, p = 0.019) and increased likelihood of being classified in the cognitive impairment group later in life (odds ratio 1.037, p = 0.004). Longer duration with oxygen saturation < 90% was associated with better immediate verbal memory, and higher oxygen saturation with worse total learning, short and long-delay recall, and processing speed. Conclusion: In a sample of American Indians, sleep characteristics in midlife were correlated with cognitive performance a decade later. Sleep disorders may be modifiable risk factors for cognitive impairment and dementia later in life, and suitable candidates for interventions aimed at preventing neurodegenerative disease development and progression.
