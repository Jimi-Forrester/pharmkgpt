32578913|a|BACKGROUND: While advances in falls prevention in the adult population have occurred, the care requirements for older patients with cognitive impairment at risk of falling are less established. OBJECTIVES: To identify interventions to prevent in-hospital falls in older patients with cognitive impairment for further research and describe the strategies used to implement those interventions. DESIGN: A seven-stage mixed studies review was used. METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched. The SPIDER framework guided the review question and selection of search terms. The Mixed Methods Assessment Tool was used to appraise the quality of research studies, and the Quality Improvement Minimum Quality Data Set was used to appraise the quality of quality improvement projects. A convergent qualitative synthesis was used to analyse the extracted data. The adapted PRISMA guideline informed the procedures. RESULTS: Ten projects (five quality improvements and five researches) were included. Five themes emerged from the synthesis: engaging with families in falls prevention, assessing falls risk to identify interventions, extending nursing observation through technology, conducting a medication review and initiating nonpharmacological delirium prevention interventions. Implementation was not well described and commonly focused on capital investment to initiate a falls prevention programme and education to introduce staff to the new techniques for practice. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging research and quality improvement studies demonstrate that effective falls prevention with this vulnerable population is possible but requires further investigation before widespread practice recommendations can be made. Further research and quality improvement in this area should consider adoption of an implementation framework to address sustainability. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Reducing falls in older people with cognitive impairment requires nurses to work more closely with pharmacists, occupational therapists and social workers to develop strategies that work and are sustainable.
