37786557|t|Update on neurological symptoms in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2.
37786557|a|Novel coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) is the latest and most intense epidemic, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In addition to causing respiratory symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 can have severe effects on the nervous system. Clinically, COVID-19 patients have been reported ranging from mild hypogeusia and hyposmia to severe neurological disorders, such as encephalopathy, encephalitis, strokes, and seizures syndrome. However, the pathological mechanisms of this SARS-CoV-2 neuro aggressiveness remain unclear, so it is of great significance to explore the neurological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To facilitate clinicians to timely recognize the manifestations of COVID-19 patients with neurological injury and timely treatment, the author hereby reviews the latest research progress in the possible pathways, clinical manifestations, and pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients with nerve injury.
