30197831|t|Targeting Prion-like Cis Phosphorylated Tau Pathology in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
30197831|a|Tau is a microtubule-associated protein heavily implicated in neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Phosphorylation of tau at Thr231 allows for the isomerization of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) into distinct cis and trans conformations. Cis, but not trans, p-tau is detectable not only in Alzheimer's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, but also right after traumatic brain injury depending on injury severity and frequency both in humans and animal models. Cis p-tau is not only neurotoxic but also spreads from a neuron to another in a prion-like fashion, functioning as a primary driver of neurodegeneration, which can be effectively neutralized by cis p-tau antibody. This represents an exciting new opportunity for understanding disease development and developing early biomarkers and effective therapies of tauopathies.
