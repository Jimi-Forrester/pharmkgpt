28422828|a|RATIONALE: Gastrointestinal Mucormycosis (GIM) is a kind of opportunistic fungal infection with poor prognosis. It usually occurs in patients with immune deficiency. We reported a case of immunocompetent male patient. PATIENT CONCERNS: This patient was presented as abdominal distension and gastrointestinal bleeding. DIAGNOSES: A variety of hemostatic methods was ineffective to stop the bleeding. The patient finally received laparotomy, and the jejunum lesions were found. INTERVENTIONS: Pathological examination confirmed it to be gastrointestinal mucormycosis in jejunum. OUTCOMES: However, after systemic anti-fungi therapy, the patient died of septic shock. LESSONS: The diagnosis mainly relies on pathological examination. Early diagnosis and early application of systemic amphotericin B liposome were fundamental for improving the prognosis.
