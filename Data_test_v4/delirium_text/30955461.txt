30955461|t|Pharmacologic Considerations Surrounding Sedation, Delirium, and Sleep in Critically Ill Adults: A Narrative Review.
30955461|a|INTRODUCTION: Agitation, delirium, and sleep dysfunction in the intensive care unit (ICU) are common occurrences that result in negative patient outcomes. With the recent publication of the 2018 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption in Adult Patients in the ICU (PAD-IS), several areas are of particular interest due to emerging literature or conflicting results of research. OBJECTIVE: To highlight areas where emerging literature or variable study results exist and to provide the clinician with recommendations regarding patient management. METHODS: The 2018 PAD-IS guidelines were reviewed, and areas of emerging literature or lack of consensus of included investigations surrounding pharmacologic management of sedation, delirium, and sleep in the ICU were identified. A review and appraisal of the literature was conducted specifically to address the identified areas. Prospective, randomized trials were included in this narrative review. RESULTS: Four areas with emerging data or conflicting evidence were identified and included: use of propofol or dexmedetomidine for sedation, pharmacologic prevention of delirium, treatment of delirium, and pharmacologic strategies to improve sleep. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive approach to the prevention and management of delirium, sedation, and sleep in the ICU is necessary to optimize patient outcomes.
