30122838|t|Comparison of Cognitive Profile in Young- and Late-onset Parkinson's Disease Patients.

OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to compare the cognition testing in young- and late-onset PD patient. METHODS: Sixty PD patients (20 young onset and 40 late onset) fulfilling UKPDS Brain Bank diagnostic criteria were enrolled in the study. Patients were assessed clinically and using scales for cognition testing such as Scales for Outcomes in PDCognition (SCOPA-COG), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating scale (motor part), and Hoehn and Yahr staging. RESULTS: Young-onset group comprised 20 (33.3%) and late-onset group comprised 40 (66.7%) patients. Most of the young- and late-onset patients, 15 (75%) and 21 (52.5%), had SCOPA-COG score in the range of 30-39, respectively. On comparison between young- and late-onset groups, SCOPA-COG score's mean +- standard deviation (SD) for young and late onset was 32.60 +- 2.52 and 30.30 +- 3.65, respectively, with statistical significance (P = 0.01). SCOPA-COG score's mean +- SD for mild, moderate, and severely impaired PD patients was 31.48 +- 3.19, 30.60 +- 3.24, and 23.50 +- 3.53, respectively, which on group comparisons (ANOVA) were statistically significant (P = 0.004). However, the SCOPA-COG score was statistically insignificant with respect to disease duration. CONCLUSION: There was statistically significant difference in SCOPA-COG score between young- and late-onset PD patients and in patients with more severe motor impairment.
