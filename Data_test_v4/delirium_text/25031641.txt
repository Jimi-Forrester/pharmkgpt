25031641|t|Dietary regulation of PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta pathway in Alzheimer's disease.
25031641|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of phosphorylated Tau. Several findings suggest that correcting signal dysregulation for Tau phosphorylation in AD may offer a potential therapeutic approach. The PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta pathway has been shown to play a pivotal role in neuroprotection, enhancing cell survival by stimulating cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. This pathway appears to be crucial in AD because it promotes protein hyper-phosphorylation in Tau. Understanding those regulations may provide a better efficacy of new therapeutic approaches. In this review, we summarize advances in the involvement of the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta pathways in cell signaling of neuronal cells. We also review recent studies on the features of several diets and the signaling pathway involved in AD.
