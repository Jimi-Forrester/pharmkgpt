18299172|t|REM sleep behaviour disorder treated with melatonin in a patient with Alzheimer's disease.
18299172|a|We report a case of a 68-year-old man with probable Alzheimer's disease who developed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder. This was confirmed with polysomnography but the patient also had some sleep apnea, which prevented the use of clonazepam for treatment. Melatonin was successfully used as an alternative treatment.
