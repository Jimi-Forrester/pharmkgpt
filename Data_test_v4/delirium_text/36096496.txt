36096496|t|The Effects of Medium-Chain Triglyceride Oil Supplementation on Endurance Performance and Substrate Utilization in Healthy Populations: A Systematic Review.
36096496|a|Background: The use of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil has increased due to its potential for therapeutic and ergogenic properties. Although recent evidence has suggested that MCT oil supplementation may lead to an improvement in endurance and substrate utilization, contradicting studies have reported the ergogenic benefits of MCT oil toward exercise performance. Methods: An extensive systematic review was conducted to assess the role of MCT oil as an ergogenic aid in exercise performance. Moreover, this study examined any alterations in substrate utilization and various physiological components while using MCT oil. The databases searched in this review were PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. Results: Most studies reported that MCT oil did not improve exercise performance and had no effect on respiratory exchange ratio, glucose concentration, fat and carbohydrate oxidation, and lactate concentration. Although ketones were increased when supplementing with MCTs, most studies demonstrated that the body could not utilize the MCT oil-induced ketones as its primary energy source during an acute bout of endurance exercise. Thirty grams of MCTs seems to be the safe maximal dosage to minimize adverse reactions during or after exercise. Conclusion: MCT oil showed very little to no ergogenic effects on exercise performance and substrate utilization in healthy populations. Future research is needed to examine the effects of long-term intake of MCT oil alongside various diets, perhaps a ketogenic diet, on exercise performance within different sports/exercises in a variety of populations.
