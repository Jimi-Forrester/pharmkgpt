37510851|t|The Association of Infection with Delirium in the Post-Operative Period after Elective CABG Surgery.
37510851|a|Delirium is one of the most common complications of coronary artery by-pass graft (CABG) surgery. The identification of patients at increased risk of delirium and the implementation of preventive measures to reduce the risk of postoperative delirium is necessary to improve treatment outcomes after CABG. The aim of this study was to assess the association between postoperative delirium and postoperative infection and 10-year mortality in patients undergoing CABG surgery. This is a retrospective, observational cohort study of patients undergoing planned on-pump CABG between April 2010 and December 2012. We analysed a group of 3098 patients operated on in our cardiac surgery centre, from whom we selected a cohort of patients undergoing planned CABG surgery. All patients were assessed for postoperative infection, such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections (BSIs) and surgical site infections (SSIs). Patients who experienced postoperative delirium were significantly more likely to have infection (7.4% vs. 22%; p = 0.0037). As regards particular types of infection, significant differences were only found for pneumonia and sternal SSIs. Patients who experienced postoperative delirium had significantly lower 5-year (p = 0.0136) and 10-year (p = 0.0134) survival. Postoperative delirium significantly increases long-term mortality in patients undergoing CABG surgery. Pneumonia and sternal SSIs significantly increase the risk of postoperative delirium in cardiac surgery patients.
