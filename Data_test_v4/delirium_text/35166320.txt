35166320|t|Rare catastrophes and evolutionary legacies: human germline gene variants in MLKL and the necroptosis signalling pathway.
35166320|a|Programmed cell death has long been characterised as a key player in the development of human disease. Necroptosis is a lytic form of programmed cell death that is universally mediated by the effector protein mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL), a pseudokinase. MLKL's activating kinase, receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), is itself activated within context specific scaffolds of receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), Z-DNA Binding Protein-1 (ZBP1) or TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-beta (TRIF). These core necroptosis modulating proteins have been comprehensively revealed as potent drivers and suppressors of disease in inbred mouse strains. However, their roles in human disease within the 'real world' of diverse genetic backgrounds, natural infection and environmental challenges remains less well understood. Over 20 unique disease-associated human germline gene variants in this core necroptotic machinery have been reported in the literature and human clinico-genetics databases like ClinVar to date. In this review, we provide an overview of these human gene variants, with an emphasis on those encoding MLKL. These experiments of nature have the potential to not only enrich our understanding of the basic biology of necroptosis, but offer important population level insights into which clinical indications stand to benefit most from necroptosis-targeted drugs.
