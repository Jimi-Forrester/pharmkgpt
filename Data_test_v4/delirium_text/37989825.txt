37989825|a|Cognitive impairment in learning, memory, and executive function occurs in normal aging even in the absence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While neurons do not degenerate in humans or monkeys free of AD, there are structural changes including synapse loss and dendritic atrophy, especially in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and these correlate with cognitive age-related impairment. Developmental studies revealed activity-dependent neuronal properties that lead to synapse remodeling by microglia. Microglia-mediated phagocytosis that may eliminate synapses is regulated by immune "eat me" and "don't eat me" signaling proteins in an activity-dependent manner, so that less active synapses are eliminated. Whether this process contributes to age-related synapse loss remains unknown. The present study used a rhesus monkey model of normal aging to investigate the balance between the "eat me" signal, complement component C1q, and the "don't eat me" signal, transmembrane glycoprotein CD47, relative to age-related synapse loss in dlPFC Area 46. Results showed an age-related elevation of C1q and reduction of CD47 at PSD95+ synapses that is associated with cognitive impairment. Additionally, reduced neuronal CD47 RNA expression was found, indicating that aged neurons were less able to produce the protective signal CD47. Interestingly, microglia do not show the hypertrophic morphology indicative of phagocytic activity. These findings suggest that in the aging brain, changes in the balance of immunologic proteins give microglia instructions favoring synapse elimination of less active synapses, but this may occur by a process other than classic phagocytosis such as trogocytosis.
