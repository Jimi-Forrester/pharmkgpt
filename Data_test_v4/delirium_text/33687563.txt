33687563|t|Mortality after cardiopulmonary resuscitation on a medical ICU : A sex-specific outcome analysis.
33687563|a|BACKGROUND: Performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and postresuscitation care in the intensive care unit (ICU) are standardized procedures; however, there is evidence suggesting sex-dependent differences in clinical management and outcome variables after cardiac arrest (CA). METHODS: A prospective analysis of patients who were hospitalized at a medical ICU after CPR between December 2018 and March 2020 was conducted. Exclusion criteria were age < 18 years, hospital length of stay < 24 h and traumatic CA. The primary study endpoint was mortality after 6 months and the secondary endpoint neurological outcome assessed by cerebral performance category (CPC). Differences between groups were calculated by using U-tests and chi2-tests, for survival analysis both univariate and multivariable Cox regression were fitted. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were included and the majority were male (71.7%). No statistically significant difference regarding 6-month mortality between sexes could be shown (hazard risk, HR 0.68, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.35-1.34; p = 0.27). Neurological outcome was also similar between both groups (CPC 1 88% in both sexes after 6 months; p = 1.000). There were no statistically significant differences regarding general characteristics, pre-existing diseases, as well as the majority of clinical and laboratory parameters or measures performed on the ICU. CONCLUSION: In a single center CPR database no statistically significant sex-specific differences regarding post-resuscitation care, survival and neurological outcome after 6 months were observed.
