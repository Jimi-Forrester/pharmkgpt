27981583|t|Cross-seeding between Abeta40 and Abeta42 in Alzheimer's disease.
27981583|a|Abeta42 is the major component of parenchymal plaques in the brain of Alzheimer's patients, while Abeta40 is the major component of cerebrovascular plaques. Since Abeta40 and Abeta42 coexist in the brain, understanding the interaction between Abeta40 and Abeta42 during their aggregation is important to delineate the molecular mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease. Here, we present a rigorous and systematic study of the cross-seeding effects between Abeta40 and Abeta42. We show that Abeta40 fibril seeds can promote Abeta42 aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner, and vice versa. Our results also suggest that seeded aggregation and spontaneous aggregation may be two separate pathways. These findings may partly resolve conflicting observations in the literature regarding the cross-seeding effects between Abeta40 and Abeta42.
