34002018|a|The expression of TDP-43, the main component of neuronal intracellular inclusions across a broad spectrum of ALS and FTD disorders, is developmentally regulated and studies in vivo have shown that TDP-43 overexpression can be toxic, even before observation of pathological aggregates. Starting from these observations, the regulation of its expression at transcriptional level might represent a further key element for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we have characterized the human TARDBP promoter, in order to study the transcriptional mechanisms of expression. Mapping of cis-acting elements by luciferase assays in different cell outlined that the activity of the promoter seems to be higher in SH-SY5Y, Neuro2A, and HeLa than in HEK293. In addition, we tested effects of two SNPs found in the promoter region of ALS patients and observed no significant effect on transcription levels in all tested cell lines. Lastly, while TDP-43 overexpression did not affect significantly the activity of its promoter (suggesting that TDP-43 does not influence its own transcription), the presence of the 5'UTR sequence and of intron-1 splicing seem to impact positively on TDP-43 expression without affecting transcript stability. In conclusion, we have identified the region spanning nucleotides 451-230 upstream from the transcription start site as the minimal region with a significant transcription activity. These results lay an important foundation for exploring the regulation of the TARDBP gene transcription by exogenous and endogenous stimuli and the implication of transcriptional mechanisms in the pathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathies.
