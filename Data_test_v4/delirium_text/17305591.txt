17305591|a|There is considerable evidence showing that oxidative damage is one of the earliest neuronal and pathological changes of Alzheimer disease and many, if not all, of the etiological and pathological causes of the disease are related, directly or indirectly, to free radical production and oxidative damage. Here we summarize the current body of knowledge suggestive that oxidative damage is, if not the key factor, certainly a major factor in Alzheimer disease. As such, therapeutic modalities encompassing antioxidants may be an effective approach to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and delay the aging process.
