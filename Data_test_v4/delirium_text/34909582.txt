There is no scale specific to the outbreak period and which can be used in other outbreaks. In this study, it was planned to develop a scale to evaluate the anxiety associated with epidemic disease, especially during the epidemic period. METHODS: In this study, a Likert type scale with 15 items was developed by our research team to evaluate outbreak disease anxiety, and the scale form created was transferred to online use and the reliability of validity was evaluated by obtaining the results of 311 participants in the online environment. The internal consistency of the scale was assessed with Cronbach's Alpha coefficients. Split-half reliability was estimated using Spearman-Brown coefficients unequel length. Explanatory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis in AMOS, correlation analysis, and construct validity analysis (convergent validity and discriminant validity) were conducted. Beck Anxiety Inventory and Health Anxiety Inventory was used to evaluate concurrent and discriminant validity. RESULTS: The Cronbach Alpha coefficient calculated for the evaluation of the internal consistency (homogeneity) of the outbreak anxiety scale was determined as 0.94 and this value shows that the scale has high reliability. With the results of this study, the scale's content validity and construct validity, discrimination, and criterion validity were evaluated and it was shown to have acceptable valid features in all. CONCLUSION: Outbreak anxiety scale is a valid and reliable tool to evaluate anxiety related with outbreak of epidemic and pandemic disease.
