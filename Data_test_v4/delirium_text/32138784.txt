32138784|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are common side-effects following strabismus surgery. The present study aimed to compare the effects of different doses of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on PONV incidence in pediatric patients undergoing strabismus surgery. METHODS: In this prospective randomized double-blinded study, 126 pediatric patients undergoing strabismus surgery were randomized into one of three groups: Placebo group, normal saline; DEX1 group, 0.3 mug/kg dexmedetomidine, and DEX2 group, 0.5 mug/kg dexmedetomidine. Oculocardiac reflex (OCR) events were recorded during surgery. PONV or postoperative vomiting (POV) was recorded for 24 h in the ward. Pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) scale and emergence agitation (EA) scale were recorded in the recovery room. RESULTS: Intraoperative OCR was significantly reduced in DEX2 group (42%) as compared to that of Placebo group (68%) (p = 0.0146). During the first 24 h post-op, the overall incidence of PONV was significantly lower in DEX2 group (10%) than that of Placebo group (32%) (p = 0.0142). There was no significant difference in POV among the three groups. PAED or EA scores among the three groups were similar during recovery time. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine (0.5 mug/kg) reduced OCR and PONV without lengthening extubation time or recovery time in pediatric patients undergoing strabismus surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was prospectively registered before patient enrollment at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (Clinical Trial Number: ChiCTR1800020176, Date: 12/19/2018).
