33104033|t|Evaluation and Effectiveness of Dementia Staff Training Programs in General Hospital Settings: A Narrative Synthesis with Holton's Three-Level Model Applied.
33104033|a|BACKGROUND: People with Dementia (PwD) are frequently admitted to hospital settings. The lack of proper dementia knowledge, poor communication skills, negative attitudes toward dementia, and lack of confidence affects the quality of care, thus development of dementia trainings has increased. Nevertheless, literature regarding the effectiveness of training implementation is limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this narrative synthesis is to 1) identify the characteristics of training programs and 2) explore the effectiveness of these training programs in everyday clinical practice. METHODS: A systematic search in PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane was conducted, including qualitative and quantitative peer-reviewed studies. Holton's evaluation model with its three outcome levels (learning, individual performance, and organizational results) was adopted. 14 studies were included. RESULTS: The synthesis of the results was divided into two parts: 1) to describe the characteristics and content of trainings 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of training programs according to the three outcome levels of Holton's model, taking into consideration its construct domains: ability, motivation, and environment. Learning outcomes were assessed in all selected studies: 13 studies observed changes in individual performance, four studies reported changes within the organizational level, and only five showed sustainable changes over time. CONCLUSION: Person-centered care (PCC) approaches, interactive and varied teaching methods, supporting conditions like champions, action plans, and setting care policies, are all characteristics of effective trainings. Successful programs should be sustainable over time, demonstrating positive outcomes across the organization. Based on current findings, there is a lack of adequate evaluation with regard to training programs on the organizational level.
