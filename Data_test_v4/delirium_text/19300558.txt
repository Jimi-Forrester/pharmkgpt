19300558|t|Glatiramer acetate in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
19300558|a|Glatiramer acetate is an immunomodulating drug used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It consists of a copolymer of amino acid residues in the same stoichiometric proportions as in myelin basic protein. Its mechanism of action is not entirely known and is probably multifaceted, with deletion of some immune cell populations and stimulation of others in these patients. Some mechanisms involve neuroprotectant effects. There is ample evidence of its efficacy in relapsing-remitting disease, using both clinical and imaging measures of disease activity, and in this paper we review the clinical and basic studies of this drug. Finally we discuss how some of its neuroprotectant effects may be useful in neurodegeneration such as is seen in more advanced cases of multiple sclerosis and other diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease.
