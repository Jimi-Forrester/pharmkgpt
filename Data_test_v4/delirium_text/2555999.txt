2555999|a|Ubiquitin has previously been identified as a component of neuronal inclusions in neurodegenerative disorders. In this investigation, we examined tissue from cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Pick's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) to identify previously unrecognized ubiquitinated structures and to assess the evolution of neuronal inclusions. In AD, approximately 60% of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that were stained with an anti-paired helical filaments (PHF) serum were identified by the ubiquitin antibodies. Extracellular NFTs were not labelled with anti-PHF but were unlabelled or weakly labelled with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. In Pick's disease, most Pick bodies were strongly labelled by the ubiquitin antibodies, and in addition some hippocampal CA1 neurones contained granular or strand-like ubiquitin-immunoreactive (IR) inclusions associated with more typical Pick bodies. Typical Lewy bodies in PD cases showed an unlabelled central core with an outer ring intensely labelled by ubiquitin antibodies. Pale bodies in pigmented substantia nigra neurones appeared as large well-defined, rounded structures without an identifiable core or peripheral zone. Some pale bodies were unlabelled by ubiquitin antibodies, but others showed labelling of variable intensity. Pale bodies which were labelled by ubiquitin antibodies tended also to be labelled by BF10, a monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated neurofilaments. We suggest that pale bodies in PD may represent stages in the formation of Lewy bodies. In addition, we observed numerous spindle-shaped ubiquitin-IR swellings of dendrites of pigmented substantia nigra neurones. In contrast to inclusions of AD and Pick's disease, the PHF-positive fibrillary neuronal inclusions of PSP were either unlabelled or only weakly labelled by ubiquitin antibodies. No ubiquitinated structures were seen in neurones from corresponding areas in aged controls. Identification of ubiquitinated proteins in neurodegenerative disorders may provide insights into molecular events associated with cell death.
