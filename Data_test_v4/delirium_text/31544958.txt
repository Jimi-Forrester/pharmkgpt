31544958|a|Motivated by recent work involving the analysis of biomedical imaging data, we present a novel procedure for constructing simultaneous confidence corridors for the mean of imaging data. We propose to use flexible bivariate splines over triangulations to handle an irregular domain of the images that is common in brain imaging studies and in other biomedical imaging applications. The proposed spline estimators of the mean functions are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal under some regularity conditions. We also provide a computationally efficient estimator of the covariance function and derive its uniform consistency. The procedure is also extended to the two-sample case in which we focus on comparing the mean functions from two populations of imaging data. Through Monte Carlo simulation studies, we examine the finite sample performance of the proposed method. Finally, the proposed method is applied to analyze brain positron emission tomography data in two different studies. One data set used in preparation of this article was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.
