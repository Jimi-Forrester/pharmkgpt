20121561|t|Is oseltamivir (Tamiflu) safe? Re-examining the Tamiflu 'ado' from Japan.
20121561|a|Reports that oseltamivir causes abnormal behaviors in influenza patients and, thereby, increases the risk of injuries or death alerted the world. Such reports came almost exclusively from Japan, which consumes more than 75% of the world supply, even before the novel influenza pandemic started. The Japanese government will not revoke its warning issued in March 2007 against the use of oseltamivir in teenagers despite the accumulating evidence that such abnormal behaviors are part of generic symptoms of influenza-like delirium and not attributable to certain drugs. The author analyzes the background of the 'ado' by compiling the various sources of information, some of which have not been readily available to the international audience and explains why Japan is incapable of producing firm evidence to draw a definite conclusion. The author also alarms the potential risk of sudden death related to oseltamivir and foresees how the problem may be solved in the future.
