34784461|t|Approaching trauma analgesia using prolonged and novel continuous peripheral nerve blocks - A case report.
34784461|a|BACKGROUND: A supraclavicular brachial plexus nerve block provides analgesia for the shoulder, arm, and hand; however, the maximum safe duration for a continuous infusion remains controversial. A novel continuous peripheral nerve block (CPNB) technique combining the Lateral, Intermediate, and Medial femoral cutaneous nerves (termed the 'LIM' block) to provide analgesia to the lateral, anterior, and medial cutaneous areas of the thigh while preserving quadriceps strength will also be described in detail here. CASE: We present a complex case in which simultaneous utilization of an unilateral supraclavicular CPNB (5 weeks) and bilateral LIM CPNB (5 days) are successfully performed to provide analgesia for a traumatic degloving injury resulting in multiple surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: The analgesic plan in this case study eliminated previous episodes of opioid-induced delirium, facilitated participation in recovery, and removed concerns for respiratory depression and chronic opioid use in a patient at particular risk for both issues.
