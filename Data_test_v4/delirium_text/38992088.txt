38992088|t|An optical photothermal infrared investigation of lymph nodal metastases of oral squamous cell carcinoma.
38992088|a|In this study, optical photothermal infrared (O-PTIR) spectroscopy combined with machine learning algorithms were used to evaluate 46 tissue cores of surgically resected cervical lymph nodes, some of which harboured oral squamous cell carcinoma nodal metastasis. The ratios obtained between O-PTIR chemical images at 1252 cm-1 and 1285 cm-1 were able to reveal morphological details from tissue samples that are comparable to the information achieved by a pathologist's interpretation of optical microscopy of haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained samples. Additionally, when used as input data for a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and random forest (RF) analyses, these yielded sensitivities, specificities and precision of 98.6 +- 0.3%, 92 +- 4% and 94 +- 5%, respectively, and an area under receiver operator characteristic (AUC) of 94 +- 2%. Our findings show the potential of O-PTIR technology as a tool to study cancer on tissue samples.
