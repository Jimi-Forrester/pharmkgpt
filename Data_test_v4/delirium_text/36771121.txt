36771121|t|Porphyrin Functionalized Carbon Quantum Dots for Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence and Sensitive Detection of Cu2.
36771121|a|Porphyrin (TMPyP) functionalized carbon quantum dots (CQDs-TMPyP), a novel and efficient carbon nanocomposite material, were developed as a novel luminescent material, which could be very useful for the sensitive detection of copper ions in the Cu2+ quenching luminescence of functionalized carbon quantum dots. Therefore, we constructed a sensitive "signal off" ECL biosensor for the detection of Cu2+. This sensor can sensitively respond to copper ions in the range of 10 nM to 10 muM, and the detection limit is 2.78 nM. At the same time, it has good selectivity and stability and a benign response in complex systems. With excellent properties, this proposed ECL biosensor provides an efficient and ultrasensitive method for Cu2+ detection.
