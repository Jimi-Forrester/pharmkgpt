39317307|a|Oxidative stress and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption due to brain endothelial barrier dysfunction contribute to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), which is characterized by beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation in senile plaques. Copper (Cu) is implicated in AD pathology and its levels are tightly controlled by several Cu transport proteins. However, their expression and role in AD, particularly in relation to brain endothelial barrier function remains unclear. In this study, we examined the expression of Cu transport proteins in the brains of AD mouse models as well as their involvement in Abeta42-induced brain endothelial barrier dysfunction. We found that the Cu uptake transporter CTR1 was upregulated, while the Cu exporter ATP7A was downregulated in the hippocampus of AD mouse models and in Abeta42-treated human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). In the 5xFAD AD mouse model, Cu levels (assessed by ICP-MS) were elevated in the hippocampus. Moreover, in cultured hBMECs, Abeta42-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, ROS-dependent loss in barrier function (measured by transendothelial electrical resistance), and tyrosine phosphorylation of CDH5 were all inhibited by either a membrane permeable Cu chelator or by knocking down CTR1 expression. These findings suggest that dysregulated expression of Cu transport proteins may lead to intracellular Cu accumulation in the AD brain, and that Abeta42 promotes ROS-dependent brain endothelial barrier dysfunction and CDH5 phosphorylation in a CTR1-Cu-dependent manner. Our study uncovers the critical role of Cu transport proteins in oxidative stress-related loss of BBB integrity in AD.
