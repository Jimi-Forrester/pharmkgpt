31392693|t|In Vivo Phagocytosis Analysis of Amyloid Beta.
31392693|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta), tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. One striking feature in the disease is the clustering of microglia around Abeta plaques. These cells exhibit a highly and chronically activated phenotype, performing a variety of functions, phagocytosis being one of them. Since Abeta phagocytosis by microglia could represent a key aspect in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease, robust and comprehensive methods to evaluate this process are needed. Here, we describe a detailed flow cytometry-based protocol for the analysis of Abeta phagocytosis in vivo.
