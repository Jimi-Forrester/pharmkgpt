35046351|t|[Management of Delirium in Patients with Cancer].
35046351|a|Delirium is a condition in which the main symptom is a mild disturbance of consciousness caused by a physical abnormality or medication, and various symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction, hallucinations, delusions, and mood swings appear with any disease. Delirium is frequently observed in patients with cancer, especially in the terminal stage, and is observed in about 90% of patients just before death. Hypercalcemia due to bone metastases, brain metastases, and the use of opioids and steroids for symptom relief are direct factors in the development of delirium. Furthermore, there are many opportunities to encounter delirium at the end of life caused by conditions that are difficult to recover from, such as brain metastasis, liver failure, and hypoxic encephalopathy. In the management of delirium, "search for the cause(s)and its treatment"and"environmental adjustment"are the most important. Then, pharmacotherapy is considered to reduce the severity of delirium. Antipsychotics are the basic medication of choice. The route of administration, half-life, dosage form, adverse events of medication, as well as patient factors such as the presence or absence of diabetes and the subtype of delirium should be comprehensively considered when selecting a medication. The timing of medication discontinuation should also be kept in mind once medication therapy is initiated. On the other hand, when delirium is caused by factors that are difficult to recover from, the goal of treatment is to alleviate the painful symptoms caused by delirium, and it is important to take a holistic approach for patients and family members.
