36478774|a|Introduction: Calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), or the calcium to magnesium (Ca:Mg) ratio may affect the risk of dementia via complex mechanisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of dietary Ca, Mg, and Ca:Mg ratio with dementia risk at the prospective phase of the Shanghai Aging Study. Methods: We analyzed data from 1565 dementia-free participants living in an urban community who had measurements of dietary Ca and Mg intake derived from a food frequency questionnaire at baseline and incident dementia during follow-up. Results: Over the 5-year follow-up, 162 (10.4%) participants were diagnosed with incident dementia by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition criteria. Participants with the lowest tertile of dietary Ca (<339.1 mg/day) and Mg (<202.1 mg/day) had the highest incidence rates of dementia (3.3/100 person-years for Ca, 3.3/100 person-years for Mg) compared to those with higher Ca and Mg intake. In the subgroup with Ca:Mg ratios <= 1.69, Mg intake >267.5 mg/day was related to an increased risk for dementia (adjusted hazard ratio: 3.97, 95% confidence interval: 1.29-12.25). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that high dietary intake of Mg is associated with an increased risk of dementia mainly among older adults with low Ca:Mg intake ratios. Proper balance of Ca to Mg in the diet may be critical to the relationship between Mg intake and risk of dementia. Highlights: Participants with the lowest tertile of dietary calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) had the highest incidence rates of dementia.In the subgroup with Ca:Mg ratios <=1.69, Mg intake >267.5 mg/day was related to an increased risk for dementia.Balance of Ca to Mg in diet may be critical to the relationship between Mg intake and risk of dementia.
