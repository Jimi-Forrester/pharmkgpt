726768|t|[Syndromokinesis of alcoholic psychoses (according to the results of a clinico-epidemiologic survey)].
726768|a|A clinico-epidemiological study was made of 446 patients who suffered from alcoholic psychoses during 1946--1970. An analysis of the quantitative and qualitative modification of the syndromes, the regularities in their dynamics demonstrated that the transformation of the symptomatology to a large extent depend upon the type of development of the alcoholic psychoses. Transitory psychoses are more frequently replaced by psychopathy-like personality changes. In a remittent development, repeated psychoses are characterized, as a rule, by a delirium or hallucinosis. Following a delirium there are typical acute verbal hallucinosis. During relapses there is an increasing amount of atypical symptoms. In patients with mixed and especially a continuous development of the psychoses, the pathokinesis of syndromes proceeds on the level of profound psychopathological disorders. As a result there may be either schizoform and crude organic clinical pictures and eventually there is a deep organic symptomatology (pseudoparalysis), or against the background of crude alcoholic personality changes, after lucid periods, there may be acute psychotic conditions.
