38217438|t|Quantitative EEG in the Differential Diagnosis of Dementia Subtypes.
38217438|a|OBJECTIVE: Most neurodegenerative dementias present with substantial overlap in clinical features. Therefore, differential diagnosis is often a challenging task necessitating costly and sometimes invasive diagnostic procedures. A promising, non-invasive and cost-effective method is the widely available electroencephalography (EEG). METHODS: Twenty-three subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 28 subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 15 subjects with frontotemporal dementias (FTDs), and 22 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. Nineteen channel computerized EEG recordings were acquired. Mean relative powers were calculated using the standard frequency bands. Theta/alpha ratio (TAR), theta/beta ratio (TBR), a spectral index of (alpha + beta)/(theta + delta) and an alpha reactivity index (alpha in eyes-open condition/alpha in eyes-closed condition) were also calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to assess diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: For the comparison of EEG measures across groups, we performed a multivariate ANOVA followed by univariate ANOVAs controlling for the effects of age, with post hoc tests. Theta power and TBR were increased in DLB compared to other groups. Alpha power was decreased in DLB compared to HC and FTD; and in AD compared to FTD. Beta power was decreased in DLB compared to AD and HC. Furthermore, regional analyses demonstrated a unique pattern of theta power increase in DLB; affecting frontal, central, parietal, occipital, and temporal regions. In AD, theta power increased compared to HC in parietal, occipital, and right temporal regions. TAR was increased in DLB compared to other groups; and in AD compared to HC. Finally, alpha reactivity index was higher in DLB compared to HC and FTD. In AD, EEG slowing was associated with cognitive impairment, while in DLB, this was associated with higher DLB characteristics. In the ROC analyses to distinguish DLB from FTD and AD, measures of EEG slowing yielded high area under curve values, with good specificities. Also, decreased alpha reactivity could distinguish DLB from FTD with good specificity. EEG slowing in DLB showed a diffuse pattern compared to AD, where a posterior and temporal slowing predominated. CONCLUSION: We showed that EEG slowing was satisfactory in distinguishing DLB patients from AD and FTD patients. Notably, this slowing was a characteristic finding in DLB patients, even at early stages, while it paralleled disease progression in AD. Furthermore, EEG slowing in DLB showed a diffuse pattern compared to AD, where a posterior and temporal slowing predominated. These findings align with the previous evidence of the diencephalic dysfunction in DLB.
