25032908|a|The emergence of genomic approaches coupled to recombinant DNA technologies have identified the quality control systems that regulate proteostasis - biological pathways that modulate protein biogenesis, maturation, trafficking, and degradation. The elucidation of these pathways has become of growing importance in therapeutics as loss of proteostasis has been suggested to lead to a number of human diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's Disease and Type II Diabetes. We anticipate that the most successful strategies for protein expression and therapeutics development may involve integration of protein engineering strategies with host manipulation, to exploit the cell's native stress response pathways and trafficking mechanisms. This review will highlight recent findings and mechanistic detail correlated to quality control in the early secretory pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
