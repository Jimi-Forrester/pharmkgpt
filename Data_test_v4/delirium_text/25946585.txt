25946585|a|BACKGROUND: Studies that deepen in the aspects related to quality of life (QoL) of elderly with dementia living in nursing homes in Spain are needed. The aim of this study is to describe the QoL and related aspects in this population. METHODS: Sample of 525 people with dementia older than 60 years in 14 nursing homes. QoL was assessed with EQ-5D (both index and visual analogue Scale, EQ-VAS) and Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease(QoL-AD, resident and caregiver versions). Other scales were also applied: Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), Barthel Index, Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), modified version of the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G), Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) and Cognitive Mini-exam (MEC). To determine the relationship between the variables of interest, Pearson's correlation coefficient and the analysis of variance (Student's t test) were used. RESULTS: QoL scales displayed correlations from 0.17 to 0.50 between them. Qol-AD-caregiver scored higher in men with lower disability and depression 28.94 +- 4.91, 29.91 +- 4.74 and 28.44 +- 4.94, respectively;(p < 0.01), and correlated 0.45 with Barthel Index and -0.36 with CSDD. Qol-AD-resident scored higher in absence of depression (29.29 +- 6.03). EQ-5D Index scored higher in men (0.19 +- 0.33) with less disability (0.42 +- 0.32) and its coefficient of correlation with Barthel Index was 0.79. CONCLUSIONS: Functional state and depression are associated with quality of life in older people with dementia living in nursing homes.
