34367489|a|INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychologists play an important role on multidisciplinary teams with physicians from multiple specialties. The extent of residency training on the use of neuropsychological services is unclear. Medical residents across multiple specialties throughout the United States were surveyed to assess resident education, training, and understanding of neuropsychological services, along with their intent to consult neuropsychologists in the future. METHODS: A survey was sent to residents in accredited psychiatry, neurology, family medicine, and internal medicine programs. After data were collected, chi-square group level analyses with post-hoc pairwise comparisons were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 434 residents took the survey. The proportion of residents exposed to neuropsychology during residency varied significantly according to specialty (chi2 (3, N = 419) = 51.4, p < 0.001), with more psychiatry and neurology residents reporting exposure than residents in family medicine or internal medicine. Similarly, the proportion of psychiatry and neurology residents who 'agree' or 'strongly agree' that they understand the nature of neuropsychological services differed significantly from family medicine and internal medicine residents (chi2 (3, N = 415) = 40.4, p < 0.001). The majority of residents across all specialties (85.7%) reported they are likely to consult/order neuropsychological services in future practice. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of residents in all specialties reported exposure to neuropsychological services in some manner, but forms of exposure varied. Results indicated a need for increased education and training in neuropsychological services, especially within family medicine and internal medicine programs.
