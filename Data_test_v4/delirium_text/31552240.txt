31552240|t|Computational Assessment of the Pharmacological Profiles of Degradation Products of Chitosan.
31552240|a|Chitosan is a natural polymer revealing an increased potential to be used in different biomedical applications, including drug delivery systems, and tissue engineering. It implies the evaluation of the organism response to the biomaterial implantation. Low-molecular degradation products, the chito-oligomers, are resulting mainly from the influence of enzymes, which are found in the organism fluids. Within this study, we have performed the computational assessment of pharmacological profiles and toxicological effects on human health of small chito-oligomers with distinct molecular weights, deacetylation degrees, and acetylation patterns. Our approach is based on the fact that regulatory agencies and researchers in the drug development field rely on the use of modeling to predict biological effects and to guide decision making. To be considered as valid for regulatory purposes, every model that is used for predictions should be associated with a defined toxicological endpoint and has appropriate robustness and predictivity. Within this context, we have used FAF-Drugs4, SwissADME, and PreADMET tools to predict the oral bioavailability of chito-oligomers and SwissADME, PreADMET, and admetSAR2.0 tools to predict their pharmacokinetic profiles. The organs and genomic toxicities have been assessed using admetSAR2.0 and PreADMET tools but specific computational facilities have been also used for predicting different toxicological endpoints: Pred-Skin for skin sensitization, CarcinoPred-EL for carcinogenicity, Pred-hERG for cardiotoxicity, ENDOCRINE DISRUPTOME for endocrine disruption potential and Toxtree for carcinogenicity and mutagenicity. Our computational assessment showed that investigated chito-oligomers reflect promising pharmacological profiles and limited toxicological effects on humans, regardless of molecular weight, deacetylation degree, and acetylation pattern. According to our results, there is a possible inhibition of the organic anion transporting peptides OATP1B1 and/or OATP1B3, a weak potential of cardiotoxicity, a minor probability of affecting the androgen receptor, and phospholipidosis. Consequently, these results may be used to guide or to complement the existing in vitro and in vivo toxicity tests, to optimize biomaterials properties and to contribute to the selection of prototypes for nanocarriers.
