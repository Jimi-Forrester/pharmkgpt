20969847|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It can cause cell death in Alzheimer's disease by evoking a cascade of oxidative damage to neurons. Antioxidant compounds may help to elucidate and develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of TEMPOL (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy), a cyclic nitroxide which is particularly effective at reducing oxidative injury, on Abeta(1-42)-induced SH-SY5Y cell toxicity. Exposure of cells to 20 muM Abeta(1-42) for 48 h caused viability loss and apoptotic increase, and pre-treatment with TEMPOL for 24 h significantly reduced the viability loss and apoptotic rate. In addition, TEMPOL inhibited Abeta(1-42)-induced superoxide anion generation and hydroxyl radical generation to a striking degree. Based on these results, it is concluded that TEMPOL effectively protects SH-SY5Y cells against beta-amyloid-induced damage by suppressing the generation of reactive oxygen species especially, superoxide anion.
