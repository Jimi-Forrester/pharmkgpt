37869351|a|Background: Pertrochanteric fracture is one of the most prevalent public health issues across the world for the elderly population. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between surgical factors and postoperative mortality in patients with intramedullary nail-treated pertrochanteric fractures. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was designed to evaluate the pertrochanteric fracture patients treated with intramedullary nail between January 2016 to February 2021. The surgical factors included the Dorr morphology, Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) classification of fractures, the tip-apex distance (TAD), location of the cephalic screw, reduction quality in anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral views, the integrity of the lateral wall, and the design of cephalic screws. Using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, the association between these risk factors and postoperative mortality in patients with this type of fractures was evaluated. Results: A total of 169 pertrochanteric fracture patients treated with intramedullary nails were included in our study, with the average age of 82.68+-5.93 years. The mortality rates at 3 months, 1 year, and the end of follow-up were 4.14%, 11.24%, and 26.04%, respectively. According to the univariate Cox analysis, age, gender, preoperative levels of hemoglobin (Hb) and albumin (Alb) were associated with a poor overall survival (OS) (P<0.05). After multivariate adjustment, the pre-operative level of Alb (P<0.001) and the reduction in lateral view (P<0.001) were shown to be independent risk factors for poor OS. Conclusions: The preoperative hypoalbuminemia and reduction quality in lateral view were associated with postoperative mortality in our study. Therefore, optimizing both parameters could improve the prognosis in elderly pertrochanteric fracture patients.
