24822208|t|Urokinase gene 3'-UTR T/C polymorphism is associated with malignancy and ESRD in idiopathic membranous nephropathy.
24822208|a|Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (MN) is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults, and 25% of MN patients proceed to ESRD. Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) may play an important role in reducing renal fibrosis. This study was conducted to clarify the relationship between uPA gene polymorphisms and clinical manifestations of MN. We recruited 91 biopsy-diagnosed MN patients and 105 healthy subjects. Genotyping of uPA gene 3'-UTR T/C polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction methods. The genotype distribution had no effect on the development of MN. Thirteen patients (15.9%; P = 0.008) acquired malignancies and seventeen (20.7%; P = 0.006) patients progressed to ESRD with the C/C genotype, but no patients with the T/C genotype did. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the presence of the uPA gene 3'-UTR C/C genotype was associated with ESRD as well as acquired malignancies in MN patients. These findings should prompt specific considerations for the treatment of MN patients to maintain a balance between treating disease entities and protecting the immune system from cancers.
