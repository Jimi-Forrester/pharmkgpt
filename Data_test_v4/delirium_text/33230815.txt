33230815|t|Access to Health Services in Older Minority Ethnic Groups with Dementia: A Systematic Review.
33230815|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: While it is acknowledged that minority ethnic (ME) groups across international settings face barriers to accessing care for dementia, it is not clear whether ME groups access services less frequently as a result. The objective of this review is to examine whether ME groups have longer delays before accessing dementia/memory services, higher use of acute care and crisis services and lower use of routine care services based on existing literature. We also examined whether ME groups had higher dementia severity or lower cognition when presenting to memory services. DESIGN: Systematic review with narrative synthesis. SETTING: Nonresidential medical, psychiatric, memory, and emergency services. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty studies totaling 94,431 older adults with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. MEASUREMENTS: We searched Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Global Health, and PsycINFO from inception to November 2018 for peer-reviewed observational studies which quantified ethnic minority differences in nonresidential health service use in people with dementia. Narrative synthesis was used to analyze findings. RESULTS: Twenty studies were included, mostly from the U.S. (n = 13), as well as the UK (n = 4), Australia (n = 1), Belgium (n = 1), and the Netherlands (n = 1). There was little evidence that ME groups in any country accessed routine care at different rates than comparison groups, although studies may have been underpowered. There was strong evidence that African American/Black groups had higher use of hospital inpatient services versus U.S. comparison groups. Primary care and emergency services were less well studied. Study quality was mixed, and there was a large amount of variability in the way ethnicity and service use outcomes were ascertained and defined. CONCLUSION: There is evidence that some ME groups, such as Black/African American groups in the U.S., may use more acute care services than comparison populations, but less evidence for differences in routine care use. Research is sparse, especially outside the U.S.
