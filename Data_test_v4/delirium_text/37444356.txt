37444356|t|Green Assessment of Phenolic Acid Composition and Antioxidant Capacity of Advanced Potato Mutant Lines through UPLC-qTOF-MS/MS Quantification.
37444356|a|Potatoes are one of the most consumed crops worldwide. They contain a high amount of bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds and vitamins with important antioxidant activities, which makes this crop of high biological value for human health. The goal of this research was to biochemically evaluate polyphenol levels and antioxidant capacities in parent and control genotypes compared to advanced mutant potato lines in the M1V8 generation. This will reveal the genetic changes that result from induced mutagenesis. The quantified compounds and the evaluated antioxidant activity boost the health benefits of consuming the improved mutant potatoes. In the present study, the phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of eighteen mutant and initial potato genotypes were analyzed by UPLC-qTOF-MS/MS and the ORAC method, respectively. In each of the hybrid combinations, mutant lines with an improved phenolic compound profile were observed. Representative samples from the third hybrid combination had notable increases in phenolic compound concentrations, as well as the presence of metabolites not found in the parental lines. With one exception, the remaining nine mutants showed significantly higher antioxidant capacities. The results will be used in future potato breeding programs, with participation of the valuable mutant lines containing new phenolic substances not present in the initial genotypes.
