25613910|a|Determining Abeta levels in body fluids remains a powerful tool in the diagnostics of Alzheimer's disease. This report delineates a new supramolecular strategy which increases the affinity of antibodies towards Abeta to make diagnostic procedures more sensitive. A monoclonal antibody IC16 was generated to an N-terminal epitope of Abeta and the variable regions of the heavy and light chains were cloned as a recombinant protein (scFv). A 6 x histidine tag was fused to the C-terminus of IC16-scFv allowing hybridization with a small organic beta-sheet binder via Ni-NTA complexation. On the other hand, a multivalent nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-equipped trimeric aminopyrazole (AP) derivative was synthesized based on a cyclam platform; and experimental evidence was obtained for efficient Ni(2+)-mediated complex formation with the histidine-tagged antibody species. In a proof of principle experiment the hybrid molecule showed a strong increase in affinity towards Abeta. Thus, the specific binding power of recombinant antibody fragments to their beta-sheet rich targets can be conveniently enhanced by non-covalent hybridization with small organic beta-sheet binders.
