20713025|t|Correlations between soluble alpha/beta forms of amyloid precursor protein and Abeta38, 40, and 42 in human cerebrospinal fluid.
20713025|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are now widely used for diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) in atypical clinical forms, for differential and early diagnosis, or for stratification of patients in clinical trials. Among these biomarkers, different forms of amyloid peptides (Abeta) produced by the cleavage of a transmembrane precursor protein called APP (amyloid precursor protein) have a major role. Abeta peptides exist in different length the most common ones having 40 (Abeta40), 42 (Abeta42), or 38 (Abeta38) amino acids in length. APP processing by gamma-secretase releases also an amino-terminal secreted fragment called sAbetaPP-beta while an alternative nonamyloidogenic cleavage of APP, through an alpha-secretase, liberates another fragment called sAbetaPP-alpha. To decipher the molecular and pathological mechanisms leading to the production and the detection of these entities is essential for the comprehension and the prevention of AD. In this report, we present the results of the multiplex measurement of CSF Abeta38, Abeta40, Abeta42, sAbetaPP-alpha, and sAbetaPP-beta in 60 patients mostly with dementia eventually segregated between neurochemical dementia diagnostic (NDD) positive and negative groups. The NDD classification was based on our routine Tau, P-tau(181), and Abeta(42) cutoff values. We confirmed previous findings regarding the correlation between sAbetaPP-alpha and sAbetaPP-beta, as well as the potential interest of these new biomarkers. We also studied the correlation between sAbetaPPs and Abeta peptides, as well as between Abeta peptides themselves. We observed a strong correlation between Abeta38 and sAbetaPP-beta which suggested that the production of this peptide was in direct relation with beta secretase activities. We also reported a strong correlation between Abeta38 and Abeta40, while Abeta42 was correlated to these fragments only in nonpathological situations. These results enlighten the complex relationships between these molecular markers in both physiological and pathological situations. Our results are important for the further use of these analytes for AD diagnosis as well as for validating the cell biological hypotheses of APP processing and Abeta fragment production.
