36974247|t|Awareness Level of Hypoglycemia Among Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 Patients in Al Qassim Region.
36974247|a|Background Hypoglycemia has a major impact on patient health and glycemic management during insulin therapy for both type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is the rate-limiting complication in diabetes management that prevents stringent glucose control. Objectives To assess the knowledge and awareness about hypoglycemia as a complication of T2D in adults in Al Qassim, Saudi Arabia. Methods This is a cross-sectional study done among type 2 diabetes patients in Al-Qassim, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, from January to June 2022. A previously validated online questionnaire was disseminated through social media to gather information from respondents. Participants were chosen via a simple random sampling technique. Data analysis was completed using SPSS (version 23; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results Overall, 213 respondents were included in our study. The majority of them were females (70.9%). The participants' average age was 35.9 + 13.0 years. Our results revealed that the average awareness score of the study population was found to be 3.6 +- 1.1 (by using the Clarke method) and 3.7 +- 2.1 (by using the Gold method). Moreover, we found that impaired awareness of hypoglycemia's prevalence by Clarke's questionnaire was 52.1% and 53.5% by using the Gold questionnaire. In addition, almost half of the respondents reported weakness as a symptom of hypoglycemia over the last six months and unconsciousness over the last 12 months. Hypertension was the most commonly reported chronic disease by our participants. Lastly, factors such as age, gender, educational level, geographic distribution, and history of chronic illness did not show any significant association with impaired awareness of the prevalence of hypoglycemia. Conclusion According to our research, we concluded that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the region of Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia, had insufficient knowledge about hypoglycemia as a complication of T2D. Moreover, the impaired awareness of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients was found to be high. Hence, there is a need for interventional programs to raise public awareness.
