29230284|t|Acute appendicitis presenting as a complicated inguinal hernia: a case of left-sided Amyand's hernia in an elderly man.
29230284|a|Amyand's hernia (AH) is characterized by the presence of the vermiform appendix in an inguinal hernia sac. Typically presenting on the right side and with manifestations similar to those seen in complicated hernias, it presents a diagnostic challenge and is frequently only diagnosed intraoperatively. We present the case of a left-sided AH on a 75-year-old man treated with appendicectomy, orchidectomy and hernioplasty without mesh.
