38405501|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the major causes of dementia in the elderly and exerts tremendous clinical, psychological and socio-economic constraints. Currently, there are no effective disease-modifying/retarding anti-AD agents. Emodin is a bioactive phytochemical with potent multimodal anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antifibrillogenic properties. In particular, emodin may result in significant repression of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying AD. The purpose of this review is to accumulate and summarize all the primary research data evaluating the therapeutic actions of emodin in AD pathogenesis. Methodology: The search, selection, and retrieval of pertinent primary research articles were systematically performed using a methodically designed approach. A variety of keyword combinations were employed on online scholarly web-databases. Strict preset inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to select the retrieved studies. Data from the individual studies were summarized and compiled into different sections, based upon their findings. Results: Cellular and animal research indicates that emodin exerts robust multimodal neuroprotection in AD. While emodin effectively prevents tau and amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomerization, it also mitigates their neurotoxicity by attenuating neuroinflammatory, oxidative, and bioenergetic defects. Evidences for emodin-mediated enhancements in memory, learning, and cognition were also found in the literature. Conclusion: Emodin is a potential anti-AD dietary supplement; however, further studies are warrantied to thoroughly understand its target players and mechanisms. Moreover, human clinical data on emodin-mediated amelioration of AD phenotype is largely lacking, and must be addressed in the future. Lastly, the safety of exogenously supplemented emodin must be thoroughly evaluated.
