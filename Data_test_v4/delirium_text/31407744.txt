31407744|t|A highly sensitive fluorescent probe that quantifies transthyretin in human plasma as an early diagnostic tool of Alzheimer's disease.
31407744|a|The development of sensitive and reliable fluorescent probes for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly challenging and plays an important role in achieving effective treatments. Herein, we designed and synthesized an indole-based fluorophore for TTR in human plasma, an important hallmark of AD pathogenesis. This robust and simple fluorescent method allows quantification of TTR in the complex biological matrix.
