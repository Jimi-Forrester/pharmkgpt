38675371|a|Brain somatic gene recombination (SGR) and the endogenous reverse transcriptases (RTs) that produce it have been implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting RT inhibitors as novel prophylactics or therapeutics. This retrospective, proof-of-concept study evaluated the incidence of AD in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with or without exposure to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs) using de-identified medical claims data. Eligible participants were aged >=60 years, without pre-existing AD diagnoses, and pursued medical services in the United States from October 2015 to September 2016. Cohorts 1 (N = 46,218) and 2 (N = 32,923) had HIV. Cohort 1 had prescription claims for at least one NRTI within the exposure period; Cohort 2 did not. Cohort 3 (N = 150,819) had medical claims for the common cold without evidence of HIV or antiretroviral therapy. The cumulative incidence of new AD cases over the ensuing 2.75-year observation period was lowest in patients with NRTI exposure and highest in controls. Age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratios showed a significantly decreased risk for AD in Cohort 1 compared with Cohorts 2 (HR 0.88, p < 0.05) and 3 (HR 0.84, p < 0.05). Sub-grouping identified a decreased AD risk in patients with NRTI exposure but without protease inhibitor (PI) exposure. Prospective clinical trials and the development of next-generation agents targeting brain RTs are warranted.
