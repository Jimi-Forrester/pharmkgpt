30257685|a|BACKGROUND: Neuronal Ca2+ dyshomeostasis and hyperactivity play a central role in Alzheimer's disease pathology and progression. Amyloid-beta together with non-genetic risk-factors of Alzheimer's disease contributes to increased Ca2+ influx and aberrant neuronal activity, which accelerates neurodegeneration in a feed-forward fashion. As such, identifying new targets and drugs to modulate excessive Ca2+ signalling and neuronal hyperactivity, without overly suppressing them, has promising therapeutic potential. METHODS: Here we show, using biochemical, electrophysiological, imaging, and behavioural tools, that pharmacological modulation of Rap1 signalling by inhibiting its interaction with Pde6delta normalises disease associated Ca2+ aberrations and neuronal activity, conferring neuroprotection in models of Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: The newly identified inhibitors of the Rap1-Pde6delta interaction counteract AD phenotypes, by reconfiguring Rap1 signalling underlying synaptic efficacy, Ca2+ influx, and neuronal repolarisation, without adverse effects in-cellulo or in-vivo. Thus, modulation of Rap1 by Pde6delta accommodates key mechanisms underlying neuronal activity, and therefore represents a promising new drug target for early or late intervention in neurodegenerative disorders. CONCLUSION: Targeting the Pde6delta-Rap1 interaction has promising therapeutic potential for disorders characterised by neuronal hyperactivity, such as Alzheimer's disease.
