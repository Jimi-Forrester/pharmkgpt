23199038|a|It has been suggested that a more precise selection of predictive biomarkers may prove useful in the early diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), even when glucose tolerance is normal. This is vital since many T2D cases may be preventable by avoiding those factors that trigger the disease process (primary prevention) or by use of therapy that modulates the disease process before the onset of clinical symptoms (secondary prevention) occurs. The selection of predictive markers must be carefully assessed and depends mainly on three important parameters: sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value. Unfortunately, biomarkers with ideal specificity and sensitivity are difficult to find. One potential solution is to use the combinatorial power of different biomarkers, each of which alone may not offer satisfactory specificity and sensitivity. Recent technological advances in proteomics and bioinformatics offer a great opportunity for the discovery of different potential predictive markers. In this review, we described a cellular T2D model as an example with the intent of providing specific enrichment and new identification strategies, which might have the potential to improve predictive biomarker identification and to bring accuracy in disease diagnosis and classification, as well as therapeutic monitoring in the early phase of T2D.
