The treatment of this complex group of patients in specialized centers is therefore recommended. The collaborative treatment of patients by trauma surgeons and geriatricians improves the results. The treatment is carried out according to a standardized protocol and includes rapid surgical stabilization of the fracture and an interdisciplinary care of the patients. During hospitalization many patients develop delirium. Due to the high rate of complications endangered patients should already be identified in the emergency department to enable a timely initiation of preventive measures. Due to the high number of patients requiring treatment and the complexity of the patients, the legislation has established specific requirements for the treatment of proximal femoral fractures. The treatment of fragility fractures in trauma surgery goes beyond the surgical stabilization alone and incorporates the pharmaceutical treatment of the osteoporosis.
