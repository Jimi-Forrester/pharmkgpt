38653150|a|The first systematic acylated diversification of naturally scarce premyrsinane diterpenes, together with their biosynthetic precursors lathyrane diterpene were carried out. Two new series of premyrsinane derivates (1a-32a) and lathyrane derivates (1-32) were synthesized from the naturally abundant lathyrane diterpene Euphorbia factor L3 through a bioinspired approach. The cholinesterase inhibitory and neuroprotective activities of these diterpenes were investigated to explore potential anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) bioactive lead compounds. In general, the lathyrane diterpenes showed the better acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity than that of premyrsinanes. The lathyrane derivative 17 bearing a 3-dimethylaminobenzoyl moiety showed the best AChE inhibition effect with the IC50 value of 7.1 muM. Molecular docking demonstrated that 17 could bond with AChE well (-8 kal/mol). On the other hand, premyrsinanes showed a better neuroprotection profile against H2O2-induced injury in SH-SY5Y cells. Among them, the premyrsinane diterpene 16a had significant neuroprotective effect with the cell viability rate of 113.5 % at 12.5 muM (the model group with 51.2 %). The immunofluorescence, western blot and reactive oxygen species (ROS) analysis were conducted to demonstrate the mechanism of 16a. Furthermore, a preliminary SAR analysis of the two categories of diterpenes was performed to provide the insights for anti-AD drug development.
