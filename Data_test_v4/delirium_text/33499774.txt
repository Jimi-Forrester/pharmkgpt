33499774|t|MYBPC2 and MYL1 as Significant Gene Markers for Rhabdomyosarcoma.
33499774|a|BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue tumor in children. Rhabdomyosarcoma commonly results in pain and bleeding caused by tumor compression and is prone to early metastasis and recurrence, which can seriously affect the therapeutic outcomes and long-term prognosis. Up to 37.7% of rhabdomyosarcomas may metastasize. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms underlying rhabdomyosarcoma must be explored to identify an effective target for its early diagnosis and specific treatment. METHODS: A dataset of 18 rhabdomyosarcoma tissue samples and 6 healthy skeletal muscle samples was downloaded. Differentially expressed genes between rhabdomyosarcoma and healthy tissue samples were identified by GEO2R. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and gene ontology pathway enrichment analyses were performed. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed, and hub genes were identified. Expression and survival analyses of hub genes were performed. Additionally, 30 patients with rhabdomyosarcoma were recruited, and overall survival information and samples were collected. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to verify the expression of MYBPC2 and MYL1 in rhabdomyosarcoma tumor tissues. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to explore overall survival based on our clinical data. RESULTS: In total, 164 genes were up-regulated and 394 were down-regulated in rhabdomyosarcoma tumor tissues. Gene ontology analysis revealed that variations were predominantly enriched in the cell cycle, muscle contraction, muscle system processes, cytoskeleton, nucleotide binding, and cytoskeletal protein binding. The protein-protein interaction network revealed 3274 edges, and 441 nodes were constructed. Ten hub genes were identified; of these, MYBPC2 and MYL1 were significantly up-regulated in rhabdomyosarcoma. Compared with the healthy group, patients with rhabdomyosarcoma exhibiting high expression of MYBPC2 and MYL1 exhibited significantly worse overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: We found differentially expressed genes between rhabdomyosarcoma and healthy tissue samples. MYBPC2 and MYL1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma and therefore deserve further exploration.
