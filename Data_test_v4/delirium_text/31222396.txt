31222396|a|The study is aimed at retrospectively estimating the percentage of inpatients with severe acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) who met the early discharged (ED) criteria adapted from Nathwani et al. (Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2016 Aug;48(2):127-36) and to calculate the number of hospitalization days that could be potentially saved. A retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Florence, Italy. We included all patients admitted for cellulitis and post-surgical infections from 2014 to 2017. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. We a priori defined the following as a risk factor for non-adherence (RFNA): active or on methadone intravenous drug users, homeless, migrants without health care assistance, and patients who need a caregiver to take prescribed medications. One hundred sixty-two subjects were enrolled. Of them, 94 (58.0%) were male, and 113 (69.7%) had cellulitis/erysipelas. A microbiological isolate was obtained in 51 patients (31.4%); Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent (47%). Eighty-four (51.8%) were ED suitable, with 258 (49.0%) patient days potentially saved. Among the 78 not ED suitable patients, the most common reason for prolonged length of stay (LOS) was having at least one RFNA (34.6%). Fourteen (18.0%) had one RFNA. Half of the patients admitted in our hospital met the ED criteria with a sparing close to 50% in terms of hospitalization days. Unstable social and personal factors were the most frequent causes for prolonged LOS. In this selected subset of patients, more recent and easier to administer treatments, including long-acting agents, could be proposed.
