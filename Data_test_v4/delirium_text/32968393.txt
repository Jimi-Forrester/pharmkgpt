32968393|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the anesthetic effects of flurbiprofen axetil combined with propofol on patients with liver cancer receiving microwave ablation. METHODS: Sixty patients (SA grade: I-II) who underwent microwave ablation for liver cancer in our hospital from May 2018 to May 2019 were selected and randomly divided into a study group and a control group (n=30) that were anesthetized through target-controlled infusion of propofol combined with intravenous infusion of flurbiprofen axetil and target-controlled infusion of propofol alone, respectively. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), numerical rating scale (NRS) score, adverse reactions and anesthetic effects (induction time, recovery time) of the two groups were compared before anesthesia (T0), at the beginning of puncture (T1), at the beginning of microwave ablation (T2), at the end of microwave ablation (T3) and one hour after surgery (T4). RESULTS: MAP and HR of the study group were higher than those of the control group (P<0.05) at T2. There was no difference in SpO2 between the two groups (P>0.05). The anesthesia induction time and recovery time of the study group were significantly shorter than those of the control group (P<0.05). There was no difference in the NRS score between the two groups at T1 (P>0.05), but the study group had lower scores at T2-T4 (P<0.05). The incidence rate of postoperative adverse reactions was 13.33% in the study group and 46.67% in the control group, with a significant difference (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Flurbiprofen axetil in combination with propofol exert evident anesthetic effects on patients with liver cancer receiving microwave ablation. The time of preoperative anesthesia induction and postoperative recovery time can be markedly shortened, and intraoperative vital signs can be maintained stable. This method is thus worthy of clinical promotion.
