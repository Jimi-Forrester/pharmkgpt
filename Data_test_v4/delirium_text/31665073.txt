31665073|a|BACKGROUND: Brugmansia suaveolens is the commonest species under the Solanacea ("Angels Trumpet" in English; "Attana" in Sinhalese) plant family in Sri Lanka. It contains alkaloids like scopolamine, atropine and hyoscyamine which can cause an anticholinergic toxindrome. There have been a few reported cases of accidental ingestion of Brugmansia seeds among children, seeds being the most toxic part, but no such reported cases of Brugmansia leaves poisoning among adults. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old-female Sinhalese presented with acute confusion, delirium, and agitation. She had ingested a herbal drink made from leaves of an unknown plant from her garden prior to onset of symptoms. She had urinary retention, mydriasis and sinus tachycardia. She was managed supportively with activated charcoal and hydration and the delirium completely resolved within 15 hours. The presented unkown plant leaves were identified as Brugmansia suaveolens. CONCLUSION: Although seeds are the most toxic plant part in most cases of Brugmansia poisoning, leaves also have a significant degree of toxicity. It is important that medical professionals promptly recognize the features of anticholinergic syndrome, and have a high index to suspect Brugmansia poisoning and start prompt treatment. It is also important to improve awareness of toxic plants among the general community to prevent toxicities and fatalities.
