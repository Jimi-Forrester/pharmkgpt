31960401|t|[Construction of Graded Nursing Care Index System for Patients With Alzheimer's Disease].
31960401|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common diseases in older populations. Its main clinical features include cognitive dysfunction, affective disorder, and abnormal mental behavior. Due to the lack of therapeutic drugs, professional care has become an important diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease patients. At present, most Alzheimer's disease patients are cared for at home by relatives or caregivers, and less than l0% of city-based patients receive care in old-age institutions. Due to mixed treatment regimens in the hospital, care services do not necessarily match patient care needs and thus Alzheimer's disease patients do not receive adequate treatment. Developed countries have a mature care system for the elderly, but no graded care model for the elderly with Alzheimer's disease currently exists in China. In this paper, the author draws on the experience of developed countries to construct an index system for the graded care of Alzheimer's disease patients that is suited to conditions in China. This article addresses the burden faced by the elderly with Alzheimer's disease and the current standard of care for the elderly at home and abroad. After explaining the necessity of constructing a care model for the elderly with Alzheimer's disease, the author then explains the practicability of the care system proposed in this study in order to provide a whole-course care model for the mentally impaired elderly in China.
