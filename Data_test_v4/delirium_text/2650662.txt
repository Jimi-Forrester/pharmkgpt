2650662|a|A loss of cortical noradrenergic innervation may contribute to the intellectual deterioration in Alzheimer's disease. To test the hypothesis that noradrenergic replacement may confer symptomatic benefit, a double-blind, placebo-controlled therapeutic trial with clonidine hydrochloride (Catapres), a centrally active noradrenergic receptor agonist, was undertaken in eight patients with the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. No statistically significant changes in cognitive function were found over a range of doses, including those that produced clinically observable side effects. These preliminary results indicate a need for alternative noradrenergic replacement strategies in Alzheimer's disease.
