39183746|a|INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are highly prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are no effective treatments targeting these symptoms. METHODS: To facilitate identification of causative mechanistic pathways, we initiated an effort (NIH: U01AG079850) to collate, harmonize, and analyze all available NPS data (  100,000 samples) of diverse ancestries with whole-genome sequencing data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). RESULTS: This study will generate a genomic resource for Alzheimer's disease with both harmonized whole-genome sequencing and NPS phenotype data that will be publicly available through NIAGADS. Primary analyses will (1) identify novel genetic risk factors associated with NPS in AD, (2) characterize the shared genetic architecture of NPS in AD and primary psychiatric disorders, and (3) assess the role of ancestry effects in the etiology of NPS in AD. DISCUSSION: Expansion of the ADSP to harmonize and refine NPS phenotypes coupled with the proposed core analyses will lay the foundation to disentangle the molecular mechanisms underlying these detrimental symptoms in AD in diverse populations. Highlights: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are highly prevalent in Alzheimer's disease (AD).There are no effective treatments targeting NPS in AD.The current effort aims to collate, harmonize, and analyze all NPS data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project.Core analyses will identify underlying genetic factors and mechanistic pathways.The harmonized genomic and phenotypic data from this initiative will be available through National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site.
