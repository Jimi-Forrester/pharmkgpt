39532785|a|Neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive damage of the nervous system, and neuropathies caused by the neuronal injury are both led to substantial impairments in neural function and quality of life among geriatric populations. Recovery from nerve damage and neurodegenerative diseases present a significant challenge, as the central nervous system (CNS) has limited capacity for self-repair. Investigating mechanism of neurodegeneration and regeneration is essential for advancing our understanding and development of effective therapies for nerve damage and degenerative conditions, which can significantly enhance patient outcomes. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) was first identified as a key mediator of axonal growth and guidance is essential for neurogenesis and neuroregeneration. Phosphorylation as a primary modification approach of CRMP2 facilitates its involvement in numerous physiological processes, including axonal guidance, neuroplasticity, and cytoskeleton dynamics. Prior research on CRMP2 phosphorylation has elucidated its involvement in the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and nerve damage. Pharmacological and genetic interventions that alter CRMP2 phosphorylation have shown the potential to influence neurodegenerative diseases and promote nerve regeneration. Even with decades of research delving into the intricacies of CRMP2 phosphorylation, there remains a scarcity of comprehensive literature reviews addressing this topic. This absence of synthesis and integration of findings hampers the field's progress by preventing a holistic understanding of CRMP2's implications in neurobiology, thereby impeding potential advancements in clinical treatments and interventions. This review intends to compile investigations focused on the role of CRMP2 phosphorylation in both neurodegenerative disease models and injury models to summarizing impacts and offer novel insight for clinical therapies.
