38927446|t|Combination Therapy for Sustainable Fish Oil Products: Improving Cognitive Function with n-3 PUFA and Natural Ingredients.
38927446|a|Long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), are recommended as beneficial dietary supplements for enhancing cognitive function. Although fish oil (FO) is renowned for its abundant n-3 PUFA content, combining FO with other natural products is considered as a viable option to support the sustainable development of FO products. This review aims to provide comprehensive insights into the advanced effects of combining FO or its components of DHA and EPA with natural products on protecting cognitive function. In two double-blind random control trials, no advanced effects were observed for adding curcumin to FO on cerebral function protection. However, 16 week's treatment of FO combined with vitamin E did not yield any advanced effects in cognitive factor scores. Several preclinical studies have demonstrated that combinations of FO with natural products can exhibit advanced effects in addressing pathological components in cognitive impairment, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal survival. In conclusion, evidence from clinical trials for beneficial use of FO and natural ingredients combination is lacking. Greater cohesion is needed between preclinical and clinical data to substantiate the efficacy of FO and natural product combinations in preventing or slowing the progression of cognitive decline.
