39390517|a|BACKGROUND: Interprofessional education is crucial for healthcare students to develop collaborative skills and provide effective patient care. However, opportunities for interprofessional learning are often limited in healthcare curricula. The present study aimed to engage students from different health professions in co-designing an educational resource on delirium recognition and management through an interprofessional lens and explore their experiences of this process. METHODS: Two co-design workshops were conducted with students from medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and occupational therapy programmes at two universities across the island of Ireland. Focus groups were held following these workshops to explore students' experiences of the co-design process. The workshops involved a range of activities, including theme generation, scenario development, resource creation (podcasts, simulations), and focus group discussions. Data from focus groups were analysed thematically. RESULTS: A total of 19 students participated across the two workshops. Three themes were identified: (1) Relationship development, where students identified the benefits of co-creating the resource and valued the flexibility, collaboration, and social aspects of the co-design approach; (2) Interprofessional collaboration, which challenged students' assumptions about other disciplines, fostered teamwork and communication, and highlighted the need for early and continuous interprofessional learning; (3) Professional growth, with students reporting increased confidence in managing delirium, working with other professions, and engaging in novel experiences like podcasting and simulation. CONCLUSIONS: The co-design process facilitated interprofessional collaboration, peer learning, and personal growth among healthcare students. Students appreciated the opportunity to co-create an educational resource while developing interprofessional skills. The study demonstrates the potential of co-design as a methodology for enhancing interprofessional education and promoting effective teamwork in healthcare.
