39340316|t|Prenatal and early life lead exposure induced neurotoxicity.
39340316|a|Lead (Pb) has become a major environmental contaminant. There are several ways in which lead can enter the human body and cause toxic effects on human health. This review focuses on the impact of lead toxicity at prenatal and early life stages and its effect on neurodevelopment. Lead exposure to the developing foetus targets foetal neural stem cells. Hence, it has detrimental effects on developing neural and glial cells, adversely influencing cognition and behaviour. Lead has a profound influence on the movement of calcium ions (Ca2+), which can be attributed to most of the mechanisms by which lead affects neurodevelopment. There is no known safe threshold of lead exposure for children. Lead can affect foetal neurodevelopment leading to various neurological disorders, and neurotoxic effects on behavioural and cognitive outcomes. In this review, we discuss prenatal and early-life lead exposure, its mechanism, and consequences for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease in later stages of life. This review further highlights the importance of lead exposure during pregnancy and lactation periods as well as early development of the child in understanding the extent of lead-induced neurological damage to the foetus/children and the associated future risks.
