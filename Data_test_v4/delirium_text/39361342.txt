39361342|a|BACKGROUND: Pressure injury (PI) is a significant health concern among older inpatients, particularly in regions with diverse ethnic populations. Understanding the epidemiological characteristics and preventive measures is crucial for improving patient outcomes. PURPOSE: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics, prevention status, and influencing factors of pressure injury (PI) in older inpatients of Zhuang and Han nationality in Guangxi, China. METHODS: A total of 2206 inpatients age 60 years or older in 2 class III grade A general hospitals in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region between April 1, 2021, and May 27, 2021, were included in this cross-sectional study. Epidemiological characteristics-including age, sex, educational background, race, ethnicity, and hospitalization information-were collected using a general information questionnaire designed by the researchers. The PI risk factors were evaluated using the Braden Scale. Prevention status was assessed using the Epidemiology and Prevention Skin Injuries in the Elderly Scale and Skin Injury Survey Scale. RESULTS: Of the total 2206 patients included in the study, 555 (25.16%) were of Zhuang nationality and 1651 (74.84%) were of Han nationality. The overall PI incidence was 2.58%, with PI prevalence of 1.80% and 2.85% in Zhuang and Han patients, respectively. The main influencing factor for PI in Zhuang patients was caregivers (P < .05), whereas in Han patients the main influencing factors were urinary conditions, Alzheimer disease, sedatives, and antihypertensive drugs (P < .05). CONCLUSION: The PI prevalence rates were similar in both ethnic groups. Health care staff in high-risk departments for PI must remain vigilant and take appropriate action.
