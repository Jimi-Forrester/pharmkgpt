34277276|t|Forehead Regional Oxygen Saturation (rSO2)-Related Ear-Level Arterial Pressure and Lower Thigh rSO2 in the Steep Trendelenburg Position with CO2 Pneumoperitoneum and the Beach Chair Position.
34277276|a|Introduction Regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) reflects tissue perfusion. This observational study aimed to examine the change in the forehead and lower thigh rSO2 associated with intraoperative posture, anesthesia regimen, or mean arterial pressure (mAP) at heart and external auditory meatus (ear) levels. Methods Patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in the Trendelenburg position at 30  with pneumoperitoneum (TPP) or arthroscopic shoulder surgery in the beach chair position at 70  (BCP) under desflurane-remifentanil (D/R) or propofol-remifentanil (P/R) anesthesia were examined. Bilateral forehead and lower thigh rSO2 values and mean radial artery pressure were measured simultaneously at heart and ear levels. Results In TPP, there were no differences under anesthesia regimens in the forehead or lower thigh rSO2change, although one patient with an absolute lower thigh rSO2 of <=50% in the lithotomy position complained of transient limb pain. No correlation was observed between rSO2 and mAP. In BCP, forehead rSO2 decreased and lower thigh rSO2 increased under either of the anesthesia regimens. The coefficient of correlation between forehead rSO2 andheart-level and ear-level mAP was 0.341 and 0.236, respectively. Conclusions There were no differences under anesthesia regimens in the changes of forehead rSO2 and lower thigh rSO2. In TPP, significant changes in forehead rSO2 and lower thigh rSO2 were not observed. Monitoring lower thigh rSO2 might be useful for preventing lower extremity pain. In BCP, forehead rSO2 decreased and lower thigh rSO2 increased from the supine position to the BCP. To prevent brain damage, anesthesiologists should pay attention to heart- and ear-level mAP.
