32789234|t|Association Between Early Rehabilitation for Mechanically Ventilated Intensive Care Unit Patients and Oral Ingestion.
32789234|a|OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the association between early rehabilitation for mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients and oral ingestion. METHOD: Among 1055 consecutive patients who were transported to the study facility via ambulance, newly admitted to the ICU, and treated with rehabilitation during hospitalization, 234 were included in the current study. The patients were allocated to early rehabilitation and control groups to retrospectively examine the proportion able to orally ingest three meals per day, the period needed to achieve such independence, and course-related factors. RESULTS: A total of 77 matched pairs were selected using propensity score matching. Analysis using the Kaplan-Meier estimator revealed that the early rehabilitation group needed a markedly shorter period to achieve oral ingestion of three meals per day. There were significant differences between the groups in the periods from hospital admission to first physical therapy and to mobilization as well as differences in the frequency of delirium. CONCLUSION: Early rehabilitation for mechanically ventilated ICU patients may facilitate earlier mobilization. It may also shorten the period needed to achieve oral ingestion of three meals per day by preventing complications such as delirium.
