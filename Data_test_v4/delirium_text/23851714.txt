23851714|a|The interaction of amyloid beta-proteins (Abetas) with membrane lipids has been postulated as an early event in Abeta fibril formation in Alzheimer's disease. We evaluated the effects of several putative bioactive Abetas and gangliosides on neural stem cells (NSCs) isolated from embryonic mouse brains or the subventricular zone of adult mouse brains. Incubation of the isolated NSCs with soluble Abeta1-40 alone did not cause any change in the number of NSCs, but soluble Abeta1-42 increased their number. Aggregated Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 increased the number of NSCs but soluble and aggregated Abeta25-35 decreased the number. Soluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 did not affect the number of apoptotic cells but aggregated Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 did. When NSCs were treated with a combination of GM1 or GD3 and soluble Abeta1-42, cell proliferation was enhanced, indicating that both GM1 and GD3 as well as Abetas are involved in promoting cell proliferation and survival of NSCs. These observations suggest the potential of beneficial effects of using gangliosides and Abetas for promoting NSC proliferation.
