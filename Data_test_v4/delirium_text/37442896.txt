37442896|a|Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) due to injury of the myelin sheath by immune cells. The clotting factor fibrinogen is involved in the pathogenesis of MS by triggering microglia and the progress of neuroinflammation. Fibrinogen level is correlated with MS severity; consequently, inhibition of the fibrinogen cascade may reduce MS neuropathology. Thus, this review aimed to clarify the potential role of fibrinogen in the pathogenesis of MS and how targeting of fibrinogen affects MS neuropathology. Accumulation of fibrinogen in the CNS may occur independently or due to disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in MS. Fibrinogen acts as transduction and increases microglia activation which induces the progression of inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal injury. Besides, brain fibrinogen impairs the remyelination process by inhibiting the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. These findings proposed that fibrinogen is associated with MS neuropathology through interruption of BBB integrity, induction of neuroinflammation, and demyelination with inhibition of the remyelination process by suppressing oligodendrocytes. Therefore, targeting of fibrinogen and/or CD11b/CD18 receptors by metformin and statins might decrease MS neuropathology. In conclusion, inhibiting the expression of CD11b/CD18 receptors by metformin and statins may decrease the pro-inflammatory effect of fibrinogen on microglia which is involved in the progression of MS.
