32848054|a|Increased neural stem cell (NSC) quiescence is a major determinant of age-related regenerative decline in the adult hippocampus. However, a coextensive model has been proposed in which division-coupled conversion of NSCs into differentiated astrocytes restrict the stem cell pool with age. Here we report that age-related loss of the posttranslational modification, O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), in NSCs promotes a glial fate switch. We detect an age-dependent decrease in NSC O-GlcNAc levels coincident with decreased neurogenesis and increased gliogenesis in the mature hippocampus. Mimicking an age-related loss of NSC O-GlcNAcylation in young mice reduces neurogenesis, increases astrocyte differentiation, and impairs associated cognitive function. Using RNA-sequencing of primary NSCs following decreased O-GlcNAcylation, we detected changes in the STAT3 signaling pathway indicative of glial differentiation. Moreover, using O-GlcNAc-specific mass spectrometry analysis of the aging hippocampus, together with an in vitro site-directed mutagenesis approach, we identify loss of STAT3 O-GlcNAc at Threonine 717 as a driver of astrocyte differentiation. Our data identify the posttranslational modification, O-GlcNAc, as a key molecular regulator of regenerative decline underlying an age-related NSC fate switch.
