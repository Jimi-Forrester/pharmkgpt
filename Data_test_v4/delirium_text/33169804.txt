33169804|a|It proved that the most destructive effects of the toxic Al3+ ion on the human nervous system and disease that are involved with this system, such as Alzheimer's. The development of solid-state electrodes is still in its infancy during the sensor-based detection methods for Al3+. Hence, in this study, a novel flexible ITO/PET-based electrochemical solid-state sensor was designed and constructed. Modification of the surface of electrode bedding was done by layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of Mg-Al LDH. nanoplatelets along with alizarin red S (ARS) in an interconnected matrix film. In the molecular design of sensing base of the electrode, the electroactive organic units (ARS molecules) present in the ITO/PET-layered (ARS/LDHs)n matrix are involved in electrochemical reactions when exposed to the target molecule (Al3+ ion), so the electrochemical changes of the new formed Al-chelated system are detectable. This type of sensor is used for sensitive and selective detection of Al3+. The minimum sheet resistance, morphology and high electrocatalytic activity of the modified matrix film are obtained in the fifth cycle of LbL assembly technique. In this electrochemical sensor, both electrochemical and optical methods were detected with high sensitivity and selectivity of Al3+, so that in a cyclic voltammetry electrochemical method, the lower detection limit of 10.1 nM with a linear range of [0.2-120 muM] was obtained compared to the fluorescence-based optical method.
