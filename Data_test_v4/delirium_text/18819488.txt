18819488|t|[COX plays a pivotal role in the progressive neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases].
18819488|a|Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the major target of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Since its discovery in the early 1990s, COX has been identified as a major player in inflammatory reactions. "neuroinflammation" is triggered and sustained by activation of resident cells, particularly microglia. Intensive researches have been made in the last decade concerning the COX pathway and its effect on microglial activation as well as other processes involved in neurondegeneration. This article reviewed new data in this area, focusing on three major neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). By highlighting current knowledge in this field, it may reveal novel insight into disease mechanisms and help to design better therapies for these disorders.
