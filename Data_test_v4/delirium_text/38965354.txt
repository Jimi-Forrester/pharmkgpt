38965354|a|The COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge healthcare systems globally, necessitating advanced tools for clinical decision support. Amidst the complexity of COVID-19 symptomatology and disease severity prediction, there is a critical need for robust decision support systems to aid healthcare professionals in timely and informed decision-making. In response to this pressing demand, we introduce BayesCovid, a novel decision support system integrating Bayesian network models and deep learning techniques. BayesCovid automates data preprocessing and leverages advanced computational methods to unravel intricate patterns in COVID-19 symptom dynamics. By combining Bayesian networks and Bayesian deep learning models, BayesCovid offers a comprehensive solution for uncovering hidden relationships between symptoms and predicting disease severity. Experimental validation demonstrates BayesCovid 's high prediction accuracy (83.52-98.97%). Our work represents a significant stride in addressing the urgent need for clinical decision support systems tailored to the complexities of managing COVID-19 cases. By providing healthcare professionals with actionable insights derived from sophisticated computational analysis, BayesCovid aims to enhance clinical decision-making, optimise resource allocation, and improve patient outcomes in the ongoing battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.
