33842888|t|Cholate Conjugated Polymeric Amphiphiles as Efficient Artificial Ionophores.
33842888|a|A family of amphiphilic copolymers containing hydrophobic cholate pendants has been prepared by copolymerization of cholic acid-based monomer 2-(methacryloxy)-ethyl cholate (MAECA) with polyethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA). The polymers differ for the content of MAECA that increases from 0 to 35%. The copolymers partition within liposomes and display potent ionophoric activity forming large pores in the membrane and allowing the leakage of small inorganic ions (H+, Na+) and of large polar organic molecules (calcein). Their activity is strictly correlated to the content of cholic acid subunits, increasing as the fraction of cholate moiety increases.
