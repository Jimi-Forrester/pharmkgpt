37559042|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is a chronic, progressive, and neurodegenerative brain discomfort that causes the be damage to brain cells. Although there is no definitive treatment for AD, various drug treatments are used to reduce and control the symptoms of the disease. Developed for the treatment of mild-stage Alzheimer's patients, Aducanumab is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the past two decades. However, the cost is very high and, in many countries, Aducanumab has not been approved due to insufficient clinical efficacy and lack of evidence yet. This study aims to analyze the cost-effectiveness of Aducanumab, which was developed for the treatment of mild-stage AD, from the patient's perspective. METHODS: In the study, the Markov model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of Aducanumab compared to Standard of Care (SoC) therapy over a 5-year horizon. Cost and effectiveness data were taken from the literature. In the study, the discount rate was determined as 6%. The results were presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which represents the cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The results were retested with a one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) due to possible uncertainties in the research parameters. The results were presented with the tornado diagram and the scatter plots. RESULTS: With the Markov model, the total costs of Aducanumab and SoC treatments over a 5-year horizon were found to be 98.068 $ and 21.292 $, respectively. Aducanumab treatment had an incremental gain of 0.64 QALY and an incremental cost of 76.776 $ compared to the SoC treatment. The ICER value, which shows the additional cost per QALY of Aducanumab, was 119.408 $/QALY. As a result of the study, it was determined that Aducanumab was not cost-effective when compared to SoC treatment. Sensitivity analysis results showed stability against uncertainties. Aducanumab was confirmed not to be cost-effective with its current price and potential clinical benefit. CONCLUSION: The result of the research is considered important in terms of providing evidence-based information on the cost-effectiveness of Aducanumab in Turkey. However, further, research is needed to evaluate Aducanumab's clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness.
