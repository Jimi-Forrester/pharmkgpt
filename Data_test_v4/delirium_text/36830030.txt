36830030|a|Oxidative stress that can lead to oxidation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is considered a key feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD), influencing the ability of Abeta to assemble into beta-sheet rich fibrils that are commonly found in senile plaques of AD patients. The present study aims at investigating the fallouts of Abeta oxidation on the assembly properties of the Abeta peptide. To accomplish this, we performed kinetics and analysis on an oxidized Abeta (oxAbeta) peptide, resulting from the attack of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are formed by the biologically relevant Cu/Abeta/dioxygen/ascorbate system. oxAbeta was still able to assemble but displayed ill-defined and small oligomeric assemblies compared to the long and thick beta-sheet rich fibrils from the non-oxidized counterpart. In addition, oxAbeta does affect the assembly of the parent Abeta peptide. In a mixture of the two peptides, oxAbeta has a mainly kinetic effect on the assembly of the Abeta peptide and was able to slow down the formation of Abeta fibril in a wide pH range [6.0-7.4]. However, oxAbeta does not change the quantity and morphology of the Abeta fibrils formed to a significant extent. In the presence of copper or zinc di-cations, oxAbeta assembled into weakly-structured aggregates rather than short, untangled Cu-Abeta fibrils and long untangled Zn-Abeta fibrils. The delaying effect of oxAbeta on metal altered Abeta assembly was also observed. Hence, our results obtained here bring new insights regarding the tight interconnection between (i) ROS production leading to Abeta oxidation and (ii) Abeta assembly, in particular via the modulation of the Abeta assembly by oxAbeta. It is the first time that co-assembly of oxAbeta and Abeta under various environmental conditions (pH, metal ions ...) are reported.
