28323038|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is essential to physiological processes such as synapse formation and neural plasticity. Sequential proteolysis of APP by beta- and gamma-secretases generates amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), the main component of senile plaques in Alzheimer Disease. Alternative APP cleavage by alpha-secretase occurs within Abeta domain, releasing soluble alpha-APP (sAPPalpha), a neurotrophic fragment. Among other functions, sAPPalpha is important to synaptogenesis, neural survival and axonal growth. APP and sAPPalpha levels are increased in models of neuroplasticity, which suggests an important role for APP and its metabolites, especially sAPPalpha, in the rearranging brain. In this work we analyzed the effects of monocular enucleation (ME), a classical model of lesion-induced plasticity, upon APP content, processing and also in secretases levels. Besides, we addressed whether alpha-secretase activity is crucial for retinotectal remodeling after ME. Our results showed that ME induced a transient reduction in total APP content. We also detected an increase in alpha-secretase expression and in sAPP production concomitant with a reduction in Abeta and beta-secretase contents. These data suggest that ME facilitates APP processing by the non-amyloidogenic pathway, increasing sAPPalpha levels. Indeed, the pharmacological inhibition of alpha-secretase activity reduced the axonal sprouting of ipsilateral retinocollicular projections from the intact eye after ME, suggesting that sAPPalpha is necessary for synaptic structural rearrangement. Understanding how APP processing is regulated under lesion conditions may provide new insights into APP physiological role on neural plasticity.
