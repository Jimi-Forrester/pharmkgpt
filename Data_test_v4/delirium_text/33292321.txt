33292321|a|BACKGROUND: Ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer), a representative Chinese herbal medicine, can improve the body's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity. Recently, scientists have shifted emphasis towards the initial stages of different malignant diseases-corresponding organ fibrosis and explored the essential role of P. ginseng in the treatment of fibrotic diseases. MAIN BODY: In the first instance, the review generalizes the molecular mechanisms and common therapeutic methods of fibrosis. Next, due to the convenience and safety of individual medication, the research progress of ginseng extract and formulas in treating liver fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, myocardial fibrosis, and renal fibrosis has been systematically summarized. Finally, we describe active ingredients isolated from P. ginseng for their outstanding anti-fibrotic properties and further reveal the potential therapeutic prospect and limitations of P. ginseng in fibrotic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: P. ginseng can be regarded as a valuable herbal medicine against fibrous tissue proliferation. Ginseng extract, derived formulas and monomers can inhibit the abundant deposition of extracellular matrix which caused by repeated damage and provide protection for fibrotic organs. Although the molecular mechanisms such as transforming growth factor beta signal transduction have been confirmed, future studies should still focus on exploring the underlying mechanisms of P. ginseng in treating fibrotic disease including the therapeutic targets of synergistic action of multiple components in P. ginseng. Moreover, it is also necessary to carry out clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of P. ginseng in combination with common fibrosis drugs.
