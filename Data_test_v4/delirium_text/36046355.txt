36046355|t|Engineered phosphorus dendrimers as powerful non-viral nanoplatforms for gene delivery: a great hope for the future of cancer therapeutics.
36046355|a|During the past two decades, tremendous progress has been made in the dendrimer-based delivery of therapeutic molecules including, for instance, small molecules, macromolecules, and genes. This review deals with recent successes in the development of promising biocompatible phosphorus dendrimers, a specific type of dendrimer, to deliver genes to treat cancers.
