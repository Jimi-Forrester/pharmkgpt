11893840|a|There is growing evidence for a role of apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent findings suggest an increased susceptibility of lymphocytes to apoptosis in AD. To prove the hypothesis of systemic alterations in the apoptotic balance in AD, serum and cerebrospinal fluid levels of soluble CD95, which is known to mediate apoptosis, were measured. In the serum, AD patients exhibited significantly higher levels of CD95 than the controls (p = 0.017), suggesting an involvement of peripheral markers in AD.
