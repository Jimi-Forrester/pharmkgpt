37354773|a|Alzheimer's disease, a primary neurodegenerative condition, predominantly impacts the elderly and pre-elderly population. This progressive neurological disorder is characterized by an array of symptoms including memory loss, cognitive decline, and various physiological and psychological disturbances, significantly compromising the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. Recent advancements in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology have catalyzed research in AI-enhanced diagnostics for Alzheimer's disease, fostering optimism for early detection and timely interventions. This progress has paved the way for the development of sophisticated algorithms and models adept at analyzing complex brain imaging data, thereby augmenting diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This advancement fuels optimism regarding the transformative potential of AI-driven diagnostics in revolutionizing Alzheimer's disease management, with the prospect of facilitating more effective treatment strategies and improved patient outcomes. The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of recent developments in deep learning methodologies applied to brain MRI images for the classification of various stages of Alzheimer's disease, with a particular emphasis on early diagnosis. Furthermore, this review underscores the limitations of current research, discussing potential challenges and future research directions in this dynamic field.
