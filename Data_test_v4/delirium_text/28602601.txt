28602601|a|INTRODUCTION: The identification of novel biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) could provide key biological insights and permit targeted preclinical prevention. We investigated circulating metabolites associated with incident dementia and AD using metabolomics. METHODS: Plasma levels of 217 metabolites were assessed in 2067 dementia-free Framingham Offspring Cohort participants (mean age = 55.9 +- 9.7 years; 52.4% women). We studied their associations with future dementia and AD risk in multivariate Cox models. RESULTS: Ninety-three participants developed incident dementia (mean follow-up = 15.6 +- 5.2 years). Higher plasma anthranilic acid levels were associated with greater risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.15-1.70]; P = 8.08 x 10-4). Glutamic acid (HR = 1.38; 95% CI = [1.11-1.72]), taurine (HR = 0.74; 95% CI = [0.60-0.92]), and hypoxanthine (HR = 0.74; 95% CI = [0.60-0.92]) levels also showed suggestive associations with dementia risk. DISCUSSION: We identified four biologically plausible, candidate plasma biomarkers for dementia. Association of anthranilic acid implicates the kynurenine pathway, which modulates glutamate excitotoxicity. The associations with hypoxanthine and taurine strengthen evidence that uric acid and taurine may be neuroprotective.
