39324088|t|Delirium in Lower Limb Trauma: The Incidence and Risk Factors in a Prospective Observational Study.
39324088|a|Background: Delirium poses a significant challenge in musculoskeletal trauma patients, particularly the elderly, contributing to elevated morbidity and mortality. Despite unclear pathogenesis, various risk factors have been identified. This prospective observational study, conducted in a tertiary center, aims to estimate delirium incidence and identify associated risk factors in adult patients undergoing lower limb trauma surgeries. Methods: Between August 2021 and December 2022, 150 patients with lower limb trauma admitted for surgery were included. Initial assessments recorded Mini-Mental State Examination scores, Injury Severity Scores, and potential risk factors. Confusion Assessment Method scoring done preoperatively (excluding emergencies) and postoperatively on days 2 and 5 or at discharge. Daily delirium screening utilized Nursing 4-Abbreviated Trauma score, with severity assessed using CAM-Severity score. Risk factor analysis categorized patients into Group A (delirium) and Group B (non-delirium), with primary endpoint being delirium occurrence. Results: The study revealed a 10% delirium incidence. Delirium severity ranged from mild to severe. The median age (in years) was 79 vs 46 in delirium and non-delirium group respectively. Delirium patients had longer hospital stay (13 vs 8, p value 0.011). Similarly, factors like female gender, delayed surgery, hyponatremia, hypoproteinaemia, increased injury severity, midazolam use during induction, multiple blood transfusions, and heightened postoperative pain intensity were found significant (p value < 0.05). Conclusions: This study enhances our understanding of delirium in lower limb trauma patients undergoing surgeries. Identified risk factors offer insights for targeted interventions, emphasizing the need for comprehensive preoperative assessments and management strategies to reduce delirium incidence and improve patient outcomes.
