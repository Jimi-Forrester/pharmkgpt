38140461|t|Assessment of Chemical Composition and In Vitro Antioxidant, Antidiabetic, Anticholinesterase and Microbial Virulence-Quenching Effects of Salad Burnet (Sanguisorba minor L.) Harvested from Algeria.
38140461|a|Sanguisorba minor is a medicinal vegetable used in seasoning desserts, juices, and beverages. An evaluation of the total flavonoid, phenolic, tannin and anthocyanin contents indicated that these classes of compounds are distributed variably in the different fractions. In summary, the HPLC-DAD analyses enabled the identification and quantification of thirteen phenolic compounds in an ethyl acetate extract (EAE), nine in a dichloromethane extract (DCME), seven in an aqueous extract (AQE) and four in a butanol extract (BE). Rutin was the most abundant phenolic compound in the BE (278.4 +- 1.20 microg/g) and AQE (32.87 +- 0.23 microg/g) fractions, while apigenin was the most abundant in the DCME (84.75 +- 0.60 microg/g) and EAE (156.8 +- 0.95 microg/g) fractions. The presence of phenolic compounds in the fractions conferred good antioxidant capacity, especially the EAE and DCME fractions, which both exhibited higher antioxidant effects than BHA and alpha-tocopherol in DPPH  and CUPRAC assays. Additionally, in the ABTS + assay, EAE (IC50 = 9.27 +- 0.33 microg/mL) was more active than alpha-tocopherol (IC50 = 35.50 +- 0.55 microg/mL), and BHA (IC50 = 12.70 +- 0.10 microg/mL). At 200 microg/mL, the fractions inhibited acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase as well as alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, indicating that they can slow neurodegeneration and hyperglycemia. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 0.312 mg/mL to 1.25 mg/mL, and fractions showed good biofilm inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The extracts exhibited good violacein inhibition in Chromobacterium violaceum CV12472 and Chromobacterium violaceum CV026, despite the supply of external acyl-homoserine lactone to CV026. The antioxidant, quorum-sensing, antibiofilm and enzyme inhibition attributes indicate the potential for the application of S. minor as a food preservative.
