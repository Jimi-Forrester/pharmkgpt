16866908|a|The pathology of Alzheimer's disease is closely connected with lipid metabolism. Processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is sensitive to membrane alterations in levels of cholesterol and gangliosides. As cholesterol and gangliosides are major components of rafts and BACE I and gamma-secretase are supposed to be localized to rafts there might be a yet unknown biological function underlying this connection. Increasing evidence shows a close connection between cholesterol homeostasis and APP processing and Abeta production respectively. We measured membrane fluidity by anisotropy determination, isolated detergent resistant membrane (DRM) fractions from membrane preparations and determined cholesterol content of these fractions by a coupled enzymatic assay. We found membrane fluidity to be changed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) PS1/2 -/- along with altered cholesterol content in DRM fraction of these cells. In addition, total ganglioside levels were enhanced in absence of presenilin (PS).
