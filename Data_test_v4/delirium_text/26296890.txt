26296890|t|Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) Metabolites APP Intracellular Fragment (AICD), Abeta42, and Tau in Nuclear Roles.
26296890|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolites (amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides) and Tau are the main components of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the two histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. Consequently, intense research has focused upon deciphering their physiological roles to understand their altered state in Alzheimer disease pathophysiology. Recently, the impact of APP metabolites (APP intracellular fragment (AICD) and Abeta) and Tau on the nucleus has emerged as an important, new topic. Here we discuss (i) how AICD, Abeta, and Tau reach the nucleus and how AICD and Abeta control protein expression at the transcriptional level, (ii) post-translational modifications of AICD, Abeta, and Tau, and (iii) what these three molecules have in common.
