38302317|a|In their recent Nature paper, Oh et al. use 4979 plasma proteins collected across multiple cohorts, publicly available gene expression data, and machine learning models to identify 11 organ-specific aging scores that are linked to organ-specific disease and mortality risk, including heart failure, cognitive decline, and Alzheimer's disease.
