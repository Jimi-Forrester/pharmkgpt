30126150|t|Synthesis, Spectroscopic Analysis and Assessment of the Biological Activity of New Hydrazine and Hydrazide Derivatives of 3-Formylchromone.
30126150|a|The hydrazine and hydrazide derivatives of benzo-gamma-pyrones with fluorine substituents remain an unexplored group of chemical compounds. This preliminary study reports the synthesis, structural assessment, initial microbiological screening and biological testing of the synthesized compounds on cell lines using the XTT-assay. A series of 10 novel hydrazine and hydrazide derivatives of 3-formylchromone were synthesized and their structures determined. Structural assessment consisted of elemental analysis, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MS and crystallographic studies. Antimicrobial activity was tested on standard strains representing different groups of microorganisms. The tested compounds were found to inhibit microbial growth. Concentrations of 0.01-1250 micromol/L were found to influence cell proliferation, demonstrating antiproliferative and stimulation of proliferation against two cell lines: the L929 cell line (mouse fibroblast cell line) and the EA.hy926 cell line (the human umbilical vein, somatic cell hybrid).
