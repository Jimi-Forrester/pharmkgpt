10637937|t|[Neuropsychological aspects of Alzheimer's disease].
10637937|a|This analysis is centered on the study of cognitive disorders in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), mainly for major neuropsychological functions. We insist on the heterogeneity of the clinical picture especially in the early stages of the illness, when deficits of episodic memory and executive functions are prevalent. We consider that studying early stages of the illness is necessary to delineate the diagnostic signs, to validate the new therapeutic experiments, to predict stages of decline.
