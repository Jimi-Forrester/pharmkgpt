39109032|a|BACKGROUND: Aortic dissection is the deadliest disease of the cardiovascular system. Type B aortic dissection accounts for 30%-60% of aortic dissections and is mainly treated by endovascular repair of thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR). However, patients are prone to various complications after surgery, with central nervous system injury being the most common, which seriously affects their prognosis and increases the risk of disability and death. Therefore, exploring the risk factors of central nervous system injury after TEVAR can provide a basis for its prevention and control. AIM: To investigate the risk factors for central nervous system injury after the repair of a thoracic endovascular aneurysm with type B aortic dissection. METHODS: We enrolled 306 patients with type B aortic dissection who underwent TEVAR at our hospital between December 2019 and October 2022. The patients were categorized into injury (n = 159) and non-injury (n = 147) groups based on central nervous system injury following surgery. The risk factors for central nervous system injury after TEVAR for type B aortic dissection were screened by comparing the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: The Association between age, history of hypertension, blood pH value, surgery, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, postoperative recovery times on the first day after surgery, and arterial partial pressure of oxygen on the first day after surgery differed substantially (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that age, surgery time, history of hypertension, duration of mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit stay were independent risk factors for central nervous system injury after TEVAR of type B aortic dissection (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: For high-risk patients with central nervous system injury after TEVAR of type B aortic dissection, early intervention measures should be implemented to lower the risk of neurological discomfort following surgery in high-risk patients with central nervous system injury after TEVAR for type B aortic dissection.
