37802319|a|It has been illustrated that metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology. Components of MetS including central obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance (IR), and dyslipidemia adversely affect the pathogenesis of AD by different mechanisms including activation of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), inflammatory signaling pathways, neuroinflammation, brain IR, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. MetS exacerbates AD neuropathology, and targeting of molecular pathways in MetS by pharmacological approach could a novel therapeutic strategy in the management of AD in high risk group. However, the underlying mechanisms of these pathways in AD neuropathology are not completely clarified. Therefore, this review aims to elucidate the association between MetS and AD regarding the oxidative and inflammatory mechanistic pathways.
