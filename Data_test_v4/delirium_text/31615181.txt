31615181|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of soothing liver, relieving depression, invigorating spleen and reinforcing blood on reducing delirium in elderly patients with hip fracture. METHODS: From December 2014 to June 2018, 180 elderly patients with hip fracture admitted were divided into treatment group and placebo group according to the order of admission:90 patients in treatment group were treated with Jiawei Xiaoyao Powder(JWXYP), including 32 males and 58 females, with an average age of(72.12+-4.92), involving 67 cases of femoral trochanter fractures and 23 cases of femoral neck fractures; 35 cases underwent dynamic hip screw fixation, 31 cases underwent intramedullary fixation and 24 cases underwent artificial hip replacement. In the placebo group, 90 patients were treated with placebo, including 37 males and 53 females, with an average age of(72.91+-5.43) years old, involving 69 cases of femoral trochanteric fractures and 21 cases of femoral neck fractures, including 37 cases underwent dynamic hip screw fixation, 30 cases underwent intramedullary fixation and 23 cases underwent artificial hip replacement. The age, sex, injury site, intraoperative bleeding volume, postoperative drainage, operation time, anesthesia time, post-operative pain score, post-operative hemoglobin, post-operative CRP, delirium severity(DRS) score and delirium occurrence were observed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: All patients were followed up until delirium returned to normal, postoperative delirium was found in 12 cases (13.33%) in the treatment group and in 39 cases(43.33%) in the placebo group, the treatment group was significantly better than the placebo group. The monitoring indexes of the two groups were compared:post-operative pain score(P=0.002), post-operative hemoglobin(P=0.012), post-operative CRP(P=0.042). CONCLUSIONS: JWXYP can relieve liver depression, invigorate spleen and invigorate blood circulation, reduce pain, inflammatory stimulation and supplement blood volume after operation, and significantly reduce the incidence of delirium after operation.
