37022340|a|Ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal (CLN) genes encode 13 proteins that localize throughout the endomembrane system to regulate a variety of cellular processes. In humans, mutations in CLN genes cause a devastating form of neurodegeneration called neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), commonly known as Batten disease. Each CLN gene is associated with a specific subtype of the disease that differ from each other in severity and age of onset. The NCLs affect all ages and ethnicities worldwide but primarily affect children. The pathology underlying the NCLs is poorly understood, which has prevented the development of a cure or effective therapy for most subtypes of the disease. A growing body of literature supports the networking of CLN genes and proteins within cells, which aligns with the broadly similar cellular and clinical manifestations among the different subtypes of NCL. Here, all relevant literature is reviewed to provide a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of how CLN genes and proteins are networked in mammalian cells with an aim towards revealing new molecular targets for therapy development. Intriguingly, CLN gene and protein networking extends beyond the NCLs as recent work has linked several CLN genes and proteins to other forms of neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Thus, a deeper understanding of the pathways and cellular processes impacted by mutations in CLN genes will not only strengthen our knowledge of the pathological mechanisms underlying the NCLs but may also provide new insight into related forms of neurodegeneration.
