35196748|t|Reliability and Validity of the Subjective Cognitive Complaints Questionnaire for Parkinson's Disease (SCCQ-PD).
35196748|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) are gaining attention as a self-perceived symptom for cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but there are few suitable tools for assessing SCCs in PD. This study aimed to develop and validate a questionnaire for assessing SCCs in PD, called the Subjective Cognitive Complaints Questionnaire for Parkinson's Disease (SCCQ-PD). METHODS: The SCCQ-PD consists of 12 yes/no questions on subjective cognitive function, and the questionnaire was completed by patients with PD (score-P) and their caregivers (score-C). The cognitive function of patients was examined using comprehensive neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: This study included 73 patients (38 cognitively normal, 25 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 10 demented) and their caregivers. Score-P and score-C had excellent reliability (Kuder-Richardson formula 20 coefficients of 0.893 and 0.931, respectively), and the scores exhibited a strong intercorrelation. Both score-P and score-C were negatively correlated with cognitive performance, and both were excellent in discriminating demented patients from those with normal cognition or MCI (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 and 0.88, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The SCCQ-PD is a reliable tool for assessing SCCs in patients with PD. SCCs measured using the SCCQ-PD are correlated with objective cognitive decline and useful for discriminating demented patients from nondemented patients.
