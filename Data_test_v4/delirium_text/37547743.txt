37547743|a|Widespread neurodegeneration, enlargement of cerebral ventricles, and atrophy of cortical and hippocampal brain structures are classic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prominent macroscopic disturbances to the cytoarchitecture of the AD brain occur alongside changes in the mechanical properties of brain tissue, as reported in recent magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) measurements of human brain mechanics. Whilst MRE has many advantages, a significant shortcoming is its spatial resolution. Higher resolution "cellular scale" assessment of the mechanical alterations to brain regions involved in memory formation, such as the hippocampus, could provide fresh new insight into the etiology of AD. Characterization of brain tissue mechanics at the cellular length scale is the first stepping-stone to understanding how mechanosensitive neurons and glia are impacted by neurodegenerative disease-associated changes in their microenvironment. To provide insight into the microscale mechanics of aging brain tissue, we measured spatiotemporal changes in the mechanical properties of the hippocampus using high resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation tests on acute brain slices from young and aged wild-type mice and the APPNL-G-F mouse model. Several hippocampal regions in APPNL-G-F mice are significantly softer than age-matched wild-types, notably the dentate granule cell layer and the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Interestingly, regional softening coincides with an increase in astrocyte reactivity, suggesting that amyloid pathology-mediated alterations to the mechanical properties of brain tissue may impact the function of mechanosensitive astrocytes. Our data also raise questions as to whether aberrant mechanotransduction signaling could impact the susceptibility of neurons to cellular stressors in their microenvironment.
