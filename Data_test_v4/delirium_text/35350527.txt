35350527|t|A Rare Case of Typhoid Fever in the United States Associated With Travel to Mexico.
35350527|a|Typhoid fever is an infectious febrile illness caused by Salmonella typhi that is rare in the United States but is endemic in regions of South Asia and Africa. Typhoid fever initially presents with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, malaise, and abdominal pain. We describe a case of typhoid fever in an adult in the United States with recent travel to Mexico. After a nonspecific presentation, the patient developed Faget sign and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed mesenteric adenitis, which prompted additional workup. Diagnosis of typhoid fever was established by blood culture and the patient was treated with ciprofloxacin.
