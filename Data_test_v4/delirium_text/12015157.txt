12015157|a|In this study, free radical scavenging abilities of ferulic acid in relation to its structural characteristics were evaluated in solution, cultured neurons, and synaptosomal systems exposed to hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals. Cultured neuronal cells exposed to the peroxyl radical initiator AAPH die in a dose-response manner and show elevated levels of protein carbonyls. The presence of ferulic acid or similar phenolic compounds, however, greatly reduces free radical damage in neuronal cell systems without causing cell death by themselves. In addition, synaptosomal membrane systems exposed to oxidative stress by hydroxyl and peroxyl radical generators show elevated levels of oxidation as indexed by protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and ROS measurement. Ferulic acid greatly attenuates these changes, and its effects are far more potent than those obtained for vanillic, coumaric, and cinnamic acid treatments. Moreover, ferulic acid protects against free radical mediated changes in conformation of synaptosomal membrane proteins as monitored by EPR spin labeling techniques. The results presented in this study suggest the importance of naturally occurring antioxidants such as ferulic acid in therapeutic intervention methodology against neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease in which oxidative stress is implicated.
