35214929|t|Graphene Oxide/Silver Nanoparticles Platforms for the Detection and Discrimination of Native and Fibrillar Lysozyme: A Combined QCM and SERS Approach.
35214929|a|We propose a sensing platform based on graphene oxide/silver nanoparticles arrays (GO/AgNPs) for the detection and discrimination of the native and toxic fibrillar forms of an amyloid-prone protein, lysozyme, by means of a combination of Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) and Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) measurements. The GO/AgNPs layer system was obtained by Langmuir-Blodgett assembly of the silver nanoparticles followed by controlled adsorption of GO sheets on the AgNPs array. The adsorption of native and fibrillar lysozyme was followed by means of QCM, the measurements provided the kinetics and the mechanism of adsorption as a function of protein concentration as well as the mass and thickness of the adsorbed protein on both nanoplatforms. The morphology of the protein layer was characterized by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy experiments on Thioflavine T-stained samples. SERS experiments performed on arrays of bare AgNPs and of GO coated AgNP after native, or fibrillar, lysozyme adsorption allowed for the discrimination of the native form and toxic fibrillar structure of lysozyme. Results from combined QCM/SERS studies indicate a general construction paradigm for an efficient sensing platform with high selectivity and low detection limit for native and amyloid lysozyme.
