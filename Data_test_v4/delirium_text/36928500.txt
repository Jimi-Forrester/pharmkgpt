36928500|a|INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted to observe the effect of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on the postoperative sleep quality of patients undergoing gastrointestinal tumor surgery and to verify the possible mechanism. METHODS: Eighty-three patients were allocated to the TEAS or Sham group. Patients in the TEAS group received TEAS treatment (disperse-dense waves; frequency, 2/100 Hz) on bilateral Shenmen (HT7), Neiguan (PC6) and Zusanli (ST36) points for 30 min each time, total three times in the perioperative period. In the Sham group, electrodes were placed; however, no current was given. Sleep quality was assessed on the day before surgery (P1) and the first and third days after surgery (D1 and D3) using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Postoperative pain was assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) 72 h postoperatively. The incidences of abdominal distension, dizziness, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pulmonary complications were recorded. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and the expression of key factors of oxidative stress and key molecules of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element (Nrf2/ARE) signal pathway were measured. RESULTS: TEAS ameliorated sleep quality at D1 and D3 (PSQI P < 0.05, AIS P < 0.05) and decreased postoperative pain as demonstrated by lower VAS scores compared to the Sham group (P < 0.05). The incidences of abdominal distension and PONV were also lower in the TEAS group. Markers of oxidative stress were increased (P < 0.05), and the serum concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly lower in the TEAS group. The key mediators of the Nrf2/ARE pathway were enhanced after TEAS. CONCLUSION: Perioperative TEAS improved postoperative sleep quality, reduced postoperative pain and alleviated postoperative adverse effects in patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrointestinal tumor surgery resection. This may be associated with activating Nrf2/ARE signal pathway and decreasing its inflammatory actions.
