34063751|a|The role of immunoproteasome (iP) in astroglia, the cellular component of innate immunity, has not been clarified. The results so far indicate that neuroinflammation, a prominent hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, strongly activates the iP subunits expression. Since omega-3 PUFAs possess anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving activity in the brain, we investigated the effect of DHA and EPA on the gene expression of constitutive (beta1 and beta5) and inducible (ibeta1/LMP2 and ibeta5/LMP7) proteasome subunits and proteasomal activity in IL-1beta-stimulated astrocytes. We found that both PUFAs downregulated the expression of IL-1beta-induced the iP subunits, but not the constitutive proteasome subunits. The chymotrypsin-like activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by DHA, and much strongly in the lower concentration by EPA. Furthermore, we established that C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta transcription factors, being the cis-regulatory element of the transcription complex, frequently activated by inflammatory mediators, participate in a reduction in the iP subunits' expression. Moreover, the expression of connexin 43 the major gap junction protein in astrocytes, negatively regulated by IL-1beta was markedly increased in PUFA-treated cells. These findings indicate that omega-3 PUFAs attenuate inflammation-induced hyperactivity of iPs in astrocytes and have a beneficial effect on preservation of interastrocytic communication by gap junctions.
