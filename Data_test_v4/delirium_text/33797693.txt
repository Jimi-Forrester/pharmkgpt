33797693|t|A New Approach to Model Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease by Intracerebroventricular Streptozotocin Injection in APP/PS1 Mice.
33797693|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia among elderly people. Majority of AD cases are sporadic (SAD) with unknown cause. Transgenic animal models closely reflect the familial (genetic) aspect of the disease but not the sporadic type. However, most new drug candidates which are tested positive in transgenic animal models failed in clinical studies so far. Herein, we aim to develop an AD animal model that combines most of the neuropathological features seen in sporadic AD in humans with amyloid plaques observed in transgenic mice. Four-month-old wild-type and APP/PS1 AD mice were given a single intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of 3 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ), a diabetogenic agent. Three weeks later, their cognitive behavior was assessed, and their brain tissues were collected for biochemical and histological analysis. STZ produced cognitive deficits in both non-transgenic mice and AD mice. Biochemical analysis showed a severe decline in synaptic proteins, increase in tau phosphorylation, oxidative stress, disturbed brain insulin signaling with extensive neuroinflammation, and cell death. Significant increase was also observed in the level of the soluble beta amyloid precursor protein (APP) fragments and robust accumulation of amyloid plaques in AD mice compared to the control. These results suggest that STZ ICV treatment causes disturbance in multiple metabolic and cell signaling pathways in the brain that facilitated amyloid plaque accumulation and tau phosphorylation. Therefore, this animal model can be used to evaluate new AD therapeutic agents for clinical translation.
