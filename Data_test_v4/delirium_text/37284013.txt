37284013|t|mHealth in Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe: Context of current health, healthcare status, and demographic structure.
37284013|a|Introduction: The advent of digital systems and global mobile phone availability presents an opportunity for better healthcare access and equity. However, the disparity in the usage and availability of mHealth systems between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has not been explored in relation to current health, healthcare status, and demographics. Objective: This study aimed to compare mHealth system availability and use in SSA and Europe in the above-mentioned context. Methods: The study analyzed health, healthcare status, and demographics in both regions. It assessed mortality, disease burden, and universal health coverage. A systematic narrative review was conducted to thoroughly assess available data on mHealth availability and use, guiding future research in the field. Results: SSA is on the verge of stages 2 and 3 in the demographic transition with a youthful population and high birth rate. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases contribute to high mortality and disease burden, including child mortality. Europe is on the verge of stages 4 and 5 in the demographic transition with low birth and death rates. Europe's population is old, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) pose major health challenges. The mHealth literature adequately covers cardiovascular disease/heart failure, and cancer. However, it lacks approaches for respiratory/enteric infections, malaria, and NCDs. Conclusions: mHealth systems in SSA are underutilized than in Europe, despite alignment with the region's demographics and major health issues. Most initiatives in SSA lack implementation depth, with only pilot tests or small-scale implementations. Europe's reported cases highlight actual implementation and acceptability, indicating a strong implementation depth of mHealth systems.
