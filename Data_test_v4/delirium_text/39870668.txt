39870668|a|It is established that patients hospitalised with COVID-19 often have ongoing morbidity affecting activity of daily living (ADL), employment, and mental health. However, little is known about the relative outcomes in patients with COVID-19 neurological or psychiatric complications. We conducted a UK multicentre case-control study of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 (controls) and those who developed COVID-19 associated acute neurological or psychiatric complications (cases). Among the 651 patients, [362 (55%) cases and 289 (45%) controls], a higher proportion of cases had impairment in ADLs (199 [68.9%] vs 101 [51.8%], OR 2.06, p < 0.0002) and reported symptoms impacting employment (159 [58.2%] vs 69 [35.6%] OR 2.53, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the proportion with depression or anxiety between case and control groups overall. For cases, impairment of ADLs was associated with increased risk in female sex, age > 50 years and hypertension (OR 5.43, p < 0.003, 3.11, p = 0.02, 3.66, p = 0.04). Those receiving either statins or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors had a lower risk of impairment in ADLs (OR 0.09, p = 0.0006, 0.17, p = 0.03). Patients with neurological or psychiatric complications of COVID-19 had worse functional outcomes than those with respiratory COVID-19 alone in terms of ADLs and employment. Female sex, age > 50 years, and hypertension were associated with worse outcomes, and statins or ACE inhibitors with better outcomes.
