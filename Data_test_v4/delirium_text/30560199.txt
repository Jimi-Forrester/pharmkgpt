30560199|a|INTRODUCTION: There is scant literature on the use of opioids among community-dwelling elderly with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). METHODS: We adopted a retrospective, cross-sectional study design using Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data from 2006 to 2013. The study sample included elderly community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries who were diagnosed with chronic pain conditions and had Medicare fee-for-service plans for the entire year. We conducted bivariate chi2 test and multivariate logistic regression to examine the relationship between opioid use and ADRD status. RESULTS: The study sample included 19,347 Medicare beneficiaries; 7.7% of them had ADRD. We found no statistically significant difference in opioid use by ADRD status in the unadjusted analysis; however, controlling for various factors, those with ADRD had lower odds of opioid use (adjusted odds ratio = 0.81, 95% confidence interval = 0.71, 0.93) than those without ADRD. DISCUSSION: This population-based study suggests that elderly Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD and chronic pain conditions may have undertreatment of pain.
