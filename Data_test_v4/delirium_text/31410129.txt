31410129|t|Causes of and treatment options for dislocation following total hip arthroplasty.
31410129|a|The second most common complication following total hip arthroplasty (THA) is dislocation. The majority of dislocations occur early in the post-operative period and are due to either patient-associated or surgical factors. The patient-associated factors that have been implicated as causes of post-operative dislocation include previous surgery, lumbar spine fusion surgery and/or neurological impairment. The surgical factors include surgical approach, component orientation and prosthetic and/or bony impingement. In order to delineate the cause of the hip instability a thorough history and physical and a radiographic assessment (possibly including advanced imaging) needs to be performed. Approximately two thirds of cases are successfully treated; one third of cases will require surgical treatment (e.g., revision arthroplasty (including constrained liners, the use of elevated rim liners and dual mobility implants or trochanteric advancement). In this review, we discuss the causes leading to dislocation following THA and evaluate the different treatment options available.
