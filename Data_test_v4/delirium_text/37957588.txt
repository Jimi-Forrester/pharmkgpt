37957588|a|BACKGROUND: There is a lack of understanding of the mechanisms by which the CNS is injured in multiple sclerosis (MS). Since Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection in SJL/J mice is an established model of progressive disability in MS, and CNS atrophy correlates with progressive disability in MS, we used in vivo MRI to quantify total ventricular volume in TMEV infection. We then sought to identify immunological and virological biomarkers that correlated with increased ventricular size. METHODS: Mice, both infected and control, were followed for 6 months. Cerebral ventricular volumes were determined by MRI, and disability was assessed by Rotarod. A range of immunological and virological measures was obtained using standard techniques. RESULTS: Disability was present in infected mice with enlarged ventricles, while infected mice without enlarged ventricles had Rotarod performance similar to sham mice. Ventricular enlargement was detected as soon as 1 month after infection. None of the immunological and virological measures correlated with the development of ventricular enlargement. CONCLUSIONS: These results support TMEV infection with brain MRI monitoring as a useful model for exploring the biology of disability progression in MS, but they did not identify an immunological or virological correlate with ventricular enlargement.
