25233606|a|The plant family Amaryllidaceae is renowned for its unique alkaloid constituents which possess a significant array of structural diversity. Several of these alkaloids are known for their interesting biological properties, of which galanthamine and pancratistatin have acquired a privileged status due to their relevance in the pharmaceutical arena. In particular, galanthamine represents the first prescription drug emanating from the Amaryllidaceae after its approval by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Following on this commercial success there have been sustained projections for the emergence of an anticancer agent related to pancratistatin due to the potency, selectivity, low toxicity and high tolerability typifying targets of this series of alkaloids. The lycorine series of alkaloids have also garnered widespread interest as cytotoxic agents and were amongst the earliest of the Amaryllidaceae constituents to exhibit such activity. To date over 100 of such naturally-occurring or synthetically-derived alkaloids have been screened for cytotoxic effects against a number of cancer cell lines. This survey examines the cytotoxic properties of lycorine alkaloids, highlights the outcomes of structure-activity relationship orientated studies and affords plausible insights to the mechanistic rationale behind these effects.
