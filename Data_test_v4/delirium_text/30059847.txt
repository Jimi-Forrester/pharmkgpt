30059847|t|Exploring the contribution of visual imagery to scene construction - Evidence from Posterior Cortical Atrophy.
30059847|a|Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) is a rare neurodegenerative syndrome characterised by profound visuoperceptual processing disturbances, attributable to focal parieto-occipital cortical atrophy. Despite relative sparing of the medial temporal lobes, converging evidence reveals significant autobiographical memory impairments in this syndrome, underscoring the crucial role of visual imagery for episodic memory processes. The contribution of visual imagery to complex constructive endeavours, however, remains unclear. Here, we investigated the capacity for atemporal scene construction in 5 well-characterised cases of PCA and contrasted their performance with 10 typical amnestic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and 10 healthy older Control participants. Behavioural data were analysed using case-Control statistics comparing each PCA patient's scene construction scores to the mean scores of AD and Control groups. In keeping with their clinical phenotype, PCA patients demonstrated significant visuoperceptual and episodic memory impairments on standard neuropsychological tasks. Scene construction performance was grossly impaired in PCA, at a level comparable to that observed in the AD group, manifesting in impoverished and spatially fragmented scenes. Structural neuroimaging confirmed prominent grey matter intensity decrease predominantly in posterior cortical regions in PCA, in the absence of frank hippocampal atrophy. Using an a priori motivated region-of-interest approach across all participants, scene construction performance was found to correlate with grey matter intensity in the left angular gyrus, right precuneus, and right hippocampus. This study is the first to reveal compromised scene construction capacity in PCA, extending our understanding of the cognitive profile of this rare syndrome and pointing towards the fundamental contribution of visual imagery to atemporal forms of imagination.
