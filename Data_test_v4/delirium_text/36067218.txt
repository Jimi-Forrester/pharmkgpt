36067218|t|Sustained Improvement in Quality of Patient Handoffs After Orthopaedic Surgery I-PASS Intervention.
36067218|a|PURPOSE: The I-PASS tool has been shown to decrease medical errors in patient handoffs in nonorthopaedic surgery fields. We prospectively studied the implementation of a version of this handoff tool modified for orthopaedic surgery patients in an academic practice at two level I trauma centers. METHODS: This was a prospective study of a multicenter handoff improvement program. Handoffs were evaluated preintervention and at 1, 6, 9, and 18 months postintervention for key data elements defined by I-PASS. Rates of adverse clinical outcomes were compared before and after the handoff intervention. RESULTS: Seven hundred five electronic patient handoffs were analyzed. From preintervention to the 18-month time point, notable improvement was observed in 8 of 9 targeted quality elements. In Poisson regression analysis, adherence to the standardized handoff format was sustained at markedly improved levels throughout all postintervention time points. No statistically significant differences were observed between rates of 30-day readmission, 90-day readmission, urinary tract infection, pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis, surgical site infection, or delirium before and after the intervention. CONCLUSION: Introduction of an orthopaedic-specific I-PASS tool produced sustained adherence from a group of over 50 orthopaedic providers. Objective quality of handoffs improved markedly as defined by the I-PASS standard, and 86% of the providers supported the ongoing use of the tool. Despite the improvement in handoff quality, we were unable to demonstrate a notable change in measured clinical outcomes. Methods for the development and implementation of the orthopaedic-specific I-PASS tool are described. Orthopaedic residency programs should consider using a version of I-PASS to standardize care.
