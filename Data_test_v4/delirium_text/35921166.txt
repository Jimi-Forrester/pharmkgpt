35921166|a|Endothelia determine blood-to-tissue solute delivery, yet glucose transit is poorly understood. To illuminate mechanisms, we tracked [3H]-2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) in human adipose-tissue microvascular endothelial cells. 2-DG uptake was largely facilitated by the glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3. Once in the cytosol, >80% of 2-DG became phosphorylated and ~20% incorporated into glycogen, suggesting that transported glucose is readily accessible to cytosolic enzymes. Interestingly, a fraction of intracellular 2-DG was released over time (15-20% over 30 min) with slower kinetics than for uptake, involving GLUT3. In contrast to intracellular 2-DG, the released 2-DG was largely unphosphorylated. Glucose release involved endoplasmic reticulum-resident translocases/phosphatases and was stimulated by adrenaline, consistent with participation of glycogenolysis and glucose dephosphorylation. Surprisingly, the fluorescent glucose derivative 2-NBD-glucose (2-NBDG) entered cells largely via fluid phase endocytosis and exited by recycling. 2-NBDG uptake was insensitive to GLUT1/GLUT3 inhibition, suggesting poor influx across membranes. 2-NBDG recycling, but not 2-DG efflux, was sensitive to N-ethyl maleimide. In sum, by utilizing radioactive and fluorescent glucose derivatives, we identified two parallel routes of entry: uptake into the cytosol through dedicated glucose transporters and endocytosis. This reveals the complex glucose handling by endothelial cells that may contribute to glucose delivery to tissues.
