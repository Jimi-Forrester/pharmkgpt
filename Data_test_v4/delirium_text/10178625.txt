10178625|t|Cataract, Alzheimer's disease, and other conformational diseases.
10178625|a|Unfolding of proteins was shown to occur in human cataract more than 25 years ago. Recently, the term conformational diseases was applied to a whole group of diseases in which unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate. In this article, common features in the biochemistry and epidemiology of cataract, Alzheimer's disease, and other conformational diseases are explored.
