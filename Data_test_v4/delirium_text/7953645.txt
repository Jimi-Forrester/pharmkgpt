7953645|t|Enhanced neurotrophic activity in Alzheimer's disease cortex is not associated with down-regulation of metallothionein-III (GIF).
7953645|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder for which the pathogenic mechanisms are not well understood. Previous studies demonstrated that extracts prepared from AD brains could increase the survival of rat cortical neurons in vitro. Additional studies indicated that this enhanced neurotrophic activity of AD brain was due to a reduction of a growth inhibitory factor (GIF) that was subsequently shown to be a new member of the metallothionein (MT) gene family, and designated MT-III. The study presented here examined the association between neurotrophic activity and MT-III expression in frontal cortices from eight AD and five control brains, and further characterized the inhibitory activity of MT-III. On average, AD extracts stimulated the survival of approximately 2-fold more rat cortical neurons than control extracts, demonstrating that AD brain possesses elevated neurotrophic activity. When recombinant MTs were added to cultures grown in the presence of brain extract, MT-III but not MT-I had an inhibitory effect on neuron survival, confirming that MT-III is a specific inhibitory factor in this assay. However, in contrast to previous reports, neither MT-III mRNA nor MT-III protein levels were significantly decreased in the AD group. Therefore, the difference in neurotrophic activity between the AD and control brain samples examined in this study is probably not directly mediated by MT-III. These results suggest that MT-III down-regulation is not an important pathogenic event in some cases of AD.
