38195124|a|OBJECTIVES: To observe the accuracy of Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans in evaluating neurological disorders. METHODS: This retrospective research used CT or MRI to diagnose and characterize brain disorders. Patients' records suffering from neurological disorders were considered eligible for inclusion, regardless of the time of appearance of symptoms, the severity of their symptoms, or their final clinical diagnosis. The exclusion criteria for this study involved patients who did not undergo either a CT or MRI scan. A chi-square test was performed to observe the association between the study variables. A total of 3155 cases were analyzed. RESULTS: The most prevalent comorbid was dyslipidemia 670 (21.6%) followed by hypertension 548 (17.6%). Overall brain disorders were confirmed in 2426 (77%) patients. It was observed that half of the patients 1543 (48.9%) were diagnosed with stroke. It was found that the accuracy of CT and MRI was 78% and 74% respectively. The association of modalities, patient type, and gender with the confirmation of diseases was not found significant (p=>0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that CT and MRI were accurate by more than 75% and no difference was between both techniques to detect neurological disorders.
