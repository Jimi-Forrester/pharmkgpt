16466313|t|Late-life depression: a neuropsychiatric approach.
16466313|a|Late-life depression refers to depressive syndromes defined in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and in the International Classification of Diseases that arise in adults older than 65 years of age. Late life depressive syndromes often arise in the context of medical and neurologic disorders. There is a high prevalence of depression in various neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebrovascular disease and frontotemporal dementias. It has been well recognized that late life depression may itself be the presenting symptom of a latent neurodegenerative disorder. Therefore, an accurate diagnosis of late-onset depression may serve to identify a high-risk group that would benefit from initiation of therapies with the goal of delaying or possibly even preventing the onset of dementia.
