37881400|t|Congenital Heart Block and Its Association With Anti-Ro and Anti-La Antibodies in Pregnancy: A Case Report of a Rare Entity and a Review of the Current Evidence.
37881400|a|Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous chronic, multisystem, inflammatory autoimmune disorder with variable clinical features, with its manifestations being attributed to the presence of multiple autoantibodies and their subsequent autoimmune reactions. Multiple organs may be involved, with the kidneys, the joints, and the skin being the most common, increasing maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Our current article describes the case of a 32-year-old primigravida who was referred to our department after the detection of fetal bradycardia and the strong suspicion of an underlying cardiac abnormality. After a detailed fetal and maternal assessment, the diagnosis of SLE-associated fetal congenital heart block was established, and the appropriate management and treatment were provided, factors that led to the uncomplicated delivery and prompt successful management of an otherwise severely affected fetus. Our work, also, includes a detailed review of the accumulated evidence regarding the association between autoantibodies and congenital heart block, the available screening modalities of the condition, and its potential therapeutic interventions.
