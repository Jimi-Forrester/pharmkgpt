36450705|a|Spatially resolved proteomics is an emerging approach for mapping proteome heterogeneity of biological samples, however, it remains technically challenging due to the complexity of the tissue microsampling techniques and mass spectrometry analysis of nanoscale specimen volumes. Here, we describe a spatially resolved proteomics method based on the combination of tissue expansion with mass spectrometry-based proteomics, which we call Expansion Proteomics (ProteomEx). ProteomEx enables quantitative profiling of the spatial variability of the proteome in mammalian tissues at ~160 microm lateral resolution, equivalent to the tissue volume of 0.61 nL, using manual microsampling without the need for custom or special equipment. We validated and demonstrated the utility of ProteomEx for streamlined large-scale proteomics profiling of biological tissues including brain, liver, and breast cancer. We further applied ProteomEx for identifying proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease in a mouse model by comparative proteomic analysis of brain subregions.
