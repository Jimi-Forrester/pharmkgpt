36371675|t|Comparison of intravenous and inhalation anesthesia on postoperative behavior changes in children undergoing ambulatory endoscopic procedures: A randomized clinical trial.
36371675|a|BACKGROUND: Early and delayed behavioral changes are well recognized after anesthesia. Intravenous anesthesia may prevent emergence delirium. However, it has not been evaluated as a preventive strategy for delayed postoperative behavior changes. AIMS: We aimed to determine whether intravenous anesthesia is effective at reducing postoperative behavior changes in children undergoing ambulatory endoscopic procedures when compared to inhalation anesthesia. METHODS: This randomized, double-blinded controlled trial was approved by the local IRB. Children aged 1-12 years who underwent ambulatory endoscopic procedures were recruited. Preoperative anxiety was evaluated through the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale. All children underwent face mask inhalation induction with sevoflurane. After a peripheral line was placed, each child was allocated to sevoflurane or propofol maintenance. Emergence delirium was evaluated through the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale. The child was discharged home, and behavioral changes were assessed through the Posthospitalization Behavior Questionnaire for Ambulatory Surgery on Days 1, 7, and 14. RESULTS: Overall, 175 children were enrolled. On Day 1 after the procedure, 57 children presented at least one negative behavior. On Days 7 and 14, 49 and 44 children presented at least one negative behavior, respectively. The median number of negative behaviors was similar between the groups. Post hoc analyses showed a moderate correlation between emergence delirium and negative postoperative behavior on Day 7 (r = .34; p = <.001) and an increase of 3.31 (95% CI 1.90; 4.36 p < .001) points in the mean summed score of new negative behaviors for individuals with emergence delirium. CONCLUSION: The incidence of postoperative behavior changes in children undergoing ambulatory endoscopic procedures was similar when comparing intravenous with inhalation anesthesia. Children who experience emergence delirium might show a greater incidence of negative postoperative behavior changes.
