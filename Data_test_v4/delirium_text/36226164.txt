36226164|t|Injectable reactive oxygen and nitrogen species-controlling hydrogels for tissue regeneration: current status and future perspectives.
36226164|a|The dual role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) in physiological and pathological processes in biological systems has been widely reported. It has been recently suggested that the regulation of RONS levels under physiological and pathological conditions is a potential therapy to promote health and treat diseases, respectively. Injectable hydrogels have been emerging as promising biomaterials for RONS-related biomedical applications owing to their excellent biocompatibility, three-dimensional and extracellular matrix-mimicking structures, tunable properties and easy functionalization. These hydrogels have been developed as advanced injectable platforms for locally generating or scavenging RONS, depending on the specific conditions of the target disease. In this review article, the design principles and mechanism by which RONS are generated/scavenged from hydrogels are outlined alongside a discussion of their in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Additionally, we highlight the advantages and recent developments of these injectable RONS-controlling hydrogels for regenerative medicines and tissue engineering applications.
