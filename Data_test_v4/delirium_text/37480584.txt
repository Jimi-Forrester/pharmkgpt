37480584|a|Objective: To compare the anaesthesia methods in percutaneous nephrolithotomy in terms of safety and effectiveness in elderly men.Methods: Elderly male patients who had undergone percutaneous nephrolithotomy were screened retrospectively and divided into 2 groups: percutaneous nephrolithotomy under combined spino-epidural anaesthesia (Group CSEA, n = 70) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy under general anaesthesia (Group GA, n = 114). Preoperative, perioperative and postoperative outcome measures were examined.Results: Between the two groups, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of stone burden, stone location, presence of the previous operation in the same kidney, presence of staghorn stones, mean American Society of Anesthesiologists scores and presence of abnormal kidney (p > 0.05). The mean duration time in the operation room and post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) was statistically shorter in the Group CSEA (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of Clavien Grade 1 and above complications (p > 0.05). Stone-free rates and success rates were similar in both groups (p = 0.133 and p = 0.273, respectively).Conclusion: The type of anaesthesia does not affect the success rate and complication rate of percutaneous nephrolithotomy in elderly male patients. Patients who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy under CSEA needed less analgesic injection during the postoperative period. CSEA can shorten the time a patient spends in the operating room and PACU, which provides more effective use of operation room working hours.
