38951436|t|An insight into the concept of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease: targeting molecular approach Nrf2, NF-kappaB, and CREB.
38951436|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a most prevalent neurologic disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunction, amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein accumulation, and excessive neuroinflammation. It affects various life tasks and reduces thinking, memory, capability, reasoning and orientation ability, decision, and language. The major parts responsible for these abnormalities are the cerebral cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. Excessive inflammatory markers release, and microglial activation affect post-synaptic neurotransmission. Various mechanisms of AD pathogenesis have been explored, but still, there is a need to debate the role of NF-kappaB, Nrf2, inflammatory markers, CREB signaling, etc. In this review, we have briefly discussed the signaling mechanisms and function of the NF-kB signaling pathway, inflammatory mediators, microglia activation, and alteration of autophagy. NF-kappaB inhibition is a current strategy to counter neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the brain of individuals with AD. In clinical trials, numbers of NF-kappaB modulators are being examined. Recent reports revealed that molecular and cellular pathways initiate complex pathological competencies that cause AD. Moreover, this review will provide extensive knowledge of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and how these nuclear proteins affect neuronal plasticity.
