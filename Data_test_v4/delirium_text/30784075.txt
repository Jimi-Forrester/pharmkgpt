The accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques, reduction of acetylcholine due to hyperactivity of acetylcholinesterase, and glutamate neurotoxicity are known to be involved in decreased level of cognitive function. In our previous study, we proved that the aqueous extract of lavender improves learning and memory. This in vitro study was designed to evaluate antiaggregative, antioxidant, and antiacetylcholinesterase activities of the herbal medicine. METHODS: Thin layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, thioflavin, atomic force microscope (AFM), Elleman,and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl techniques were used for qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis, antiaggregative characteristics, anti-acetylcholinestrase activity and antioxidant activity of the lavender extract, respectively. RESULTS: We found chromatographic peaks of caffeic acid and luteolin-7-glycosid in the lavender extract. Our results indicated that aqueous extract of lavender dose-dependently inhibits the formation of Abeta aggregate. The AFM technique showed that lavender largely diminished the Abeta fibril formation. We also observed a considerable radical scavenging activity of the extract. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of Abeta plaque formation and antioxidant activity along with nontoxic features of the lavender extract promise possible effectiveness of this plant on improving some neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease.
