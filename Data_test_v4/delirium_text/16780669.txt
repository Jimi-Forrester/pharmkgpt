16780669|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of Gln192Arg polymorphism in paraoxonase 1 (PON1) gene with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Chinese Han population. METHODS: Gln192Arg polymorphism in PON1 gene was detected with real-time PCR (RT-PCR) technique in 521 patients with AD and 578 healthy controls. RESULTS: The presence of at least one of PON1 R allele (Q/R or R/R) was lower in AD patients as compared with the controls (82.7% vs 87.4%; chi(2) = 4.68, P = 0.03). PON1 gene R allele frequency was lower in AD patients as compared with the controls (60.7% vs 64.7%; chi(2) = 3.85, P = 0.05). One-Way ANOVA showed that PON1 genotype had no effect on the age of onset of AD. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the age and sex-adjusted OR for the risk of AD in PON1 R allele carriers was 0.71 (P = 0.044, 95% CI = 0.51 - 0.99). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that Gln192Arg polymorphism in PON1 gene is associated with AD and PON1 R allele might be a protective factor for AD in Chinese Han population.
