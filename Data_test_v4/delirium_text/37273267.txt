37273267|a|The National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association's research framework in 2018 proposed a molecular construct for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless, the clinical exclusionary strategy is still the mainstay of AD diagnosis in Pakistan. We looked at the plasma levels of amyloid beta-42 (Abeta-42), phosphorylated tau (P-tau), and neurofilament light (NFL) in patients with Alzheimer's clinical syndrome (ACS) and healthy controls (HC) from the Pakistani population to keep pace with the global efforts towards establishing accessible and affordable biochemical diagnostic markers for AD in Pakistan. Consultant neurologists screened patients who presented with cognitive impairment to three large tertiary care hospitals in Karachi, and after receiving informed consent, recruited participants with ACS and HC from the same facilities. We collected 5cc of blood in EDTA tubes along with demographic and lifestyle information of the subjects. Plasma aliquots were stored at -80 C after centrifugation. For analysis it was thawed at 4C and levels of the three proteins were measured through ELISA. Data from 28 ACS patients and 28 age matched healthy controls were evaluated. Among demographic factors, education and depression were related with health status (p = 0.03 and 0.003, respectively). NFL and P-tau mean values demonstrated a significant difference between the ACS and control groups (p = 0.003 and 0.006), however Abeta42 did not (p = 0.114). ROC analysis showed that plasma P-tau and NFL, with AUCs of 0.717 and 0.735, respectively, could substantially distinguish ACS from the HC group (p = 0.007 and 0.003, respectively). Both plasma P-tau (r = -0.389; p = 0.004) and NFL (r = -0.424; p = 0.001) levels were significantly and negatively correlated with individuals' MMSE scores. NFL and plasma P-tau show promise in differentiating AD patients from healthy individuals. However, similar larger studies are needed to validate our findings.
