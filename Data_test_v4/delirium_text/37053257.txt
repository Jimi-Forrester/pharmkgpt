37053257|t|Effectiveness of physical rehabilitation interventions in critically ill patients-A protocol for an overview of systematic reviews.
37053257|a|INTRODUCTION: Adult and pediatric patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) requiring invasive ventilatory support, sedation, and muscle blockade may present neuromusculoskeletal deterioration. Different physical rehabilitation interventions have been studied to evaluate their effectiveness in improving critically ill patients' outcomes. Given that many published systematic reviews (SRs) aims to determine the effectiveness of different types of physical rehabilitation interventions, it is necessary to group them systematically and assess the methodological quality of SRs to help clinicians make better evidence-based decisions. This overview of SRs (OoSRs) aims to map the existing evidence and to determine the effectiveness of physical rehabilitation interventions to improve neuromusculoskeletal function and other clinical outcomes in adult and pediatric critically ill patients. METHODS: An OoSRs of randomized and non-randomized clinical trials involving critically ill adult and pediatric patients receiving physical rehabilitation intervention will be conducted. A sensitive search of MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos, and other search resources will be conducted. Two independent reviewers will conduct study selection, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment. Discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. The degree of overlap of studies will be calculated using the corrected covered area. The methodological quality of the SRs will be measured using the AMSTAR-2 tool. The GRADE framework will report the certainty of evidence by selecting the "best" SR for each physical rehabilitation intervention and outcome. DISCUSSION: The findings of this overview are expected to determine the effectiveness and safety of physical rehabilitation interventions to improve neuromusculoskeletal function in adult and pediatric critically ill patients based on a wide selection of the best available evidence and to determine the knowledge gaps in this topic by mapping and assessing the methodological quality of published SRs.
