32659909|t|Bispecific Antibodies: A New Era of Treatment for Multiple Myeloma.
32659909|a|Despite the introduction of novel agents such as proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and autologous stem cell transplant, multiple myeloma (MM) largely remains an incurable disease. In recent years, monoclonal antibody-based treatment strategies have been developed to target specific surface antigens on MM cells. Treatment with bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) is an immunotherapeutic strategy that leads to an enhanced interaction between MM cells and immune effector cells, e.g., T-cells and natural killer cells. With the immune synapse built by bsAbs, the elimination of MM cells can be facilitated. To date, bsAbs have demonstrated encouraging results in preclinical studies, and clinical trials evaluating bsAbs in patients with MM are ongoing. Early clinical data show the promising efficacy of bsAbs in relapsed/refractory MM. Together with chimeric antigen receptor-modified (CAR)-T-cells, bsAbs represent a new dimension of precision medicine. In this review, we provide an overview of rationale, current clinical development, resistance mechanisms, and future directions of bsAbs in MM.
