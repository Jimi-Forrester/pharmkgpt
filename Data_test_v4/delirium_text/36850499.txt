36850499|t|Multi Modal Feature Extraction for Classification of Vascular Dementia in Post-Stroke Patients Based on EEG Signal.
36850499|a|Dementia is a term that represents a set of symptoms that affect the ability of the brain's cognitive functions related to memory, thinking, behavior, and language. At worst, dementia is often called a major neurocognitive disorder or senile disease. One of the most common types of dementia after Alzheimer's is vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is closely related to cerebrovascular disease, one of which is stroke. Post-stroke patients with recurrent onset have the potential to develop dementia. An accurate diagnosis is needed for proper therapy management to ensure the patient's quality of life and prevent it from worsening. The gold standard diagnostic of vascular dementia is complex, includes psychological tests, complete memory tests, and is evidenced by medical imaging of brain lesions. However, brain imaging methods such as CT-Scan, PET-Scan, and MRI have high costs and cannot be routinely used in a short period. For more than two decades, electroencephalogram signal analysis has been an alternative in assisting the diagnosis of brain diseases associated with cognitive decline. Traditional EEG analysis performs visual observations of signals, including rhythm, power, and spikes. Of course, it requires a clinician expert, time consumption, and high costs. Therefore, a quantitative EEG method for identifying vascular dementia in post-stroke patients is discussed in this study. This study used 19 EEG channels recorded from normal elderly, post-stroke with mild cognitive impairment, and post-stroke with dementia. The QEEG method used for feature extraction includes relative power, coherence, and signal complexity; the evaluation performance of normal-mild cognitive impairment-dementia classification was conducted using Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor. The results of the classification simulation showed the highest accuracy of 96% by Gaussian SVM with a sensitivity and specificity of 95.6% and 97.9%, respectively. This study is expected to be an additional criterion in the diagnosis of dementia, especially in post-stroke patients.
