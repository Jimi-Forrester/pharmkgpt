38004296|t|Therapeutic Potential of P110 Peptide: New Insights into Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
38004296|a|Mitochondrial degeneration in various neurodegenerative diseases, specifically in Alzheimer's disease, involves excessive mitochondrial fission and reduced fusion, leading to cell damage. P110 is a seven-amino acid peptide that restores mitochondrial dynamics by acting as an inhibitor of mitochondrial fission. However, the role of P110 as a neuroprotective agent in AD remains unclear. Therefore, we performed cell culture studies to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of P110 on amyloid-beta accumulation and mitochondrial functioning. Human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells were incubated with 1 microM and 10 microM of P110, and Real-Time PCR and Western blot analysis were done to quantify the expression of genes pertaining to AD and neuronal health. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to P110 significantly increased APP mRNA levels at 1 microM, while BACE1 mRNA levels were increased at both 1 microM and 10 microM. However, protein levels of both APP and BACE1 were significantly reduced at 10 microM of P110. Further, P110 treatment significantly increased ADAM10 and Klotho protein levels at 10 microM. In addition, P110 exposure significantly increased active mitochondria and reduced ROS in live SH-SY5Y cells at both 1 microM and 10 microM concentrations. Taken together, our results indicate that P110 might be useful in attenuating amyloid-beta generation and improving neuronal health by maintaining mitochondrial function in neurons.
