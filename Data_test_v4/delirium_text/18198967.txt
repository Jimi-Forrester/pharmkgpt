18198967|t|Hip fracture: improving the outcome.
18198967|a|The number of hip fractures increases substantially with age, and they often become life threatening. Fractures can increase postsurgical incidences of deep venous thrombosis, delirium, persistent pain, wounds, and urinary tract infections. The one-year mortality from hip fractures is 20%, but prophylaxis interventions improve outcomes. Rehabilitation is patient-specific and focuses on maximizing functional status and minimizing future risks. Ongoing medication review and assessment are important components in preventing fractures.
