30243292|a|Graphene's unique physical structure, as well as its chemical and electrical properties, make it ideal for use in sensor technologies. In the past years, novel sensing platforms have been proposed with pristine and modified graphene with nanoparticles and polymers. Several of these platforms were used to immobilize biomolecules, such as antibodies, DNA, and enzymes to create highly sensitive and selective biosensors. Strategies to attach these biomolecules onto the surface of graphene have been employed based on its chemical composition. These methods include covalent bonding, such as the coupling of the biomolecules via the 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide reactions, and physisorption. In the literature, several detection methods are employed; however, the most common is electrochemical. The main reason for researchers to use this detection approach is because this method is simple, rapid and presents good sensitivity. These biosensors can be particularly useful in life sciences and medicine since in clinical practice, biosensors with high sensitivity and specificity can significantly enhance patient care, early diagnosis of diseases and pathogen detection. In this review, we will present the research conducted with antibodies, DNA molecules and, enzymes to develop biosensors that use graphene and its derivatives as scaffolds to produce effective biosensors able to detect and identify a variety of diseases, pathogens, and biomolecules linked to diseases.
