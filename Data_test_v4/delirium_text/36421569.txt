36421569|t|Effect of Composite Chitosan/Sodium Alginate Gel Coatings on the Quality of Fresh-Cut Purple-Flesh Sweet Potato.
36421569|a|In this study, single-layer coating using chitosan (Ch) and sodium alginate (SA) solutions and their gel coating (ChCSA) formed by layer-by-layer (LbL) electrostatic deposition using calcium chloride (C) as a cross linking agent were prepared to improve storage qualities and shelf-life of fresh-cut purple-flesh sweet potatoes (PFSP). The preservative effects of single-layer coating in comparison with LbL on the quality parameters of fresh-cut PFSP, including color change, weight loss, firmness, microbial analysis, CO2 production, pH, solid content, total anthocyanin content (TAC), and total phenolic content (TPC) were evaluated during 16 days of storage at 5  C. Uncoated samples were applicable as a control. The result established the effectiveness of coating in reducing microbial proliferation (~2 times), color changes (~3 times), and weight loss (~4 times) with negligible firmness losses after the storage period. In addition, TAC and TPC were better retained in the coated samples than in the uncoated samples. In contrast, quality deterioration was observed in the uncoated fresh cuts, which progressed with storage time. Relatively, gel-coating ChCSA showed superior effects in preserving the quality of fresh-cut PFSP and could be suggested as a commercial method for preserving fresh-cut purple-flesh sweet potato and other similar roots.
