37773139|t|Neuronal MHC-I complex is destabilized by amyloid-beta and its implications in Alzheimer's disease.
37773139|a|BACKGROUNDS: The expression of major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) in neurons has recently been shown to regulate neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. However, its contribution to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains largely unknown. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the relationship between impaired MHC-I-beta2M complex and AD in vitro and human AD samples. Interaction between protein was identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and confirmed by immunoprecipitation. Single-chain trimer of MHC-I-beta2M was generated to study the effect of stabilization of MHC-I-beta2M complex on NCAM1 signaling. RESULTS: MHC-I is destabilized in the brains of AD patients and neuronal cells treated with oligomeric beta-amyloid (Abeta). Specifically, Abeta oligomers disassemble the MHC-I-beta2-microglobulin (beta2M) complex, leading to reduced interactions with neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1), a novel interactor of neuronal MHC-I, and decreased signaling. Inhibition of MHC-I-beta2M complex destabilization by non-dissociable MHC-I-beta2M-peptide complex restored MHC-I-NCAM1 signaling in neuronal cells. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated that disruption of MHC-1-NCAM1 signaling by Abeta induced disassembly of MHC-I-beta2M complex is involved in the pathophysiology of AD. Moreover, our findings suggest modulation of MHC-I stability may be a potential therapeutic target for restoring synaptic function in AD.
