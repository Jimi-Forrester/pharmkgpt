9630429|a|Levels of mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), iron (Fe), rubidium (Rb), and zinc (Zn) were measured in the pituitary gland to assess the possibility of a potential difference in the environmental Hg exposure of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and control subjects and levels of other elements of interest in AD. The pituitary gland has been established as a good predictor of environmental Hg exposure. Neutron activation analysis was utilized to determine levels of these elements in pituitary glands of 43 AD subjects and 15 control subjects. No significant differences were observed between the AD and control means for these five elements. The sole significant Pearson's correlation involving Hg was the established correlation with Se, indicative of the detoxification of Hg. The absence of a statistical difference between AD and control pituitary gland Hg levels suggests AD patients do not have an excessive environmental exposure to Hg compared to controls.
