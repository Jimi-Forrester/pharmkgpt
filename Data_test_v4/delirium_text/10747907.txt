10747907|t|Interaction of tau with the neural membrane cortex is regulated by phosphorylation at sites that are modified in paired helical filaments.
10747907|a|The axonal microtubule-associated phosphoprotein tau interacts with neural plasma membrane (PM) components during neuronal development (Brandt, R., Leger, J., and Lee, G. (1995) J. Cell Biol. 131, 1327-1340). To analyze the mechanism and potential regulation of tau's PM association, a method was developed to isolate PM-associated tau using microsphere separation of surface-biotinylated cells. We show that tau's PM association requires an intact membrane cortex and that PM-associated tau and cytosolic tau are differentially phosphorylated at sites detected by several Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnostic antibodies (Ser(199)/Ser(202), Thr(231), and Ser(396)/Ser(404)). In polar neurons, the association of endogenous tau phosphoisoforms with the membrane cortex correlates with an enrichment in the axonal compartment. To test for a direct effect of AD-specific tau modifications in determining tau's interactions, a phosphomutant that simulates an AD-like hyperphosphorylation of tau was produced by site-directed mutagenesis of Ser/Thr residues to negatively charged amino acids (Glu). These mutations completely abolish tau's association with the membrane cortex; however, the construct retains its capability to bind to microtubules. The data suggest that a loss of tau's association with the membrane cortex as a result of phosphorylation at sites that are modified during disease contributes to somatodendritic tau accumulation, axonal microtubule disintegration, and neuronal death characteristic for AD.
