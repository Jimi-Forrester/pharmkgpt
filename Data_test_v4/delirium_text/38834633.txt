38834633|t|Brain network topology and its cognitive impact in adult glioma survivors.
38834633|a|Structural brain network topology can be altered in case of a brain tumor, due to both the tumor itself and its treatment. In this study, we explored the role of structural whole-brain and nodal network metrics and their association with cognitive functioning. Fifty WHO grade 2-3 adult glioma survivors (> 1-year post-therapy) and 50 matched healthy controls underwent a cognitive assessment, covering six cognitive domains. Raw cognitive assessment scores were transformed into w-scores, corrected for age and education. Furthermore, based on multi-shell diffusion-weighted MRI, whole-brain tractography was performed to create weighted graphs and to estimate whole-brain and nodal graph metrics. Hubs were defined based on nodal strength, betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient and shortest path length in healthy controls. Significant differences in these metrics between patients and controls were tested for the hub nodes (i.e. n = 12) and non-hub nodes (i.e. n = 30) in two mixed-design ANOVAs. Group differences in whole-brain graph measures were explored using Mann-Whitney U tests. Graph metrics that significantly differed were ultimately correlated with the cognitive domain-specific w-scores. Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for multiple testing. In survivors, the bilateral putamen were significantly less frequently observed as a hub (pbonf < 0.001). These nodes' assortativity values were positively correlated with attention (r(90) > 0.573, pbonf < 0.001), and proxy IQ (r(90) > 0.794, pbonf < 0.001). Attention and proxy IQ were significantly more often correlated with assortativity of hubs compared to non-hubs (pbonf < 0.001). Finally, the whole-brain graph measures of clustering coefficient (r = 0.685), global (r = 0.570) and local efficiency (r = 0.500) only correlated with proxy IQ (pbonf < 0.001). This study demonstrated potential reorganization of hubs in glioma survivors. Assortativity of these hubs was specifically associated with cognitive functioning, which could be important to consider in future modeling of cognitive outcomes and risk classification in glioma survivors.
