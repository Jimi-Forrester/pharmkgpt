27265784|a|Dysfunctions in the perirhinal cortex (PRh) are associated with visual recognition memory deficit, which is frequently detected in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-dependent long-term depression (mAChR-LTD) of synaptic transmission is known as a key pathway in eliciting this type of memory, and Tg2576 mice expressing enhanced levels of Abeta oligomers are found to have impaired mAChR-LTD in this brain area at as early as 3 months of age. We found that the administration of Abeta oligomers in young normal mice also induced visual recognition memory impairment and perturbed mAChR-LTD in mouse PRh slices. In addition, when mice were treated with infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha, visual recognition memory impaired by pre-administered Abeta oligomers dramatically improved and the detrimental Abeta effect on mAChR-LTD was annulled. Taken together, these findings suggest that Abeta-induced inflammation is mediated through TNF-alpha signaling cascades, disturbing synaptic transmission in the PRh, and leading to visual recognition memory deficits.
