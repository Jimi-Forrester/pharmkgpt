28670853|t|The pathological roles of NDRG2 in Alzheimer's disease, a study using animal models and APPwt-overexpressed cells.
28670853|a|AIMS: To investigate the roles of N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) in the pathology of aging and neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). RESULTS: In this study, we confirmed the upregulation of NDRG2 in the brains of aging and AD animal models. To explore the role of NDRG2 in the pathology of AD at molecular level, we conducted a cell-based assay of highly expressed wild-type human APP695 SK-N-SH cells (SK-N-SH APPwt). By silencing and overexpressing gene of NDRG2, we demonstrated that NDRG2-mediated increase in Abeta1-42 was through the pathways of BACE1 and GGA3. NGRG2 improved tau phosphorylation via enhanced activity of CDK5 and decreased Pin1, but it was not affected by GSK3beta pathway. NDRG2 might also induce cell apoptosis through the extrinsic (caspase 8) apoptotic pathway by interaction with STAT3. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the upregulation of NDRG2 in AD animal models and demonstrated its important roles in AD pathology. NDRG2 might be a potential target for studying and treatment of AD.
