10598290|a|Study of depression in North-Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa has shown that, since the seventies, the clinical expression of depression is markedly different from that of depression in the West. Several authors have noted the rareness of guilt themes and the frequency of persecution themes and somatic complaints in depressed Africans, even those living in the West. More recent studies have shown an evolution in depressive symptoms in North-Africa with an increase in guilt and a decrease in persecution and somatic complaints. This shift in symptoms brings the expression of depression closer to that observed in the West. Our study addresses delusional depression: in 73 cases of delusional depression, delusions of guilt were present in 31% of cases, persecution in 48% and hallucinations in 31.5%. A comparison of the sub-groups consulting in 1991 and a second sub-group consulting in 1998 shows a marked increase in guilt (23.5 versus 39%).
