32265623|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), which most commonly occurs in the elder, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with no agreed drugs or treatment protocols at present. Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), earlier than AD onset and later than subjective cognitive decline (SCD) onset, has a serious probability of converting into AD. The SCD, which can last for decades, subjectively complains of decline impairment in memory. Distinct altered patterns of default mode network (DMN) subnetworks connected to the whole brain are perceived as prominent hallmarks of the early stages of AD. Nevertheless, the aberrant phase position connectivity (PPC) connected to the whole brain in DMN subnetworks remains unknown. Here, we hypothesized that there exist distinct variations of PPC in DMN subnetworks connected to the whole brain for patients with SCD and aMCI, which might be acted as discriminatory neuroimaging biomarkers. We recruited 27 healthy controls (HC), 20 SCD and 28 aMCI subjects, respectively, to explore aberrant patterns of PPC in DMN subnetworks connected to the whole brain. In anterior DMN (aDMN), SCD group exhibited aberrant PPC in the regions of right superior cerebellum lobule (SCL), right superior frontal gyrus of medial part (SFGMP), and left fusiform gyrus (FG) in comparison of HC group, by contrast, no prominent difference was found in aMCI group. It is important to note that aMCI group showed increased PPC in the right SFGMP in comparison with SCD group. For posterior DMN (pDMN), SCD group showed decreased PPC in the left superior parietal lobule (SPL) and right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) compared to HC group. It is noteworthy that aMCI group showed decreased PPC in the left middle frontal gyrus of orbital part (MFGOP) and right SFG compared to HC group, yet increased PPC was found in the left superior temporal gyrus of temporal pole (STGTP). Additionally, aMCI group exhibited decreased PPC in the left MFGOP compared to SCD group. Collectively, our results have shown that the aberrant regions of PPC observed in DMN are related to cognitive function, and it might also be served as impressible neuroimaging biomarkers for timely intervention before AD occurs.
