18681360|a|Nearly 60% of the Dutch population undergoing surgery is over the age of 65. The elderly are at higher risk of developing perioperative complications (e.g. myocardial infarction, pneumonia or delirium), that lead to a prolonged hospital stay or death. Preoperative risk stratification calculates the patient's risk by evaluating the presence and extent of frailty, and pathophysiological risk factors, type of surgery and the results of additional testing. The type of anaesthesia, fluid management and pain management strongly influences the outcome of surgery and the way this is experienced by the patient. Recent developments focus on multimodal perioperative care of the older patient to shorten hospital stay, using minimal invasive surgery, postoperative anaesthesiology rounds and early geriatric consultation.
