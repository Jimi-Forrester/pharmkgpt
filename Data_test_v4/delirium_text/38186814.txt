38186814|t|Association of medication adherence quality measures for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia with cognitive decline.
38186814|a|Background: While diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia each are associated with increased risk of cognitive decline, little is known regarding how nonadherence to medications for these conditions is associated with cognitive decline risk. Methods: We identified patients enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan who were eligible for inclusion in the CMS Star Medication Adherence quality measures for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia in 2018, 2019, and 2020. To achieve an adherence quality measure, patients had to meet 80% of the proportion of days for the medication. We used propensity score with inverse probability of treatment weighting to balance outcomes for baseline characteristics and logistic regression models to compare odds of cognitive decline outcomes across patient groups. Results: The study population of 99,774 individuals had a mean age of 71.0 years and was 49.1% female, 73.9% White, and 17.8% Black, with 62.0% living in an urban setting. Compared with patients who missed zero adherence measures, those who missed one measure had 23%-33% increased odds of cognitive decline (any decline OR = 1.23; dementia OR = 1.33; Alzheimer's disease OR = 1.27; all P values <0.01). Patients who missed 2-3 measures had 37%-96% increased odds of cognitive decline (any decline OR = 1.37; dementia OR = 1.58; Alzheimer's disease OR = 1.96; all P values <0.01). Patients who missed >=4 adherence measures had the greatest odds of cognitive decline (any decline OR = 1.64; dementia OR = 2.05; Alzheimer's disease OR = 2.48; all P values <0.01). Conclusion: Not achieving CMS Star Medication Adherence quality measures for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia therapies was associated with increased risk of cognitive decline outcomes.
