35989801|t|Clinical Uses of Ketamine in Children: A Narrative Review.
35989801|a|Ketamine is a phencyclidine derivative that acts as a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate as well as a glutamate receptor antagonist. It also has other minor mechanisms that contribute to its extensive drug profile. Ketamine is a bronchodilator and maintains normal airway reflexes and, thus, permits spontaneous respiration. This, coupled with the fact that it produces potent analgesia, makes it highly suitable for children. Despite its many merits, the drug's side effects, along with its cultural image of being a drug of abuse, a drug used in veterinary medicine, or a "date-rape drug" have sullied its reputation within the armamentarium of medicine. Even though it is widely used in developing countries, its use in Western nations has diminished. We have strived to explore the various clinical uses of ketamine in children through this article. In addition, the article also highlights how some of the fears associated with using the drug are unfounded and provides ways by which the drug's side effects can be prevented and managed.
