36031894|t|Hypnosis Intervention for Couples Confronted with Alzheimer's Disease: Promising Results of a First Exploratory Study.
36031894|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia has a negative impact on the quality of life of the person with dementia and their spouse caregivers, as well as on the couple's relationship, which can lead to high levels of distress for both partners. Hypnosis has been shown to be effective in managing distress and increasing the quality of the relationship. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to develop a standardized hypnosis intervention for couples confronted with Alzheimer's disease and evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and helpfulness in managing the distress of both partners and increasing the quality of the relationship. METHODS: In a single-arm study, sixteen couples received the 8-week intervention. Qualitative and quantitative assessments were conducted pre- and post-intervention as well as three months after. RESULTS: 88.9% of couples (n = 16) of the final sample (n = 18) completed the intervention. Despite the negative representations of hypnosis, several factors led couples to accept to participate in this study: positive expectations, professional endorsement, medical application, non-drug approach, home-based, free, flexible, and couple-based intervention. The results showed a significant decrease in distress for both partners. These effects were maintained three months after the intervention. Couples felt more relaxed, had fewer negative emotions, accepted difficulties more easily, were more patient, and reported better communication and more affection in the relationship. CONCLUSION: Overall, this pilot study shows the feasibility and acceptability of hypnosis with couples confronted with Alzheimer's disease. Although measures of the preliminary pre- and post-intervention effects are encouraging, confirmatory testing with a randomized controlled trial is needed.
