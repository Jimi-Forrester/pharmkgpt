30832418|t|High-Performance Thin-Layer Chromatography Hyphenated with Microchemical and Biochemical Derivatizations in Bioactivity Profiling of Marine Species.
30832418|a|Marine organisms produce an array of biologically active natural products, many of which have unique structures that have not been found in terrestrial organisms. Hence, marine algae provide a unique source of bioactive compounds. The present study investigated 19 marine algae and one seagrass collected from Torquay beach, Victoria, Australia. High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) hyphenated with microchemical (DPPH , p-anisaldehyde, and Fast Blue B) and biochemical (alpha-amylase and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) enzymatic) derivatizations was used to evaluate antioxidant activity, presence of phytosterols and phenolic lipids, alpha-amylase and AChE inhibitory activities of extract components. Significant alpha-amylase and AChE inhibitory activities were observed in samples 2, 6, 8 and 10. Antioxidant activities in the samples were found to be correlated to phytosterol content (R2 = 0.78), but was not found to be related to either alpha-amylase or AChE inhibitory activities. alpha-Amylase inhibitory activities were correlated to AChE inhibition (R2 = 0.77) and attributed to the phytosterol content, based on the similar peak position in the chromatograms with the beta-sitosterol chromatogram. Samples 1, 8, and especially sample 20, were found to contain phenolic lipids (alkyl resorcinol derivatives) with significant antioxidant activities. The results suggest that these marine species have a significant number of bioactive compounds that warrant further investigation.
