39074779|t|Myoclonus, Uremia, and Delirium in a Liver Transplant Recipient: A Case Report and Literature Review.
39074779|a|BACKGROUND: Consultation-liaison (CL) psychiatrists are frequently asked to consult on various abnormal movements(1). CL psychiatrists can be instrumental in aiding the primary teams to identify and manage these movement disorders. In this manuscript, we provide an illustrative case of a patient presenting with myoclonus and offer a review on this important topic. Myoclonus accompanied by delirium represents a rare post-transplant complication and can be associated with heightened morbidity and mortality. The incidence of this complication in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients is scarcely documented, and its pathophysiology remains inadequately understood. Potential etiologies in the intensive care unit (ICU) are numerous and likely multifactorial. The literature lacks detailed descriptions of the correlation and association between myoclonus and uremia. Management of this condition requires a multimodal approach, focusing on resolving underlying metabolic disturbances and providing symptomatic treatment. OBJECTIVES: This manuscript describes the clinical presentation of myoclonus in a liver transplant recipient accompanied by delirium and precipitated by uremia. We aim to highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic complexities, help providers distinguish myoclonus from other movement disorders, and aid appropriate management. METHODS AND RESULTS: We present a case of acute myoclonus in an elderly female liver transplant recipient precipitated by uremia and improved after continuous renal replacement treatment. In addition, we conducted a systematic review utilizing EMBASSE and PubMed of reported cases of myoclonus, delirium, and/or encephalopathy accompanied by uremia. We included 12 manuscripts in our review and discussed their findings. CONCLUSION: CL psychiatrists are frequently consulted for a range of movement disorders in the ICU, including myoclonus. Accurate diagnosis and identification of contributing etiologies are critical in these cases. Management typically involves addressing the underlying disorder, such as using dialysis for uremia, alongside symptomatic treatment with benzodiazepines to mitigate the frequency and amplitude of myoclonus. This approach helps to alleviate both the physical burden and psychological distress associated with the condition. This case underscores the pivotal role of the CL psychiatrist within a complex multidisciplinary team, contributing to diagnostic precision and optimization of management strategies for movement disorders.
