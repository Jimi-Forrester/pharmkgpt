29184882|a|Cutaneous metastases from colorectal cancer are extremely rare and generally appear several years after diagnosis or resection of the primary tumor. Although this phenomenon is uncommon, it is very important and often indicates a poor prognosis. We present a case of a 76-year-old female patient with multiple cutaneous metastatic nodules on the back, just 1 month after resection of rectal cancer. Unfortunately, the patient gave up the follow-up treatment due to her age and poor physical condition; she died 3 months later. In view of its rarity of occurrence and lack of experience in treatment, we reviewed the literature and report as follows.
