24975982|t|[Practice guideline 'Delirium' from the Dutch College of General Practitioners].
24975982|a|The revised practice guideline 'Delirium' of the Dutch College of General Practitioners (NHG) provides recommendations about the prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment of delirium in elderly patients in general practice. The guideline now also offers tools for the treatment of delirium in terminally-ill patients. A patient with delirium can only be cared for at home if a safe environment and the continuous presence of carers can be guaranteed. This requires close cooperation between the care services and the home carers involved and good coordination with the general practice health centre. The discharge from hospital of patients with persistent symptoms of delirium to their homes requires optimal transfer from the specialist/nursing staff to the general practitioner and home carers involved. The NHG guideline therefore pays considerable attention to collaboration and transfer in the care of patients with delirium. The revised version of this guideline was developed in close collaboration with the revision of the multidisciplinary guideline on delirium produced by the Dutch Order of Medical Specialists.
