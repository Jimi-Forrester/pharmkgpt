36978932|t|Edible Seaweeds Extracts: Characterization and Functional Properties for Health Conditions.
36978932|a|Seaweeds are popular foods due to claimed beneficial health effects, but for many there is a lack of scientific evidence. In this study, extracts of the edible seaweeds Arame, Nori, and Fucus are compared. Our approach intends to clarify similarities and differences in the health properties of these seaweeds, thus contributing to target potential applications for each. Additionally, although Arame and Fucus seaweeds are highly explored, information on Nori composition and bioactivities is scarce. The aqueous extracts of the seaweeds were obtained by decoction, then fractionated and characterized according to their composition and biological activity. It was recognized that fractioning the extracts led to bioactivity reduction, suggesting a loss of bioactive compounds synergies. The Arame extract showed the highest antioxidant activity and Nori exhibited the highest potential for acetylcholinesterase inhibition. The identification of the bioactive compounds in the extracts allowed to see that these contained a mixture of phloroglucinol polymers, and it was suggested that Nori's effect on acetylcholinesterase inhibition may be associated with a smaller sized phlorotannins capable of entering the enzyme active site. Overall, these results suggest a promising potential for the use of these seaweed extracts, mainly Arame and Nori, in health improvement and management of diseases, namely those associated to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration.
