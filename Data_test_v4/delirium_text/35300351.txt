35300351|t|Quantification of Brain beta-Amyloid Load in Parkinson's Disease With Mild Cognitive Impairment: A PET/MRI Study.
35300351|a|Background: Mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI) is associated with faster cognitive decline and conversion to dementia. There is uncertainty about the role of beta-amyloid (Abeta) co-pathology and its contribution to the variability in PD-MCI profile and cognitive progression. Objective: To study how presence of Abeta affects clinical and cognitive manifestations as well as regional brain volumes in PD-MCI. Methods: Twenty-five PD-MCI patients underwent simultaneous PET/3T-MRI with [18F]flutemetamol and a clinical and neuropsychological examination allowing level II diagnosis. We tested pairwise differences in motor, clinical, and cognitive features with Mann-Whitney U test. We calculated [18F]flutemetamol (FMM) standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) in striatal and cortical ROIs, and we performed a univariate linear regression analysis between the affected cognitive domains and the mean SUVR. Finally, we investigated differences in cortical and subcortical brain regional volumes with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: There were 8 Abeta+ and 17 Abeta- PD-MCI. They did not differ for age, disease duration, clinical, motor, behavioral, and global cognition scores. PD-MCI-Abeta+ showed worse performance in the overall executive domain (p = 0.037). Subcortical ROIs analysis showed significant Abeta deposition in PD-MCI-Abeta+ patients in the right caudal and rostral middle frontal cortex, in precuneus, in left paracentral and pars triangularis (p < 0.0001), and bilaterally in the putamen (p = 0.038). Cortical regions with higher amyloid load correlated with worse executive performances (p < 0.05). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses showed no between groups differences. Conclusions: Presence of cerebral Abeta worsens executive functions, but not motor and global cognitive abilities in PD-MCI, and it is not associated with middle-temporal cortex atrophy. These findings, together with the observation of significant proportion of PD-MCI-Abeta-, suggest that Abeta may not be the main pathogenetic determinant of cognitive deterioration in PD-MCI, but it would rather aggravate deficits in domains vulnerable to Parkinson primary pathology.
