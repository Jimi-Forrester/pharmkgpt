38026450|t|Serum 3-Hydroxybutyrate is Expected to Serve as One of the Supportive Diagnostic Markers of Persistent Idiopathic Dentoalveolar Pain (PDAP).
38026450|a|Background: Persistent idiopathic dentoalveolar pain (PDAP), previously referred to as atypical odontalgia, is a chronic dental pain that occurs without signs of pathology. PDAP is considered a diagnosis of exclusion, and its definition is currently under refinement and remains ambiguous. The metabolite known as 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) has garnered significant interest as a potential indicator for both depression and chronic psychogenic pain. We investigated the characteristics of patients with PDAP and hypothesized that serum 3HB could support the diagnosis of PDAP. Subjects and Methods: Forty-one patients with PDAP and 167 patients with odontogenic toothache were investigated regarding depression and anxiety scales in addition to the general dental evaluation. Blood tests including high-sensitivity CRP, HbA1c, and 3HB were performed for all patients. Associations between PDAP and patients' varying characteristics were investigated using hierarchical multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: There were more females, current smokers, patients with orofacial pain (such as temporomandibular joint pain, glossalgia, and headache), and people with elevated 3HB levels among patients with PDAP than among control participants. Multivariate logistic regression analyses predicting patients with PDAP identified the female sex (odds ratio [OR]: 4.16), current smoking (OR: 14.9), glossalgia (OR: 19.8) a high CES-D score (>=16) (OR: 5.98), and elevated serum 3HB (>=80 mumol/L) (OR: 18.4) factors significantly associated with PDAP. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that serum 3HB levels could be elevated in patients with PDAP compared to other types of odontogenic pain, although 3HB was not specific to PDAP. Based on our findings, five factors - female sex, current smoking, depressive tendencies, chronic orofacial pains, and high serum 3HB levels - could be useful for diagnosing PDAP.
