34870508|a|COVID-19 has had an unprecedented worldwide impact, and Peru has had one of the highest COVID-19 case rates despite implementation of an early strict nationwide quarantine. Repercussions on Peru's healthcare system may impact vulnerable populations, particularly people with HIV (PWH). We explored knowledge of COVID-19 and the socioeconomic and health impact of the pandemic among middle-aged and older PWH. A cross-sectional telephone survey was administered to 156 PWH age >=40 years receiving care in one of two large HIV clinics in Lima, Peru. The majority of PWH (age 52 +- 7.7 years, 41% female, 65% completed secondary school or less) were knowledgeable regarding COVID-19 symptoms and prevention methods. Nearly half of those employed prior to the pandemic reported job loss. Female sex (unadjusted prevalence ratio [PR] 1.85 [95%CI 1.27-2.69]), low educational level (PR 1.62 [1.06-2.48]) and informal work (PR 1.58 [1.06-2.36]) were risk factors for unemployment but not in adjusted models. Increased anxiety was reported in 64% and stress in 77%. COVID-19 has had a substantial socioeconomic and mental health impact on PWH living in Lima, Peru, particularly those with lower educational levels and informal workers. Efforts are needed to ensure continued medical care and socioeconomic support of PWH in Peru.
