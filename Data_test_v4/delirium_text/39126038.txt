39126038|t|The Complex Relationship between Neuromodulators, Circadian Rhythms, and Insomnia in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea.
39126038|a|Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been linked to disruptions in circadian rhythm and neurotrophin (NFT) signaling. This study explored the link between neuromodulators, chronotype, and insomnia in OSA. The participants (n = 166) underwent polysomnography (PSG) before being categorized into either the control or the OSA group. The following questionnaires were completed: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Chronotype Questionnaire (morningness-eveningness (ME), and subjective amplitude (AM). Blood samples were collected post-PSG for protein level assessment using ELISA kits for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), proBDNF, glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor, NFT3, and NFT4. Gene expression was analyzed utilizing qRT-PCR. No significant differences were found in neuromodulator levels between OSA patients and controls. The controls with insomnia exhibited elevated neuromodulator gene expression (p < 0.05). In the non-insomnia individuals, BDNF and NTF3 expression was increased in the OSA group compared to controls (p = 0.007 for both); there were no significant differences between the insomnia groups. The ISI scores positively correlated with all gene expressions in both groups, except for NTF4 in OSA (R = 0.127, p = 0.172). AM and ME were predicting factors for the ISI score and clinically significant insomnia (p < 0.05 for both groups). Compromised compensatory mechanisms in OSA may exacerbate insomnia. The correlation between chronotype and NFT expression highlights the role of circadian misalignments in sleep disruptions.
