22465202|t|Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy for neurological disease.
22465202|a|Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) have provided enormous opportunities for the therapeutic application of viral vector gene transfer. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has been the vector of choice in recent clinical trials of neurological disease, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, due to the safety, efficacy, and stability of AAV gene transfer to the CNS. This review highlights the strategies employed for improving direct and peripheral targeting of therapeutic vectors to CNS tissue, and considers the significance of cellular and tissue transduction specificity, transgene regulation, and other variables that influence achievement of successful therapeutic goals. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'New Targets and Approaches to the Treatment of Epilepsy'.
