32886731|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A recent study identified progranulin as a candidate biomarker for frailty, based on gene expression databases. In the present study, we investigated associations between serum progranulin levels and frailty in a population-based sample of late middle-age and older adults. METHODS: We utilized a cohort study that included 358 African Americans (baseline ages 49-65). Frailty was assessed by three established methods: the interview-based FRAIL scale, the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) frailty scale that includes performance-based measurements, and the Frailty Index (FI) that is based on cumulative deficits. Serum levels of the following proteins and metabolites were measured: progranulin, cystatin C, fructosamine, soluble cytokine receptors (interleukin-2 and -6, tumor necrosis factor alpha-1 and -2), and C-reactive protein. Sarcopenia was assessed using the SARC-F index. Vital status was determined by matching through the National Death Index (NDI). RESULTS: Serum progranulin levels were associated with frailty for all indices (FRAIL, CHS, and FI) but not with sarcopenia. Inflammatory markers indicated by soluble cytokine receptors (sIL-2R, sIL-6R, sTNFR1, sTNFR2) were positively associated serum progranulin. Increased serum progranulin levels at baseline predicted poorer outcomes including future frailty as measured by the FRAIL scale and 15-year all-cause mortality independent of age, gender, and frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that serum progranulin levels may be a candidate biomarker for physical frailty, independent of sarcopenia. Further studies are needed to validate this association and assess the utility of serum progranulin levels as a potential biomarker for prevalent frailty, for risk for developing incident frailty, and for mortality risk over and above the effect of baseline frailty.
