38359305|a|The misfolding and aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta40 and Abeta42, the two primary isoforms of Abeta, can not only self-aggregate into homogeneous aggregates but also coaggregate to form mixed fibrils. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a prominent tea polyphenol, has shown the capability to prevent the self-aggregation of Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides and disaggregate their homogeneous fibrils. However, its effects on the cofibrillation of Abeta40 and Abeta42 have not yet been explored. Here, we employed molecular dynamic simulations to investigate the effects of EGCG on the coaggregation of Abeta40 and Abeta42, as well as on their mixed fibril. Our findings indicated that EGCG effectively inhibits the codimerization of Abeta40 and Abeta42 primarily by impeding the interchain interaction between the two isoforms. The key binding sites for EGCG on Abeta40 and Abeta42 are the polar residues and aromatic residues, engaging in hydrogen-bond , pi-pi, and cation-pi interactions with EGCG. Additionally, EGCG disaggregates the Abeta40-Abeta42 mixed fibril by reducing its long-range interaction through similar binding sites and interactions as those between EGCG and Abeta40-Abeta42 heterodimers. Our research reveals the comprehensive inhibition and disaggregation effects of EGCG on the cofibrillation of Abeta isoforms, which provides further support for the development of EGCG as an effective antiaggregation agent for AD.
