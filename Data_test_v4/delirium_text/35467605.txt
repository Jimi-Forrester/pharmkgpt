35467605|t|Medication-induced Psychotic Disorder. A Review of Selected Drugs Side Effects.
35467605|a|BACKGROUND: Medication-induced psychotic disorder (MIPD) is a diagnostic term for a syndrome with symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions directly related to drug intake. The purpose of this review is to report and comment on the current knowledge about pathomechanisms, risk factors, symptoms, and treatment of MIPD caused by selected widely used medications. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched for articles on MIPD published prior to January 2021 using search terms 'psychosis' OR 'psychotic disorder' AND 'side effects' combined with certain medications group. The initial search was then narrowed to medications with more pathomechanisms than only direct dopamine-inducing activity that are widely used by clinicians of various medical specialties. RESULTS: Steroids, antiepileptic drugs, antimalarial drugs, and antiretroviral drugs can induce psychosis with persecutory delusions and auditory hallucinations as the most frequently reported symptoms. Mood changes and anxiety may precede psychosis after steroids and antimalarials. Psychiatric history and female sex are risk factors for most of the MIPD. Treatment involves cessation of the suspected drug. Administration of atypical antipsychotic drugs may be helpful, although there is insufficient data to support this approach. The latter should be done with careful consideration of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. CONCLUSIONS: MIPD is a rare condition. The appearance of psychotic symptoms during systemic treatment may be associated with administered medications, psychiatric comorbidity, or be a part of the clinical picture of a certain disorder. Furthermore, sometimes it may be challenging to distinguish MIPD from delirium. Therefore, we consider that the key to proper management of MIPD is a thorough differential diagnosis.
