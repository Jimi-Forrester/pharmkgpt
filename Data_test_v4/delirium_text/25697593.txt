25697593|a|Antithrombin III (AT III) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been suggested to have high specificity and sensitivity in separating primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma from other neurological conditions. We measured with ELISA CSF and serum AT III and albumin levels in 12 lymphoma patients with CNS involvement, 30 lymphoma patients without CNS involvement, and 41 patients with non-neoplastic neurological diseases. AT III immunostaining was also carried out, in lymphoma patients. Both CSF AT III and albumin levels were higher in lymphoma patients with CNS involvement. AT III/albumin ratio in CSF was the most sensitive and specific measure for diagnosis. Lowest it was in patients with known CNS lymphoma. Serum AT III levels were lower both in CNS lymphoma and systemic lymphoma. CSF AT III levels were shown to be higher in lymphoma patients with CNS involvement, when AT III/albumin ratios were lower. This was probably a result of lowered serum AT III levels, indicating that high levels of AT III in CSF might reflect only leakage of the blood-brain barrier. Thus, AT III fails to be a specific marker for diagnosis of lymphoma CNS involvement.
