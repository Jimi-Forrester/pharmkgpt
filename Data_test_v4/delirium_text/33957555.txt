33957555|a|The default mode network (DMN) overlaps with regions showing early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology. Age, sex, and apolipoprotein E e4 are the predominant risk factors for developing AD. How these risk factors interact to influence DMN connectivity and connectivity-cognition relationships before the onset of impairment remains unknown. Here, we examined these issues in 475 cognitively normal adults, targeting total DMN connectivity, its anticorrelated network (acDMN), and the DMN-hippocampal component. There were four main findings. First, in the e3 homozygous group, lower DMN and acDMN connectivity was observed with age. Second, sex and e4 modified the relationship between age and connectivity for the DMN and hippocampus with e4 vs. e3 males showing sustained or higher connectivity with age. Third, in the e3 group, age and sex modified connectivity-cognition relationships with the oldest participants having the most differential patterns due to sex. Fourth, e4 carriers with lower connectivity had poorer cognitive performance. Taken together, our results show the three predominant risk factors for AD interact to influence brain function and function-cognition relationships.
