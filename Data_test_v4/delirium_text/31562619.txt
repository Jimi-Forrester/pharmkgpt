31562619|t|The Evolving Role of Specialized Pro-resolving Mediators in Modulating Neuroinflammation in Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders.
31562619|a|Surgery can be a life-saving procedure; however, significant complications may occur after routine procedures especially in older and more frail patients. Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs), including delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, are the most common complications in older adults following common procedures such as orthopedic or cardiac surgery. The consequences of PNDs can be devastating, with longer in-hospital stay, poorer prognosis, and higher mortality rates. Inflammation is gaining considerable interest as a critical driver of cognitive deficits. In this regard, resolution of inflammation, once thought to be a passive process, may provide novel approaches to treat neuroinflammation and PNDs. Herein we review the role for impaired resolution after surgery and the growing role of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in regulating postoperative neuroinflammation and neurological complications after surgery.
