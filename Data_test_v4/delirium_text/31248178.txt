31248178|t|Transcriptomic Insights into the Response of the Olfactory Bulb to Selenium Treatment in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
31248178|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of extracellular senile plaques primarily composed of Abeta peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Olfactory dysfunction is an early clinical phenotype in AD and was reported to be attributable to the presence of NFTs, senile Abeta plaques in the olfactory bulb (OB). Our previous research found that selenomethionine (Se-Met), a major form of selenium (Se) in organisms, effectively increased oxidation resistance as well as reduced the generation and deposition of Abeta and tau hyperphosphorylation in the olfactory bulb of a triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD), thereby suggesting a potential therapeutic option for AD. In this study, we further investigated changes in the transcriptome data of olfactory bulb tissues of 7-month-old triple transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice treated with Se-Met (6 microg/mL) for three months. Comparison of the gene expression profile between Se-Met-treated and control mice revealed 143 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among these genes, 21 DEGs were upregulated and 122 downregulated. The DEGs were then annotated against the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. The results show that upregulated genes can be roughly classified into three types. Some of them mainly regulate the regeneration of nerves, such as Fabp7, Evt5 and Gal; some are involved in improving cognition and memory, such as Areg; and some are involved in anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis, such as Adcyap1 and Scg2. The downregulated genes are mainly associated with inflammation and apoptosis, such as Lrg1, Scgb3a1 and Pglyrp1. The reliability of the transcriptomic data was validated by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for the selected genes. These results were in line with our previous study, which indicated therapeutic effects of Se-Met on AD mice, providing a theoretical basis for further study of the treatment of AD by Se-Met.
