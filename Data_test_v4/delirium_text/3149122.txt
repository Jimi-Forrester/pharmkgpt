3149122|a|Light microscopic immunohistochemical investigations were performed on neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in four histologically confirmed cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in five patients with a progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The antibody panel included antisera to the neuronal microtubule-associated protein, tau, and to isolated paired helical filaments (PHF), as well as mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to phosphorylated epitopes on high and medium molecular weight neurofilament subunits (RT97 and BF10, respectively). Paraffin sections were also impregnated with the Gallyas silver method, which specifically stains tangles and cortical neuropil threads in AD, but does not stain normal neurofilaments. All tangles in PSP and AD showed consistent immunostaining with antibodies to tau protein and isolated PHF, regardless of their localization. MAbs RT97 and BF10, however, did not stain or only weakly stained, subcortical tangles in PSP and AD, whereas most cortical NFT in AD were intensely immunostained. All tangles in PSP were as heavily impregnated with Gallyas as they were in AD. Furthermore there were extensive networks of Gallyas-positive, tau- and PHF-immunoreactive neurites in subcortical gray areas containing NFT, and bundles of positive axons in white matter tracts interconnecting subcortical nuclei of PSP. Our studies indicate a much more extensive disruption of fibrillar proteins in PSP subcortical neurons than previously reported. They furthermore indicate a very similar antigenic profile of NFT in PSP and AD, as far as subcortical neurons are concerned.
