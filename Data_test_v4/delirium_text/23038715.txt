23038715|t|Association of Alzheimer's Disease With APOE and IL-1alpha Gene Polymorphisms.
23038715|a|Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene polymorphisms are thought to be the most important genetic risk factor in the pathogenesis of late onset and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) is found to be associated with the pathogenesis of AD. In this research,  2,  3, and  4 polymorphisms of ApoE gene and C889T polymorphism of IL-1alpha gene were genotyped in patients with AD and controls. Genotyping was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.  3/ 3 and  3/ 4 genotype frequencies were significantly higher in control and case groups, respectively. While  3 allele frequencies were significantly higher in the control group,  2 and  4 allele frequencies were significantly higher among the cases with AD. No difference was found between the groups according to C889T polymorphism of IL-1alpha. In conclusion, we demonstrated that there was a strong association between ApoE  4 allele and AD, while there was no relation with IL-1alpha C889T polymorphisms for this study.
