32627085|t|Dopamine-induced photoluminescence quenching of bovine serum albumin-capped manganese-doped zinc sulphide quantum dots.
32627085|a|The direct detection of dopamine (DA) in human body fluids is a great challenge for medical diagnostics of neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, and schizophrenia. In this work, a simple and turn off luminescence sensing of DA based on bovine serum albumin (BSA)-capped manganese-doped zinc sulphide quantum dots (Mn:ZnS/BSA QDs) is developed. The Mn:ZnS/BSA QDs were synthesized by a chemical co-precipitation method. Due to the special interaction of DA with BSA and metal ions, Mn:ZnS/BSA QDs can serve as an effective sensing platform for DA. The luminescence of Mn:ZnS/BSA QDs decreased linearly with increasing concentration of DA in the range from 6.6 to 50.6 nM. The limit of detection is 2.02 nM. The driving force for the luminescence quenching is partly provided by ground-state complex formation of QDs with DA. The photo-induced electron transfer from the conduction band of QDs to oxidized dopamine (quinone) also favors quenching. The Mn:ZnS/BSA QDs are barely interfered with by other competing biomolecules except catecholamine neurotransmitter like epinephrine. Moreover, this method is used in the analysis of DA-spiked human serum and human urine samples and good recovery percentages are found. To assess the utility of the developed sensor, paper strip assay was also successfully conducted. Graphical abstract.
