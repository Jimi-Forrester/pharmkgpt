34834465|t|Gut Microbiota as Early Predictor of Infectious Complications before Cardiac Surgery: A Prospective Pilot Study.
34834465|a|Cardiac surgery remains a field of medicine with a high percentage of postoperative complications, including infectious ones. Modern data indicate a close relationship of infectious disorders with pathological changes in the composition of the gut microbiome; however, the extent of such changes in cardiac surgery patients is not fully clarified. In this prospective, observational, single center, pilot study, 72 patients were included, 12 among them with the infectious complications. We analyzed the features of the fecal microbiota before and in the early postoperative period, as one of the markers for predicting the occurrence of bacterial infection. We also discovered the significant change in microbial composition in the group of patients with infectious complications compared to the non-infectious group before and after cardiac surgery, despite the intra-individual variation in composition of gut microbiome. Our study demonstrated that the group of patients that had a bacterial infection in the early postoperative period already had an altered microbial composition even before the surgery. Further studies will evaluate the clinical significance of the identified proportions of individual taxa of the intestinal microbiota and consider the microbiota as a novel target for reducing the risk of infectious complications.
