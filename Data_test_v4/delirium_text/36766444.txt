36766444|t|R4Alz-Revised: A Tool Able to Strongly Discriminate 'Subjective Cognitive Decline' from Healthy Cognition and 'Minor Neurocognitive Disorder'.
36766444|a|BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of the minor neurocognitive diseases in the clinical course of dementia before the clinical symptoms' appearance is the holy grail of neuropsychological research. The R4Alz battery is a novel and valid tool that was designed to assess cognitive control in people with minor cognitive disorders. The aim of the current study is the R4Alz battery's extension (namely R4Alz-R), enhanced by the design and administration of extra episodic memory tasks, as well as extra cognitive control tasks, towards improving the overall R4Alz discriminant validity. METHODS: The study comprised 80 people: (a) 20 Healthy adults (HC), (b) 29 people with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), and (c) 31 people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The groups differed in age and educational level. RESULTS: Updating, inhibition, attention switching, and cognitive flexibility tasks discriminated SCD from HC (p <= 0.003). Updating, switching, cognitive flexibility, and episodic memory tasks discriminated SCD from MCI (p <= 0.001). All the R4Alz-R's tasks discriminated HC from MCI (p <= 0.001). The R4Alz-R was free of age and educational level effects. The battery discriminated perfectly SCD from HC and HC from MCI (100% sensitivity-95% specificity and 100% sensitivity-90% specificity, respectively), whilst it discriminated excellently SCD from MCI (90.3% sensitivity-82.8% specificity). CONCLUSION: SCD seems to be stage a of neurodegeneration since it can be objectively evaluated via the R4Alz-R battery, which seems to be a useful tool for early diagnosis.
