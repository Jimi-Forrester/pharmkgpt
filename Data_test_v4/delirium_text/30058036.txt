30058036|t|Lipidomics: a promising cancer biomarker.
30058036|a|The prevention, diagnosis and targeted therapies of cancer are important in cancer controlling and treatment. The present challenge about cancer biomarker still remains in identifying the special biomarkers for predicting cancer risk and assessing patient's response during anticancer treatment. Lipidomics, in simple definition is the quantification of all lipids in a confined biological entity. Lipids play roles in membrane structure, energy storage, and signal transduction as well as in human cancers. Previous researches indicated that lipids may serve as a promising biomarker in the early diagnoses and individualized treatment of cancer.
