38503671|t|Requesting That Delirium Achieve Parity With Acute Encephalopathy in the MS-DRG System.
38503671|a|Since 2007, the Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups classification system has favored billing codes for acute encephalopathy over delirium codes in determining hospital reimbursement and several quality-of-care value metrics, despite broad overlap between these sets of diagnostic codes. Toxic and metabolic encephalopathy codes are designated as major complication or comorbidity, whereas causally specified delirium codes are designated as complication or comorbidity and thus associated with a lower reimbursement and lesser impact on value metrics. The authors led a submission to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requesting that causally specified delirium be designated major complication or comorbidity alongside toxic and metabolic encephalopathy. Delirium warrants reclassification because it satisfies U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' guiding principles for re-evaluating Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group severity levels. Delirium: (1) has a bidirectional relationship with the permanent condition of dementia (major neurocognitive disorder per DSM-5-TR), (2) indexes vulnerability across populations, (3) impacts healthcare systems across levels of care, (4) complicates postoperative recovery, (5) consigns patients to higher levels of care, (6) impedes patient engagement in care, (7) has several recent treatment guidelines, (8) often indicates neuronal/brain injury, and (9) represents a common expression of terminal illness. The proposal's impact was explored using the 2019 National Inpatient Sample, which suggested that increasing delirium's complexity designation would lead to an upcoding of less than 1% of eligible discharges. Parity for delirium is essential to enhancing awareness of delirium's clinical and economic costs. Appreciating delirium's impact would encourage delirium prevention and screening efforts, thereby mitigating its dire outcomes for patients, families, and healthcare systems.
