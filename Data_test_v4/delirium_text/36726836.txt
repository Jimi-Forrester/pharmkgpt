36726836|t|Skeletal Muscle Myokine Expression in Critical Illness, Association With Outcome and Impact of Therapeutic Interventions.
36726836|a|Context: Muscle expresses and secretes several myokines that bring about benefits in distant organs. Objective: We investigated the impact of critical illness on muscular expression of irisin, kynurenine aminotransferases, and amylase; association with clinical outcome; and impact of interventions that attenuate muscle wasting/weakness. Methods: We studied critically ill patients who participated in 2 randomized controlled trials (EPaNIC/NESCI) and documented time profiles in critically ill mice. Included in the study were 174 intensive care unit (ICU) patients (day 8 +- 1) vs 19 matched controls, and 60 mice subjected to surgery/sepsis vs 60 pair-fed healthy mice. Interventions studied included 7-day neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), and withholding parenteral nutrition (PN) in the first ICU week (late PN) vs early PN. The main outcome measures were FNDC5 (irisin- precursor), KYAT1, KYAT3, and amylase mRNA expression in skeletal muscle. Results: Critically ill patients showed 34% to 80% lower mRNA expression of FNDC5, KYAT1, and amylases than controls (P < .0001). Critically ill mice showed time-dependent reductions in all mRNAs compared with healthy mice (P <= .04). The lower FNDC5 expression in patients was independently associated with a higher ICU mortality (P = .015) and ICU-acquired weakness (P = .012), whereas the lower amylase expression in ICU survivors was independently associated with a longer ICU stay (P = .0060). Lower amylase expression was independently associated with a lower risk of death (P = .048), and lower KYAT1 expression with a lower risk of weakness (P = .022). NMES increased FNDC5 expression compared with unstimulated muscle (P = .016), and late PN patients had a higher KYAT1 expression than early PN patients (P = .022). Conclusion: Expression of the studied myokines was affected by critical illness and associated with clinical outcomes, with limited effects of interventions that attenuate muscle wasting or weakness.
