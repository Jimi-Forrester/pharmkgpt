38262636|t|Does pain optimisation impact delirium outcomes in critically ill patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.
38262636|a|BACKGROUND: Untreated pain is associated with short-term and long-term consequences, including post-traumatic stress disorder and insomnia. Side effects of some analgesic medications include dysphoria, hallucinations and delirium. Therefore, both untreated pain and analgesic medications may be risk factors for delirium. Delirium is associated with longer length of stay or cognitive impairment. Our systematic review and meta-analysis will examine the relationship between pain or analgesic medications with delirium occurrence, duration and severity among critically ill adults. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials and a review of recent conference abstracts will be searched without restriction from inception to 15 May 2023. Study inclusion criteria are: (1) age>=18 years admitted to intensive care; (2) report a measure of pain, analgesic medications and delirium; (3) study design-randomised controlled trial, quasiexperimental designs and observational cohort and case-control studies excluding case reports. Study exclusion criteria are: (1) alcohol withdrawal delirium or delirium tremens; or (2) general anaesthetic emergence delirium; or (3) lab or animal studies. Risk of bias will be assessed with the Risk of Bias V.2 and risk of bias in non-randomised studies tools. There is no language restriction. Occurrence estimates will be transformed using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine. Point estimates will be pooled using Hartung-Knapp Sidik-Jonkman random effects meta-analysis to estimate a pooled risk ratio. Statistical heterogeneity will be estimated with the I2 statistic. Risk of small study effects will be assessed using funnel plots and Egger test. Studies will be analysed for time-varying and unmeasured confounding using E values. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required as this is an analysis of published aggregated data. We will share our findings at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: The finalised protocol was submitted to the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO ID: CRD42022367715).
