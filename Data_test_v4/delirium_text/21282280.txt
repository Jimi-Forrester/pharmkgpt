21282280|a|BACKGROUND: Rivastigmine patches provide similar efficacy to rivastigmine capsules with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal side effects in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Post hoc analysis of a 24-week, prospective, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trial. Patients (n = 892) with probable AD received rivastigmine transdermal patches (9.5 mg/24 hours [10 cm(2)]), rivastigmine capsules (6 mg twice daily), or placebo, and impact on activities of daily living (ADLs) was assessed utilizing 3 subscales: basic, high-level function, and autonomy. RESULTS: At week 24, both rivastigmine groups demonstrated significantly superior performance in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Total Score versus placebo (rivastigmine patch, P = .013; capsules, P = .039). Overall, both rivastigmine formulations provided benefits in ADL subscales. For basic ADLs, rivastigmine capsules performed significantly better than placebo (P = .012). For high-level function ADLs, rivastigmine patch performed better than placebo (P = .056). For autonomy ADLs, rivastigmine patch performed significantly better than placebo (P = .017). CONCLUSION: Rivastigmine patches and capsules provide significant effects in both total and subscale ADLs in patients with probable AD.
