29022905|a|Oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal cell death have important roles in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) is a critical factor in regulating mitochondrial dynamics. A variety of posttranslational modifications of Drp1 have been reported, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation and S-nitrosylation. In this study, we found that c-Abl phosphorylated Drp1 at tyrosine 266, 368 and 449 in vitro and in vivo, which augmented the GTPase activity of Drp1 and promoted Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation. Consistently, c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation is important for GTPase activity of Drp1 and mitochondrial fragmentation. Furthermore, we found that Drp1 phosphorylation mediated by c-Abl is required for oxidative stress-induced cell death in primary cortical neurons. Taken together, our findings reveal that c-Abl-Drp1 signaling pathway regulates oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death, which might be a potential target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
