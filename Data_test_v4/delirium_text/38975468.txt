38975468|t|Pneumonia in Geriatric Patients and Prediction of Mortality Based on the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), CURB-65, Frailty Index (FI), and FI-Lab21 Scores.
38975468|a|Background Elderly individuals have higher rates of morbidity, death, and financial burden due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Objectives The study aimed to assess the outcomes of geriatric pneumonia patients and the prediction of mortality based on the pneumonia severity index (PSI), CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and 65-year-old score), frailty index (frailty index), and FI-Lab21 (21-item frailty index based on laboratory) scores. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted on 100 elderly patients (>= 65 years) with CAP. PSI, CURB-65, FI, and FI-Lab21 scores were determined. The outcome measures were 30-day mortality and the risk factors of mortality. The mortality predictive value of scores were compared. Results The mean age of the study subjects was 72.14 +- 6.1 years. Specifically, 76 (76%) were male, and 24 (24%) were females. During the follow-up, there was a 30-day mortality rate of 57%. On performing multivariate regression, the PSI score and severely frail were significant independent risk factors of mortality, with an odds ratio of 1.046 and 52.213, respectively. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) showed that the performance of the PSI score (AUC: 0.952; 95% CI: 0.910-0.994), CURB-65 score (AUC: 0.936; 95% CI: 0.893-0.978), and severely frail (AUC: 0.907; 95% CI: 0.851-0.962) was outstanding, while FI-Lab21 (AUC: 0.515; 95% CI: 0.400-0.631) was non-significant. Among all the parameters, the PSI score was the best predictor of mortality at the cutoff points of >121 with a diagnostic accuracy of 92%. Conclusion CAP in the elderly carries a high mortality rate. Out of PSI, CURB-65, FI, and FI-Lab21 scores, the PSI holds the best predicting ability for mortality.
