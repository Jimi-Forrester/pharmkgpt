23254638|a|Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), featuring in most of the Alzheimer's disease spectrum, plays a detrimental role in brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) homeostasis, cerebrovascular morbidity, and cognitive decline; therefore, early management of cerebrovascular pathology is considered to be important for intervention in the impending cognitive decline. S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) is an endogenous nitric oxide carrier modulating endothelial function, inflammation, and neurotransmission. Therefore, the effect of GSNO treatment on CCH-associated neurocognitive pathologies was determined in vivo by using rats with permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO), a rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. We observed that rats subjected to permanent BCCAO showed a significant decrease in learning/memory performance and increases in brain levels of Abeta and vascular inflammatory markers. GSNO treatment (50 mug/kg/day for 2 months) significantly improved learning and memory performance of BCCAO rats and reduced the Abeta levels and ICAM-1/VCAM-1 expression in the brain. Further, in in vitro cell culture studies, GSNO treatment also decreased the cytokine-induced proinflammatory responses, such as activations of NFkappaB and STAT3 and expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in endothelial cells. In addition, GSNO treatment increased the endothelial and microglial Abeta uptake. Additionally, GSNO treatment inhibited the beta-secretase activity in primary rat neuron cell culture, thus reducing secretion of Abeta, suggesting GSNO mediated mechanisms in anti-inflammatory and anti-amyloidogenic activities. Taken together, these data document that systemic GSNO treatment is beneficial for improvement of cognitive decline under the conditions of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and suggests a potential therapeutic use of GSNO for cerebral hypoperfusion associated mild cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.
