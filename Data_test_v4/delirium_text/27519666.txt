27519666|t|Molecularly imprinted microparticles in lipid-based formulations for sustained release of donepezil.
27519666|a|Donepezil is a drug administered for Alzheimer's disease treatment, and it is a potential template molecule for imprinted microparticles. The precipitation polymerization technique allows the synthesis of spherical imprinted microparticles, and the intermolecular interactions among drug and molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) play a promising role for delineating drug delivery systems. Once that donepezil is a poorly-water soluble compound, lipid based-formulations (LBFs) may enhance its oral administration. Based on this, LBFs are useful vehicles to incorporate imprinted microparticles synthesized by precipitation polymerization. In these formulations, the drug dissolved in lipids is accessible to adsorbate in the polymers, and the hydrophobic environment of lipids increases the molecular recognition of MIPs. The formulations based on MIPs using pure oleic acid as vehicle prolong the in vitro release of donepezil up to several hours by a Fickian diffusion mechanism, and it provides a multiphasic release pattern related to the heterogeneity of the binding sites. The modulation of donepezil release from MIPs-based formulations using oil vehicles may contribute to decrease its side effects, possibly regulating its absorption rate in the gastrointestinal tract. These systems represent a novel technological platform to prolong the delivery not only for donepezil, but also for a variety of therapeutics.
