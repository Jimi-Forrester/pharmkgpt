36526314|a|OBJECTIVES: To describe representativeness in the Gothenburg H70 1930 Birth Cohort Study. DESIGN: Repeated cross-sectional examinations of a population-based study. SETTING: Gothenburg, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: All residents of Gothenburg, Sweden, born on specific birth dates in 1930 were invited to a comprehensive health examination at ages 70, 75, 79, 85 and 88. The number of participants at each examination was 524 at age 70, 767 at age 75, 580 at age 79, 416 at age 85, and 258 at age 88. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We compared register data on sociodemographic characteristics and hospital discharge diagnoses between participants and (1) refusals, (2) all same-aged individuals in Gothenburg and (3) all same-aged individuals in Sweden. We also compared mortality rates between participants and refusals. RESULTS: Refusal rate increased with age. At two or more examination waves, participants compared with refusals had higher educational level, more often had osteoarthritis, had lower mortality rates, had lower prevalence of neuropsychiatric, alcohol-related and cardiovascular disorders, and were more often married. At two examination waves, participants compared with same-aged individuals in Gothenburg had higher education and were more often born in Sweden. At two examination waves or more, participants compared with same-aged individuals in Sweden had higher education, had higher average income, less often had ischaemic heart disease, were less often born in Sweden and were more often divorced. CONCLUSIONS: Participants were more similar to the target population in Gothenburg than to refusals and same-aged individuals in Sweden. Our study shows the importance of having different comparison groups when assessing representativeness of population studies, which is important in evaluating generalisability of results. The study also contributes unique and up-to-date knowledge about participation bias in these high age groups.
