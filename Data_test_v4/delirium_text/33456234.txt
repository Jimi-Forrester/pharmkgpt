The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro anticancer efficacy of hydroalcoholic fruit extract of cranberry against oral cancer KB cell line by Di-Methyl Thiazoldiphenyl Tetrazolium bromide assay (MTT) assay and its cytotoxicity on normal fibroblast cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vaccinium macrocarpon extract was prepared using a hydroethanolic solvent (water - 30%:ethanol - 70%) using the standardized maceration protocol. Standard KB and normal fibroblast (L929) cell lines were used. The minimum lethal effect of the extract was calculated using the MTT cytotoxicity assay. RESULTS: The extract shows a satisfactory antiproliferative effect on the KB cell line and a higher cell viability percentage of the normal fibroblast cell line. CONCLUSION: V. macrocarpon can prove to be an adjunct to the existing anticancer drug therapy against oral cancer KB cell line.
