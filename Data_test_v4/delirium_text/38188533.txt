38188533|t|Reducing Preoperative Caregiver Anxiety With Virtual Reality: A Pragmatic, Randomized Controlled Study.
38188533|a|Pediatric patients and their caregivers often experience perioperative anxiety. Interventions reduce caregiver anxiety improve cooperation and contribute to an improved patient experience. This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality (VR)-assisted mindfulness on perioperative caregiver anxiety. Participants were randomized into a standard of care (SOC) group, which included snacks but no technology-based distractions, or a VR group, which included snacks and a VR-guided meditation. Caregiver anxiety was measured before and after the intervention using the Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety (VAS-A). Secondary aims explored participants' baseline anxiety with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). VR group participants completed a satisfaction survey. Linear regression models of VAS-A and STAI were used to compare group differences. Satisfaction survey results were reported with descriptive statistics. 26 participants were included, with 12 randomized to the SOC group and 14 to the VR group. VAS-A scores in the VR group were lower than those in the SOC group (p = .002). The STAI found no change in participants' state of anxiety in the SOC group (p = .7108), compared to a significant reduction (p = .014) in the VR group when controlling for anxiety traits. 12 of 14 caregivers in the VR group expressed satisfaction or strong satisfaction. This study supports the implementation of VR mindfulness as a method to reduce caregiver anxiety. VR use in the pediatric healthcare setting is safe and inexpensive, and the intervention had a high degree of participant satisfaction.
