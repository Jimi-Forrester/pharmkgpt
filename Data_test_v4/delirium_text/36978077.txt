36978077|a|BACKGROUND: Emerging data suggests the neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory effects of glucosamine. We aimed to examine the association between regular glucosamine use and risk of incident dementia, including dementia subtypes. METHODS: We conducted large-scale observational and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Participants in UK Biobank having accessible data for dementia incidence and who did not have dementia at baseline were included in the prospective cohort. Through the Cox proportional hazard model, we examined the risks of incident all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia among glucosamine users and non-users. To further test the causal association between glucosamine use and dementia, we conducted a 2-sample MR utilizing summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The GWAS data were obtained from observational cohort participants of mostly European ancestry. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 8.9 years, there were 2458 cases of all-cause dementia, 924 cases of AD, and 491 cases of vascular dementia. In multivariable analysis, the hazard ratios (HR) of glucosamine users for all-cause dementia, AD, and vascular dementia were 0.84 (95% CI 0.75-0.93), 0.83 (95% CI 0.71-0.98), and 0.74 (95% CI 0.58-0.95), respectively. The inverse associations between glucosamine use and AD appeared to be stronger among participants aged below 60 years than those aged above 60 years (p = 0.04 for interaction). The APOE genotype did not modify this association (p > 0.05 for interaction). Single-variable MR suggested a causal relationship between glucosamine use and lower dementia risk. Multivariable MR showed that taking glucosamine continued to protect against dementia after controlling for vitamin, chondroitin supplement use and osteoarthritis (all-cause dementia HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.95; AD HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.72-0.85; vascular dementia HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57-0.94). Single and multivariable inverse variance weighted (MV-IVW) and MR-Egger sensitivity analyses produced similar results for these estimations. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this large-scale cohort and MR analysis provide evidence for potential causal associations between the glucosamine use and lower risk for dementia. These findings require further validation through randomized controlled trials.
