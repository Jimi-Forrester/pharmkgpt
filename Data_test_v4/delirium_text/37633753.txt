37633753|a|Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the progressive dysfunction and death of selectively vulnerable neuronal populations, often associated with the accumulation of aggregated host proteins. Sustained brain inflammation and hyperactivation of inflammasome complexes have been increasingly demonstrated to contribute to neurodegenerative disease progression. Here, we review molecular mechanisms leading to inflammasome assembly in neurodegeneration. We focus primarily on four degenerative brain disorders in which inflammasome hyperactivation has been well documented: Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and the spectrum of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We discuss shared and divergent principles of inflammasome assembly across these disorders, and underscore the differences between neurodegeneration-associated inflammasome activation pathways and their peripheral-immune counterparts. We examine how aberrant assembly of inflammasome complexes may amplify pathology in neurodegeneration, including misfolded protein aggregation, and highlight prospects for neurotherapeutic interventions based on targeting inflammasome pathways.
