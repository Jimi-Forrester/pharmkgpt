38392480|t|Quality of Life in Metabolic Syndrome Patients Based on the Risk of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.
38392480|a|Despite the impact of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on a sizeable proportion of the global population, the difference in the quality of life (QoL) between a group without risk factors for OSA and a group with risk factors for OSA among individuals with MetS is currently unclear. This study aimed to identify the determinants of QoL in patients with MetS with and without OSA risk factors and to analyze differences between these two groups. Data were extracted from the 2020 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). The Rao-Scott chi2 test was performed to evaluate differences in baseline characteristics based on OSA risk factors. A t-test was performed to evaluate differences in the baseline QoL, and linear regression analysis was performed to identify the effect on the QoL of the two groups. The factors affecting QoL in the low-risk group included age, education level, and depression. The factors affecting QoL in the high-risk group were physical activity and depression. These results suggest that nursing interventions should be devised according to patients' characteristics to help improve their QoL.
