34589880|a|Neurotoxoplasmosis, also known as cerebral toxoplasmosis, is an opportunistic chronic infection caused by the persistence of parasite Toxoplasma gondii cysts in the brain. In wild animals, chronic infection is associated with behavioral manipulation evident by an altered risk perception towards predators. In humans, reactivation of cysts and conversion of quiescent parasites into highly invasive tachyzoites is a significant cause of mortality in immunocompromised patients. However, the current standard therapy for toxoplasmosis is not well tolerated and is ineffective against the parasite cysts. In recent years, the concept of dietary supplementation with natural products derived from plants has gained popularity as a natural remedy for brain disorders. Notably, urolithin-A, a metabolite produced in the gut following consumption of ellagitannins-enriched food such as pomegranate, is reported to be blood-brain barrier permeable and exhibits neuroprotective effects in-vivo. In this study, we investigated the potential of pomegranate extract and urolithin-A as anti-neurotoxoplasmosis agents in-vitro and in-vivo. Treatment with pomegranate extract and urolithin-A reduced the parasite tachyzoite load and interfered with cyst development in differentiated human neural culture. Administration of urolithin-A also resulted in the formation of smaller brain cysts in chronically infected mice. Interestingly, this phenomenon was mirrored by an enhanced risk perception of the UA-treated infected mice towards predatory cues. Together, our findings demonstrate the potential of dietary supplementation with urolithin-A-enriched food as a novel natural remedy for the treatment of acute and chronic neurotoxoplasmosis.
