27128368|t|Attitudes and Perceptions of Research in Aging and Dementia in an Urban Minority Population.
27128368|a|In dementia trials, minority participation is low. We assessed attitudes toward research in a community based urban poor minority sample of elderly adults attending senior center talks using the 7-item Research Attitudes Questionnaire (RAQ). Presentations on cognitive aging were given at senior centers, and 123 attendees completed the RAQ-7. On trust and safety questions, a significant minority (42-48%) responded neutrally or negatively. Encouragingly, on questions concerning the importance of research, 72-81% answered positively. More work can be done to capitalize on these findings to engage and foster trust, and this can be a focus of outreach.
