31703779|t|Delirium Superimposed on Dementia: Challenges and Opportunities.
31703779|a|Delirium superimposed on dementia is an acute medical illness that is difficult to diagnose because of the similarities of the symptoms to dementia. Delirium can contribute to the suffering of the patient as well as the family and caregiver. An initial holistic assessment of the patient is critical in establishing the cognitive baseline symptoms of delirium. Prevention of delirium can be assisted by ongoing reassessment of the patient for symptoms of delirium. The goal of treatment is to treat the underlying cause of the delirium.
