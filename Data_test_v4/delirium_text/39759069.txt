39759069|a|Background and Aims: Emergence delirium (ED) during the postanesthesia recovery phase presents significant challenges, especially among pediatric patients, with incidence rates spanning from 2% to 80%. This study sought to assess and compare the effectiveness of propofol and dexmedetomidine in addressing ED in pediatric patients undergoing sevoflurane anesthesia. The primary aim was to ascertain the prevalence of ED in both treatment cohorts, while secondary outcomes encompassed postoperative pain, hemodynamic responses, and the occurrence of complications. Material and Methods: Eighty children aged 2-6 years scheduled for short infraumbilical surgeries under general anesthesia were recruited in this trial. Propofol (1 mg/kg) or dexmedetomidine (0.3 mug/kg) was administered 10 min before completion of surgery. The Paediatric Anaesthesia Emergence Delirium scale was employed to evaluate ED every 5 min following extubation, wherein a score exceeding 12 was indicative of ED. Postoperative sedation was assessed using the Ramsay Sedation Scale, while pain levels were determined through the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) score. Any potential complications were closely monitored. Results: The incidence of ED at extubation was 2.50% and 70% in group D and P, respectively, and the trend of lower ED incidence was consistently observed at 5, 10, 15, and 30 min postextubation. The relative risk ratio at extubation was 4.103 (95% confidence interval: 2.49-6.76), highlighting a significant reduction of 4.1 times in the risk of ED when dexmedetomidine was administered. The dexmedetomidine group exhibited a lower incidence of postoperative pain. Conclusion: In comparison to propofol, dexmedetomidine demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing ED and postoperative pain in pediatric patients during general anesthesia, when administered before completion of surgery.
