36221378|a|Buyang Huanwu Decoction, a traditional Chinese medicine decoction, is widely used to treat spinal cord injury in China. However, the underlying mechanism of this decoction in treating spinal cord injury is unclear. This study used network pharmacology and molecular docking to examine the pharmacological mechanism of Buyang Huanwu Decoction in prevention and treatment of spinal cord injury. The active compounds and target genes of Buyang Huanwu Decoction were collected from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology and the SwissTargetPrediction Database. The network diagram of "traditional Chinese medicine compound target" was constructed by Cytoscape software. Genetic data of spinal cord injury were obtained by GeneCards database. According to the intersection of Buyang Huanwu Decoction's targets and disease targets, the core targets were searched. The protein-protein interaction network were constructed using the STRING and BisoGenet platforms. Meanwhile, gene ontology enrichment and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes, and genome pathway were performed on the intersection targets by Metascape. Molecular docking technology was adopted to verify the combination of main components and core targets. A total of 109 active compounds and 5440 prediction targets were screened from 7 Chinese herbal medicines of Buyang Huanwu Decoction, with 98 active components and 49 related prediction targets being strongly linked to Spinal Cord Injury. By studying protein-protein interaction network, a total of 8 core proteins were identified, primarily interleukin-6, tumor protein P53, epidermal growth factor receptor, and others. Positive regulation of kinase activity regulation of reaction to inorganic chemicals are the basic biological processes. Buyang Huanwu Decoction cures Spinal Cord Injury primarily by moderating immunological inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress, which involves the cancer pathway, the HIF-1 signaling pathway, the p53 signaling pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, and so on. The results of molecular docking demonstrated that the primary components could attach to the target protein effectively. Finally, the mechanism of Buyang Huanwu Decoction in the treatment of spinal cord injury through multicomponent, multitarget, and multichannel was deeply explored. And it offers new ideas and directions for future research on the mechanism of the treatment of spinal cord injury.
