33170738|t|FDG PET/MRI for Visual Detection of Crossed Cerebellar Diaschisis in Patients With Dementia.
33170738|a|OBJECTIVE: Depressed regional metabolism and cerebellar blood flow may be caused by dysfunction in anatomically separate but functionally related regions, presumably related to disruption of the corticopontine-cerebellar pathway. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) in patients undergoing 18F-FDG PET/MRI for suspected neurodegenerative disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 75 patients (31 men, 44 women; mean age, 74 years) underwent hybrid FDG PET/MRI for clinical workup of neurodegenerative disease. Images were obtained with an integrated 3-T PET/MRI system. PET surface maps, fused T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo and axial FLAIR/PET images were generated with postprocessing software. Two board-certified neuroradiologists and a nuclear medicine physician blinded to patient history evaluated for pattern of neurodegenerative disease and CCD. RESULTS: Qualitative assessment showed that 10 of 75 (7.5%) patients had decreased FDG activity in the cerebellar hemisphere contralateral to the supratentorial cortical hypometabolism consistent with CCD. Six of the 10 patients had characteristic imaging findings of frontotemporal dementia (three behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, two semantic primary progressive aphasia, and one logopenic primary progressive aphasia), three had suspected corticobasal degeneration, and one had Alzheimer dementia. CONCLUSION: Our study results suggest that CCD occurs most commonly in frontotemporal dementia, particularly the behavioral variant, and in patients with cortico-basal degeneration. Careful attention to cerebellar metabolism may assist in the clinical evaluation of patients with cognitive impairment undergoing FDG PET/MRI as part of their routine dementia workup.
