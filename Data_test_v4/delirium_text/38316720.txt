38316720|t|Delirium is not dementia: Delirium Awareness Day-related event at the University Hospital in Krakow.
38316720|a|PURPOSE: To present the two-day Delirium Awareness Day-related event held at the University Hospital, Krakow, Poland. METHODS: Activities included a lecture, a multimedia presentation, meetings with healthcare workers at their respective wards, and distribution of information posters about delirium. Local news outlets were also engaged. RESULTS: We reached out to approximately 300 persons in the hospital itself and several thousand via TV and radio broadcasts. We prompted interdisciplinary discussions about delirium, especially concerning preventive measures. The most common questions were how to alleviate symptoms as soon as possible, with the expectation of straightforward solutions for the non-geriatrician staff. Patient distress and burden on caregivers were important topics brought-up in the discussions. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that our educational initiative was feasible and well-accepted among medical staff. Local media helped in building public understanding of delirium. Education about the syndrome should be one of the key societal tasks of geriatricians.
