37327760|a|INTRODUCTION: The Geriatric 8 (G8) and Vulnerable Elders Survey-13 (VES-13) are established screening tools for assessing vulnerability in older patients. Here we investigated their usefulness as predictors of length of hospital stay and postoperative complications in Japanese patients undergoing urological surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 643 patients who underwent urological surgery (74% were for malignancy) at our institute from 2017 to 2020. G8 and VES-13 scores were routinely recorded upon admission. These indices and other clinical data were obtained through chart review. The correlation between G8 group (high, >14; intermediate, 11-14; low, <11) or VES-13 group (normal, <3; high, >=3) and length of total hospital stay (LOS), postoperative hospital stay (pLOS), and postoperative complications including delirium were analyzed. RESULTS: The median patient age was 69 years. A total of 44%, 45%, and 11% of patients were classified into high, intermediate, and low G8 groups, respectively, while 77% and 23% were classified into normal and high VES-13 groups, respectively. Univariate analyses revealed that low G8 scores were associated with prolonged LOS (vs. intermediate, odds ratio [OR] 2.87, P < 0.001; vs. high, OR 3.87, P < 0.001), prolonged pLOS (vs. intermediate, OR 2.37, P = 0.005; vs. high, OR 3.06, P < 0.001), and delirium (vs. intermediate, OR 3.23, P = 0.007; vs. high, OR 5.38, P < 0.001), and high VES-13 scores were associated with prolonged LOS (OR 2.85, P < 0.001), prolonged pLOS (OR 2.97, P < 0.001), and Clavien-Dindo grade >= 2 complications (OR 1.74, P = 0.044), and delirium (OR 3.18, P = 0.001). Furthermore, multivariate analyses revealed that low G8 and high VES-13 scores were independent factors which predicted prolonged LOS (low G8; vs. intermediate, OR 2.96, P < 0.001; vs. high, OR 3.94, P < 0.001; high VES-13; OR 2.98, P < 0.001) and prolonged pLOS (low G8; vs. intermediate, OR 2.41, P = 0.008; vs. high, OR 3.18, P = 0.002; high VES-13; OR 3.47, P < 0.001), respectively. DISCUSSION: The G8 and VES-13 may be effective tools for predicting prolonged LOS/pLOS and postoperative complications in Japanese patients who undergo urological surgery.
