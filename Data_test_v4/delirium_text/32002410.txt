32002410|t|A Case of Frequently Relapsing Minimal-Change Nephrotic Syndrome with Steroid-Induced Psychiatric Syndrome Treated by Low-Dose, Short-Term Steroid Therapy in Combination with Cyclosporine.
32002410|a|Adults with minimal-change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) generally receive oral prednisolone (PSL) at an initial dosage of 1.0 mg/kg/day for a minimum of 4 weeks, with 80% of patients achieving clinical remission. However, relapses are frequent, necessitating repeated treatment with high-dose PSL. Long-term treatment with high-dose steroids increases the risk of steroid toxicities, such as diabetes mellitus, gastric complications, infections, osteoporosis, and steroid-induced psychiatric syndrome (SIPS), which may compromise the patient's quality of life. Strategies are therefore needed to reduce the dosage and duration of steroid therapy for frequently relapsing MCNS (FRNS). Here, we suggest a new combination therapy of low-dose and short-term steroid with cyclosporine (CsA). We encountered an adult patient who developed recurrence of FRNS with depression arising from SIPS and was treated using low-dose, short-term PSL combined with CsA. He was successfully treated with PSL at an initial dosage of 0.3 mg/kg/day (20 mg/day) for just 2 weeks combined with CsA, allowing earlier induction of complete remission. We then promptly reduced the dose of PSL to below a physiological dosage (5 mg/day) over 3 weeks without relapse after episodes of SIPS and quickly resolved psychiatric symptoms. CsA in combination with PSL can reduce the initial dosage of PSL, shorten the time to remission, and easily maintain clinical remission. This protocol appears clinically useful and potentially applicable as a future treatment strategy for FRNS troubled by SIPS.
