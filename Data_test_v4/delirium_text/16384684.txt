16384684|a|The initial stages of Alzheimer's disease pathology in the neocortex show upregulation of cell cycle proteins, adhesion and inflammation related factors, indicating the early involvement of inflammatory and regenerating pathways in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. These brain changes precede the neurofibrillary pathology and the extensive process of neurodestruction and (astro)gliosis. Amyloid beta deposition, inflammation and regenerative mechanisms are also early pathogenic events in transgenic mouse models harbouring the pathological Alzheimer's disease mutations, while neurodegenerative characteristics are not seen in these models. This review will discuss the relationship between neuroinflammation and neuroregeneration in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
