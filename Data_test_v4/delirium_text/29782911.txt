29782911|t|Estrogen deficiency exacerbates Abeta-induced memory impairment through enhancement of neuroinflammation, amyloidogenesis and NF-kB activation in ovariectomized mice.
29782911|a|Estrogen is well known to have a preventative effect in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Several studies have demonstrated that nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) can contribute to the effects of estrogen on the development of AD. We investigated whether NF-kB affects amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced memory impairment in an estrogen-lacking condition. In the present study, nine-week-old Institute cancer research (ICR) mice were ovariectomized to block estrogen stimulation. Ten weeks after the ovariectomization, mice were administered with Abeta (300 pmol) via intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion for 2 weeks. Memory impairment, neuroinflammatory protein expression, and amyloidogenic pathways were then measured. Ovariectomized mice demonstrated severe memory impairment, Abeta accumulation, neprilysin downregulation, and activation of NF-kB signaling compared to sham-control mice. In vitro experiments demonstrated that beta-estradiol (10 muM) inhibited Abeta (1 muM)-induced neuroinflammation in microglial BV-2 cells and prevented Abeta-induced cell death in primary cultured neuronal cells. As in in vivo experiments, NF-kB activation was significantly upregulated in in vitro experiments. Furthermore beta-estradiol treatment inhibited NF-kB activation in both of microglial BV-2 cells and cultured neuronal cells. These findings suggest that estrogen may protect against memory impairment through the regulation of Abeta accumulation and neurogenic inflammation by inhibiting NF-kappaB activity.
