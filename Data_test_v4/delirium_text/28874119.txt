28874119|t|Automated segmentation of cerebral deep gray matter from MRI scans: effect of field strength on sensitivity and reliability.
28874119|a|BACKGROUND: The cerebral subcortical deep gray matter nuclei (DGM) are a common, early, and clinically-relevant site of atrophy in multiple sclerosis (MS). Robust and reliable DGM segmentation could prove useful to evaluate putative neuroprotective MS therapies. The objective of the study was to compare the sensitivity and reliability of DGM volumes obtained from 1.5T vs. 3T MRI. METHODS: Fourteen patients with MS [age (mean, range) 50.2 (32.0-60.8) years, disease duration 18.4 (8.2-35.5) years, Expanded Disability Status Scale score 3.1 (0-6), median 3.0] and 15 normal controls (NC) underwent brain 3D T1-weighted paired scan-rescans at 1.5T and 3T. DGM (caudate, thalamus, globus pallidus, and putamen) segmentation was obtained by the fully automated FSL-FIRST pipeline. Both raw and normalized volumes were derived. RESULTS: DGM volumes were generally higher at 3T vs. 1.5T in both groups. For raw volumes, 3T showed slightly better sensitivity (thalamus: p = 0.02; caudate: p = 0.10; putamen: p = 0.02; globus pallidus: p = 0.0004; total DGM: p = 0.01) than 1.5T (thalamus: p = 0.05; caudate: p = 0.09; putamen: p = 0.03; globus pallidus: p = 0.0006; total DGM: p = 0.02) for detecting DGM atrophy in MS vs. NC. For normalized volumes, 3T but not 1.5T detected atrophy in the globus pallidus in the MS group. Across all subjects, scan-rescan reliability was generally very high for both platforms, showing slightly higher reliability for some DGM volumes at 3T. Raw volumes showed higher reliability than normalized volumes. Raw DGM volume showed higher reliability than the individual structures. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest somewhat higher sensitivity and reliability of DGM volumes obtained from 3T vs. 1.5T MRI. Further studies should assess the role of this 3T pipeline in tracking potential MS neurotherapeutic effects.
