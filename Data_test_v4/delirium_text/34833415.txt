34833415|t|In-Hospital Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Fragility Fractures of the Lumbar Spine, Thoracic Spine, and Pelvic Ring: A Comparison of Data before and after Certification as a DGU  Geriatric Trauma Centre.
34833415|a|Background and Objectives: The implementation of orthogeriatric co-management (OGCM) reflects the demand for interdisciplinary collaborations due to the increasing comorbidities of geriatric trauma patients. This study aimed to assess clinical in-hospital outcomes in lumbar spine, thoracic spine, and pelvic ring fragility fracture patients before and after the implementation of a Geriatric Trauma Centre (GTC) certified by the German Trauma Society (DGU ). Materials and Methods: In this observational, retrospective cohort study, geriatric trauma patients (>70 years of age) were stratified into either a pre-GTC group (hospital admission between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013) or a post-GTC group (hospital admission between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2018). Patients' pre-injury medical complexity was measured by ASA class (American Society of Anaesthesiologists classification), the use of anticoagulant medication, and the ACCI (Age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index). Outcome parameters were patients' in-hospital length of stay (LOS) and mortality rates, as well as new in-hospital findings and diagnoses. Further, the necessity of deviation from initial management plans due to complications was assessed using the Adapted Clavien-Dindo Scoring System in Trauma (ACDiT score of >=1). Results: Patients in the post-GTC group (n = 111) were older (median age 82.0 years) compared to the pre-GTC group (n = 108, median age 80.0 years, p = 0.016). No differences were found in sex, body mass index, ASA class, or ACCI (all p > 0.05). Patients in the post-GTC group used vitamin K antagonists or direct oral anticoagulants more frequently (21.3% versus 10.8%). The incidence of non-surgical treatment and mortality was comparable between groups, while LOS tended to be shorter in the post-GTC group (7.0 days versus 9.0 days, p = 0.076). In the post-GTC group, the detection of urinary tract infections (UTI) increased (35.2% versus 16.2%, p = 0.001), and the delirium diagnoses tended to increase (13.0% versus 6.3%, p = 0.094), while an ACDiT score of >=1 was comparable between groups (p = 0.169). Conclusions: In this study including lumbar spine, thoracic spine, and pelvic ring geriatric fragility fractures, patients in the post-GTC group were more medically complex. More UTIs and the tendency for increased delirium detection was observed in the post-GTC group, likely due to improved diagnostic testing. Nonetheless, the necessity of deviation from initial management plans (ACDiT score of >=1) was comparable between groups, potentially a positive result of OGCM.
