1282367|t|Cerebrospinal fluid protein variations in common to Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.
1282367|a|Analysis of silver stained two-dimensional (2D) gels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 27 patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and 10 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) revealed an increase in the relative amount of a polypeptide of 18,000M(r) and isoelectric point of 6.5 when compared to the appropriate controls. This protein was identified by its electrophoretic characteristics and by immune analysis of Western blots as an isoform of alpha-2 haptoglobin, provisionally identified as alpha-2FS haptoglobin. Alzheimer's disease versus control CSF samples showed a 6.8-fold increase in the percent mean density value of this haptoglobin isoform (n = 10 AD vs 11 control; P > 0.025) while a 4.4-fold increase was observed in the schizophrenic patients (n = 17 SCZ vs 10 control; P > 0.001). Two additional polypeptides (proteins '127' and '128') of 40,000 M(r) and isoelectric points 5.7 and 5.9, respectively, described previously by this laboratory, were found in the CSF of 27% of schizophrenics, 23% of the Alzheimer's disease patients, and 4% of the controls in the current study. The presence of proteins 127 and 128, as well as the increased concentrations of alpha-2 haptoglobin in the CSF of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenic patients, may be useful as diagnostic biological markers. They may also indicate a common pathophysiology between these diseases.
