22288505|t|A biomarker for severity of Alzheimer's disease: 1H-NMR resonances in cerebrospinal fluid correlate with performance in mini-mental-state-exam.
22288505|a|CONTEXT: There is no valid biomarker for severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) available until now. OBJECTIVE: Therefore, we investigated (1)H-NMR spectroscopy for specific resonances as biomarkers for severity of AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with diagnosed AD and healthy control subjects was analysed by one-dimensional water-suppressed (1)H-NMR spectroscopy. The resonances were correlated with the cognitive performance of the patients and controls. RESULTS: Specific (1)H-NMR resonances showed higher intensities in AD patients than in control subjects. Mini-mental-state-exam scores correlated with (1)H-NMR resonances in AD patients. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: (1)H-NMR resonances of CSF are obviously valid biomarker for severity of AD, despite the lack of knowledge of the underlying molecular structure. Successful isolation and identification of these substances will most likely provide details to the pathophysiology of AD.
