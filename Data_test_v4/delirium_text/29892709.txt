29892709|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe the features of 2 unrelated adults with xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group F (XP-F) ascertained in a neurology care setting. METHODS: We report the clinical, imaging, molecular, and nucleotide excision repair (NER) capacity of 2 middle-aged women with progressive neurodegeneration ultimately diagnosed with XP-F. RESULTS: Both patients presented with adult-onset progressive neurologic deterioration involving chorea, ataxia, hearing loss, cognitive deficits, profound brain atrophy, and a history of skin photosensitivity, skin freckling, and/or skin neoplasms. We identified compound heterozygous pathogenic mutations in ERCC4 and confirmed deficient NER capacity in skin fibroblasts from both patients. CONCLUSIONS: These cases illustrate the role of NER dysfunction in neurodegeneration and how adult-onset neurodegeneration could be the major symptom bringing XP-F patients to clinical attention. XP-F should be considered by neurologists in the differential diagnosis of patients with adult-onset progressive neurodegeneration accompanied by global brain atrophy and a history of heightened sun sensitivity, excessive freckling, and skin malignancies.
