30705830|t|Toxicological profile of Amanita virosa - A narrative review.
30705830|a|Mushrooms account for a part of human diet due to their exquisite taste and protein content as well as their promising health effects unveiled by scientific research. Toxic and non-toxic mushrooms frequently share considerable morphological similarities, which mislead the collectors/consumers, resulting in mycotoxicity. Numerous mushroom species are considered "poisonous" as they produce dangerous toxins. For instance, members of the genus Amanita, especially A. phalloides, A. virosa and A. verna, are responsible for severe and even life-threatening noxious consequences. Globally, mushroom poisoning is a crucial healthcare issue as it leads to a considerable number of deaths annually. However, no definite antidote has been introduced to treat this poisoning. The present article discusses the characteristics of A. virosa in terms of epidemiology, mechanisms of toxicity, poisoning features and management.
