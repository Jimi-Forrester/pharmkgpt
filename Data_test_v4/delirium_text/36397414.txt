This study aimed to investigate the effects of a programmed intermittent epidural bolus injection versus continuous epidural injection for controlling nighttime pain and improving sleep quality after thoracotomy. METHODS: Seventy-six patients scheduled for open thoracotomy for lung cancer or other lung diseases were enrolled. The participants were divided into 2 groups. Group A was continuously injected with 0.2% levobupivacaine at 1.1 mL/h, and group B was injected intermittently with 3 mL 0.2% levobupivacaine at 3 hours intervals through a thoracic epidural catheter via a programmed infusion pump. Within 48 hours after surgery, the degree of pain control using visual analog scale and the patients' sleep conditions on postoperative day (POD) 0 and 1 were evaluated, and other adverse events were investigated. RESULTS: On POD 1 night, the visual analog scale in group B showed lower than group A (P = .009). Comparison of time to fall asleep showed no differences between 2 groups. Total sleep time was no difference on POD 0 but was longer in group B than that in group A on POD 1 (P = .042). Awakening from sleep on POD 0 was lower in group B than that in group A (P = .033), and satisfaction with sleep quality on POD 0 was superior in group B compared to group A (P = .005). Postoperative nausea and vomiting occurred more frequently in group B than in group A (P = .018). CONCLUSION: The programmed intermittent epidural bolus technique of patient-controlled epidural analgesia reduces postoperative nighttime pain and improves sleep quality in patients undergoing thoracotomy for lung cancer or other lung diseases.
