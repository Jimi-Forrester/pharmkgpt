37580528|a|The lack of biomarkers to monitor and predict the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has hindered its optimal use. To establish metabolomic markers for monitoring and predicting the treatment efficacy of ECT, we comprehensively evaluated metabolite levels in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) by performing targeted and non-targeted metabolomic analyses using plasma samples before and after the first, third, and final ECT sessions, and 3-7 days after the final session. We compared the plasma metabolomes of age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Thirteen hospitalized patients with MDD and their corresponding HCs were included in this study. We observed that patients with MDD exhibited lower levels of amino acids, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and metabolites involved in tryptophan metabolism and the kynurenine pathway, and higher levels of cortisol at baseline. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between metabolite levels and depression severity across seven measurement timepoints along with one correlation analysis and found that amino acids, including GABA and tryptophan catabolites, were significantly correlated with the severity of depression. Despite the exploratory nature of this study due to the limited sample size necessitating further validation, our findings suggest that the blood metabolic profile has potential as a biomarker for ECT.
