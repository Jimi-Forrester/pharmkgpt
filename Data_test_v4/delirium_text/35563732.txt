35563732|a|Astrocytes are specialized glial cells that tile the central nervous system (CNS) and perform numerous essential functions. Astrocytes react to various forms of CNS insults by altering their morphology and molecular profile, through a process known as reactive astrogliosis. Accordingly, astrocyte reactivity is apparent in many neurodegenerative diseases, among which one is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent clinical trials on early-stage AD have demonstrated that Fortasyn Connect (FC), a multi-nutrient combination providing specific precursors and cofactors for phospholipid synthesis, helps to maintain neuronal functional connectivity and cognitive performance of patients. Several studies have shown that FC may act through its effects on neuronal survival and synaptogenesis, leading to reduced astrocyte reactivity, but whether FC can directly counteract astrocyte reactivity remains to be elucidated. Hence, we developed an in vitro model of reactive astrogliosis using the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma together with an automated high-throughput assay (AstroScan) to quantify molecular and morphological changes that accompany reactive astrogliosis. Next, we showed that FC is potent in preventing cytokine-induced reactive astrogliosis, a finding that might be of high relevance to understand the beneficial effects of FC-based interventions in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.
