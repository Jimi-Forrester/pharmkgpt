37834380|t|MRI and Clinical Biomarkers Overlap between Glaucoma and Alzheimer's Disease.
37834380|a|Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. It is classically associated with structural and functional changes in the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer, but the damage is not limited to the eye. The involvement of the central visual pathways and disruption of brain network organization have been reported using advanced neuroimaging techniques. The brain structural changes at the level of the areas implied in processing visual information could justify the discrepancy between signs and symptoms and underlie the analogy of this disease with neurodegenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease, and with the complex group of pathologies commonly referred to as "disconnection syndromes." This review aims to summarize the current state of the art on the use of advanced neuroimaging techniques in glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the emerging biomarkers shared by both diseases.
