33732293|t|Anti-infection mechanism of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and their roles in coronavirus disease 2019 (Review).
33732293|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a variety of impacts on the human body. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the pathogen that causes COVID-19. It invades human tissues through the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, resulting in an imbalance in the angiotensin II (AngII) level and upregulation of renin-angiotensin system/AngII pathway activity. Furthermore, the binding of AngII to its receptor leads to vasoconstriction, endothelial injury and intravascular thrombosis. In addition, COVID-19 may have adverse effects on male reproductive organs and a marked impact on male reproductive health. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) may improve vascular endothelial function, promote testicular and systemic blood circulation and testosterone secretion and enhance epididymal function, as well as sperm maturation and capacitation. PDE5Is may also be of use in the treatment of infectious diseases by enhancing immunity and anti-inflammatory responses and improving vascular endothelial function. Based on the pharmacological mechanism of PDE5Is, they are of unique value in the fight against infectious diseases and may be effective in combination with direct antiviral drugs. The anti-infection mechanisms of PDE5Is and their roles in COVID-19 were reviewed in the present study.
