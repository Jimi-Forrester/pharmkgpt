36721095|a|BACKGROUND: The alpha2 adrenergic receptor agonist dexmedetomidine is an important intravenous sedative with analgesic properties. Currently available dexmedetomidine reversal agents, like the alpha2-receptor antagonist atipamezole, cause serious adverse effects at the large dosages required for effective reversal; they are not used clinically. Without reversal agents, emergence times from dexmedetomidine sedation are slow. In this study we tested the ability of low-dose atipamezole, in combination with caffeine, to reverse dexmedetomidine sedation. The low dose of atipamezole employed should not be associated with unwanted effects. METHODS: Two different sedation protocols were employed. In the first protocol, a bolus of dexmedetomidine was rapidly applied and the drug was allowed to equilibrate for 10 min before rats received either saline (as control) or low-dose atipamezole with caffeine. Following this procedure, rats were placed on their backs. Emergence from sedation was the time for rats to recover their righting reflex and stand with 4 paws on the floor. A second sedation protocol simulated a pediatric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Adult rats were sedated with dexmedetomidine for one hour followed by 30 min with both dexmedetomidine and propofol. At the end of 90 min, rats received either saline (control) or a combination of low-dose atipamezole, and caffeine. Recovery of the righting reflex was used as a proxy for emergence from sedation. RESULTS: Emergence from sedation, the time for rats to recover their righting reflex, decreased by ~ 90% when using an atipamezole dose ~ 20 fold lower than manufacturer's recommendation, supplemented with caffeine. Using an atipamezole dose ~ tenfold lower than recommended, with caffeine, emergence times decreased by ~ 97%. A different stimulant, forskolin, when tested, was as effective as caffeine. For the MRI simulation, emergence times were decreased by ~ 93% by low-dose atipamezole with caffeine. CONCLUSIONS: Low dose atipamezole with caffeine was effective at reversing dexmedetomidine sedation. Emergence was rapid and the rats regained not only their righting reflex but also their balance and their ability to carry out complex behaviors. These findings suggest that the combination of low dose atipamezole with caffeine may permit rapid clinical reversal of dexmedetomidine without unwanted effects.
