33511932|a|Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Multiple Sclerosis and Ischemic stroke have become a major health problem worldwide. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of flavonoids on neurodegenerative diseases and suggest them to be used as therapeutic agents. Kaempferol is found in many plants such as tea, beans, broccoli, strawberries, and neuroprotective effects against the development of many neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. The present study summarizes the neuroprotective effects of kaempferol in various models of neurodegenerative diseases. Kaempferol delays the initiation as well as the progression of neurodegenerative disorders by acting as a scavenger of free radicals and preserving the activity of various antioxidant enzymes. Kaempferol can cross the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), and therefore results in an enhanced protective effect. The multi-target property of kaempferol makes it a potential dietary supplement in preventing and treating neurodegenerative diseases.
