33299526|t|Secondary Metabolites with Antioxidant Activities for the Putative Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): "Experimental Evidences".
33299526|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disorder that is characterized by progressive loss of the upper and lower motor neurons at the spinal or bulbar level. Oxidative stress (OS) associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and the deterioration of the electron transport chain are factors that contribute to neurodegeneration and perform a potential role in the pathogenesis of ALS. Natural antioxidant molecules have been proposed as an alternative form of treatment for the prevention of age-related neurological diseases, in which ALS is included. Researches support that regulations in cellular reduction/oxidation (redox) processes are being increasingly implicated in this disease, and antioxidant drugs are aimed at a promising pathway to treatment. Among the strategies used for obtaining new drugs, we can highlight the isolation of secondary metabolite compounds from natural sources that, along with semisynthetic derivatives, correspond to approximately 40% of the drugs found on the market. Among these compounds, we emphasize oxygenated and nitrogenous compounds, such as flavonoids, coumarins, and alkaloids, in addition to the fatty acids, that already stand out in the literature for their antioxidant properties, consisting in a part of the diets of millions of people worldwide. Therefore, this review is aimed at presenting and summarizing the main articles published within the last years, which represent the therapeutic potential of antioxidant compounds of natural origin for the treatment of ALS.
