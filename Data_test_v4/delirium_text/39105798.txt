39105798|a|Melatonin is a powerful endogenous antioxidant hormone. Its healing effects on energy balance and neuronal damage associated with oxidative metabolism disorders have been reported in pathologic conditions. We aimed to determinate the utility of melatonin on neuronal damage, synaptic transmission, and energy balance in the brain tissue of rats with sepsis induced with LPS. Rats was divided into four groups such as control, LPS (20 mg/kg i.p.), melatonin (10 mg/kg i.p. x 3), and LPS + Melatonin (LPS + Mel). After 6 h from the first injection, rats were decapitated, and also tissue and serum samples were taken. Lipid peroxidation and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels were determined from the serum in all group. High energy compounds, creatine, and creatine phosphate are measured by HPLC methods from the homogenized tissue. Counts of living neurons are marked with NeuN (neuronal nuclei), degenerated neurons are marked with S100-ss and synaptic vesicles transmission is analyzed with synaptophysin antibodies immunoreactivities. One-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey tests were used to statistical analysis. In LPS group, AMP, ATP, creatine, and creatine phosphate levels were significantly decreased (p < 0.05), and also ADP levels were significantly increased compared with the other groups (p < 0.01). Living neurons counts were significantly decreased in LPS (p < 0.01), melatonin, and LPS + Melatonin (p < 0.05) groups compared with control. Degenerated neurons counts were increased in LPS group compared with control (p < 0.01) and also decreased in both of melatonin and LPS + Melatonin groups (p < 0.01). Synaptophysin immunoreactivity was decreased in LPS group compared with the other groups (p < 0.05). We observed that melatonin administration prevents neuronal damage, regulates energy metabolism, and protects synaptic vesicle proteins from sepsis-induced reduction.
