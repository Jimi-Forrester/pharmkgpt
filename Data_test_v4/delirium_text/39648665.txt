39648665|a|BACKGROUND: The association between heatwave and heat-related outcomes in people with mental health conditions with and without psychotropics was unclear. METHODS: We identified people with severe mental illness (SMI) and depression, respectively, using Japanese claim data of Ibaraki prefecture during 1/1/2014-31/12/2021. We conducted self-controlled case series to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of heat-related illness, myocardial infarction and delirium, respectively, during 5-day pre-heatwave, heatwave, and 5-day post-heatwave periods v. all other periods (baseline) within an individual, stratified by periods prescribed psychotropics and periods not prescribed psychotropics, respectively. RESULTS: Among people with SMI, heatwave was associated with an increased rate of heat-related illness v. baseline, with no evidence of a difference in the IRRs between those prescribed v. not prescribed antipsychotics (IRR: 1.48 [95% CI 1.40-1.56]; 1.45 [95% CI 1.35-1.56] respectively, p interaction: 0.53). Among people with depression, heatwave was similarly associated with heat-related illness, with no evidence of a difference in the IRRs between those prescribed v. not prescribed antidepressants (IRR: 1.54 [95% CI 1.46-1.64]; 1.64 [95% CI 1.57-1.71] respectively, p interaction: 0.33). Smaller increased rates of heat-related illness were also observed in pre- and post-heatwave periods, v. baseline in both cohorts. There was weak evidence of an increased risk of MI and delirium associated with heatwave v. baseline. CONCLUSIONS: We showed an increased risk of heat-related illness, myocardial infarction and delirium associated with heatwave in people with mental health conditions regardless of whether being prescribed psychotropics. Risks of heat-related illness, myocardial infarction and delirium associated with heatwave might not be factors to influence decisions about the routine use of psychotropics.
