36979274|t|Association between Systemic Immune Inflammation Index and Cognitive Impairment after Acute Ischemic Stroke.
36979274|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is one of the major complications after ischemic stroke. PSCI has been shown to be associated with low-grade systemic inflammation. As a novel inflammatory marker, the systemic immune-inflammation (SII) index could reflect clinical outcomes in severe cardiovascular diseases. We therefore performed a prospective study to investigate the correlation between the SII index and the risk of PSCI in patients with ischemic stroke. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 254 patients with ischemic stroke with symptoms onset <72 h. The SII index was detected within 24 h after admission. The Montreal Cognitive Scale (MoCA) was utilized to evaluate cognitive function, and PSCI was defined as a MoCA score of <25 points. RESULTS: During the 3-month follow-up, 70 participants (27.6%) had mild cognitive impairment and 60 (23.6%) had severe cognitive impairment. In binary logistic regression analysis, each one-standard deviation increase in the SII index was significantly associated with the prevalence of PSCI after adjusting for age, sex, and other confounders (odds ratio 2.341; 95% confidence interval, 1.439-3.809, p = 0.001). Similar significant findings were observed when SII was defined as a categorical variable. In addition, the multiple-adjusted spline regression model showed a linear association between the SII index and cognitive impairment (p = 0.003 for linearity). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that an increased SII index was closely related to PSCI at 3 months in patients with ischemic stroke. Further research is required to evaluate the efficacy of inflammation management in these patients.
