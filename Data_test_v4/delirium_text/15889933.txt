15889933|t|Analysis of derivatized biogenic aldehydes by LC tandem mass spectrometry.
15889933|a|Lipid peroxidation has been linked to the etiology of several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). End products of this phenomenon include low molecular weight, water-soluble aldehydes, compounds that covalently modify proteins and nucleic acids, thereby altering function. Aliphatic aldehydes (C3-C10) are generated during lipid peroxidation, along with alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes, including acrolein and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). The Hantzsch reaction was used to produce heterocyclic aldehyde derivatives that can be conveniently analyzed with mass spectrometry. Liquid chromatographic analyses revealed increasing retention times from derivatized methanal to octanal. HNE derivatives were observed to elute between heptanal and octanal derivatives, while the acrolein derivatives had a retention time similar to the propanal derivative. Smaller aliphatic aldehyde derivatives fragmented in a similar manner to produce a base peak of m/z 273, while the larger derivatives yielded m/z 274 as the base peak. Acrolein and HNE derivatives fragmented in a slightly different manner compared to their aliphatic counterparts. Calibration plots of aliphatic and unsaturated aldehydes were linear (r2 >/= 0.99) in the concentration range explored (approximately 5-1500 pg on column). The LC-MS/MS methodology developed here will be used in subsequent studies to determine aldehyde concentrations for comparing age-matched controls to AD tissues from human subjects.
