23303272|a|Hyponatremia is prevalent before liver transplantation and generally corrected immediately after transplantation.  However, the clinical significance of correction rate of hyponatremia is not well investigated.  The prognostic impact of pre-transplant serum sodium concentrations and post-transplant correction rate of hyponatremia were assessed.  A total of 512 patients who received orthotopic liver transplants were enrolled.  The correction rate of hyponatremia (delta sodium, DeltaNa) was calculated based on the data collected during the first 48 hours following liver transplantation.  Outcomes, including in-hospital mortality, delirium, neurological complications, acute kidney injury, and infections, were compared according to the serum sodium levels (sNa < 125, 125-135, and >= 135 mmol/L), and the risk factors for in-hospital mortality and neurological complications were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression methods.  Patients with severe hyponatremia (sNa < 125 mmol/L) had higher rates of in-hospital mortality (9.6%, P = 0.010), delirium (54.8%, P = 0.003), neurological complications (24.7%, P = 0.003), and acute kidney injury (57.5%, P = 0.005).  In multivariate analysis, serum sodium levels (OR = 0.975, P = 0.402) and delta sodium (OR = 1.097, P = 0.066) were not independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality.  However, delta sodium (OR = 1.093, P = 0.003) and fast correction rate of hyponatremia (DeltaNa >= 12 mmol/L/24h, OR = 3.397, P = 0.023) were significantly associated with post-transplant neurological complications.  Pre-transplantation hyponatremia was not independently associated with clinical outcomes.  However, rapid correction of hyponatremia is an independent risk factor for the development of post-transplant neurological complications.
