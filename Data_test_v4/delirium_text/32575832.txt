32575832|a|The long-term use of benzodiazepines is not recommended for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) due to the risk of adverse effects, including dependence, falls, dementia, mortality and the lack of evidence of effectiveness for symptoms other than anxiety. However, there are many patients with MDD for whom antidepressants are co-administrated with benzodiazepines. This study aimed to identify whether the use of benzodiazepines is associated with a lower risk of relapse or recurrence of MDD in some patients, and the characteristics of these patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to quantify the relapse and recurrence of MDD in 108 patients with MDD who achieved remission during hospitalization. Among them, 26 patients had been diagnosed with severe MDD with psychotic features. There was no significant difference in the rate of relapse/recurrence between patients with and without benzodiazepines when all patients were analyzed together. However, among the 26 patients with psychotic depression, 21.2% in the benzodiazepine group and 75.0% in the non-benzodiazepine group experienced relapse (log rank p = 0.0040). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that this effect was dose-dependent. The adjunctive use of benzodiazepines may reduce relapse/recurrence rates in patients with severe MDD with psychotic features.
