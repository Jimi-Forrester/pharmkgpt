36808969|a|A series of new N-aryl galantamine analogues (5a-5x) were designed and synthesized by modification of galantamine, using Pd-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling reaction in good to excellent yields. The cholinesterase inhibitory and neuroprotective activities of N-aryl derivatives of galantamine were evaluated. Among the synthesized compounds, the 4-methoxylpyridine-galantamine derivative (5q) (IC50 = 0.19 muM) exhibited excellent acetylcholinesterase inhibition activity, as well as significant neuroprotective effect against H2O2-induced injury in SH-SY5Y cells. Molecular docking, staining, and Western blotting analyses were performed to demonstrate the mechanism of action of 5q. Derivative 5q would be a promising multifunctional lead compound for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
