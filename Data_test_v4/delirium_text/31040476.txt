31040476|a|One of the important provisions of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, in section 21 (4), is the inclusion of "mental illnesses" for health insurance coverage. This is a progressive step toward considering mental illness at par with physical illness, which will, in turn, ensure better access to mental health care.
