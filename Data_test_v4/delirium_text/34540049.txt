METHODS: A total of 119 patients with AD complicated with diabetes admitted to our hospital from January 2017 to January 2019 were selected for prospective analysis, and 64 patients received individual nursing mode, which were regarded as the personality group (PG). Another 55 patients received routine nursing mode and were regarded as the regular group (RG). The curative effect of AD, blood glucose, living ability, cognitive function, self-care ability and nursing satisfaction of the two groups were investigated. RESULTS: There was no difference between the two groups in AD curative effect and cognitive function (P > 0.05), and the blood sugar control, living ability, self-care ability and nursing satisfaction of the PG were higher than those of the RG (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Individual nursing can effectively improve the ability of blood sugar control and daily life of AD patients with diabetes mellitus, and greatly enhance the patients' trust, dependence, and satisfaction with medical staff, which is worth popularizing in clinical practice.
