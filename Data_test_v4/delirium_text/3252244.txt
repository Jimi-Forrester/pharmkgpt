3252244|a|The effects of the long-acting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, galanthamine, on spatial memory were investigated in mice. Mice received ibotenic acid or sham lesions to the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nBM). Groups of nBM-lesioned and control mice were then trained on a modified Morris swim maze task. Each mouse was first placed on a platform and then into quadrants of the swim tank in a random order. Time required to find the hidden platform was measured. In different phases of testing, the animal had to find a platform that either remained in the same quadrant (reference memory component) or was moved daily (working memory component). The nBM-lesioned mice took significantly longer to find the platform as compared to controls on the working, but not on the reference, memory component of the task. Galanthamine (5.0 mg/kg, IP), given 3.5 hours before testing, improved performance on the working memory task in nBM-lesioned mice by 70% and strikingly impaired performance in controls. Galanthamine's ability to reverse cognitive deficits induced by nBM lesions and its comparatively long half-life suggest that it may be effective in treating the central cholinergic deficits in Alzheimer's disease patients.
