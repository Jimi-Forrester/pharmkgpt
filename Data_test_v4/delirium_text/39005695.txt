39005695|a|Objective: This study aimed to determine the microorganisms grown in the urine cultures of patients followed up with the diagnosis of community-acquired urinary tract infection (CA-UTI), their antibiotic susceptibility, and the risk factors that cause extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production in microorganisms. Materials and Methods: Patients diagnosed with CA-UTI in the Yildirim Beyazit University City Hospital Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology Clinic between February 2019 and February 2020 were prospectively analyzed. The microorganisms grown in the urine cultures and antibiotic susceptibility rates were examined. The clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients were compared in terms of the isolated agent producing ESBL. Results: Escherichia coli (63.8%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (22.0%) were the most common microorganisms detected in the urine cultures; the rate of those producing ESBL was 46.6%. Antibiotics with high resistance rates were ampicillin (74.2%), cefuroxime (49.6%), and ceftriaxone (49%). Male gender, complicating factors, immunosuppression, kidney transplantation and history of antibiotic use were determined as significant risk factors for ESBL production. Male gender, immunosuppression, and history of antibiotic use were also independent risk factors. ROC analysis of risk factors showed ESBL-producing bacteria were isolated at a high rate in patients having >=3 risk factors. Conclusion: The resistance rates in our study are quite high. Male gender, history of antibiotic use and immunosuppression status were found to be independent risk factors for ESBL positivity in patients with CA-UTI, and the more risk factors a patient has, the higher the risk of ESBL positivity.
