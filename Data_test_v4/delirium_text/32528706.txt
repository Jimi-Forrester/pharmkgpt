32528706|t|Dissecting the genome of star fruit (Averrhoa carambola L.).
32528706|a|Averrhoa carambola is commonly known as star fruit because of its peculiar shape, and its fruit is a rich source of minerals and vitamins. It is also used in traditional medicines in countries such as India, China, the Philippines, and Brazil for treating various ailments, including fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and skin disease. Here, we present the first draft genome of the Oxalidaceae family, with an assembled genome size of 470.51 Mb. In total, 24,726 protein-coding genes were identified, and 16,490 genes were annotated using various well-known databases. The phylogenomic analysis confirmed the evolutionary position of the Oxalidaceae family. Based on the gene functional annotations, we also identified enzymes that may be involved in important nutritional pathways in the star fruit genome. Overall, the data from this first sequenced genome in the Oxalidaceae family provide an essential resource for nutritional, medicinal, and cultivational studies of the economically important star-fruit plant.
