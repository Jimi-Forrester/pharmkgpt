37636455|a|Hypercalcaemia associated with malignancy is a complication of advanced tumors. Lactic acidosis is also an extremely rare paraneoplastic syndrome of malignancy, and the presence of both usually indicates an extremely poor prognosis for the tumour. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and is also a common aggressive lymphoma. It is extremely rare for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma to develop both hypercalcaemia and severe lactic acidosis. In this article, we report a case of CD5 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with hypercalcaemic crisis and persistent lactic acidosis, in which calcium was rapidly reduced to normal after rehydration, diuresis, calcitonin and zoledronate, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). After correction of acidosis with sodium bicarbonate, diuresis, vitamin B1 and CRRT, the patient's lactate remained at a high level. The aim of this article is to analyse the experience of the combination of hypercalcaemia and intractable lactic acidosis, which should be considered as a serious electrolyte disorder possibly associated with abnormal metabolism of malignant tumors, and to identify and treat the primary lesion as early as possible.
