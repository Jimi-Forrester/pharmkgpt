32664455|t|Diagnostic Ability of Structural Transcranial Sonography in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
32664455|a|The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic ability of transcranial sonography (TCS) for the evaluation of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Standard neuropsychological evaluation, TCS and 1.5 T MRI were performed for 20 patients with AD and for 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls in a prospective manner. Measurements of the size of the third ventricle and heights of the MTL (A) and the choroidal fissure (B) were performed twice on each side by two independent neurosonologists for all participants. On MRI, both conventional and volumetric analyses of the third ventricle and hippocampus were performed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analyses were applied. Height of the MTL on TCS had sensitivities of 73.7% (right)/63.2%(left) and specificities of 65% (right)/65-70% (left) Area under a curve (AUC) 75.4-77.2% (right), 60.4-67.8% (left)) for AD. A/B ratio on TCS had sensitivities of 73.7% (right)/57.9% (left) and specificities of 70.0% (right)/55.0% (left) (AUC 73.3% (right), 60.4% (left)) by the experienced neurosonologist, and sensitivities of 78.9% (right and left) and specificities of 60.0% (right)/65.0% (left) (AUC 77.8-80.0%) by the inexperienced neurosonologist for AD. On MRI, linear measurement of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus height had sensitivities of 84.2% (right)/89.5% (left) and specificities of 80.0% (right)/85% (left) (AUC 86.1-92.9%) for AD. Hippocampal volume had sensitivities of 70% (right and left) and specificities of 75% (right)/80% (left) (AUC 77.5-78%) for AD. Atrophy of the right MTL in AD could be detected on TCS with a good diagnostic ability, however MRI performed better on the left.
