35215094|a|Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a global public health burden causing up to 650,000 deaths per year. Yearly vaccination programmes and anti-viral drugs currently have limited benefits; therefore, research into IAV is fundamental. Leukocyte trafficking is a crucial process which orchestrates the immune response to infection to protect the host. It involves several homing molecules and receptors on both blood vessels and leukocytes. A key mediator of this process is the transmembrane glycoprotein L-selectin, which binds to vascular addressins on blood vessel endothelial cells. L-selectin classically mediates homing of naive and central memory lymphocytes to lymph nodes via high endothelial venules (HEVs). Recent studies have found that L-selectin is essential for homing of activated CD8+ T cells to influenza-infected lungs and reduction in virus load. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) is the primary regulator of cell surface levels of L-selectin. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate these two proteins are central to comprehending recruitment of T cells to sites of IAV infection. This review summarises the immune response to IAV infection in humans and mice and discusses the roles of L-selectin and ADAM17 in T lymphocyte homing during IAV infection.
