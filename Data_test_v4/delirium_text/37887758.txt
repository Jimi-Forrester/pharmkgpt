37887758|t|Novel Baicalein-Derived Inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum.
37887758|a|Malaria, a life-threatening mosquito-borne disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, continues to pose a significant global health burden. Despite notable progress in combating the disease in recent years, malaria remains prevalent in many regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and most of sub-Saharan Africa, where it claims hundreds of thousands of lives annually. Flavonoids, such as the baicalein class of compounds, are known to have antimalarial properties. In this study, we rationally designed and synthesized a series of baicalein derivatives and identified a lead compound, FNDR-10132, that displayed potent in vitro antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum), both chloroquine-sensitive (60 nM) and chloroquine-resistant (177 nM) parasites. FNDR-10132 was evaluated for its antimalarial activity in vivo against the chloroquine-resistant strain Plasmodium yoelii N67 in Swiss mice. The oral administration of 100 mg/kg of FNDR-10132 showed 44% parasite suppression on day 4, with a mean survival time of 13.5 +- 2.3 days vs. 8.4 +- 2.3 days of control. Also, FNDR-10132 displayed equivalent activity against the resistant strains of P. falciparum in the 200-300 nM range. This study offers a novel series of antimalarial compounds that could be developed into potent drugs against chloroquine-resistant malarial parasites through further chemistry and DMPK optimization.
