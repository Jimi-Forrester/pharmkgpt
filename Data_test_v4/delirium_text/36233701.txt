36233701|t|The Role of Vascular Risk Factors in Post-Stroke Delirium: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
36233701|a|Vascular risk factors may predispose to post-stroke delirium (PSD). A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. The primary outcome was the prevalence of vascular risk factors in PSD vs. non-PSD patients. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs were calculated for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Fixed effects or random effects models were used in case of low- or high-statistical heterogeneity, respectively. We found an increased prevalence of atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.74, p = 0.0004), prior stroke (OR = 1.48, p < 0.00001), coronary artery disease (OR = 1.48, p < 0.00001), heart failure (OR = 2.01, p < 0.0001), and peripheral vascular disease (OR = 2.03, p < 0.00001) in patients with vs. without PSD. PSD patients were older (MD = 5.27 y, p < 0.00001) compared with their non-PSD counterparts. Advanced age, atrial fibrillation, prior stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease appeared to be significantly associated with PSD.
