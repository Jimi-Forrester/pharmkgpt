37570286|t|Ethical Concerns of the Veterinarian in Relation to Experimental Animals and In Vivo Research.
37570286|a|Animal experiments, despite their controversial nature, play an indispensable role in scientific advancement and led to numerous significant discoveries. The supervision of veterinarians in the realm of in vivo research holds immense importance. However, this particular aspect of veterinary medicine, distinct from their other activities, can pose ethical challenges. Veterinarians are entrusted with the prevention of diseases, healing, and pain elimination, yet in the case of animal experiments, they witness intentional suffering and death. This article evaluates the ethical and professional deontological aspects of this issue. It explores the historical evolution of human-animal (including experimental) relationships and discusses how deontology stems from the definition of ethics. The article also examines codes of ethics for veterinarians, providing illustrative examples. It highlights that the actions of veterinarians in this domain align with their deontology and emphasises the role of veterinarians in in vivo research as viewed within current legal frameworks. In conclusion, the veterinarian's participation in animal research is both ethically and deontologically justified, and it is also a legal requirement.
