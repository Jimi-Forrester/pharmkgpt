36185924|t|Fentanyl Versus Dexmedetomidine for the Prevention of Emergence Agitation in Children After Sevoflurane Anaesthesia: A Comparative Clinical Study.
36185924|a|Introduction Sevoflurane is widely used in pediatric anesthesia due to its rapid onset and offset of action, smooth induction, and less hepatotoxicity. However, it is associated with emergence agitation, which can be frightening and harm the patient or the caregiver. While a definite preventive measure of emergence agitation is in search, the use of some drugs is associated with a lesser incidence of emergence related to sevoflurane.  Aims and objective This study aimed to compare the efficacy of fentanyl with dexmedetomidine in preventing emergence agitation in children undergoing surgery with sevoflurane anesthesia. Also, we assessed the perioperative hemodynamic and postoperative recovery characteristics and side effects, if any, between children receiving the two groups of drugs. Material and method We conducted a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial after getting approval from the institutional ethical committee. A total of 120 patients were recruited into the study and divided into two groups, F and D, of 60 patients each. Patients in group F received an infusion of injection fentanyl at 1 mcg/kg and patients in group D received infusions of injection dexmedetomidine at 0.15 mcg/kg, respectively, after induction of general anaesthesia. Additionally, all patients received a caudal epidural block with 0.125% isobaric levobupivacaine. After the conclusion of surgery, we transferred the patients to the post-anaesthesia care unit for further observation and assessment. Result The Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) score for emergence agitation was significantly greater in the fentanyl group compared to the dexmedetomidine group at 0 minutes (7.08 +- 1.03 vs. 6.43 +- 1.33, p = 0.003) and 15 minutes (5.51 +- 1.7 vs. 4.01 +- 1.08, p = 0.0001) postoperative period. The mean time to eye-opening was significantly earlier amongst children receiving fentanyl than those receiving dexmedetomidine (9.3 +- 1.1 min vs. 10.12 +-1.05 min, p = 0.0001). The modified Aldrete Score for adequacy of recovery was statistically insignificant initially, but as the duration progressed to 15 minutes, the children in the fentanyl group had significantly higher scores than those in the dexmedetomidine group (8.05 +- 0.67 vs. 7.76 +- 0.62, p = 0.01). Conclusion Prophylactic administration of dexmedetomidine (0.15 mcg/kg) or fentanyl (1 mcg/kg) administered is effective in preventing emergence agitation. Although we found emergence agitation was higher amongst children receiving fentanyl than those receiving dexmedetomidine during the early recovery period, this difference became insignificant as the postoperative period increased to 30 minutes.
