28811538|t|Fine Structure of Posterior Alpha Rhythm in Human EEG: Frequency Components, Their Cortical Sources, and Temporal Behavior.
28811538|a|Heterogeneity of the posterior alpha rhythm (AR) is a widely assumed but rarely tested phenomenon. We decomposed the posterior AR in the cortical source space with a 3-way PARAFAC technique, taking into account the spatial, frequency, and temporal aspects of mid-density EEG. We found a multicomponent AR structure in 90% of a group of 29 healthy adults. The typical resting-state structure consisted of a high-frequency occipito-parietal component of the AR (ARC1) and a low-frequency occipito-temporal component (ARC2), characterized by individual dynamics in time. In a few cases, we found a 3-component structure, with two ARC1s and one ARC2. The AR structures were stable in their frequency and spatial features over weeks to months, thus representing individual EEG alpha phenotypes. Cortical topography, individual stability, and similarity to the primate AR organization link ARC1 to the dorsal visual stream and ARC2 to the ventral one. Understanding how many and what kind of posterior AR components contribute to the EEG is essential for clinical neuroscience as an objective basis for AR segmentation and for interpreting AR dynamics under various conditions, both normal and pathological, which can selectively affect individual components.
