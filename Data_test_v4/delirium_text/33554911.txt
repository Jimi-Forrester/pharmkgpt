33554911|t|The Role of D-Amino Acids in Alzheimer's Disease.
33554911|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the main cause of dementia worldwide, is characterized by a complex and multifactorial etiology. In large part, excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system is mediated by glutamate and its receptors are involved in synaptic plasticity. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which require the agonist glutamate and a coagonist such as glycine or the D-enantiomer of serine for activation, play a main role here. A second D-amino acid, D-aspartate, acts as agonist of NMDA receptors. D-amino acids, present in low amounts in nature and long considered to be of bacterial origin, have distinctive functions in mammals. In recent years, alterations in physiological levels of various D-amino acids have been linked to various pathological states, ranging from chronic kidney disease to neurological disorders. Actually, the level of NMDA receptor signaling must be balanced to promote neuronal survival and prevent neurodegeneration: this signaling in AD is affected mainly by glutamate availability and modulation of the receptor's functions. Here, we report the experimental findings linking D-serine and D-aspartate, through NMDA receptor modulation, to AD and cognitive functions. Interestingly, AD progression has been also associated with the enzymes related to D-amino acid metabolism as well as with glucose and serine metabolism. Furthermore, the D-serine and D-/total serine ratio in serum have been recently proposed as biomarkers of AD progression. A greater understanding of the role of D-amino acids in excitotoxicity related to the pathogenesis of AD will facilitate novel therapeutic treatments to cure the disease and improve life expectancy.
