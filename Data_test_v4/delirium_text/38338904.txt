38338904|t|Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Mitochondria-Associated Autoantibodies: A Review of the Specific Pathogenesis and Therapeutic Strategies.
38338904|a|Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a severe retinal disease that causes irreversible visual loss and blindness in elderly populations worldwide. The pathological mechanism of AMD is complex, involving the interactions of multiple environmental and genetic factors. A poor understanding of the disease leads to limited treatment options and few effective prevention methods. The discovery of autoantibodies in AMD patients provides an opportunity to explore the pathogenesis and treatment direction of the disease. This review focuses on the mitochondria-associated autoantibodies and summarizes the functional roles of mitochondria under physiological conditions and their alterations during the pathological states. Additionally, it discusses the crosstalk between mitochondria and other organelles, as well as the mitochondria-related therapeutic strategies in AMD.
