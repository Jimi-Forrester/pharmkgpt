35538829|t|A Systematic Review of updated mechanistic insights towards Alzheimer's disease.
35538829|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative neurological disorder that impairs memory, cognitive abilities, and the ability to do even most everyday activities. This neurodegenerative disease is growing increasingly common as the world's population ages. Here we reviewed some of the key findings that have shown the function of Abeta peptide, oxidative stress, free radical damage Triggering Receptors Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2), Nitric Oxide (NO), and gut microbiota in the aetiology of AD. METHODOLOGY: The potentially relevant online medical databases, namely, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and JSTOR were exhaustively researched. In addition, the data reported in the present study were primarily intervened on the basis of the timeline selected from 1 January 2000 to 31 October 2021. The whole framework was designed substantially based on key terms and studies selected by virtue of their relevance to our investigations. RESULTS: Findings suggested that channels of free radicals, such as transition metal accumulation, and genetic factors are mainly accountable for the redox imbalance that assist to understand better the pathogenesis of AD and incorporate new therapeutic approaches. Moreover, TREM2 might elicit a protective function for microglia in AD. NO causes an increase in oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, compromising cellular integrity and viability. The study also explored that the gut and CNS communicate with one another and that regulating gut commensal flora might be a viable therapeutic for neurodegenerative illnesses like AD. CONCLUSION: There are presently no viable therapies for Alzheimer's disease, but recent breakthroughs in our knowledge of the disease's pathophysiology may aid in the discovery of prospective therapeutic targets.
