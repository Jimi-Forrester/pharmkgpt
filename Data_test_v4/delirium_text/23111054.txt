23111054|t|How tired is too tired? A case report.
23111054|a|We report a case involving a 32-year-old male presenting with acute delirium after completing the daily duties of his job. Though previously well, social history was positive for surgical residency. Symptom resolution was achieved with conservative treatment. We feel that this patient's clinical course represents an emerging disease entity known as "fatigue," which may have important implications for surgical training and practice.
