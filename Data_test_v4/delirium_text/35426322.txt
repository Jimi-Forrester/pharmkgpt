35426322|t|A Short Course of Prednisolone in Patients With Moderate Covid 19 Respiratory Failure- Stop the Progression a Case Series.
35426322|a|Covid 19 positive patients requiring oxygen therapy to maintain saturations above 90% were given a trial of oral prednisolone between 15 and 30 mg until they were weaned to room air maintaining saturations >95%. This treatment resulted in the rapid resolution of worsening respiratory function of 4 Covid 19 positive patients within the High Dependency unit in a tertiary medical center. The cases are from the "first wave" in Trinidad, March 2020. The signs and symptoms of respiratory failure resolved after 72 hours of prednisolone treatment and none of these patients were escalated to non-invasive or invasive respiratory support. The patients were kept for a further 48 hours after the steroids were discontinued to monitor for relapse of symptoms, all patients were discharged home after quarantine. The initiation of a prednisolone steroid trial must be considered in Covid 19 positive patients needing supplementary oxygen therapy or developing worsening shortness of breath. Early Covid respiratory failure responds to a low dose for a short duration and prevents escalation to non-invasive/invasive respiratory support.
