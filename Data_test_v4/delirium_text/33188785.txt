33188785|t|The use of Motor and Cognitive Dual-Task quantitative assessment on subjects with mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review.
33188785|a|Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) represent a health emergency. The identification of valid and noninvasive markers to identify people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is profoundly advocated. This review outlines the use of quantitative Motor and Cognitive Dual-Task (MCDT) on MCI, by technologies aid. We describe the framework and the most valuable researches, displaying the adopted protocols, and the available technologies. PubMed Central, Web of Science, and Scopus were inspected between January 2010 and May 2020. 1939 articles were found in the initial quest. Exclusion criteria allowed the selection of the most relevant papers; 38 papers were included. The articles, regarding four technological solutions "wearable sensors", "personal devices", "optokinetic systems", and "electronic walkways", are organized into three categories: "Quantitative MCDT", "MCDT Inspired by Neuropsychological Test", and "MCDT for MCI Stimulation". MCDT might furnish clinical landmarks, supplying aid for disease stratication, risk prediction, and intervention optimization. Such protocols could foster the use of data mining and machine learning techniques. Notwithstanding, there is still a need to standardize and harmonize such protocols.
