37156330|t|Intranasal in situ gelling liquid crystal for delivery of resveratrol ameliorates memory and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.
37156330|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an illness that affects people aged 65 or older and affects around 6.5 million in the United States. Resveratrol is a chemical obtained from natural products and it exhibits biological activity based on inhibiting the formation, depolymerization of the amyloid, and decreasing neuroinflammation. Due to the insolubility of this compound; its incorporation in surfactant-based systems was proposed to design an intranasal formulation. A range of systems has been produced by mixing oleic acid, CETETH-20 and water. Polarised light microscopy (PLM), small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirm the initial liquid formulation (F) presented as microemulsion (ME). After dilution, the gelled systems were characterized as hexagonal mesophase and they showed feasibility proprieties. Pharmacological assays performed after intranasal administration showed the ability to improve learning and memory in animals, as well as remission of neuroinflammation via inhibition of interleukin.
