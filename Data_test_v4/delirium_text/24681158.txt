24681158|t|The interplay between microRNAs and histone deacetylases in neurological diseases.
24681158|a|Neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and stroke, represent a prevalent group of devastating illnesses with few treatments. Each of these diseases or conditions is in part characterized by the dysregulation of many genes, including those that code for microRNAs (miRNAs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Recently, a complex relationship has been uncovered linking miRNAs and HDACs and their ability to regulate one another. This provides a new avenue for potential therapeutics as the ability to reinstate a careful balance between miRNA and HDACs has lead to improved outcomes in a number of in vitro and in vivo models of neurological conditions. In this review, we will discuss recent findings on the interplay between miRNAs and HDACs and its implications for pathogenesis and treatment of neurological conditions, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and stroke.
