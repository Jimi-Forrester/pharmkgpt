38899634|a|INTRODUCTION: Premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy (PBO) is associated with later-life cognition, but the underlying brain changes remain unclear. We assessed the impact of PBO and PBO age on white matter integrity. METHODS: Female participants with regional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were included (22 with PBO < 40 years; 43 with PBO 40-45 years; 39 with PBO 46-49 years; 907 referents without PBO < 50 years). Linear regression models adjusted for age and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. RESULTS: Females with PBO < 40 years, compared to referents, had lower FA and higher MD in the anterior corona radiata, genu of the corpus collosum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior occipital, and superior temporal white matter. Females who underwent PBO between 45 and 49 also had some changes in white matter integrity. DISCUSSION: Females who underwent PBO < 40 years had reduced white matter integrity across multiple regions in later-life. These results are important for females considering PBO for noncancerous conditions. HIGHLIGHTS: Females with premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy (PBO) < 40 years had lower FA versus referents. Females with PBO < 40 years had higher MD in many regions versus referents. Adjusting for estrogen replacement therapy use did not attenuate results. Females with PBO 45-49 years also had some white matter changes versus referents.
