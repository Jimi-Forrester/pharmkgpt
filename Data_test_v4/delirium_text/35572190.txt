35572190|t|Multimodal Analgesia in the Aesthetic Plastic Surgery: Concepts and Strategies.
35572190|a|Postoperative pain management is crucial for aesthetic plastic surgery procedures. Poorly controlled postoperative pain results in negative physiologic effects and can affect length of stay and patient satisfaction. In light of the growing opioid epidemic, plastic surgeons must be keenly familiar with opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia regimens to optimize postoperative pain control. Methods: A review study based on multimodal analgesia was conducted. Results: We present an overview of pain management strategies pertaining to aesthetic plastic surgery and offer a multimodal analgesia model for outpatient aesthetic surgery practices. Conclusion: This review article presents an evidence-based approach to multimodal pain management for aesthetic plastic surgery.
