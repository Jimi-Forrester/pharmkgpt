6913574|a|This study investigated the relationship of incidence, degree, and duration of PCD to age of the patient, time on cardiopulmonary bypass, mean arterial pressure on bypass, ICU time, and body temperature postoperatively. The study sample consisted of 50 open-heart surgery patients. The delirium assessment was made each evening for 7 days after operation. Manifestations of delirium were experienced by 72% of the sample. Incidence of PCD was related to blood pressure on bypass, age, and temperature on the third postoperative day. Using these variables as well as temperature on the first postoperative day, delirium was accurately predicted in 76% of the patients. Degree of PCD was related to age and time in ICU. Duration of delirium was related to age, ICU time, and temperature on the third postoperative day. Thus, the findings supported the multiple factor theory for etiology of PCD. Certain factors interacted to produce PCD, while different factors interacted to prolong and intensify the delirium produced.
