30854017|t|Metabolite Markers for Characterizing Sasang Constitution Type through GC-MS and 1H NMR-Based Metabolomics Study.
30854017|a|Sasang constitutional medicine classifies human beings into four types based on their physical and psychological characteristics. Despite its potential value in achieving personalized medicine, the diagnosis of sasang constitution (SC) type is complex and subjective. In this study, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolic analyses were conducted to find maker metabolites in serum and urine according to different SC types. Although some samples were overlapped on orthogonal projection to latent structure discriminant analysis score plots, serum samples showed separation between different SC types. Levels of lactate, glutamate, triglyceride, and fatty acids in serum and glycolic acid in urine of Tae-Eum type were higher than those of So-Eum and So-Yang type. Fatty acids, triglyceride, and lactate levels were found to be metabolites related to body mass index, indicating that marker metabolites for the diagnosis of SC type could be associated with obese. However, Tae-Eum type showed higher lactate levels in serum than So-Yang type for both normal weight and overweight groups, suggesting that the contents of serum lactate might be dependent on the SC type regardless of body weight. These results suggest that metabolomics analysis could be used to determine SC type.
