39506420|t|Identifying the Role of Oligodendrocyte Genes in the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease through Machine Learning and Bioinformatics Analysis.
39506420|a|BACKGROUND: Due to the heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the underlying pathogenic mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Oligodendrocyte (OL) damage and myelin degeneration are prevalent features of AD pathology. When oligodendrocytes are subjected to amyloid-beta (Abeta) toxicity, this damage compromises the structural integrity of myelin and results in a reduction of myelin-associated proteins. Consequently, the impairment of myelin integrity leads to a slowdown or cessation of nerve signal transmission, ultimately contributing to cognitive dysfunction and the progression of AD. Consequently, elucidating the relationship between oligodendrocytes and AD from the perspective of oligodendrocytes is instrumental in advancing our understanding of the pathogenesis of AD. OBJECTIVE: Here, an attempt is made in this study to identify oligodendrocyte-related biomarkers of AD. METHODS: AD datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and used for consensus clustering to identify subclasses. Hub genes were identified through differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis and oligodendrocyte gene set enrichment. Immune infiltration analysis was conducted using the CIBERSORT method. Signature genes were identified using machine learning algorithms and logistic regression. A diagnostic nomogram for predicting AD was developed and validated using external datasets and an AD model. A small molecular compound was identified using the eXtreme Sum algorithm. RESULTS: 46 genes were found to be significantly correlated with AD progression by examining the overlap between DEGs and oligodendrocyte genes. Two subclasses of AD, Cluster A, and Cluster B, were identified, and 9 signature genes were identified using a machine learning algorithm to construct a nomogram. Enrichment analysis showed that 9 genes are involved in apoptosis and neuronal development. Immune infiltration analysis found differences in immune cell presence between AD patients and controls. External datasets and RT-qPCR verification showed variation in signature genes between AD patients and controls. Five small molecular compounds were predicted. CONCLUSION: It was found that 9 oligodendrocyte genes can be used to create a diagnostic tool for AD, which could help in developing new treatments.
