35371594|a|Aging and aging-related diseases have emerged as increasingly severe health and social problems. Therefore, it is imperative to discover novel and effective therapeutics to delay the aging process and to manage aging-related diseases. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), one of the classes of antihyperglycemic drugs, have been recommended to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Moreover, GLP-1 RAs have been shown to protect against oxidative stress, cellular senescence and chronic inflammation, which are widely accepted as the major risk factors of aging. However, their significance in aging or aging-related diseases has not been elucidated. Herein, we explain the underlying mechanisms and protective roles of GLP-1 RAs in aging from a molecular, cellular and phenotypic perspective. We provide novel insights into the broad prospect of GLP-1 RAs in preventing and treating aging-related diseases. Additionally, we highlight the gaps for further studies in clinical applications of GLP-1 RAs in aging-related diseases. This review forms a basis for further studies on the relationship between aging-related diseases and GLP-1 RAs.
