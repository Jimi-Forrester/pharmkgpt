35700915|a|INTRODUCTION: Evidence indicates that the cerebellum is involved in cognitive processing. However, the specific mechanisms through which the cerebellum repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) contributes to the cognitive state are unclear. METHODS: In the current randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial, 27 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were randomly allotted to one of the two groups: rTMS-real or rTMS-sham. We investigated the efficacy of a four-week treatment of bilateral cerebellum rTMS to promote cognitive recovery and alter specific cerebello-cerebral functional connectivity. RESULTS: The cerebellum rTMS significantly improves multi-domain cognitive functions, directly associated with the observed intrinsic functional connectivity between the cerebellum nodes and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), medial frontal cortex, and the cingulate cortex in the real rTMS group. In contrast, the sham stimulation showed no significant impact on the clinical improvements and the cerebello-cerebral connectivity. CONCLUSION: Our results depict that 5 Hz rTMS of the bilateral cerebellum is a promising, non-invasive treatment of cognitive dysfunction in AD patients. This cognitive improvement is accompanied by brain connectivity modulation and is consistent with the pathophysiological brain disconnection model in AD patients.
