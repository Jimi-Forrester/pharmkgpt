9467725|t|The Alzheimerization of aging: a brief update.
9467725|a|This article extends the previously published opinion that the NIA disproportionately supports research related to Alzheimer's Disease at the expense of a more comprehensive research agenda. Letters to the editor, as well as newspaper interviews of partisans from the research community, both affirm and reject the opinion. The broader basic science community must overcome its traditional political apathy to pursue a more balanced research agenda at the NIA.
