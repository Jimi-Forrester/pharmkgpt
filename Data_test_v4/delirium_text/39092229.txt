39092229|a|Aim: To compare the effects of midazolam, propofol, and dexmedetomidine monotherapy and combination therapy on the prognosis of intensive care unit (ICU) patients receiving continuous mechanical ventilation (MV). Methods: 11,491 participants from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database 2008-2019 was included in this retrospective cohort study. The primary outcome was defined as incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), in-hospital mortality, and duration of MV. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were utilized to evaluate the association between sedation and the incidence of VAP. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to investigate the correlation between sedative therapy and in-hospital mortality. Additionally, univariate and multivariate linear analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between sedation and duration of MV. Results: Compared to patients not receiving these medications, propofol alone, dexmedetomidine alone, combination of midazolam and dexmedetomidine, combination of propofol and dexmedetomidine, combination of midazolam, propofol and dexmedetomidine were all association with an increased risk of VAP; dexmedetomidine alone, combination of midazolam and dexmedetomidine, combination of propofol and dexmedetomidine, combination of midazolam, propofol and dexmedetomidine may be protective factor for in-hospital mortality, while propofol alone was risk factor. There was a positive correlation between all types of tranquilizers and the duration of MV. Taking dexmedetomidine alone as the reference, all other drug groups were found to be associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. The administration of propofol alone, in combination with midazolam and dexmedetomidine, in combination with propofol and dexmedetomidine, in combination with midazolam, propofol and dexmedetomidine were associated with an increased risk of VAP compared to the use of dexmedetomidine alone. Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine alone may present as a favorable prognostic option for ICU patients with mechanical ventilation MV.
