38308660|t|Knowledge mapping of trends and hotspots in the field of exercise and cognition research over the past decade.
38308660|a|Exercise elicits a wide range of physiological responses in mammalian tissues that enhance a broad range of functions, particularly in improving cognitive performance. However, the field lacks a comprehensive bibliometric analysis that clarifies its knowledge structure and research hotspots. This study aims to address this gap and map the research landscape regarding the role of exercise in cognitive function enhancement. Firstly, the frequencies and co-occurrence of keywords were analysed to identify six main clusters: aging, cognitive impairment, rehabilitation, obesity, fatigue, and hippocampus. Secondly, reference timeline co-citation analysis revealed that hippocampus and aging were the major bursts with high intensity and long attention span while children had recently emerged as a topical subject. Finally, the evolution of themes from 2012 to 2022 was analysed, and found that older adults had been the leading research theme for exercise affecting cognition. Childhood obesity was an emerging theme that attracted increasing research attention in recent years while the hippocampus research theme expanded rapidly during the decade but remained a niche topic with less relevance to others. This research identified and summarised research priorities and evolutionary trends in exercise to improve cognition by constructing knowledge networks through visual analysis. It provides researchers with a comprehensive insight into the current state of the field to facilitate further research.
