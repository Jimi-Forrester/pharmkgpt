31869478|t|Reducing preoperative anxiety with Child Life preparation prior to intravenous induction of anesthesia: A randomized controlled trial.
31869478|a|BACKGROUND: Induction of anesthesia can be stressful: Up to 60% of children suffer significant anxiety immediately before surgery. Anxiety is associated with higher postoperative analgesia requirements, higher incidence of emergence delirium, and detrimental effects on sleep and behavior. Child Life preparation includes role-play, expectation-setting, and teaching coping strategies. AIM : The aim of this trial was to determine whether preoperative Child Life preparation reduces anxiety prior to intravenous induction of anesthesia. METHODS: Children aged 3-10 years, with no known preexisting anxiety and no preoperative anxiolytics, undergoing elective day surgery lasting <= 2 hours, were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. Each child's baseline anxiety was assessed in the anesthetic care unit, using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale-Short Form (mYPAS-SF, observational scores from 22.9, minimal anxiety, to 100, maximal anxiety) as the primary outcome. The child was randomly assigned to intervention (minimum 15 minutes Child Life preparation) or control (standard practice without Child Life preparation). Participants entered the operating room with one parent. A researcher (blinded to group allocation) scored the child's operating room anxiety using mYPAS-SF, up to the first attempt at intravenous cannulation. RESULTS: Fifty-nine children completed the study, aged median [interquartile range] 5 [3-7] years. Baseline mYPAS-SF anxiety was 29.2 [22.9-37.5] for all children, and operating room anxiety was 29.2 [22.9-49.0]. Operating room anxiety was higher than baseline in 16/31 (52%) children in the control group and 6/28 (21%) in the Child Life preparation group. ANCOVA revealed a significant effect of baseline mYPAS-SF anxiety and group on operating room anxiety (F = 10.31, P < .001, adjusted R2  = .24); individual parameter estimates indicated that Child Life preparation reduced operating room anxiety by 13.8 (95% CI 4.4-23.1) points compared to control, P = .005. CONCLUSION: A brief, targeted Child Life preparation session had a statistically significant effect on reducing preoperative anxiety prior to intravenous induction of anesthesia in young children, with no known preexisting anxiety. This effect may be clinically important and suggests that Child Life can be a valuable component of pediatric surgical care. Further research is required in specific populations.
