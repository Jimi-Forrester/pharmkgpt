In addition, systemic metabolic disorders such as oxygen metabolism dysfunction could be risk of dementia. Based on these findings, we have developed a deep neural network-based screening test (DNN-based test) of cognitive function using basic blood test data, which allowed prediction of cognitive function expressed by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. AIM: Here, we investigated whether the DNN-based test could be applicable to assessment of the effects of exercise-diet on cognitive function. METHODS: We studied the following two groups: (1) seven subjects of the local fitness gym (68.6 +- 3.2 years old). We evaluated cognitive function by the DNN-based test using blood data before and after the intervention (for 3 months). These results were compared with the measured MMSE score. (2) we studied a total of 230 subjects (67.9 +- 7.4 years old) who were members of the Tsuminory health class (Apple classroom). We assessed cognitive function by the DNN-based test before and after the intervention (for 2 months). We compared the predicted MMSE scores by the DNN-based test before and after the 2-month intervention. RESULTS: In the first group, the MMSE score predicted by the DNN-based test increased from 27.1 +- 0.8 to 27.6 +- 0.7 after the intervention period (p = 0.024). The measured MMSE score also increased after exercise, but not significant (P = 0.28). In the second group, the exercise-diet therapy increased the predicted MMSE scores in 189 cases (p < 0.001). In contrast, the therapy significantly reduced the mean MMSE score (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: The MMSE score predicted by the DNN-based test were increased by exercise-diet therapy in most subjects. The DNN-based test may be useful to monitor the effect of exercise-diet therapy on cognitive function aged people.
