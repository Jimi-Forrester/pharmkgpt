31925918|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety (mortality and readmissions) and efficiency (length of stay) of the hospital-in-the-home delirium pathway (THDP) compared with hospital-based care. METHODS: Patients admitted to THDP were compared against an age-matched cohort of patients with delirium managed entirely in hospital. Outcome data were obtained through retrospective chart review, and hospital coding was used to identify controls. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients were included in this study, of which 46 were managed on THDP. There was a significant frailty and co-morbidity burden with no differences in the demographic profile between groups. Inpatient length of stay was shorter on THDP (THDP mean 8 days, control 11 days; P = .02). One-month mortality was 13% in THDP compared with 24% in the control group (P = .2). One-month readmission was 30% in THDP and 18% in the control group (P = .23). CONCLUSION: The hospital-in-the-home delirium pathway is a promising alternative to in-hospital delirium care for selected patients.
