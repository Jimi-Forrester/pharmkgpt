36986553|a|In recent years, biodegradable polymers have gained the attention of many researchers for their promising applications, especially in drug delivery, due to their good biocompatibility and designable degradation time. Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is a biodegradable functional polymer made from the polymerization of lactic acid (LA) and glycolic acid (GA) and is widely used in pharmaceuticals and medical engineering materials because of its biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and good plasticity. The aim of this review is to illustrate the progress of research on PLGA in biomedical applications, as well as its shortcomings, to provide some assistance for its future research development.
