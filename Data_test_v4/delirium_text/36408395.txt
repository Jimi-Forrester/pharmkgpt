36408395|a|Background: Aberrant brain blood perfusion changes have been found to play an important role in the progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). However, the convergent and divergent patterns in brain perfusion between two dementias remain poorly documented. Objective: To explore the impaired brain perfusion pattern and investigate their overlaps and differences between AD and PDD using normalized cerebral blood flow (CBF). Methods: The regional perfusion in patients with AD and PDD as well as healthy control (HC) subjects were explored using the three-dimensional arterial spin labeling. The normalized CBF values were compared across the three groups and further explored the potential linkages to clinical assessments. Results: In total, 24 patients with AD, 26 patients with PDD, and 35 HC subjects were enrolled. Relative to the HC group, both the AD group and the PDD group showed reduced normalized CBF mainly in regions of the temporal and frontal gyrus, whereas preserved perfusion presented in the sensorimotor cortex and basal ganglia area. Compared with the AD group, the PDD group showed decreased perfusion in the right putamen and right supplementary motor area (SMA), while preserved perfusion in the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and right precuneus. In the AD group, significant correlations were observed between the normalized CBF values in the right IPL and scores of global cognitive function (P = 0.033, rho = 0.442), between the normalized CBF values in the right precuneus and the scores of memory function (P = 0.049,rho = 0.406). The normalized CBF in the right putamen was significantly linked to cores of motor symptoms (P = 0.017, rho = 0.214) in the PDD group. Conclusion: Our findings suggested convergent and divergent patterns of brain hemodynamic dysregulation between AD and PDD and contributed to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms.
