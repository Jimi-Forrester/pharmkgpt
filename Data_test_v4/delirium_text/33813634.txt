33813634|a|Epilepsy is a debilitating neurological disorder characterised by recurrent seizures for which 30% of patients are refractory to current treatments. The genetic and molecular aetiologies behind epilepsy are under investigation with the goal of developing new epilepsy medications. The transcriptional repressor REST (Repressor Element 1-Silencing Transcription factor) is a focus of interest as it is consistently upregulated in epilepsy patients and following brain insult in animal models of epilepsy and ischemia. This review analyses data from different epilepsy models and discusses the contribution of REST to epileptogenesis. We propose that in healthy brains REST acts in a protective manner to homeostatically downregulate increases in excitability, to protect against seizure through downregulation of BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) and its receptor, TrkB (Tropomyosin receptor kinase B). However, in epilepsy patients and post-seizure, REST may increase to a larger degree, which allows downregulation of the glutamate receptor subunit GluR2. This leads to AMPA glutamate receptors lacking GluR2 subunits, which have increased permeability to Ca2+, causing excitotoxicity, cell death and seizure. This concept highlights therapeutic potential of REST modulation through gene therapy in epilepsy patients.
