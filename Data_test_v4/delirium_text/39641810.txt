39641810|t|Exploring New and Promising Genetic Biomarkers for Evaluating Traumatic Brain Injuries: A Case-Control Study.
39641810|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of morbidity and death in all age groups, with an estimated 50 million people having brain injury due to trauma each year. Accurate blood-based biomarkers are needed to assist with diagnosis of patients across the spectrum of time and severity. Our objectives were to explore the diagnostic precision of time- and severity- related four blood-based biomarkers: AKT3, GSK-3beta, hsa-miR-16-5p, and MALAT-1 for TBI for the purpose of diagnosis, prognosis, and follow-up. 40 samples were recruited as the following: 30 TBI patients and 10 healthy volunteers as controls with matched age and sex. They were divided according to the Glasgow Coma Scale into mild (mTBI), moderate (modTBI), and severe(sTBI) TBI. Blood samples were withdrawn at entry, and after 5 and 30 days, RT-PCR was used for measuring the expression level. The results showed upregulated expression levels of AKT3, hsa-miR-16-5p and significantly downregulated expression levels of GSK-3beta in TBI patients compared to controls at all timings measured. mTBI patients showed a higher expression level of hsa-miR-16-5p compared with modTBI, and sTBI patients. MALAT-1 level showed a significant increase in severe cases only. We concluded that AKT3, hsa-miR-16-5p, and GSK-3beta are excellent diagnostic biomarkers in TBI patients at initial assessment, as well as at 5 and 30 days following the injury. Moreover, MALAT-1 had good diagnostic value in sTBI patients, and its prognostic value extends to 30 days. GSK-3beta was an excellent biomarker for detecting mTBI.
