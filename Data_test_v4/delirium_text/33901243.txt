33901243|a|As the most common type of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to be caused mainly by the excessive aggregation of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta). However, a growing number of studies have found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in the onset and progression of AD. The present study aimed to probe the neuroprotective effect of high-frequency low-intensity pulsed electric field (H-LIPEF) for SH-SY5Y cells against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Abeta-induced cytotoxicity. By looking in a systematic way into the frequency- and amplitude-dependent neuroprotective effect of pulsed electric field (PEF), the study finds that H-LIPEF at 200 Hz produces the optimal protective effect for SH-SY5Y cells. The underlying mechanisms were confirmed to be due to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and the downstream prosurvival and antioxidant proteins. Because the electric field can be modified to focus on specific area in a non-contact manner, the study suggests that H-LIPEF holds great potential for treating NDDs, whose effect can be further augmented with the administering of drugs or natural compounds at the same time.
