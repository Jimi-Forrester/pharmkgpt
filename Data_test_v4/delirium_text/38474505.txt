38474505|a|BACKGROUND: Paeonia lactiflora Pall. (PLP) is a plant with excellent ornamental and therapeutic value that can be utilized in traditional Chinese medicine as Paeoniae Radix Alba (PRA) and Paeoniae Radix Rubra (PRR). PRA must undergo the "peeling" process, which involves removing the cork and a portion of the phloem. PLP's biological function is strongly linked to its secondary metabolites, and the distribution of metabolites in different regions of the PLP rhizome causes changes in efficacy when PLP is processed into various therapeutic compounds. METHODS: The metabolites of the cork (cor), phloem (phl), and xylem (xyl) were examined in the roots of PLP using a metabolomics approach based on UPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS/MS (UPLC-MS/MS), and the differential metabolites were evaluated using multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Significant changes were observed among the cor, phl, and xyl samples. In both positive and negative ion modes, a total of 15,429 peaks were detected and 7366 metabolites were identified. A total of 525 cor-phl differential metabolites, 452 cor-xyl differential metabolites, and 328 phl-xyl differential metabolites were evaluated. Flavonoids, monoterpene glycosides, fatty acids, sugar derivatives, and carbohydrates were among the top 50 dissimilar chemicals. The key divergent metabolic pathways include linoleic acid metabolism, galactose metabolism, ABC transporters, arginine biosynthesis, and flavonoid biosynthesis. CONCLUSION: The cor, phl, and xyl of PLP roots exhibit significantly different metabolite types and metabolic pathways; therefore, "peeling" may impact the pharmaceutical effect of PLP. This study represents the first metabolomics analysis of the PLP rhizome, laying the groundwork for the isolation and identification of PLP pharmacological activity, as well as the quality evaluation and efficacy exploration of PLP.
