34430217|a|Endocrine disruption (ED) and endocrine disruptors (EDs) emerged as scientific concepts in 1995, after numerous chemical pollutants were found to be responsible for reproductive dysfunction. The World Health Organization established in the United Nations Environment Programme a list of materials, plasticizers, pesticides, and various pollutants synthesized from petrochemistry that impact not only reproduction, but also hormonal functions, directly or indirectly. Cells communicate via either chemical or electrical signals transmitted within the endocrine or nervous systems. To investigate whether hormone disruptors may also interfere directly or indirectly with the development or functioning of the nervous system through either a neuroendocrine or a more general mechanism, we examined the scientific literature to ascertain the effects of EDs on the nervous system, specifically in the categories of neurotoxicity, cognition, and behaviour. To date, we demonstrated that all of the 177 EDs identified internationally by WHO are known to have an impact on the nervous system. Furthermore, the precise mechanisms underlying this neurodisruption have also been established. It was previously believed that EDs primarily function via the thyroid. However, this study presents substantial evidence that approximately 80 % of EDs operate via other mechanisms. It thus outlines a novel concept: EDs are also neurodisruptors (NDs) and can be collectively termed endocrine and nervous disruptors (ENDs). Most of ENDs are derived from petroleum residues, and their various mechanisms of action are similar to those of "spam" in electronic communications technologies. Therefore, ENDs can be considered as an instance of spam in a biological context.
