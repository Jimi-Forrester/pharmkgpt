35480601|t|Prescribing practices, patterns, and potential harms in patients receiving palliative care: A systematic scoping review.
35480601|a|Background: Patients receiving palliative care often have existing comorbidities necessitating the prescribing of multiple medications. To maximize quality of life in this patient cohort, it is important to tailor prescribing of medication for preventing and treating existing illnesses and those for controlling symptoms, such as pain, according to individual specific needs. Objectives: To provide an overview of peer-reviewed observational research on prescribing practices, patterns, and potential harms in patients receiving palliative care. Methods: A systematic scoping review was conducted using four electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science). Each database was searched from inception to May 2020. Search terms included 'palliative care,' 'end of life,' and 'prescribing.' Eligible studies had to examine prescribing for adults (>=18 years) receiving palliative care in any setting as a study aim or outcome. Studies focusing on single medication types (e.g., opioids), medication classes (e.g., chemotherapy), or clinical indications (e.g., pain) were excluded. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for scoping reviews, and the findings were described using narrative synthesis. Results: Following deduplication, 16,565 unique citations were reviewed, and 56 studies met inclusion criteria. The average number of prescribed medications per patient ranged from 3 to 23. Typically, prescribing changes involved decreases in preventative medications and increases in symptom-specific medications closer to the time of death. Twenty-one studies assessed the appropriateness of prescribing using various tools. The prevalence of patients with >=1 potentially inappropriate prescription ranged from 15 to 92%. Three studies reported on adverse drug events. Conclusions: This scoping review provides a broad overview of existing research and shows that many patients receiving palliative care receive multiple medications closer to the time of death. Future research should focus in greater detail on prescribing appropriateness using tools specifically developed to guide prescribing in palliative care and the potential for harm.
