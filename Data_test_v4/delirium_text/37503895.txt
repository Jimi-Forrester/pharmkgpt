37503895|a|Strategic incorporation of achiral Calpha,alpha-dialkylated amino acids with bulky substituents into peptides can be used to promote extended strand conformations and inhibit protein-protein interactions associated with amyloid formation. In this work, we evaluate the thermodynamic impact of chiral Calpha,alpha monomers on folding preferences in such systems through introduction of a series of Calpha-methylated and Calpha-ethylated residues into a beta-hairpin host sequence. Depending on stereochemical configuration of the artificial monomer and potential for additional hydrophobic packing, a Calpha-ethyl-Calpha-propyl glycine residue can provide similar or enhanced folded stability relative to an achiral Calpha,alpha-diethyl analogue.
