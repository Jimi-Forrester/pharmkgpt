34759814|a|Objective: To investigate the association between plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels and neuropsychological performance in patients with cognitive decline using a highly sensitive nano-biosensing platform. Methods: We prospectively recruited 44 patients with cognitive decline who underwent plasma Abeta analysis, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, and detailed neuropsychological tests. Patients were classified into a normal control (NC, n = 25) or Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 19) group based on amyloid PET positivity. Multiple linear regression was performed to determine whether plasma Abeta (Abeta40, Abeta42, and Abeta42/40) levels were associated with neuropsychological test results. Results: The plasma levels of Abeta42/40 were significantly different between the NC and AD groups and were the best predictor of amyloid PET positivity by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis [area under the curve of 0.952 (95% confidence interval, 0.892-1.000)]. Although there were significant differences in the neuropsychological performance of cognitive domains (language, visuospatial, verbal/visual memory, and frontal/executive functions) between the NC and AD groups, higher levels of plasma Abeta42/40 were negatively correlated only with verbal and visual memory performance. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that plasma Abeta analysis using a nano-biosensing platform could be a useful tool for diagnosing AD and assessing memory performance in patients with cognitive decline.
