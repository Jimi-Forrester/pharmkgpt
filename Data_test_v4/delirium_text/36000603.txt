36000603|a|OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The term "frailty in the elderly" has become increasingly important with the increase of the elderly population, especially in diabetic subjects. Frailty is established by various scoring scales, such as Edmonton, Frail, and Prisma-7 scores. We aimed to evaluate the association between frailty and clinical and laboratory parameters of the geriatric type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: Diabetic patients over 65 years of age who presented to outpatient internal medicine clinics of our institution between June 2020 and January 2021 were enrolled to the study. Edmonton, Frail, and Prisma-7 scores were administered to the subjects. Study parameters were compared between well-controlled and poorly controlled diabetic groups according to diabetes control level and between frail and non-frail groups, according to each frailty scores. RESULTS: Frailty according to Edmonton score was associated with increased risks of hospitalization (p=0.005) and mortality (p=0.02). Frailty according to frail score was associated with increased risk of hospitalization (p=0.009). Frailty according to Prisma-7 score was associated with increased risk of mortality (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: We suggest that Edmonton frail score is superior to Frail and Prisma-7 scores in determining frailty in geriatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, since it is associated with both increased risk of hospitalization and mortality within 6 months.
