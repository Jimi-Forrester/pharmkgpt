36931947|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurological condition characterized by a gradual and progressive decline in memory, language, emotion, and cognition. It mainly affects elderly people. Due to the effects of AD, pharmaceutical medications and anticholinesterases have been vigorously promoted and approved by the FDA as a form of AD therapy. However, it was progressively found that these drugs did not address the underlying causes of AD pathogenesis; rather, they focused on the symptoms in order to enhance patients' cognitive outcomes. Consequently, a hunt for superior disease-modifying options is launched. Designing new therapeutic agents requires a thorough understanding of the neuroprotective processes and varied functions carried out by certain genes, and antibodies. In this comprehensive review article, we give an overview of the history of Alzheimer's disease, the significance of the blood-brain barrier in determining the scope of treatment options, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the current therapeutic treatment options for stem cell therapy, immunotherapy, regenerative therapy, and improved Alzheimer's disease care and diagnosis. We have also included a discussion on the potential role of aducanumab and Lecanemab as a cutting-edge therapy in refractory Alzheimer's disease patients. Lecanemab has been recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
