39247084|a|The central nervous system (CNS) is one of the most complex physiological systems, and treatment of CNS disorders represents an area of major medical need. One critical aspect of the CNS is its lack of regeneration, such that damage is often permanent. The damage often leads to neurodegeneration, and so strategies for neuroprotection could lead to major medical advances. The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family is one of the major receptor classes, and they have been successfully targeted clinically. One class of GPCRs is those activated by bioactive lysophospholipids as ligands, especially sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Research has been increasingly demonstrating the important roles that S1P and LPA, and their receptors, play in physiology and disease. In this review, I describe the role of S1P and LPA receptors in neurodegeneration and potential roles in neuroprotection. Much of our understanding of the role of S1P receptors has been through pharmacological tools. One such tool, fingolimod (also known as FTY720), which is a S1P receptor agonist but a functional antagonist in the immune system, is clinically efficacious in multiple sclerosis by producing a lymphopenia to reduce autoimmune attacks; however, there is evidence that fingolimod is also neuroprotective. Furthermore, fingolimod is neuroprotective in many other neuropathologies, including stroke, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and others that are discussed here. LPA receptors also appear to be involved, being upregulated in a variety of neuropathologies. Antagonists or mutations of LPA receptors, especially LPA1, are neuroprotective in a variety of conditions, including cortical development, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, stroke and others discussed here. Finally, LPA receptors may interact with other receptors, including a functional interaction with plasticity related genes.
