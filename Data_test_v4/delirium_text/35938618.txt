35938618|t|A computational study to target necroptosis via RIPK1 inhibition.
35938618|a|The human receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a critical necroptosis regulator implicated in cancer, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Currently, there are no specific RIPK1 antagonists in clinical practice. In this study, we took a target-based computational approach to identify blood-brain-barrier-permeable potent RIPK1 ligands with novel chemotypes. Using molecular docking, we virtually screened the Marine Natural Products (MNP) library of 14,492 small molecules. Initial 18 hits were subjected to detailed ADMET profiling for bioavailability, brain penetration, druglikeness, and toxicities and eventually yielded 548773-66-6 as the best ligand. RIPK1 548773-66-6 binding was validated through duplicated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations where the co-crystallized ligand L8D served as a reference. Trajectory analysis indicated negligible Root-Mean-Square-Deviations (RMSDs) of the best ligand 548773-66-6 relative to the protein backbone: 0.156 +- 0.043 nm and 0.296 +- 0.044 nm (mean +- standard deviations) in two individual simulations. Visual inspection confirmed that 548773-66-6 occupied the RIPK1 ligand-binding pocket associated with the kinase activation loop. Further computations demonstrated consistent hydrogen bond interactions of the ligand with the residue ASP156. Binding free energy estimation also supported stable interactions of 548773-66-6 and RIPK1. Together, our in silico analysis predicted 548773-66-6 as a novel ligand for RIPK1. Therefore, 548773-66-6 could be a viable lead for inhibiting necroptosis in central nervous system inflammatory disorders.
