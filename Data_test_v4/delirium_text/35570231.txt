35570231|t|Naturally-Occurring Antibodies Against Bim are Decreased in Alzheimer's Disease and Attenuate AD-type Pathology in a Mouse Model.
35570231|a|Increased neuronal apoptosis is an important pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) mediates amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced neuronal apoptosis. Naturally-occurring antibodies against Bim (NAbs-Bim) exist in human blood, with their levels and functions unknown in AD. In this study, we found that circulating NAbs-Bim were decreased in AD patients. Plasma levels of NAbs-Bim were negatively associated with brain amyloid burden and positively associated with cognitive functions. Furthermore, NAbs-Bim purified from intravenous immunoglobulin rescued the behavioral deficits and ameliorated Abeta deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, microgliosis, and neuronal apoptosis in APP/PS1 mice. In vitro investigations demonstrated that NAbs-Bim were neuroprotective against AD through neutralizing Bim-directed neuronal apoptosis and the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein. These findings indicate that the decrease of NAbs-Bim might contribute to the pathogenesis of AD and immunotherapies targeting Bim hold promise for the treatment of AD.
