36265303|t|A naphthalimide-based and Golgi-targetable fluorescence probe for quantifying hypochlorous acid.
36265303|a|The Golgi apparatus (GA) is a vital organelle in biological systems and excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) is produced during stress in the Golgi apparatus. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is a significant reactive oxygen species and has strong oxidative and antibacterial activity, but excessive secretion of hypochlorous acid can affect Golgi structure or function abnormally, it will lead to a series of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, and Parkinson's disease. In present work, a novel fluorescent probe for Golgi localization utilizing naphthalimide derivatives was constructed to detect hypochlorous acid. The fluorescent probe used a derivatived 1,8-naphthalimide as the emitting fluorescence group, phenylsulfonamide as the localization group and dimethylthiocarbamate as the sensing unit. When HOCl was absent, the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process of the developed probe was hindered and the probe exhibited a weak fluorescence. When HOCl was present, the ICT process occurred and the probe showed strong green fluorescence. When the HOCl concentration was altered from 5.0 x 10-7 to 1.0 x 10-5 mol L-1, the fluorescence intensity of the probe well linearly correlated with the HOCl concentration. The detection limit of 5.7 x 10-8 mol L-1 was obtained for HOCl. The HOCl fluorescent probe possessed a rapid reaction time, a high selectivity and a broad working pH scope. In addition, the probe possessed good biocompatibility and had been magnificently employed to image Golgi HOCl in Hela cells. These characteristics of the probe demonstrated its ability to be used for sensing endogenous and exogenous hypochlorous acids within the Golgi apparatus of living cells.
