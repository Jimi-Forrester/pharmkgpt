26716196|t|Preparation of Amyloid Immuno-Nanoparticles as Potential MRI Contrast Agents for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis.
26716196|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia which is caused by accumulation in the brain of plaques made up of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). Research on nanosized systems indicated that nanoparticles (NPs) could pass across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and improve the visibility of internal body structures in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which made it possible to aid the early diagnosis of AD. In this research study we synthesized magnetite nanoparticles by high-temperature solution-phase reaction, transferred into water based on a ligand exchange process and coated with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic (DMSA). Subsequently, the anti-amyloid Abeta immunomagnetic nanoparticles (IMNPs) were prepared by grafting anti-amyloid antibodies on the surface of the DMSA-coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was introduced to evaluate the IMNPs activity and conjugation amount of antibodies. The biocompatibility of the IMNPs was tested by colony-forming assay. The results showed that the anti-amyloid Abeta IMNPs were biocompatible and biologically active, as well as effective in enhancing MRI solution, indicating that the IMNPs could be used as potential MRI contrast agents and targeted carriers for AD early diagnosis and therapy.
