31833453|a|This research is geared toward the evaluation of current and pre-morbid personality psychopathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study was conducted with four groups who were administered the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4+, mainly in the form of individual interviews. Current measurement: AD Group, 44 female participants (M = 81.36 years); Control Group, 80 female participants from the population at large (M = 75.84 years). Pre-morbid measurement: AD Group Informants (n = 40); Control Group Informants (n = 42). The incidence of all clusters in clinical state are significant, and Cluster B incidence in pre-morbidity is evidenced. Cluster C is highlighted throughout the life course as a predictor. Logistic regression analyses showed that schizotypical, narcissistic, avoidant, obsessive-compulsive, pre-morbid schizotypical, pre-morbid histrionic, and pre-morbid obsessive-compulsive personality disorders, predicted the presence of AD diagnosis, accounting for 49% of the variance. These findings are relevant to research relating personality and psychopathology in Alzheimer's disease.
