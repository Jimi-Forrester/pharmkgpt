25345439|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is one of the few neuropathological biomarkers associated with transporters of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Despite the well-characterized clinical indication of decreasing Abeta levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the link between the alternation of Abeta level in the blood and the progress of the disorder is still controversial. Here, we report a direct correlation of Abeta(1-42) levels between CSF and plasma in AD mouse model. We injected monomeric Abeta(1-42) directly into the intracerebroventricular (ICV) region of normal adult mouse brains to induce AD-like phenotypes. Using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we observed proportional elevation of Abeta(1-42) levels in both CSF and plasma in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings that plasma Abeta(1-42) reflects the condition of CSF Abeta(1-42) warrant further investigation as a biomarker for the blood diagnosis of AD.
