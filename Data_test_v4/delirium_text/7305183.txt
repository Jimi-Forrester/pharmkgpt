7305183|t|[Psychosis and grammatical reality. Preliminary to an axiomatic system].
7305183|a|This paper is elaborated in the same order of those who developpe the idea that, Psychosis is pleaded as an alibi of a totalitarian reality (Psychosis alibi). So it may allow to disengage the evolution of the Psychiatry outside of the anti-psychiatry ideologies. The main subject of this work, is to analyse the gap between the Reality which includes the psychosis as a part of herself (Psychosis as disease). On the second hand the Reality of the psychosis from the psycho-pathologic point of view (delirium, hallucinations, autism, etc...). Considering the importance of the formal grammatical functions in the linguistic matter to site the reference to the reality according to the rules of the communication and the oral expression; so we propose a grammatical analysis. Two parts are distinguishable in this work. The first part concerns a review of languages proposed in different psychiatric "theorization" established previously about mental disorder. So it could be considered that the psychosis is the one who "speaks" the psychiatry. The second part concerns an abstract of the "semiotiques" studies by which we can tackle the psychosis with a scientific language: The Psychiatric "speaking" the psychosis not the opposite. This way of analyse allows to realize the modifications in the part of both protagonists in the game. By the same way, it authorizes to introduce the psychiatry from the axiomatic point of view, allowing a self-contained definition as a branch of the medicine, and disengaging his subject: The psychosis; as a syntactic subject.
