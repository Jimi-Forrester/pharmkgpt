38434042|a|Huntington's disease is caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene encoding an extended PolyQ tract within the Huntingtin protein (mHtt). This expansion results in selective degeneration of striatal medium spiny projection neurons in the basal ganglia. The mutation causes abnormalities during neurodevelopment in human and mouse models. Here, we report that mHtt/PolyQ aggregates inhibit the cell cycle in the Drosophila brain during development. PolyQ aggregates disrupt the nuclear pore complexes of the cells preventing the translocation of cell cycle proteins such as Cyclin E, E2F and PCNA from cytoplasm to the nucleus, thus affecting cell cycle progression. PolyQ aggregates also disrupt the nuclear pore complex and nuclear import in mHtt expressing mammalian CAD neurons. PolyQ toxicity and cell cycle defects can be restored by enhancing RanGAP-mediated nuclear import, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for this disease.
