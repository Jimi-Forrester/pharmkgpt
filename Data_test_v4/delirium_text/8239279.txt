8239279|t|The beta A4 amyloid protein precursor in human circulation.
8239279|a|beta A4, the principal constituent of the brain amyloid collections in Alzheimer's disease, is derived from a much larger precursor, the amyloid protein precursor (APP). APP exists in the blood as full-length, potentially amyloidogenic forms in platelets, and as an attenuated species in plasma and T-lymphocytes. Studies of circulating APP facilitate the elaboration of the function of this protein, as well as the elucidation of its processing in health and disease.
