35237132|t|Erythrophagocytosis by Microglia/Macrophage in Intracerebral Hemorrhage: From Mechanisms to Translation.
35237132|a|Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating condition characterized by hematoma related mass effect. Microglia/macrophage (M phi) are rapidly recruited in order to remove the red blood cells through erythrophagocytosis. Efficient erythrophagocytosis can detoxify hemolytic products and facilitate neurological recovery after ICH. The underlying mechanisms include modulation of inflammatory response and oxidative stress, among others. It is a dynamic process mediated by a cascade of signal transduction, including "find-me" signals, "eat-me" signals and a set of phagocytotic receptors-ligand pairs that may be exploited as therapeutic targets. This review summarizes mechanistic signaling pathways of erythrophagocytosis and highlights the potential of harnessing M phi-mediated phagocytosis for ICH treatment.
