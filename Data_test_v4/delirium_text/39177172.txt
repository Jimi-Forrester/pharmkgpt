39177172|t|Asian Cohort for Alzheimer Disease (ACAD) Pilot Study: Vietnamese Americans.
39177172|a|INTRODUCTION: The objective of this pilot study was to establish the feasibility of recruiting older Vietnamese Americans for research addressing genetic and nongenetic risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: Twenty-six Vietnamese Americans were recruited from communities in San Diego. A Community Advisory Board provided cultural and linguistic advice. Bilingual/bicultural staff measured neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, lifestyle, and medical/neurological functioning remotely. Saliva samples allowed DNA extraction. A consensus team reviewed clinical data to determine a diagnosis of normal control (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia. Exploratory analyses addressed AD risk by measuring subjective cognitive complaints (SCC), depression, and vascular risk factors (VRFs). RESULTS: Twenty-five participants completed the study (mean age=73.8 y). Eighty percent chose to communicate in Vietnamese. Referrals came primarily from word of mouth within Vietnamese communities. Diagnoses included 18 NC, 3 MCI, and 4 dementia. Participants reporting SCC acknowledged more depressive symptoms and had greater objective cognitive difficulty than those without SCC. Eighty-eight percent of participants reported at least 1 VRF. DISCUSSION: This pilot study supports the feasibility of conducting community-based research in older Vietnamese Americans. Challenges included developing linguistically and culturally appropriate cognitive and neuropsychiatric assessment tools. Exploratory analyses addressing nongenetic AD risk factors suggest topics for future study.
