27757933|t|Treating Hypertension to Prevent Cognitive Decline and Dementia: Re-Opening the Debate.
27757933|a|Hypertension and dementia are two of the most prevalent and damaging diseases associated with aging. Chronic hypertension, particularly during mid-life, is a strong risk factor for late-life cognitive decline and impairment. Hypertension is also the number one risk factor for stroke and a major contributor to the pathogenesis of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Despite the vast epidemiologic and mechanistic evidence linking hypertension to cognitive impairment, and the positive effects of blood pressure lowering on reducing the risk of post-stroke dementia, uncertainty remains about the benefit of antihypertensive medication on other forms of dementia. This chapter reviews the link between hypertension and cognition, and discusses the evidence for and against the use of antihypertensive medication for dementia prevention.
