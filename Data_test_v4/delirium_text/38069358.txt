38069358|t|Metabolome Profiling of Marrubium peregrinum L. and Marrubium friwaldskyanum Boiss Reveals Their Potential as Sources of Plant-Based Pharmaceuticals.
38069358|a|Marrubium species have been used since ancient times as food additives and curative treatments. Their phytochemical composition and various pharmacological activities were the focus of a number of scientific investigations but no comprehensive metabolome profiling to identify the numerous primary and secondary metabolites has been performed so far. This study aimed to generate a comprehensive picture of the total metabolite content of two Marrubium species-M. peregrinum and M. friwaldskyanum-to provide detailed information about the main primary and secondary metabolites. In addition, the elemental composition was also evaluated. For this purpose, non-targeted metabolomic analyses were conducted using GC-MS, UPLC-MS/MS and ICP-MS approaches. Nearly 500 compounds and 12 elements were detected and described. The results showed a strong presence of phenolic acids, flavonoids and their glucosides, which are generally of great interest due to their various pharmacological activities. Furthermore, tissue-specific analyses for M. friwaldskyanum stem, leaves and flowers were carried out in order to outline the sources of potentially important bioactive molecules. The results generated from this study depict the Marrubium metabolome and reveal its dual scientific importance-from one side, providing information about the metabolites that is fundamental and vital for the survival of these species, and from the other side, defining the large diversity of secondary substances that are a potential source of phytotherapeutic agents.
