38059052|t|High temperatures on mental health: Recognizing the association and the need for proactive strategies-A perspective.
38059052|a|Background and Aims: The influence of temperature on various aspects of daily life is often underestimated, and its effects on mental health are not widely recognized. Understanding and addressing the relationship between temperature and mental well-being is crucial in the context of climate change and rising global temperatures. This perspective aimed to investigate the effects of high temperatures on mental health and identify proactive strategies to mitigate these effects. Methods: This perspective adopted a twofold approach, including a comprehensive literature review and socioecological framework. The literature review involved extensive searches across Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus to identify relevant, peer-reviewed articles, and reports from diverse disciplines. Results: The perspective emphasized the significance of recognizing heat stress and its consequences on mental well-being. Chronic heat stress can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. Vulnerable populations include, the very young, older adults, and individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions. Socioeconomic factors can further exacerbate vulnerability, highlighting the need for tailored strategies to manage mental health challenges during high temperatures. Additionally, the article identified and discussed proactive coping strategies to minimize both the psychological and physical impacts of heat stress. Mindfulness, stress management techniques, and therapy are suggested as effective means for individuals to manage psychological distress. Conclusion: Implementing preventive measures are essential steps in promoting mental wellness in high temperatures. Proactive strategies by addressing the physiological and psychological effects of heat and considering the specific needs of vulnerable populations can help individuals and communities navigate the challenges posed by rising temperatures and promote resilience and preserve their mental well-being.
