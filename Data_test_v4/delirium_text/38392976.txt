38392976|t|Novel Approaches to Studying SLC13A5 Disease.
38392976|a|The role of the sodium citrate transporter (NaCT) SLC13A5 is multifaceted and context-dependent. While aberrant dysfunction leads to neonatal epilepsy, its therapeutic inhibition protects against metabolic disease. Notably, insights regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena are limited due to the intricacy and complexity of the latent human physiology, which is poorly captured by existing animal models. This review explores innovative technologies aimed at bridging such a knowledge gap. First, I provide an overview of SLC13A5 variants in the context of human disease and the specific cell types where the expression of the transporter has been observed. Next, I discuss current technologies for generating patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their inherent advantages and limitations, followed by a summary of the methods for differentiating iPSCs into neurons, hepatocytes, and organoids. Finally, I explore the relevance of these cellular models as platforms for delving into the intricate molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying SLC13A5-related disorders.
