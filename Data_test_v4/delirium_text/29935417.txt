29935417|a|We investigated whether subtypes of Alzheimer's disease (AD), that is, typical, limbic-predominant, hippocampal-sparing, and minimal atrophy AD, had a specific signature of small vessel disease and neurodegeneration. Four hundred twenty-three clinically diagnosed AD patients were included (161 typical, 121 limbic-predominant, 70 hippocampal-sparing, 71 minimal atrophy). One hundred fifty-six fulfilled a biomarkers-based AD diagnosis. White matter hyperintensities and cerebral microbleeds (CMB) had the highest prevalence in limbic-predominant AD, and the lowest prevalence in minimal atrophy AD. CMB existed evenly in lobar and deep brain areas in limbic-predominant, typical, and hippocampal-sparing AD. In minimal atrophy AD, CMB were mainly located in brain lobar areas. Perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale were more prevalent in typical AD. Small vessel disease contributed to the prediction of Mini-Mental State Examination. Minimal atrophy AD showed highly pathological levels of cerebrospinal fluid Ass1-42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau, in the absence of overt brain atrophy. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy seems to have a stronger contribution to hippocampal-sparing and minimal atrophy AD, whereas hypertensive arteriopathy may have a stronger contribution to typical and limbic-predominant AD.
