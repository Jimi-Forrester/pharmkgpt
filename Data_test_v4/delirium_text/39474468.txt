39474468|t|Clinical features of Chagas disease progression and severity.
39474468|a|Chagas disease, the most common form of nonischaemic cardiomyopathy globally, is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Latin America. Chagas cardiomyopathy has a wide clinical spectrum and prognosis, which is primarily determined by the severity of left ventricular dysfunction. Chagas disease also affects the brain, particularly manifesting as cardioembolic strokes and cognitive impairments. Disease progression is influenced by various factors such as anti-parasite treatments, host-parasite interactions, and other determinants. This review explores Chagas disease, covering clinical presentations, the range of severity of Chagas cardiomyopathy, and neurological manifestations. We investigate factors that influence the progression of cardiomyopathy, including anti-parasitic treatments, interactions between hosts and parasites, and the influence of social determinants on the course of the disease. This review analyses key prognostic factors associated with the progression and mortality of Chagas cardiomyopathy, offering insights into this potentially fatal illness.
