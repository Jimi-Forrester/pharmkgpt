31976005|a|Huang-Lian-Jie-Du Decoction (HLJDD), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is proven to have ameliorative effects on learning and memory deficits of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current study aims to reveal the underlying mechanism of HLJDD in the treatment of AD by simultaneous determination on the regulation of HLJDD on oxidative stress, neurotransmitters, and AMPK-SIRT1 pathway in AD. AD model rat was successfully established by injection of D-galactose and Abeta 25-35-ibotenic acid. Morris Water Maze (MWM) test was used to evaluate the success of AD modelling. On this basis, an advanced technique with UPLC-QqQ MS/MS was built up and applied to determine the levels of 8 neurotransmitters in rat plasma. Significant alternation in methionine, glutamine, and tryptophan was observed in AD rats' plasma after the administration of HLJDD, relative to the model group. Meanwhile, HLJDD could upregulate the levels of SOD, GSH-Px, AMPK, and SIRT1 and downregulate the content of MDA in the peripheral system of the AD rats. The underlying therapeutic mechanism of HLJDD for the treatment of AD was associated with alleviating oxidation stress, inflammation, neurotransmitters, and energy metabolism. These data provide solid foundation for the potential use of HLJDD to treat AD.
