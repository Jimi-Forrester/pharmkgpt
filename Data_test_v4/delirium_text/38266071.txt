38266071|t|Baclofen in the treatment of alcohol use disorder: tailored doses matter.
38266071|a|AIMS: To address the question of tailored baclofen prescribing in alcohol use disorder (AUD) in relation to dose-dependent efficacy and the potential danger of high doses and to provide suggestions for the use of high doses of baclofen in the treatment of AUD. The context is the approvement in France of baclofen in the treatment of AUD without dose limitation, making French physicians, who usually prescribe baclofen in a tailored manner, often use high or very high doses. METHODS: A narrative review of the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that used tailored baclofen prescribing and of the severe adverse effects of baclofen that have been reported in the literature. RESULTS: The results show that RCTs using tailored doses of baclofen in AUD are not completely demonstrative, though they are encouraging according to certain meta-analyses, while observational studies that used tailored doses constantly show a good effectiveness of baclofen treatment. The results suggest that many severe adverse effects of baclofen could be related to a nonrespect by physicians of prescription rules and appropriate treatment monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: The use of tailored doses shows that the dose required to suppress cravings is highly variable, low or high, depending on each case. Analysis of the circumstances in which severe adverse effects occur suggest that a careful monitoring of baclofen prescribing might prevent a large majority of severe adverse effects. We propose that the education of the patients and the prescription skills, seriousness, and availability of the prescribing physicians are of major importance in the managing of tailored baclofen treatment of AUD.
