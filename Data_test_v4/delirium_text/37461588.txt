37461588|t|Temporal trends, sex differences, and age-related disease influence in Neutrophil, Lymphocyte count and Neutrophil to Lymphocyte-ratio. Results from InCHIANTI follow-up study.
37461588|a|Background Neutrophils and lymphocytes represent the larger percentage of all blood white cells, they vary with age, with a progressive increase of the ratio in the first years of life, and then tend to remain at similar levels in steady state condition during adult age. Neutrophils to lymphocytes-ratio (NL-ratio) was proposed as an effective and low-cost marker to monitor and predict clinical condition evolution. The main objective of the study is to analyze its temporal trend variation, over twenty years' follow-up, according to age, sex, and main clinical diagnosis, in a large representative Italian population. Methods The InCHIANTI study enrolled representative samples from the registry list of two towns in Tuscany, Italy. Baseline data were collected in 1998, and last follow-up visits in 2015-18. Out of the 1453 participants enrolled, 1343 were included, and consented to donate a blood sample. All subjects were assessed and followed for life-style, clinical condition, physical performance, and underwent an instrumental diagnostic session. Results The NL-ratio showed a statistically significant interaction between birth-cohort and time of the study (p-value=0.005). A gender dimorphism was recognized in the neutrophils absolute count and in the NL-ratio. Moreover, in female participants only, those who reported CHF had lower neutrophil-count and NL-ratio; whereas an increase in creatinine clearance was directly associated with NL-ratio. In male subjects, an increase of BMI was inversely associated with both NL-ratio and neutrophils-count during the follow-up; a similar association but in the opposite direction was observed in female participants. Conclusion NL-ratio is a more reliable marker of biological age than absolute lymphocytes and/or neutrophils counts. It is associated with the changes induced by disease, lifestyle, and environmental challenges in the immune system. NL-ratio confirms the gender dimorphism in the occurrence of inflammation-driven diseases. Therefore, additional evidence emerged for the necessity for tailored sex-specific measures to prevent and treat such diseases.
