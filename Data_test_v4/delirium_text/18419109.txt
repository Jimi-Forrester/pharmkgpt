18419109|t|Benzofuran-based hybrid compounds for the inhibition of cholinesterase activity, beta amyloid aggregation, and abeta neurotoxicity.
18419109|a|The complex etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) prompts scientists to develop multitarget strategies to combat causes and symptoms. We therefore designed, synthesized, and tested new hybrid molecules linking a benzofuran ring to a N-methyl- N-benzylamine through a heptyloxy chain, affording a series of potential multifunctional drugs for AD. The cholinesterase inhibitory activity was extended to the inhibition of Abeta fibril formation for 1, 3, and 5. Compound 3 showed an additional neuroprotective effect.
