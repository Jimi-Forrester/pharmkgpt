25408905|t|Neuroregeneration and dementia: new treatment options.
25408905|a|In the last years, physiological aging became a general concept that includes all the changes that occur in organism with old age. It is obvious now, that in developing and developed countries, new health problems concerning older population appear. One of these major concerns is probably dementia. Sooner or later, all forms of dementia lead to learning deficit, memory loss, low attention span, impairment of speech and poor problem solving skills. Normal ageing is a physiological process that also involves a lot of neurological disorders with the same type of symptoms and effects that many researchers are trying to minimize in demented patients. In this review we try to highlight some of the newest aspects of therapeutic strategies that can improve natural neuroregeneration.
