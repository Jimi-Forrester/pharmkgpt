39248004|t|Depth of anesthesia monitoring: an argument for its use for patient safety.
39248004|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There have been significant advancements in depth of anesthesia (DoA) technology. The Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation recently published recommendations to use a DoA monitor in specific patient populations receiving general anesthesia. However, the universal use of DoA monitoring is not yet accepted. This review explores the current state of DoA monitors and their potential impact on patient safety. RECENT FINDINGS: We reviewed the current evidence for using a DoA monitor and its potential role in preventing awareness and preserving brain health by decreasing the incidence of postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction or decline (POCD). We also explored the evidence for use of DoA monitors in improving postoperative clinical indicators such as organ dysfunction, mortality and length of stay. We discuss the use of DoA monitoring in the pediatric population, as well as highlight the current limitations of DoA monitoring and the path forward. SUMMARY: There is evidence that DoA monitoring may decrease the incidence of awareness, postoperative delirium, POCD and improve several postoperative outcomes. In children, DoA monitoring may decrease the incidence of awareness and emergence delirium, but long-term effects are unknown. While there are key limitations to DoA monitoring technology, we argue that DoA monitoring shows great promise in improving patient safety in most, if not all anesthetic populations.
