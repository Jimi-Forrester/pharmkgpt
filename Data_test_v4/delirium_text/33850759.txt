33850759|t|Safety, efficacy and cost of intra-operative cell salvage during open radical prostatectomy.
33850759|a|BACKGROUND: We aim to examine the safety and efficacy of intra-operative cell salvage (ICS) in radical prostatectomy. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed, enrolling consecutive patients undergoing open radical prostatectomy at two institutions during 01/01/18-31/12/19. Patients were grouped by ICS use. Primary outcomes were allogeneic transfusion rates, and biochemical recurrence (prostate specific antigen >0.2 mg/mL). Secondary outcomes were use of adjuvant therapies, Clavien-Dindo complications and transfusion-related cost (allogeneic transfusion + ICS setup + ICS reinfusion). RESULTS: In total, 168 men were enrolled. Patients were grouped based on whether they received no blood conservation technique (126 men) or ICS (42 men). Groups were similar in median age, pre- and post-operative haemoglobin and length of stay. They also had similar post-operative tumour Gleason score, TNM-stage and positive surgical margin rates. Compared with controls, the ICS group had shorter follow up (336 vs. 225 days; P=0.003). The groups had similar rates of biochemical recurrence (17% vs. 14%; P=0.90), adjuvant therapy use (30% vs. 29%; P=0.85) and complications (14% vs. 19% patients; P=0.46). There was no metastatic progression or cancer-specific mortality in either group. Although a similar proportion of patients received allogenic transfusion (2.4% vs. 4.8%; P=0.33) and units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) (9 vs. 5 units), transfusion-related costs were higher amongst the ICS group (AUD $11,422 vs. $43,227). CONCLUSIONS: ICS use in radical prostatectomy was not associated with altered rates of allogeneic transfusion, complications, biochemical recurrence or adjuvant or salvage therapies. Transfusion related costs were higher in the ICS group.
