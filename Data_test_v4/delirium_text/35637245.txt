35637245|t|A study of the oxidative processes in human plasma by time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.
35637245|a|The aim of this study was to examine the usefulness of time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy in the evaluation of the oxidative processes in human plasma. To investigate the impact of oxidative stress on the fluorescence of plasma, five studied markers (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, ischemia modified albumin, carbonyl groups, hydrogen peroxide, advanced oxidation protein products) were chosen as oxidative damage approved markers. Our method presents several advantages over traditional methods as it is a direct, non-time-consuming, repeatable, and non-invasive technique that requires only simple pre-treatment of samples without additional reagents and the sample size needed for analysis is small. In principle, each modification of the protein in plasma can be expected to modify its fluorescence properties and hence its lifetime or intensity. The study involved 59 blood donors with no evidence of disease. The research was conducted at excitation wavelengths of 280 nm and 360 nm, and emission was measured at wavelengths of 350 nm and 440 nm, respectively. Our results, although preliminary, suggest that the application of fluorescence measurements can be considered as an effective marker of oxidative stress. Regression analyses showed that a notable growth in fluorescence intensity at 440 nm and a simultaneous decrease in fluorescence intensity and mean fluorescence lifetime at 350 nm are associated with higher levels of oxidative stress.
