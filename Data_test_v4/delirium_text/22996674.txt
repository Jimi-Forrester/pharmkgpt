22996674|a|OBJECTIVE: Depression may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have shown modifications in blood beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels in depressed patients. This literature review examines the potential relationship between Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity and pathophysiology of mood disorders. DESIGN: We conducted a review of the literature focusing on recent studies reporting alterations of plasma and serum Abeta peptides levels in patients suffering from mood disorders. RESULTS: Different data suggest that patients with mood disorders are at great risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia. In particular, low plasma levels of Abeta42 peptide and a high Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio have been found in depressed patients. In addition, changes in Abeta protein levels in patients with mood disorders have been associated with the severity of cognitive impairment and correlated positively with the number of episodes and severity of illness course. CONCLUSIONS: Given the intriguing association between change in plasma level of Abeta, depression and cognitive impairment, future work should focus on the relationship between Abeta peripheral level(s), biomarkers of neurodegeneration and development of dementia in patients affected by mood disorders.
