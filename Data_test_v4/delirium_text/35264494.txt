35264494|t|Efficacy of Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping with Brain Surface Correction and Vein Removal for Detecting Increase Magnetic Susceptibility in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
35264494|a|PURPOSE: Studies on quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) have reported an increase in magnetic susceptibilities in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the pathological importance of the brain surface areas, they are sometimes excluded in QSM analysis. This study aimed to reveal the efficacy of QSM analysis with brain surface correction (BSC) and/or vein removal (VR) procedures. METHODS: Thirty-seven AD patients and 37 age- and sex-matched, cognitively normal (CN) subjects were included. A 3D-gradient echo sequence at 3T MRI was used to obtain QSM. QSM images were created with regularization enabled sophisticated harmonic artifact reduction for phase data (RESHARP) and constrained RESHARP with BSC and/or VR. We conducted ROI analysis between AD patients and CN subjects who did or did not undergo BSC and/or VR using a t-test, to compare the susceptibility values after gray matter weighting. RESULTS: The susceptibility values in RESHARP without BSC were significantly larger in AD patients than in CN subjects in one region (precentral gyrus, 8.1 +- 2.9 vs. 6.5 +- 2.1 ppb) without VR and one region with VR (precentral gyrus, 7.5 +- 2.8 vs. 5.9 +- 2.0 ppb). Three regions in RESHARP with BSC had significantly larger susceptibilities without VR (precentral gyrus, 7.1 +- 2.0 vs. 5.9 +- 2.0 ppb; superior medial frontal gyrus, 5.7 +- 2.6 vs. 4.2 +- 3.1 ppb; putamen, 47,8 +- 16.5 vs. 40.0 +- 15.9 ppb). In contrast, six regions showed significantly larger susceptibilities with VR in AD patients than in CN subjects (precentral gyrus, 6.4 +- 1.9 vs. 4.9 +- 2.7 ppb; superior medial frontal gyrus, 5.3 +- 2.7 vs. 3.7 +- 3.3 ppb; orbitofrontal cortex, -2.1 +- 2.7 vs. -3.6 +- 3.2 ppb; parahippocampal gyrus, 0.1 +- 3.6 vs. -1.7 +- 3.7 ppb; putamen, 45.0 +- 14.9 vs. 37.6 +- 14.6 ppb; inferior temporal gyrus, -3.4 +- 1.5 vs. -4.4 +- 1.5 ppb). CONCLUSION: RESHARP with BSC and VR showed more regions of increased susceptibility in AD patients than in CN subjects. This study highlights the efficacy of this method in facilitating the diagnosis of AD.
