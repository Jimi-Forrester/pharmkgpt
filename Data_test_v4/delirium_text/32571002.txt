32571002|a|OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia are prevalent and extremely burdening for the patient and caregivers, but the underlying mechanism of these symptoms has not been investigated. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between neuropsychiatric symptoms and default-mode functional connectivity in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted on seventy patients with Alzheimer's disease during rest. We conducted a seed-based functional connectivity analysis to identify anterior and posterior default-mode networks (DMN). Seeds were the medial prefrontal cortex (Montreal Neurological Institute 12, 51, 36; seed radius=3 mm) for the anterior DMN and the precuneus (Montreal Neurological Institute -6, -63, 27; seed radius=3 mm) for the posterior DMN We then correlated the scores on neuropsychiatric inventory syndromes (apathy, hyperactivity, affective, and psychosis syndrome) with maps of connectivity in the default-mode network. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between decreased connectivity in the medial prefrontal cortex of the anterior defaultmode network and hyperactivity (agitation, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, euphoria, and disinhibition) syndrome (p<0.05, family wise error cluster-level corrected). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that hyperactivity syndrome is related to hypoconnected default-mode network in Alzheimer's disease. This finding suggests that specific network alterations are associated with certain neuropsychiatric syndromes.
