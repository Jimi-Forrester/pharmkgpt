37550065|a|A single 1-h session (or 7 d of daily 1-h sessions) of noninvasive visual stimulation with LED light flickering at 40 Hz, but not at 20 or 80 Hz, was reported to increase microglial size and decrease amyloid beta (Abeta) load in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. To achieve better therapeutic benefits, we explored the effects of daily 1-h sessions of visual stimulation with continuous light or LED light flickering at 24, 40, or 80 Hz for a period of five weeks in 5xFAD mice. As expected, 33-week-old 5xFAD mice but not control wild-type mice of the same age exhibited an abundance of swollen microglia and Abeta plaques in the visual cortex and hippocampus. Unexpectedly, however, compared with similar session of stimulation with continuous light or a light flickering at 24 or 80 Hz, daily sessions of stimulation with LED light flickering at 40 Hz for five weeks failed to further increase the microglial size and could not noticeably decrease the Abeta load in the visual cortex and hippocampus of the 5xFAD mice. In conclusion, contrary to previous findings based on shorter treatment periods, our data showed that daily noninvasive exposure to a light flickering at 40 Hz for a period of five weeks is not effective in reducing Abeta load in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
