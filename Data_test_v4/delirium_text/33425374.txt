33425374|t|Clinical outcomes in elective total hip arthroplasty in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review of the literature.
33425374|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) poses a significant challenge for the arthroplasty surgeon, owing to excessive muscle tone, higher fracture risk and poor bone quality. Several studies have reported high mortality, early failure and perioperative complications associated with hip fracture surgery in PD; however, no higher-level evidence exists regarding elective hip arthroplasty.The aim of our study was to perform a systematic review to evaluate the evidence basis and clinical outcomes pertaining to patients with underlying Parkinson's disease undergoing elective total hip arthroplasty (THA).We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify studies evaluating the safety and clinical outcomes of THA in patients suffering from Parkinson's. Our review conforms to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.Ten studies encompassing 49,730 patients were included in our systematic review. Qualitative synthesis demonstrated comparable results between PD patients and controls with respect to one-year mortality and surgical site infections. PD patients experienced more medical complications, had a longer hospital stay and worse long-term implant survival. Some studies also reported a higher rate of dislocation, periprosthetic fractures and aseptic loosening.Decisions about the optimal articulation, the utilization of cemented components, dual-mobility cups or constrained liners were not uniform among included studies.THA in patients with Parkinson's disease can offer significant functional gains and pain relief. Surgical considerations pertain to the approach and ways to address instability, whereas emphasis should be placed on appropriate counselling and exploring whether potential improvement of life quality outweighs the risks.
