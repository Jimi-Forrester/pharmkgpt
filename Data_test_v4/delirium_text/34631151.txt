34631151|t|Imaging findings of neurologic complications in lung transplantation: Review of a 9-year cohort.
34631151|a|BACKGROUND: Lung transplantation (LT) requires complex multidisciplinary organization and constitutes a therapeutic option and a life-saving procedure. Although the number of lung recipients continues to increase, neurological complications and death rates following lung transplantation are still higher than desirable. PURPOSE: This study aims to analyse the neuroimaging findings in a cohort of adult patients with LT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all lung transplant recipients (344 patients: 205 men and 139 women) at a single institution from January 2011 to January 2020. The collected data included demographic features, clinical data and evaluation of the imaging findings. We also recorded the date of neurological complication(s) and the underlying disease motivating lung transplantation. RESULTS: We found an elevated rate of neuroimaging findings in patients following LT with 32.6% of positive studies. In our cohort, the average time after LT to a neurological complication was 4.9 months post-transplant. Encephalopathy, critical illness polyneuropathy and stroke, in that order, were the most frequent neurological complications. Structural abnormalities in brain imaging were more often detected using MRI than CT for indications of encephalopathy and seizures. CONCLUSIONS: LT recipients constitute an especially vulnerable group that needs close surveillance, mainly during the early post-transplant period.
