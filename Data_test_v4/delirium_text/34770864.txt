34770864|t|Neuroprotective Potential of Chrysin: Mechanistic Insights and Therapeutic Potential for Neurological Disorders.
34770864|a|Chrysin, a herbal bioactive molecule, exerts a plethora of pharmacological effects, including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and anti-cancer. A growing body of evidence has highlighted the emerging role of chrysin in a variety of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, and brain tumors. Based on the results of recent pre-clinical studies and evidence from studies in humans, this review is focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of chrysin in different neurological diseases. In addition, the potential challenges, and opportunities of chrysin's inclusion in the neurotherapeutics repertoire are critically discussed.
