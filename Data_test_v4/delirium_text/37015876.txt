37015876|t|Ruminococcus gnavus: friend or foe for human health.
37015876|a|Ruminococcus gnavus was first identified in 1974 as a strict anaerobe in the gut of healthy individuals, and for several decades, its study has been limited to specific enzymes or bacteriocins. With the advent of metagenomics, R. gnavus has been associated both positively and negatively with an increasing number of intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases from inflammatory bowel diseases to neurological disorders. This prompted renewed interest in understanding the adaptation mechanisms of R. gnavus to the gut, and the molecular mediators affecting its association with health and disease. From ca. 250 publications citing R. gnavus since 1990, 94% were published in the last 10 years. In this review, we describe the biological characterisation of R. gnavus, its occurrence in the infant and adult gut microbiota and the factors influencing its colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract; we also discuss the current state of our knowledge on its role in host health and disease. We highlight gaps in knowledge and discuss the hypothesis that differential health outcomes associated with R. gnavus in the gut are strain and niche specific.
