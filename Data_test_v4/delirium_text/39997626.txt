39997626|t|Clinical and Public Health Challenge of Handling Synthetic Cathinone and Cannabinoid Abuse in Pediatric Care: A Narrative Review.
39997626|a|BACKGROUND: Synthetic cathinones and cannabinoids have emerged as significant public health concerns, particularly in pediatric populations. Marketed under deceptive names such as "bath salts" and "K2/Spice", these substances pose unique challenges due to their accessibility, potency, and unpredictable effects. This narrative review synthesizes evidence on the toxicological effects of synthetic cathinones and cannabinoids in pediatric patients, emphasizing clinical presentations, management challenges, and public health implications. METHODS: A structured narrative review was conducted using PubMed and Scopus databases to identify peer-reviewed studies published between January 2010 and September 2024. The selected articles focus on neuropsychiatric, systemic, and management outcomes associated with these substances in individuals aged 0-18 years. RESULTS: Five studies demonstrate that synthetic cathinones frequently cause seizures, sympathomimetic toxidrome (tachycardia, hypertension), and neuropsychiatric effects like paranoia and catatonia. Seven studies show synthetic cannabinoids induce psychosis, respiratory depression requiring ventilation in 12% of cases, and cardiovascular complications like myocardial ischemia. One study highlighted severe outcomes in pediatric accidental exposures, emphasizing the unpredictable and life-threatening effects of these substances, often exacerbated by co-ingestion with alcohol or THC. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric exposure to synthetic cathinones and cannabinoids results in severe and unpredictable toxicological effects, necessitating tailored clinical management strategies and enhanced diagnostic capabilities. Public health measures, including stringent regulatory controls, targeted education initiatives, and robust surveillance systems, are critical to mitigating these risks. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to safeguard vulnerable pediatric populations from the escalating dangers posed by synthetic drugs, and future research must address the long-term impacts and mechanisms of toxicity.
