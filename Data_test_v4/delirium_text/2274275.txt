2274275|t|Parenchymal preamyloid and amyloid deposits in the brains of patients with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis--Dutch type.
2274275|a|Hereditary cerebral hermorrhage with amyloidosis--Dutch type, one of the 'cerebral beta-amyloid diseases', like Alzheimer's disease, is characterized by extensive deposition of amyloid in small cerebral vessels. We investigated the presence of parenchymal beta-protein deposits in two Dutch patients with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis. Immunostaining with anti-SP28 revealed a full spectrum of these deposits, varying from preamyloid deposits to burned-out plaques. However, their density is less than in Alzheimer's disease, and immunostaining with Alz50 and anti-PHF did not show abnormal neurites in and around amyloid deposits in these two patients.
