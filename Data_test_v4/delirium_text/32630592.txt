32630592|a|Obesity induces serious diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It has been reported that obesity increases the risk of cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive dysfunction is a characteristic symptom of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, the detailed mechanisms of obesity-induced cognitive dysfunction have not yet been elucidated. The onset and progression of obesity-induced severe secondary diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular events, and hypertension are deeply connected to oxidative stress. We hypothesized that obesity induces cognitive dysfunction via acceleration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Vitamin E, which is a lipophilic vitamin, has strong antioxidative effects and consists of two groups: tocopherols and tocotrienols. Recently, it has been demonstrated that tocotrienols have strong neuroprotective and anti-obesity effects. In this study, we fed mice a high-fat diet (HFD) from 9 to 14 months of age and assessed the effect of tocotrienols treatment on body weight, brain oxidation levels, and cognitive function. The results revealed that treatment with tocotrienols inhibited body weight gain; further, tocotrienols reached the brain and attenuated oxidation in HFD-treated mice. These results indicate that tocotrienols have anti-obesity effects and inhibit obesity-induced brain oxidation.
