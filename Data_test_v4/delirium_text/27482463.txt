27482463|a|Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) detection in biological systems is of significant importance, which act as critical second messenger in fundamental biological processes. Here, we report on a chemoselective fluorescent naphthylimide peroxide probe (NPP) for the H2O2 detection in vitro and in vivo. NPP is a phenylboronic acid-caged chromophore that selectively responds to H2O2 through a self-immolate mechanism. NPP exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity to H2O2 with distinctive fluorescence change due to the excellent two-photon excitation property, which permits the facile detection of inflammation produced H2O2 and offers chance to monitor the inflammatory stages in diseased cells.
