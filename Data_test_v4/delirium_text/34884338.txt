34884338|t|Olfactory Dysfunction: A Complication of Diabetes or a Factor That Complicates Glucose Metabolism? A Narrative Review.
34884338|a|The present narrative review presents emerging data regarding the association between diabetes mellitus and olfactory dysfunction and discusses the role of olfactory dysfunction in glucose metabolism. We searched relevant published articles in PubMed and Google Scholar until October 2021. Main key words included "olfactory dysfunction", "diabetes mellitus", and "glucose metabolism". Olfactory dysfunction has been associated with diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, it has been proposed to be a diabetic complication, given that it has been linked with microvascular complications, such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Interestingly, it has been suggested that olfactory dysfunction is a manifestation of central neuropathy in diabetes, a hypothesis based on the observation that diabetes, olfactory dysfunction, and cognitive decline often coexist. However, evidence is limited and inconsistent. More importantly, olfactory and endocrine systems are closely linked, and olfactory dysfunction plays a significant role in glucose metabolism and obesity. Indeed, food behaviour and energy balance are influenced by olfaction status.
