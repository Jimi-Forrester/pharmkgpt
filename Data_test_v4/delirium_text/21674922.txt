21674922|t|[Psychopathology of acute paraphrenic syndrome, its typological forms and their relation to variants of paroxysm-like progredient schizophrenia].
21674922|a|A total of 60 patients with different forms of paroxysm-like progredient schizophrenia were examined to clarify psychopathology of acute paraphrenic syndrome in different variants of the disease. Three typological variants were distinguished: with picturesque delirium, manifestations of Knadinsky-Clerambault syndrome, and confabulation disorders. It was shown that paroxysm-like progredient schizophrenia akin to recurrent one is characterized by acute paraphrenic syndrome with picturesque delirium; paroxysm-like progredient schizophrenia akin to juvenile malignant one is characterized by acute paraphrenic syndrome dominated by Knadinsky-Clerambault syndrome and picturesque delirium; paroxysm-like progredient schizophrenia akin to paranoid one is characterized by acute paraphrenic syndrome dominated by Knadinsky-Clerambault syndrome or acute paraphrenic syndrome with confabulation disorders. The study confirms specificity of acute paraphrenic syndrome for paroxysm-like progredient schizophrenia
