19674078|a|BACKGROUND: Aspirin therapy is known to substantially reduce mortality and the rate of ischaemic complications after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Rates of perioperative aspirin resistance cited in the literature are up to 50% and could be influenced by extracorporeal circulation. Thus, aspirin resistance after CABG may have a significant clinical relevance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 59 patients undergoing CABG (on-pump, off-pump and combined procedures) aspirin resistance was investigated by arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregometry. Clinical relevance was assessed with 12-month follow up. RESULTS: Two types of resistance were observed: A preoperative resistance (despite oral aspirin or in vitro addition) was present in 29% and a postoperative developing type was seen in 49% resulting in only 22% of patients with a 'normal' reaction to aspirin. If patients were already on oral aspirin at admission, the rate of resistance was significantly reduced. Off-pump surgery or pump-times exceeding 120 min had no significant impact on resistance. During the 12-month follow up (98.3%), there were three deaths (one stroke, one intestinal ischaemia, one mediastinitis after postoperative delirium) in patients with the perioperative resistance and none in other patients (P = 0.345). In none of those patients who presented with perioperative aspirin resistance, could this aspirin resistance be demonstrated when tested again after 12 months? CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin resistance is a transient phenomenon present in the majority of patients undergoing CABG. The three deaths in the resistant group may - although not statistically significant - indicate the possibility of a worse outcome for patients with aspirin resistance.
