31351490|a|BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal meningitis is associated with high risk of neurological sequelae such as cognitive impairment and hearing loss. These sequelae are due to parenchymal brain and inner ear damage primarily induced by the excessive inflammatory reaction in response to bacterial brain invasion. Metformin-a biguanide drug to treat diabetes mellitus type 2-was recently found to suppress neuroinflammation and induce neuroregeneration. This study evaluated the effect of metformin adjunctive to antibiotics on neuroinflammation, brain and inner ear damage, and neurofunctional outcome in experimental pediatric pneumococcal meningitis. METHODS: Eleven-day-old Wistar rats were infected intracisternally with 5.22 +- 1.27 x 103 CFU Streptococcus pneumoniae and randomized for treatment with metformin (50 mg/kg, i.p., once daily for 3 weeks) plus ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg, i.p., bid, n = 61) or ceftriaxone monotherapy (n = 79). Cortical damage and hippocampal apoptosis were evaluated histomorphometrically 42 h post infection. Cerebrospinal fluid cytokine levels were analyzed during acute infection. Five weeks post infection, auditory brainstem responses were measured to determine hearing thresholds. Spiral ganglion neuron density and abundance of recently proliferated and integrated hippocampal granule neurons were assessed histologically. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory effect of metformin was studied in primary rat astroglial cells in vitro. RESULTS: Upon pneumococcal infection, metformin treatment significantly reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide production in cerebrospinal fluid and in astroglial cell cultures in vitro (p < 0.05). Compared to animals receiving ceftriaxone monotherapy, adjunctive metformin significantly reduced cortical necrosis (p < 0.02) during acute infection and improved median click-induced hearing thresholds (60 dB vs. 100 dB, p < 0.002) 5 weeks after infection. Adjuvant metformin significantly improved pure tone hearing thresholds at all assessed frequencies compared to ceftriaxone monotherapy (p < 0.05) and protected from PM-induced spiral ganglion neuron loss in the inner ear (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Adjuvant metformin reduces brain injury during pneumococcal meningitis by decreasing the excessive neuroinflammatory response. Furthermore, it protects spiral ganglion neurons in the inner ear and improves hearing impairments after experimental pneumococcal meningitis. These results identify adjuvant metformin as a promising therapeutic option to improve the outcome after pediatric pneumococcal meningitis.
