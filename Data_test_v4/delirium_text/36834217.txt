36834217|t|Tango-Therapy Intervention for Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment Living in Nursing Homes: Effects on Quality of Life, Physical Abilities and Gait.
36834217|a|Cognitive impairment in older adults is associated with poor gait performance, physical decline, falls and poor quality of life. This paper analyzes the feasibility and efficacy of tango-based intervention in older people living in nursing homes with and without cognitive impairment. A multicenter study, with pre- and post-test, was carried out. Intervention attendance, well-being, physical abilities (short physical performance battery), walking performance, functional capacities (Katz Index) and quality of life (quality of life in Alzheimer's disease) were assessed. Fifty-four participants (84.9 +- 6.7 years, mini mental state examination 14.5 +- 7.4) completed the protocol. Intervention attendance was 92%, and the mean subjective well-being after each session was 4.5 +- 0.5 (on a five-point scale). A statistically significant improvement was found in the quality of life (p = 0.030). Non-statistically significant changes were found in walking performance (p = 0.159), physical abilities (p = 0.876) and in functional capacities (p = 0.253). This study shows feasibility and suggests evidence for the effects of tango therapy on well-being and quality of life. Further studies are necessary to contrast these findings and to support the role of tango interventions as a holistic approach to prevent functional decline in older people with cognitive impairment.
