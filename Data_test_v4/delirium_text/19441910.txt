19441910|a|BACKGROUND: The application is in the field of neural stem cells (NSCs) and cellular therapy. OBJECTIVE: It aims at establishing conditions for the isolation and propagation of neural progenitor and stem cells from human fetal tissue, with high rate of growth and high yields of differentiation into the neuronal, astroglial and oligodendroglial pathways. METHODS: Neural progenitor and stem cells were isolated from fetal forebrain tissue and propagated as neurospheres, in defined medium in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Three protocols were designed to differentiate human fetal neural progenitor and stem cells into their progenies. RESULTS: The application claims the generation of human fetal neural progenitor and stem cells with a doubling rate between 5-10 days. It claims the differentiation of the neural progenitor and stem cells in vitro, into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes with high yields, e.g., 20 to 35% for neuronal cells. CONCLUSION: The establishment of human neural progenitor and stem cells with high rate of growth and high yields of differentiation provides a source of cells for therapy, particularly for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
