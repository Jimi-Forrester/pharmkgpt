25657733|a|The cholinergic system is involved in a broad spectrum of brain function, and its failure has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholine transduces signals through muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, both of which influence synaptic plasticity and cognition. However, the mechanisms that relate the rapid gating of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to persistent changes in brain function have remained elusive. Recent evidence indicates that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors activities affect synaptic morphology and density, which result in persistent rearrangements of neural connectivity. Further investigations of the relationships between nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and rearrangements of neural circuitry in the central nervous system may help understand the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
