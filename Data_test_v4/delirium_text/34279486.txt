34279486|t|Is TGF-beta1 a Biomarker of Huntington's Disease Progression?
34279486|a|Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease that can be divided into preclinical and symptomatic stages. Due to the diverse HD phenotype, there is an urgent need to identify markers that would independently assess its severity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of plasma levels of TGF-beta1 in the assessment of HD severity. One hundred HD patients and 40 healthy volunteers were included in the study. All HD patients underwent neurological and cognitive function assessment. TGF-beta1 levels were determined in the plasma of all patients. The correlations between TGF-beta1 levels and clinical profile and HD severity were also investigated. In symptomatic patients, cognitive decline was demonstrated, while in preclinical patients, no symptoms were found. Plasma levels of TGF-beta1 in HD patients did not differ significantly from the control group and did not change with the progression of the disease. In addition, TGF-beta1 levels also did not correlate with the severity of motor dysfunction. Positive correlations between plasma TGF-beta1 concentration and intensity of cognitive impairment were found, but only in the early disease stage. There was no clear benefit in assessing plasma TGF-beta1 levels in HD patients as a marker of disease severity.
