34418791|a|Here, we discuss findings made using Drosophila on Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and progression. Recent studies have investigated the mechanisms underlying glia-mediated neuroprotection in AD. First, we discuss a novel mechanism of glial lipid droplet formation that occurs in response to elevated reactive oxygen species in neurons. The data suggest that disruptions to this process contribute to AD risk. We further discuss novel mechanistic insights into glia-mediated Abeta42-clearance made using the fly. Finally, we highlight work that provides evidence that the aberrant accumulation of reactive oxygen species in AD may not just be a consequence of disease but contribute to disease progression as well. Cumulatively, the discussed studies highlight recent, relevant discoveries in AD made using Drosophila.
