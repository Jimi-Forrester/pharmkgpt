25069245|t|[Proposal of endogenous anticholinergic hypothesis in Alzheimer disease].
25069245|a|We previously speculated that anticholinergic activity (AA) endogenously appeared in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and accelerated AD pathology. In this article we introduce manuscripts supporting the endogenous appearance of AA in AD and the acceleration of AD pathology. We speculate that acethylcholine (ACh) not only is related to cognitive functions but also regulates the inflammatory system. Therefore in AD, in which the ACh system is down-regulated, the hyperactivity of the inflammatory system may be caused and among cyctokines, substances having anticholinergic properties may appear. We also refer to a case in which serum anticholinergic activity (SAA) disappeared with the prescription of memantine (an antidementia agent that has the property of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker) and speculate that because the hyperactivity of the inflammatory system occurs by way of the hyperactivity of NMDA receptor, memantine could abolish the AA.
