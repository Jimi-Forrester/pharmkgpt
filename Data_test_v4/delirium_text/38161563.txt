38161563|a|Purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS) is a peculiar phenomenon and corresponds to the appearance of purplish-colored urine. It is associated with urinary tract infections occurring mainly in debilitated elderly women with constipation and long-term indwelling urinary catheters. We share a case involving PUBS in an 87-year-old female patient, explore the pathophysiology, and discuss potential management options for this uncommon syndrome.
