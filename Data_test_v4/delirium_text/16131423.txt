16131423|t|Genetics of parkinsonism.
16131423|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. Some debate still exists as to whether PD is predominantly environmental or genetic in etiology. The genetic hypothesis of PD etiology has been driven recently by the identification of a number of PD loci. This review deals with each of these loci, discussing the latest data and evidence available. Of particular interest are the recently described mutations in the PINK1 (PARK6) and LRRK2 (PARK8) genes. We also consider the impact of these latest developments on our understanding of sporadic PD and on our everyday practice with PD patients.
