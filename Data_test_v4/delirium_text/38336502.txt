38336502|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and nutritional status, and explore their shared regulatory brain regions on the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. DESIGN: A longitudinal, observational cohort study. SETTING: Data were collected from the Chinese Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle study between June 1, 2021 and December 31, 2022. PARTICIPANTS: Overall, 432 patients on the AD continuum, including amnestic mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia, were assessed at baseline, and only 165 patients completed the (10.37 +- 6.08) months' follow-up. MEASUREMENTS: The Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) were used to evaluate nutritional status and NPS, respectively. The corrected cerebral blood flow (cCBF) measured by pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling of the dietary nutrition-related brain regions was analyzed. The association between the NPS at baseline and subsequent change in nutritional status and the association between the changes in the severity of NPS and nutritional status were examined using generalized linear mixed models. RESULTS: Increased cCBF in the left putamen was associated with malnutrition, general NPS, affective symptoms, and hyperactivity (P < 0.05). The presence of general NPS (beta = -1.317, P = 0.003), affective symptoms (beta = -1.887, P < 0.001), and appetite/eating disorders (beta = -1.714, P < 0.001) at baseline were associated with a decline in the MNA scores during follow-up. The higher scores of general NPI (beta = -0.048), affective symptoms (beta = -0.181), and appetite/eating disorders (beta = -0.416; all P < 0.001) were longitudinally associated with lower MNA scores after adjusting for confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: We found that baseline NPS were predictors of a decline in nutritional status on the AD continuum. The worse the severity of affective symptoms and appetite/eating disorders, the poorer the nutritional status. Furthermore, abnormal perfusion of the putamen may regulate the association between malnutrition and NPS, which suggests their potentially common neural regulatory basis.
