33680280|t|Enhanced Arthrospira platensis Biomass Production Combined with Anaerobic Cattle Wastewater Bioremediation.
33680280|a|Microalgae biomasses offer important benefits regarding macromolecules that serve as promising raw materials for sustainable production. In the present study, the microalgae Arthrospira platensis DHR 20 was cultivated in horizontal photobioreactors (HPBR), with and without temperature control, in batch mode (6 to 7 days), with anaerobically digested cattle wastewater (ACWW) as substrate. High dry biomass concentrations were observed (6.3-7.15 g L-1). Volumetric protein, carbohydrate, and lipid productivities were 0.299, 0.135, and 0.108 g L-1 day-1, respectively. Promising lipid productivities per area were estimated between 22.257 and 39.446 L ha-1 year-1. High CO2 bio-fixation rates were recorded (875.6-1051 mg L-1 day-1), indicating the relevant potential of the studied microalgae to mitigate atmospheric pollution. Carbon concentrations in biomass ranged between 41.8 and 43.6%. ACWW bioremediation was satisfactory, with BOD5 and COD removal efficiencies of 72.2-82.6% and 63.3-73.6%. Maximum values of 100, 95.5, 92.4, 80, 98, and 94% were achieved concerning the removal of NH4 +, NO3 -, Pt, SO4 2-, Zn, and Cu, respectively. Total and thermotolerant coliform removals reached 99-99.7% and 99.7-99.9%. This microalgae-mediated process is, thus, promising for ACWW bioremediation and valuation, producing a microalgae biomass rich in macromolecules that can be used to obtain friendly bio-based products and bioenergy.
