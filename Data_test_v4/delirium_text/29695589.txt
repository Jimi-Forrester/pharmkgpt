29695589|t|ABBY: A phase 2 randomized trial of crenezumab in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.
29695589|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of crenezumab in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: In this phase 2 trial, 431 patients with mild to moderate AD 50 to 80 years of age were randomized 2:1 (crenezumab:placebo). Patients received low-dose subcutaneous crenezumab 300 mg or placebo every 2 weeks (n = 184) or high-dose intravenous crenezumab 15 mg/kg or placebo every 4 weeks (n = 247) for 68 weeks. Primary outcome measures were change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog12) and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes scores from baseline to week 73. RESULTS: The primary and secondary endpoints were not met. In an exploratory post hoc analysis, a reduction in decline on the ADAS-Cog12 was observed in the high-dose group. Separation from the placebo group on the ADAS-Cog12 was greatest in the milder subsets of AD patients and reached statistical significance in the group with Mini-Mental State Examination scores of 22 to 26. In both groups, there was a significant increase in CSF beta-amyloid1-42 levels that correlated with crenezumab CSF levels. The overall rate of adverse events was balanced between groups. One case of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities indicative of vasogenic edema or effusions was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although prespecified criteria for testing treatment effects were not met, these data suggest a potential treatment effect in patients with mild AD treated with high-dose crenezumab. Together with the safety profile for crenezumab, these data support the exploration of crenezumab treatment at even higher doses in patients with early AD. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT 01343966. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that, for people with AD, crenezumab does not significantly improve cognition or function at 18 months. The study is rated Class II because <80% of enrolled patients completed the study.
