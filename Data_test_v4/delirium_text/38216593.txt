38216593|a|Modeling human neuronal properties in physiological and pathological conditions is essential to identify novel potential drugs and to explore pathological mechanisms of neurological diseases. For this purpose, we generated a three-dimensional (3D) neuronal culture, by employing the readily available human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line, and a new differentiation protocol. The entire differentiation process occurred in a matrix and lasted 47 days, with 7 days of pre-differentiation phase and 40 days of differentiation, and allowed the development of a 3D culture in conditions consistent with the physiological environment. Neurons in the culture were electrically active, were able to establish functional networks, and showed features of cholinergic neurons. Hence here we provide an easily accessible, reproducible, and suitable culture method that might empower studies on synaptic function, vesicle trafficking, and metabolism, which sustain neuronal activity and cerebral circuits. Moreover, this novel differentiation protocol could represent a promising cellular tool to study physiological cellular processes, such as migration, differentiation, maturation, and to develop novel therapeutic approaches.
