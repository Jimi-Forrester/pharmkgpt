35939357|t|Progress in the Study of Optical Probes for the Detection of Formaldehyde.
35939357|a|Formaldehyde, one of the simplest reactive carbonyl substances, is involved in many physiological and pathological processes in living organisms. There is a large amount of data showing that abnormal elevation of formaldehyde is associated with a variety of diseases in the body, such as neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular diseases and cancer, and is also a representative carcinogen, so monitoring formaldehyde is of great importance for disease diagnosis and treatment. In this review, In this paper, we summarize and classify the last ten years of probes for the detection of formaldehyde according to different reaction mechanisms and discuss the structures and applications of the probes. Finally, we briefly describe the challenges and possible solutions in this field. We believe that more new probes provide powerful tools to study the function of formaldehyde in living systems.
