17646627|t|In dementia with Lewy bodies, Braak stage determines phenotype, not Lewy body distribution.
17646627|a|We used an autopsy series to determine whether the newest dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) consensus pathologic classification correlates with premortem diagnosis of DLB. Neocortical sections from a total of 95 cases with Lewy bodies were stained with alpha-synuclein antibodies. We assigned cases according to the DLB consensus' categories and found a significant association with the premortem clinical diagnosis of DLB. Clinical diagnosis of DLB, however, depended on the presence of low Alzheimer disease pathology (by Braak staging) rather than on Lewy body distribution.
