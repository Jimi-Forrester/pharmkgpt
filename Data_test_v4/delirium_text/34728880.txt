34728880|a|There is a link between oral health and systemic health. Conditions such as dementia and pneumonia are associated with poor oral health. Frail older people receive regular care from medical and nursing staff but tend not to see dentists regularly or only seek treatment when there is a dental problem. Collaboration between dentists and other health professionals is therefore increasingly important. Oral health should be assessed regularly. This enables early referral to a dentist. Anticholinergic drugs, particularly in polypharmacy, can have a profound deleterious effect on salivary function and oral health. A medication review may enable the anticholinergic burden to be reduced. In addition to regular brushing, oral preventive products may be appropriate in frail older people.
