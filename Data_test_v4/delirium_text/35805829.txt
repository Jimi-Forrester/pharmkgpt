35805829|t|Global Research on Cognitive Frailty: A Bibliometric and Visual Analysis of Papers Published during 2013-2021.
35805829|a|This study analyzed the current status, hotspots, and emerging trends of global research on cognitive frailty, in order to provide new research ideas for researchers. Articles and reviews related to cognitive frailty, published from 2013 to 2021, were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database on 26 November 2021. CiteSpace 5.8.R3 was employed for data analyses. A total of 2077 publications were included. There has been a rapid growth of publications on cognitive frailty research since 2016. The United States, Italy, England, and Australia have been the leading research centers of cognitive frailty; however, China has also recently focused on this topic. The National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, and Shimada H. were found to be the most prolific institution and author, respectively. Co-citation analysis identified 16 clusters, of which the largest was cognitive frailty. The keywords which occurred most frequently were "older adult", followed by "cognitive impairment", "frailty", "risk", "dementia", "prevalence", "mortality", "health", and "Alzheimer's disease". Burst keyword detection revealed a rising interest in cognitive frailty models. By analyzing these publications from recent years, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of cognitive frailty research.
