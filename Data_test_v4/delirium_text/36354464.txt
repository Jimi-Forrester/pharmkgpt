36354464|t|Biosensors for the Detection of Enzymes Based on Aggregation-Induced Emission.
36354464|a|Enzymes play a critical role in most complex biochemical processes. Some of them can be regarded as biomarkers for disease diagnosis. Taking advantage of aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-based biosensors, a series of fluorogens with AIE characteristics (AIEgens) have been designed and synthesized for the detection and imaging of enzymes. In this work, we summarized the advances in AIEgens-based probes and sensing platforms for the fluorescent detection of enzymes, including proteases, phosphatases, glycosidases, cholinesterases, telomerase and others. The AIEgens involve organic dyes and metal nanoclusters. This work provides valuable references for the design of novel AIE-based sensing platforms.
