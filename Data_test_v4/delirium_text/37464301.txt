37464301|t|Different words for stroke: the same concept? an analysis of associated symptoms and intended reaction in Brazil.
37464301|a|BACKGROUND: Different names for stroke might mislead physicians and emergency medical service workers. This study aimed to assess the different words for stroke in Brazil and both intended response and related symptoms associated with those names. METHODS: Cross-sectional study enrolling healthy individuals from urban areas in Northeast of Brazil for an open-ended survey. We presented a typical clinical case of a stroke (an elderly who had sudden onset of hemiparalysis and slurred speech) and asked "what is happening?", "what would you do?" and "which other symptoms could happen in this condition?". RESUTS: From 1,475 interviewed individuals, 1,220 (82,7%) recognized the scenario as a stroke. There were 3 words to correctly identify (based on correct intended response and spontaneously evoked associated symptoms) the stroke, which were "AVC" (acronym for cerebrovascular accident, in Portuguese), "derrame" (spillage) and "trombose" (thrombosis). There were significant differences among them concerning demographic, economic, educational and geographical aspects, but there was no difference according to the intended reaction among them. The most cited associated symptoms (excluding those present in the case) were impaired consciousness (10.6%), headache (8.9%) and dysesthesia (7.7%). "Aneurisma" (aneurism) was also cited, by 3 individuals. CONCLUSION: There are at least three words for stroke in Portuguese ("AVC", "derrame" and "trombose"); they were similar in terms of correct intended responses and spontaneously cited accompanying symptoms. Stroke campaigns should apply different names to reach a broader audience and to improve stroke recognition.
