This research sought to establish and validate a risk assessment method for NIHL using these risk factors. This cross-sectional research was carried out with 220 workers from a steel manufacturing facility. At first, their demographic characteristics and information related to the studies' items were gathered by the researcher-made questionnaire. In the next step, the noise exposure values of the participants were measured by the sound pressure level meter based on the ISO 9612 standard. Moreover, a pure tone audiometric test of bone and air conduction was used to measure hearing loss in people. Ultimately, a new index for risk assessment was created. Indirect effect coefficients of individual factors such as work experience, age, smoking, and effective diseases were 0.266, 0.227, 0.056, and 0.064, respectively. The coefficients of noise exposure items including occupational noise and leisure noise were obtained as 0.687 and 0.660. The personal protective equipment (PPE) items including use of PPE, noise reduction rating of PPE, and awareness of PPE were 0.194, 0.147, and 0.127, respectively. These coefficients were utilized to create a new index. The overall score of the index was divided into four categories using optimal cut-off values of 4.85, 6.84, and 7.59. According to the findings, the OHLRA methods were able to account for 74 percent of the hearing loss values. The results showed that the novel index for risk assessment had proper validity in the prediction of NIHL.
