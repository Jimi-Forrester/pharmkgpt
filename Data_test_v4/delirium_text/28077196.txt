28077196|a|OBJECTIVE: The management of and prognosis for delirium are affected by its subtype: hypoactive, hyperactive, mixed, and none. The DMSS-4, an abbreviated version of the Delirium Motor Symptom Scale, is a brief instrument for the assessment of delirium subtypes. However, it has not yet been evaluated in an intensive care setting. METHOD: We performed a prospective/descriptive cohort study in order to determine the internal consistency, reliability, and validity of the relevant items of the DMSS-4 versus the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R-98) and the original DMSS in a surgical intensive care setting. RESULTS: A total of 289 elderly, predominantly male patients were screened for delirium, and 122 were included in our sample. The internal consistency of the DMSS-4 items was excellent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92), and between the DMSS-4 and DRS-R-98 the overall concurrent validity was substantial (Cramer's V = 0.67). Within individual motor subtypes, concurrent validity remained at least substantial (Cohen's kappa = 0.65-0.81) and sensitivity high (69.8 to 82.2%), in contrast to those of the no-motor subtype, with less validity and sensitivity (kappa = 0.28, 22%). Similarly, total concurrent validity between the DMSS-4 and the original DMSS reached perfection (Cramer's V = 0.83), as did agreement between the subtypes (kappa = 0.83-0.92), while sensitivity remained high (88.2-100%). Only in those with delirium with no-motor subtype was agreement moderate (kappa = 0.56) and sensitivity lower (67%). Specificity was high across all subtypes (91.2-99.1%). The DMSS-4 yielded very sensitive ratings, particularly for hypoactive and hyperactive motor symptoms, and interrater agreement was excellent (Fleiss's kappa = 0.83). SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: We found the DMSS-4 to be a most reliable and valid brief assessment of delirium in characterizing the subtypes of delirium in an intensive care setting, with increased sensitivity to hypoactive and hyperactive motor alterations.
