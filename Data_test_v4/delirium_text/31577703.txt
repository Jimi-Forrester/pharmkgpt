31577703|a|To investigate the functional connectome alterations in cerebral small-vessel disease (CSVD) patients with thalamus lacunes and its relation to cognitive impairment.This case-control study was approved by the local research ethics committee, and all participants provided informed consent. There were 14 CSVD patients with thalamus lacunes (CSVDw.), 27 without (CSVDwo.), and 34 healthy controls (HC) recruited matched for age, sex, and education to undergo a 3T resting-state functional MR examination. The whole-brain functional connectome was constructed by thresholding the Pearson correlation matrices of 90 brain regions, and the topologic properties were analyzed by using graph theory approaches. Networks were compared between CSVD patients and HC, and associations between network measures and cognitive function were tested.Compared with HC, the functional connectome in CSVDw. patients showed abnormalities at the global level and at the nodal level (P < .05, false discovery rate corrected). The network-based statistics method identified a significantly altered network consisting 6 nodes and 13 connections. Among all the 13 connections, only two connections had significant correlation with episodic memory (EM) and processing speed (PS) respectively (P < .05). The CSVDwo. patients showed no significant network alterations relative to controls (P > .05).The configurations of brain functional connectome in CSVDw. patients were perturbed but not obvious for those without, and correlated with the mild cognitive impairment, especially for EM and PS. This study suggested that lacunes on thalamus played a vital role in mediating the neural functional changes of CSVD patients.
