38802386|a|Magnetite nanoparticles are small, strongly magnetic iron oxide particles which are produced during high-temperature combustion and friction processes and form part of the outdoor air pollution mixture. These particles can translocate to the brain and have been found in human brain tissue. In this study, we estimated associations between within-city spatial variations in concentrations of magnetite nanoparticles in outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and brain cancer incidence. We performed a cohort study of 1.29 million participants in four cycles of the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort in Montreal and Toronto, Canada who were followed for malignant brain tumour (glioma) incidence. As a proxy for magnetite nanoparticle content, we measured the susceptibility of anhysteretic remanent magnetization (chiARM) in PM2.5 samples (N = 124 in Montreal, N = 110 in Toronto), and values were assigned to residential locations. Stratified Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (per IQR change in volume-normalized chiARM). ARM was not associated with brain tumour incidence (HR = 0.998, 95% CI 0.988, 1.009) after adjusting for relevant potential confounders. Although we found no evidence of an important relationship between within-city spatial variations in airborne magnetite nanoparticles and brain tumour incidence, further research is needed to evaluate this understudied exposure, and other measures of exposure to magnetite nanoparticles should be considered.
