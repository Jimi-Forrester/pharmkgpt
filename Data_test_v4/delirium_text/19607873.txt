19607873|a|The appearance of cholinergic trait often precedes synaptogenesis, indicating the involvement of cholinesterase proteins in nervous system development, particularly so acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In addition to AChE's acclaimed esterase activity, its lesser known non-cholinergic functions have gained much attention, because of AChE protein expression in areas other than cholinergic innervations; one such function could be exerted by its associated aryl acylamidase (AAA) activity. In this study, an attempt has been made in profiling esterase and AAA activities of AChE at different developmental stages of the chick embryo, e.g. at embryonic day 6 (E6), E9, E12, E15 and E18. AAA activity showed a correlated expression with esterase activity at all stages, but the relative ratios of AAA to esterase activity were higher at younger stages. The inhibition of AAA activity was shown to be more sensitive towards Huperzine, Donepezil whereas inhibition of esterase activity was sensitive to Tacrine and DFP. Remarkably, the major Alzheimer drugs- Huperzine and Donepezil, much more strongly inhibited AAA activity of AChE at younger developmental stages whose IC50 values are 0.01 muM and 0.1 muM respectively. In the case of BW284c51, inhibition was more pronounced at older stages and IC50 value was 0.1 muM. Since in Alzheimer's disease (AD), embryonic forms of AChE have been reported to reappear, a possible role of AAA activity in the pathogenesis of AD should be considered.
