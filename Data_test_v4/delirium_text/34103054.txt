34103054|t|Potential roles of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in immune cells.
34103054|a|N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) is one of the most common internal modifications on RNA molecules present in mammalian cells. Deregulation of m6A modification has been recently implicated in many types of human diseases. Therefore, m6A modification has become a research hotspot for its potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of various diseases. The immune system mostly involves different types of immune cells to provide the first line of defense against infections. The immunoregulatory network that orchestrate the immune responses to new pathogens plays a pivotal role in the development of the disease. And m6A modification has been demonstrated to be a major post-transcriptional regulator of immune responses in cells. In this review, we summarize the participants involved in m6A regulation and try to reveal how m6A modification affects the immune responses via changing the immunoregulatory networks.
