37644433|a|To gain deeper insights into the microenvironment of breast cancer, we utilized GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) technology to analyze transcripts from 107 regions of interest in 65 untreated breast cancer tissue samples. Our study revealed spatial heterogeneity in the expression of marker genes in tumor cell enriched, immune cell enriched, and normal epithelial areas. We evaluated a total of 55 prognostic markers in tumor cell enriched regions and 15 in immune cell enriched regions, identifying that tumor cell enriched regions had higher levels of follicular helper T cells, resting dendritic cells, and plasma cells than immune cell enriched regions, while the levels of resting CD4 memory in T cells and regulatory (Treg) T cells were lower. Additionally, we analyzed the heterogeneity of HLA gene families, immunological checkpoints, and metabolic genes in these areas. Through univariate Cox analysis, we identified 5 prognosis-related metabolic genes. Furthermore, we conducted immunostaining experiments, including EMILIN2, SURF4, and LYPLA1, to verify our findings. Our investigation into the spatial heterogeneity of the breast cancer tumor environment has led to the discovery of specific diagnostic and prognostic markers in breast cancer.
