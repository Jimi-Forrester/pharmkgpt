38788090|t|If Art Were a Drug: Implications for Parkinson's Disease.
38788090|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and complex neurodegenerative disorder. Conventional pharmacological or surgical therapies alone are often insufficient at adequately alleviating disability. Moreover, there is an increasing shift toward person-centered care, emphasizing the concept of "living well". In this context, arts-based interventions offer great promise, functioning as platforms for creative expression that could provide novel mechanisms to promote quality of life. Here we present a qualitative review of arts-based interventions for PD, including music, dance, drama, visual arts, and creative writing. For each, we discuss their applications to PD, proposed mechanisms, evidence from prior studies, and upcoming research. We also provide examples of community-based projects. Studies to date have had relatively small sample sizes, but their findings suggest that arts-based interventions have the potential to reduce motor and non-motor symptoms. They may also empower people with PD and thereby address issues of self-esteem, foster personal problem-solving, and augment holistic well-being. However, there is a paucity of research determining optimal dosage and symptom-specific benefits of these therapies. If art were a drug, we would have to perform appropriately powered studies to provide these data before incorporating it into routine patient care. We therefore call for further research with properly designed studies to offer more rigorous and evidence-based support for what we intuitively think is a highly promising approach to support individuals living with PD. Given the possible positive impact on people's lives, arts-based approaches merit further development and, if proven to be effective, systematic inclusion within integrated management plans.
