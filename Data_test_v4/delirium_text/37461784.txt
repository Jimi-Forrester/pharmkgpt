37461784|t|Persistent Postoperative Delirium Following Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy.
37461784|a|Gallstones are the primary cause of symptomatic gallbladder disease and lead to a significant portion of hospitalizations related to gastrointestinal diseases. The gold standard treatment for gallbladder disease continues to be cholecystectomy, which is commonly done laparoscopically, and improves patients' quality of life. With any surgical intervention there are inherent risks, and in the setting of severe illness, the risk of potential complications increases immensely. Postoperative altered mental status, namely, delirium, may occur in the elderly and a high index of suspicion is required to recognize the clinical signs for swift diagnosis and management. This case involves a 61-year-old male who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and developed persistent delirium during the hospital course. This report aims to explore the multiple risk factors that lead to postoperative delirium and review the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies utilized in managing this patient.
