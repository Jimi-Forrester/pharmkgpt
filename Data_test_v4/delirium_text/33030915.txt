33030915|a|Objective: We aimed to test the hypothesis that elevated neocortical beta-amyloid (Abeta), a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), predicts sex-specific cognitive trajectories in clinically normal older adults, with women showing greater risk of decline than men. Method: Florbetapir Abeta positron emission tomography (PET) was acquired in 149 clinically normal older adults (52% female, Mage = 74). Participants underwent cognitive testing at baseline and during annual follow-up visits over a timespan of up to 5.14 years. Mixed-effects regression models evaluated whether relations between baseline neocortical Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) and composite scores of episodic memory, executive functioning, and processing speed were moderated by sex (male/female) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) status (epsilon4 carrier/noncarrier). Results: Higher baseline SUVR was associated with longitudinal decline in episodic memory in women (b = -1.32, p < .001) but not men (b = -0.30, p = .28). Female APOE epsilon4 carriers with elevated SUVR showed particularly precipitous declines in episodic memory (b = -4.33, p < .001) whereas other cognitive domains were spared. SUVR did not predict changes in executive functioning or processing speed, regardless of sex (ps >.63), though there was a main effect of SUVR on processing speed (b = 2.50, p = .003). Conclusions: Clinically normal women with elevated Abeta are more vulnerable to episodic memory decline than men. Understanding sex-related differences in AD, particularly in preclinical stages, is crucial for guiding precision medicine approaches to early detection and intervention.
