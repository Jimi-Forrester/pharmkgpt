35242334|a|BACKGROUND: Liver disease is a multisystem condition that is classified as acute or chronic depending on the length of time. Cirrhosis patients are expected to undergo surgery in the last two years of their lives, according to estimates. In patients with elevated liver enzyme levels, anesthesia and surgery may deteriorate liver function. Preoperative identification, optimization and anesthetic management are essential for optimum outcomes in patients with liver disease undergoing surgery. METHODS: The literatures are searched using medical search engines like Google scholar, PubMed, Cochrane library and HINARI to get access for current and update evidence on perioperative optimization of patients with liver disease. The key words for literature search were (liver disease OR liver failure) AND (liver disease OR perioperative management) AND (non-hepatic surgery OR anesthesia). After searching using these search engines then collected by filtering based on the level of significance to this guideline with proper appraisal and evaluation of study quality with different level of evidences. CONCLUSIONS: and recommendations: Patients with liver disease presenting with non-hepatic surgery might have postoperative complications that can lead to death. Efforts should be expended to favorably alter a patient's preoperative Child's class before undertaking an elective operation.
