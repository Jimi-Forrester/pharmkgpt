38754721|t|Exploring Therapeutic Potential of Phytoconstituents as a Gut Microbiota Modulator in the Management of Neurological and Psychological Disorders.
38754721|a|The functioning of the brain and its impact on behavior, emotions, and cognition can be affected by both neurological and psychiatric disorders that impose a significant burden on global health. Phytochemicals are helpful in the treatment of several neurological and psychological disorders, including anxiety, depression, Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), because they have symptomatic benefits with few adverse reactions. Changes in gut microbiota have been associated with many neurological and psychiatric conditions. This review focuses on the potential efficacy of phytochemicals such as flavonoids, terpenoids, and polyphenols in regulating gut flora and providing symptomatic relief for a range of neurological and psychological conditions. Evidence-based research has shown the medicinal potentials of these phytochemicals, but additional study is required to determine whether altering gut microbiota might slow the advancement of neurological and psychological problems.
