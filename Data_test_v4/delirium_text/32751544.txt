32751544|t|Parkinson's Disease, Periodontitis and Patient-Related Outcomes: A Cross-Sectional Study.
32751544|a|Background and objectives: People with Parkinson's disease (PD) may be at risk of having bad periodontal status. A consistent periodontal examination is critical to investigate how it impacts on PD quality of life. We aimed to assess the periodontal status of people with PD, and its association with quality of life and self-perceived xerostomia. Materials and Methods: To this end, from February to March 2020, we consecutively enrolled 28 PD individuals, and motor and non-motor symptoms of PD were assessed using the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). We performed full-mouth periodontal examination and gathered information on self-perceived quality of life in PD, oral health impact profile (OHIP-14) and xerostomia. Results: The prevalence of periodontitis was 75.0% and most cases were identified as severe (46.4%). Upper extremity rigidity, hand posture and kinetic tremors were significantly correlated with worse periodontal status. PDQ-8 showed to be correlated with self-perceived oral health-related quality of life and xerostomia levels. Conclusions: This group of people with PD had a high prevalence of periodontitis. Deteriorated levels of the upper extremities in advanced stages of PD were associated with worse periodontal status and hygiene habits. Quality of life in PD appears to be associated with self-perceived OHRQoL and xerostomia.
