36815213|t|Age-Associated Upregulation of Glutamate Transporters and Glutamine Synthetase in Senescent Astrocytes In Vitro and in the Mouse and Human Hippocampus.
36815213|a|Aging is marked by complex and progressive physiological changes, including in the glutamatergic system, that lead to a decline of brain function. Increased content of senescent cells in the brain, such as glial cells, has been reported to impact cognition both in animal models and human tissue during normal aging and in the context of neurodegenerative disease. Changes in the glutamatergic synaptic activity rely on the glutamate-glutamine cycle, in which astrocytes handle glutamate taken up from synapses and provide glutamine for neurons, thus maintaining excitatory neurotransmission. However, the mechanisms of glutamate homeostasis in brain aging are still poorly understood. Herein, we showed that mouse senescent astrocytes in vitro undergo upregulation of GLT-1, GLAST, and glutamine synthetase (GS), along with the increased enzymatic activity of GS and [3H]-D-aspartate uptake. Furthermore, we observed higher levels of GS and increased [3H]-D-aspartate uptake in the hippocampus of aged mice, although the activity of GS was similar between young and old mice. Analysis of a previously available RNAseq dataset of mice at different ages revealed upregulation of GLAST and GS mRNA levels in hippocampal astrocytes during aging. Corroborating these rodent data, we showed an increased number of GS + cells, and GS and GLT-1 levels/intensity in the hippocampus of elderly humans. Our data suggest that aged astrocytes undergo molecular and functional changes that control glutamate-glutamine homeostasis upon brain aging.
