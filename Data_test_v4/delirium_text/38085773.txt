38085773|t|Nasal delivery of polymeric nanoDisc mobilizes a synergy of central and peripheral amyloid-beta clearance to treat Alzheimer's disease.
38085773|a|The disequilibrium of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) between the central and peripheral pools has been claimed as an initiating event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we employ discoidal high-density lipoproteins (HDL-Disc) mimicking Abeta antibody for directional flux of Abeta from central to peripheral catabolism, with desirable safety and translation potential. Structurally, HDL-Disc assembly (polyDisc) is prepared with aid of chitosan derivative polymerization. After intranasal administration and response to slightly acidic nasal microenvironment, polyDisc depolymerizes into carrier-free HDL-Disc with chitosan derivatives that adhere to the mucosal layer to reversibly open tight junctions, helping HDL-Disc penetrate the olfactory pathway into brain. Thereafter, HDL-Disc captures Abeta into microglia for central clearance or ferries Abeta out of the brain for liver-mediated compensatory catabolism. For synergy therapy, intranasal administration of polyDisc can effectively reduce intracerebral Abeta burden by 97.3% and vascular Abeta burden by 73.5%, ameliorate neurologic damage, and rescue memory deficits in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic AD mice with improved safety, especially vascular safety. Collectively, this design provides a proof of concept for developing Abeta antibody mimics to mobilize a synergy of central and peripheral Abeta clearance for AD treatment.
