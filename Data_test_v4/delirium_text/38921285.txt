38921285|t|Do Atopic Dermatitis and Psoriasis Have an Impact on Cognitive Decline-Latest Research Review.
38921285|a|BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are chronic skin diseases that affect the mental health of patients. The relationship between AD and psoriasis and cognitive processes in patients remains unclear. The aim of the review was to answer the question of whether AD and psoriasis have an impact on cognitive decline in patients. METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed and EBSCO to identify case-control, cross-sectional, or cohort studies that evaluated the association between atopic dermatitis and psoriasis and cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Most of the studies included in the review confirmed cognitive decline in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that atopic dermatitis and psoriasis may negatively affect cognitive processes such as working memory, concentration, attention, and speed of motor reactions. Psychological interventions targeting distorted cognitive processing could improve the quality of life of patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.
