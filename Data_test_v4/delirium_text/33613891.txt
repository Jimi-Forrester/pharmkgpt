According to the role of exercise and medicinal plants on body health, the purpose of this study was to survey the effect of combined aerobic training and the use of Ripe Pistachio Hulls (RPH) hydro-alcoholic extract on learning and memory in streptozotocin-induced diabetic male rats. METHODS: In this experimental study, 42 male Wistar rats weighing 250-280 g were used in 6 groups with an equal number of 7 rats in each one. Streptozotocin (STZ) (50 mg / kg)was used to induce diabetes, and the test protocol was applied for 8 weeks. Passive avoidance memory was assessed using a step-through passive avoidance apparatus (shuttle box). SPSS software was used to analyze the data and P<0.05 was significant. RESULTS: The results showed that step-through latency in the acquisition trial (STLa) was not significantly different among groups. Step-through latency in retrieval (STLr 24) test significantly reduced and time spent in The Dark Compartment (TDC) decreased in treated groups compared with the diabetic control groups (P<0.001). Also, there was no significant difference between the STZ and saline diabetic groups. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study revealed that the RPH hydro-alcoholic extract and aerobic exercise could improve passive avoidance memory in streptozotocin diabetic rats. Meanwhile, they might be an adjuvant therapy combined with other traditional medicine.
