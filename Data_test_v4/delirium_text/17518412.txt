17518412|t|Assessing pre-death grief in cancer caregivers using the Marwit-Meuser Caregiver Grief Inventory (MM-CGI).
17518412|a|The Marwit-Meuser Caregiver Grief Inventory (MM-CGI) was developed and initially validated with caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease, and subsequently evaluated with caregivers of persons with brain injury. The present study examined MM-CGI psychometric and validity properties in 75 caregivers of persons with cancer. As with previous studies, high internal consistency reliability of MM-CGI Total Grief and subscale scores (Personal Sacrifice and Burden, Heartfelt Sadness and Longing, and Worry and Felt Isolation) was demonstrated. Construct validity of the subscale scores was supported by differential associations with other caregiver measures of depression, strain, well-being, and family support. Based on these preliminary results, the MM-CGI appears useful for assessing pre-death grief in caregivers of persons with cancer.
