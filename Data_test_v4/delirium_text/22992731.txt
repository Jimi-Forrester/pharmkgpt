22992731|t|A novel inhibitor of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide aggregation: from high throughput screening to efficacy in an animal model of Alzheimer disease.
22992731|a|Compelling evidence indicates that aggregation of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide is a major underlying molecular culprit in Alzheimer disease. Specifically, soluble oligomers of the 42-residue peptide (Abeta42) lead to a series of events that cause cellular dysfunction and neuronal death. Therefore, inhibiting Abeta42 aggregation may be an effective strategy for the prevention and/or treatment of disease. We describe the implementation of a high throughput screen for inhibitors of Abeta42 aggregation on a collection of 65,000 small molecules. Among several novel inhibitors isolated by the screen, compound D737 was most effective in inhibiting Abeta42 aggregation and reducing Abeta42-induced toxicity in cell culture. The protective activity of D737 was most significant in reducing the toxicity of high molecular weight oligomers of Abeta42. The ability of D737 to prevent Abeta42 aggregation protects against cellular dysfunction and reduces the production/accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Most importantly, treatment with D737 increases the life span and locomotive ability of flies in a Drosophila melanogaster model of Alzheimer disease.
