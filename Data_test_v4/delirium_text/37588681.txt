37588681|a|Purpose: This study aims to identify unmet needs and barriers for improving inpatient care for older adults at an academic hospital in Korea by using a qualitative focus group design and the Age-Friendly Health Systems (AFHS) framework. Patients and Methods: A total of 14 healthcare providers and employees participated in focus group interviews. Participants included medical doctors, registered nurses, a receptionist, a patient transporter, a pharmacist, a physical therapist, and a social worker. The data were analyzed qualitatively, as per the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines. The analysis method encompassed a thematic framework analysis via the AFHS 4Ms framework, consisting of the four domains "What Matters", "Medication", "Mentation", and "Mobility". Results: Multiple barriers and unmet needs were identified using the AFHS 4Ms framework in the provision of inpatient care for older adults at the hospital. The main barriers identified in the "What matters" domain are a lack of shared decision-making and individualized care plans, as well as economic and safety-conscious preferences among some older patients. In the "Medications" domain, the main barriers to providing adequate and safe pharmacotherapy include patient and caregiver-related factors, increased complexity of medication use, and lack of institutional support systems. In the "Mentation" domain, the main issues identified are communication barriers related to patients, caregiver factors, and insufficient delirium management due to a lack of adequate processes/environments such as delirium identification. In the "Mobility" domain, the main challenges include reduced mobility and geriatric complications, unnecessary mobility restrictions, and the increased risk of falls due to lack of resources and environmental factors. Conclusion: The study highlighted the need for improvements in inpatient care for older adults at an academic hospital in Korea. Identified unmet needs and barriers can be used to guide a more patient-centered approaches for an age-friendly inpatient environment.
