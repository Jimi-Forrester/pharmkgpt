35068468|t|Subcortical and Cerebellar Neural Correlates of Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease with Prolonged Sleep Latency.
35068468|a|BACKGROUND: Despite the important associations among sleep, Alzheimer's disease (AD), subcortical structures, and the cerebellum, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with regard to these regions and sleep on patients in AD trajectory are scarce. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the influence of prolonged sleep latency on the structural and functional alterations in the subcortical and cerebellar neural correlates in amyloid-beta positive amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients (Abeta+aMCI). METHODS: A total of 60 patients with aMCI who were identified as amyloid positive ([18F] flutemetamol+) were recruited in the study, 24 patients with normal sleep latency (aMCI-n) and 36 patients prolonged sleep latency (aMCI-p). Cortical thickness and volumes between the two groups were compared. Volumetric analyses were implemented on the brainstem, thalamus, and hippocampus. Subcortical and cerebellar resting state functional connectivity (FC) differences were measured between the both groups through seed-to-voxel analysis. Additionally, group x Abeta interactive effects on FC values were tested with a general linear model. RESULT: There was a significantly decreased brainstem volume in aMCI-p subjects. We observed a significant reduction of the locus coeruleus (LC) FC with frontal, temporal, insular cortices, hippocampus, and left thalamic FC with occipital cortex. Moreover, the LC FC with occipital cortex and left hippocampal FC with frontal cortex were increased in aMCI-p subjects. In addition, there was a statistically significant group by regional standardized uptake value ratio interactions discovered in cerebro-cerebellar networks. CONCLUSION: The aforementioned findings suggest that prolonged sleep latency may be a detrimental factor in compromising structural and functional correlates of subcortical structures and the cerebellum, which may accelerate AD pathophysiology.
