38381472|a|A significant progressive decline in beta-carotene (betaC) levels in the brain is associated with cognitive impairment and a higher prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we investigated whether the administration of 9-cis beta-carotene (9CBC)-rich powder of the alga Dunaliella bardawil, the best-known source of betaC in nature, inhibits the development of AD-like neuropathology and cognitive deficits. We demonstrated that in 3 AD mouse models, Tg2576, 5xFAD, and apoE4, 9CBC treatment improved long- and short-term memory, decreased neuroinflammation, and reduced the prevalence of beta-amyloid plaques and tau hyperphosphorylation. These findings suggest that 9CBC has the potential to be an effective preventive and symptomatic AD therapy.
