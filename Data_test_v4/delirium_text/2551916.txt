2551916|t|Delirium and neuromuscular symptoms in an elderly man with isolated corticotroph-deficiency syndrome completely reversed with glucocorticoid replacement.
2551916|a|A 68-yr-old man had developed intractable vomiting soon after recovering from a flu-like illness. The use of Compazine as an antiemetic produced classic dystonic manifestations which resolved rapidly after discontinuation and treatment with Artane. However, he later developed a variety of neurobehavioral disturbances which led to his admission to the hospital. Extensive diagnostic procedures failed to identify any gastrointestinal or neurological causes. His condition unceasingly worsened until hypocortisolemia was serendipitously discovered, and all of his symptoms disappeared rapidly and completely with glucocorticoid replacement. Over the course of hospitalization, other than a single episode of orthostatic hypotension, the patient did not manifest any signs of adrenal insufficiency or endocrinopathy. Although detectable, his plasma ACTH level was markedly low in the presence of hypocortisolemia. His adrenal function was subnormal in the cortisol response to ACTH stimulation. His renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and catecholamine levels were normal. He had normal pituitary responses to GnRH, TRH, and insulin, with rises in plasma levels of LH, FSH, TSH, PRL, and GH, but no stimulation of ACTH. Repeated CRH tests revealed no stimulation of ACTH and cortisol. No circulating anti-ACTH, antiadrenal, or antipituitary antibody was detected. We conclude that this elderly patient had a rare syndrome of selective corticotroph dysfunction which resulted in secondary adrenal failure and exacerbated his mental and neuromuscular abnormalities. To our knowledge, these symptoms, which clearly relate to hypocortisolism, have not been previously reported.
