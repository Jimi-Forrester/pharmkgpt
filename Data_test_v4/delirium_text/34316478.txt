34316478|t|Dietary Patterns and Mild Cognitive Impairment Risk in Korean Adults over 50 Years Old.
34316478|a|The prevalence of age-related diseases such as dementia and cognitive disorders is rapidly increasing. This study aimed to identify the dietary patterns associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in adults aged over 50 years. This cross-sectional study investigated dietary patterns associated with cognitive function among older adults hospitalized in Gwangju province. Global cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination. Diet information was obtained using a food frequency questionnaire with 112 food items and 24-h dietary recall. Using a principal component analysis, we identified three dietary patterns, "legumes and vegetables", "beverage and nuts", and "white rice". The "beverage and nuts" pattern was inversely associated with the prevalence of high MCI after adjusting for covariates (third vs. first tertile, adjusted odds ratio: 0.333; 95% confidence interval: 0.133~0.831; P<0.05). The white rice pattern was associated with the prevalence of MCI in the crude analysis. However, after adjusting for all confounding factors, no association was found. The "beverage and nuts" pattern was inversely associated with the prevalence of MCI. In the future, longitudinal population-based studies and randomized clinical trials are required to confirm the effect of potential dietary patterns on cognitive impairment and reveal the underlying mechanism of their association.
