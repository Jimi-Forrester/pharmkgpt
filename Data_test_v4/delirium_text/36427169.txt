36427169|t|The Role of Preparedness for Caregiving on the Relationship Between Caregiver Distress and Potentially Harmful Behaviors.
36427169|a|This work extends research suggesting a link between indicators of distress among informal caregivers (CG) (e.g., depression and burden), and potentially harmful behaviors (PHB), including feeling like yelling or screaming at the care recipient (CR). We tested three hypotheses regarding the role of a novel predictor, CG preparedness for caregiving, which were: 1) a direct effect between CG preparedness and PHB, 2) CG distress mediates the relationship between the direct effect of CG preparedness on PHB, and finally, 3) CG preparedness is only related to PHB through their shared associations with indicators of caregiver distress, an indirect effects model. Examining two indicators of PHB and CG depression and CG burden, results supported the indirect effects model. Higher CG preparedness was associated with lower CG distress, which in turn was associated with lower risk of PHB. These findings highlight the importance of CG preparedness as a target for caregiver intervention research.
