27803723|t|Cognitive Impairment Among Elderly Patients With Chronic Heart Failure and Related Factors.
27803723|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure (HF) older than 65 years have a two-fold increased risk of cognitive impairment than elders without HF. Identifying factors affecting cognitive impairment in HF may present targets for intervention. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to determine cognitive function and related factors among elderly patients with heart failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 184 elderly patients with heart failure were selected from four Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences teaching hospitals using convenience sampling. Data were collected from patients' medical records and by interview, using the abbreviated mental test, geriatric depression scale, and Charlson comorbidity index. RESULTS: There were significant relationships between cognitive status and living arrangement (P < 0.001), education (P < 0.001), hypertension (P = 0.039), anemia (P = 0.046), Charlson comorbidity index (P < 0.001) and geriatric depression scale (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Screening of cognitive impairment in elderly patients with heart failure seems necessary.
