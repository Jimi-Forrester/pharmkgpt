31973592|t|Epilepsy Benchmarks Area IV: Limit or Prevent Adverse Consequence of Seizures and Their Treatment Across the Life Span.
31973592|a|Epilepsy represents a complex spectrum disorder, with patients sharing seizures as a common symptom and manifesting a broad array of additional clinical phenotypes. To understand this disorder and treat individuals who live with epilepsy, it is important not only to identify pathogenic mechanisms underlying epilepsy but also to understand their relationships with other health-related factors. Benchmarks Area IV focuses on the impact of seizures and their treatment on quality of life, development, cognitive function, and other aspects and comorbidities that often affect individuals with epilepsy. Included in this review is a discussion on sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and other causes of mortality, a major area of research focus with still many unanswered questions. We also draw attention to special populations, such as individuals with nonepileptic seizures and pregnant women and their offspring. In this study, we review the progress made in these areas since the 2016 review of the Benchmarks Area IV and discuss challenges and opportunities for future study.
