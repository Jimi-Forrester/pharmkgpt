3102001|t|[Immunocytochemical study at the ultrastructural level of neurofibrillary degeneration in Alzheimer's disease].
3102001|a|Paired Helical Filaments (PHF), as demonstrated at the ultrastructure level, are one of the main pathological landmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against PHF had been shown to label tangles and the periphery of plaques at the light microscope level. The same antiserum labels PHF specifically at the ultrastructure level, as demonstrated with a postembedding immunogold technique. Normal cytoskeleton constituents and plaque amyloid were not labelled. Specific labelling of a characteristic landmark may be a clue for a biological marker of AD.
