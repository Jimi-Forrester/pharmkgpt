38931237|t|How the Microbiota May Affect Celiac Disease and What We Can Do.
38931237|a|Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune disease with a strong association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA), characterized by the production of specific autoantibodies and immune-mediated enterocyte killing. CeD is a unique autoimmune condition, as it is the only one in which the environmental trigger is known: gluten, a storage protein present in wheat, barley, and rye. How and when the loss of tolerance of the intestinal mucosa to gluten occurs is still unknown. This event, through the activation of adaptive immune responses, enhances epithelial cell death, increases the permeability of the epithelial barrier, and induces secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in the transition from genetic predisposition to the actual onset of the disease. While the role of gastrointestinal infections as a possible trigger has been considered on the basis of a possible mechanism of antigen mimicry, a more likely alternative mechanism appears to involve a complex disruption of the gastrointestinal microbiota ecosystem triggered by infections, rather than the specific effect of a single pathogen on intestinal mucosal homeostasis. Several lines of evidence show the existence of intestinal dysbiosis that precedes the onset of CeD in genetically at-risk subjects, characterized by the loss of protective bacterial elements that both epigenetically and functionally can influence the response of the intestinal epithelium leading to the loss of gluten tolerance. We have conducted a literature review in order to summarize the current knowledge about the complex and in part still unraveled dysbiosis that precedes and accompanies CeD and present some exciting new data on how this dysbiosis might be prevented and/or counteracted. The literature search was conducted on PubMed.gov in the time frame 2010 to March 2024 utilizing the terms "celiac disease and microbiota", "celiac disease and microbiome", and "celiac disease and probiotics" and restricting the search to the following article types: Clinical Trials, Meta-Analysis, Review, and Systematic Review. A total of 364 papers were identified and reviewed. The main conclusions of this review can be outlined as follows: (1) quantitative and qualitative changes in gut microbiota have been clearly documented in CeD patients; (2) intestinal microbiota's extensive and variable interactions with enterocytes, viral and bacterial pathogens and even gluten combine to impact the inflammatory immune response to gluten and the loss of gluten tolerance, ultimately affecting the pathogenesis, progression, and clinical expression of CeD; (3) gluten-free diet fails to restore the eubiosis of the digestive tract in CeD patients, and also negatively affects microbial homeostasis; (4) new tools allowing targeted microbiota therapy, such as the use of probiotics (a good example being precision probiotics like the novel strain of B. vulgatus (20220303-A2) begin to show exciting potential applications.
