31888099|t|Extensive Structure Modification on Luteolin-Cinnamic Acid Conjugates Leading to BACE1 Inhibitors with Optimal Pharmacological Properties.
31888099|a|BACE1 inhibitory conjugates derived from two natural products, luteolin (1) and p-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (2), were subjected to systematic structure modifications, including various positions in luteolin segment for conjugation, different linkers (length, bond variation), as well as various substitutions in cinnamic acid segment (various substituents on benzene, and replacement of benzene by heteroaromatics and cycloalkane). Optimal conjugates such as 7c and 7k were chosen on the basis of a series of bioassay data for further investigation.
