32010342|a|Raw garlic contains characteristic compounds, such as S-alk(en)ylcysteine sulfoxides, gamma-glutamyl-S-alk(en)-ylcysteines and polysaccharides. These compounds undergo various transformation processes during the aging process. Among these compounds, the change of sulfur-containing molecules is diverse and time-dependent. Previously, by means of the liquid chromatography (LC)/LC-mass spectrometry (MS) method, a number of unidentified peaks corresponding to candidates of sulfur-containing molecules were detected in the chromatogram of aged garlic extract (AGE), and identified using MS and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The production mechanisms of these compounds were then examined by model reactions and laboratory experiments mimicking the aging process. Three gamma-glutamyl tripeptides [gamma-glutamyl-gamma-glutamyl-S-methylcysteine, gamma-glutamyl-gamma-gluta-myl-S-allylcysteine (GGSAC), gamma-glutamyl-gamma-glutamyl-S-1-propenylcysteine], gamma-glutamyl-S-allylmercaptocysteine (GSAMC) and cis-S-1-propenylcysteine (cis-S1PC) were isolated and identified. GGSAC was produced from GSAC through the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), and two other tripeptides could be produced in similar reactions. GSAMC was produced by the reaction between gamma-glutamyl dipeptides and allicin. Furthermore, GSAMC was a precursor compound of S-allyl-mercaptocysteine (SAMC), and thus it was produced from GSAMC by GGT. cis-S1PC was produced from trans-S1PC by the isomerization reaction. A number of other compounds were also identified, including Maillard reaction products; however, their production mechanisms have not been elucidated. In this review, we present the changes in characteristic constituents in raw garlic and garlic extract during the aging process and discuss their production mechanisms involving the various chemical and enzymatic reactions.
