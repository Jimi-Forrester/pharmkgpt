37954314|a|The potential of 2,6-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-3,3-dimethylpiperidin-4-one (BFDP) as an anti-Parkinson's, anti-lung cancer, and anti-human infectious agent was extensively assessed in the current study. To accomplish this, the compound BFDP was synthesised and analysed using several spectroscopic approaches, such as NMR, mass and FT-IR spectral studies. The computational calculations for the molecule were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-311G++ (d,p) level of theory. A X-ray diffraction (XRD) study allows us to analyse the crystalline structure of our BFDP molecule. Intermolecular interactions were assessed using 3D Hirshfeld surfaces (3D-HS) and 2D fingerprint plots. AIM and NCI-RDG were done using quantum calculations and the DFT technique, and topological ELF and LOL, as well as vibrational parameters, have been obtained. The thermodynamic and thermal properties of the BFDP compound were determined. To investigate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of BFDP, a molecular docking study and an in silico ADMET study were done.
