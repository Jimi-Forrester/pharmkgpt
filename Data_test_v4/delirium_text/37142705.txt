37142705|a|Realizing the promise of prime editing for the study and treatment of genetic disorders requires efficient methods for delivering prime editors (PEs) in vivo. Here we describe the identification of bottlenecks limiting adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated prime editing in vivo and the development of AAV-PE vectors with increased PE expression, prime editing guide RNA stability and modulation of DNA repair. The resulting dual-AAV systems, v1em and v3em PE-AAV, enable therapeutically relevant prime editing in mouse brain (up to 42% efficiency in cortex), liver (up to 46%) and heart (up to 11%). We apply these systems to install putative protective mutations in vivo for Alzheimer's disease in astrocytes and for coronary artery disease in hepatocytes. In vivo prime editing with v3em PE-AAV caused no detectable off-target effects or significant changes in liver enzymes or histology. Optimized PE-AAV systems support the highest unenriched levels of in vivo prime editing reported to date, facilitating the study and potential treatment of diseases with a genetic component.
