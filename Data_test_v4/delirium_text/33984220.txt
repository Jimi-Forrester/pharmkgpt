33984220|a|BACKGROUND: We compared upper- and lower-body forced-air blankets in terms of their ability to prevent perioperative hypothermia, defined as a reduction in body temperature to < 36.0 C, during the perioperative period in patients undergoing spine surgery in the prone position. METHODS: In total, 120 patients scheduled for elective spine surgery under general anesthesia were divided into an upper-warming group (n = 60) and a lower-warming group (n = 60). After inducing anesthesia and preparing the patient for surgery, including prone positioning, the upper and lower bodies of the patients in the upper- and lower-warming groups, respectively, were warmed using a forced-air warmer with specified upper and lower blankets. Body temperature was measured using a tympanic membrane thermometer during the pre- and post-operative periods and using a nasopharyngeal temperature probe during the intraoperative period. Patients were evaluated in terms of shivering, thermal comfort, and satisfaction in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). RESULTS: The incidence of intraoperative and postoperative hypothermia was lower in the upper-warming group than in the lower-warming group ([55.2% vs. 75.9%, P = 0.019] and [21.4% vs. 49.1%, P = 0.002]). Perioperative body temperature was higher in the upper-warming group (P < 0.001). However, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative thermal comfort scale and shivering scores, patient satisfaction, and PACU duration were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The upper-body blanket was more effective than the lower-body blanket for preventing perioperative hypothermia in patients who underwent spine surgery in the prone position.
