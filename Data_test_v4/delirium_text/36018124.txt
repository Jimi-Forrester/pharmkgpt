36018124|a|Purpose: Myopia is the most common type of refractive error and the leading cause of functional visual loss. Increased risk of myopic maculopathy, retinal detachment, glaucoma and cataract has been seen with a myopia of as low as -1D. This study was done to determine the effect of atropine 0.01% eye drops on the progression of myopia in children >5 years. Methods: This was a single-blind, prospective, randomized case-control study which included children of 5-15 years with myopia of >2D and were divided into treatment group (group 1) and placebo group (group 2). Children under treatment group were treated with application of 0.01% atropine at night. Children with history of any ocular surgery, chronic ophthalmic illness, squint and amblyopia were excluded from the study. The follow-up for myopia progression was done for two years. Results: This study showed a significant difference in increase of spherical equivalent and axial length among treatment and placebo groups after a duration of two years. Total duration of follow up was twenty-four months. Mean increase in axial length of group 1 and 2 was 0.115 mm and 0.32 mm, respectively. Mean increase in refraction of groups 1 and 2 was -0.30 D and -0.88 D, respectively, showing significant change in axial length and refraction (P < 0.0001). Conclusion: This study supports the use of atropine 0.01% eye drops in reducing the progression of myopia.
