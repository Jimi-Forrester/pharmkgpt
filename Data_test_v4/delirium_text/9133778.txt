9133778|t|Somatostatin: the neuroendocrine story.
9133778|a|Since its original discovery as the neuroendocrine hormone responsible for inhibiting growth hormone (GH) secretion, our understanding of the functions of somatostatin [or somatotrophin release inhibitory hormone (SRIH)], both in the periphery and the CNS, has grown enormously. With the cloning of five SRIH receptors, much interest has centred recently on the potential use of SRIH analogues in the treatment of clinical conditions ranging from human cancers to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. There is a growing recognition that the physiological functions of GH also need to be extended beyond its role in growth control, e.g. to a role in the maintenance of normal immune, cardiovascular and reproductive functions. Here, Glenda Gillies addresses the importance of somatostatinergic systems in regulating the sexually dimorphic patterns of GH secretion as well as their influence on other endocrine hormones. She also considers the neurotransmitter/neuromodulator actions of SRIH within the hypothalamus, where it is involved in the neural control and integration of many aspects of endocrine function, as well as its potential role in the maturation of the hypothalamus during the critical perinatal period.
