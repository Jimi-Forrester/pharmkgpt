38596010|a|The varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a latent viral infection and its reactivation has been reported following different conditions such as immunosuppression. This study presents a confirmed case of VZV encephalitis following the first dose administration of the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine. A 63-year-old immunocompetent woman who developed VZV encephalitis after first dose administration of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine. A final diagnosis of VZV encephalitis was made based on positive CSF PCR results for VZV infection. Treatment was administered with acyclovir and she returned to normal life without any neurological sequelae. In this report, VZV reactivation and VZV encephalitis have been observed after COVID-19 vaccination; however, the results of this report should be considered with some caution, and continued post-vaccine surveillance of adverse events is recommended to explore whether any causal association with VZV reactivation is biologically plausible in this context, or if it is just a coincidence.
