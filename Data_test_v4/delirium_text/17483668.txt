17483668|t|Psychiatric and behavioral manifestations of vascular dementia.
17483668|a|Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common cause of dementia, accounting for about 20% of all cases. Psychiatric and behavioral problems are at least as common in VaD as in Alzheimer's disease but are very different qualitatively. Patients with VaD, and especially those with small vessel disease, typically manifest symptoms related to damage to the frontal-subcortical system of the brain, including loss of executive function (which is not generally detected with most conventional tests of cognitive function), loss of drive, and disinhibited behaviors. Patients with VaD also commonly develop treatable mood disorders, most commonly depression. Once the symptoms are recognized, the clinician is in an ideal position to manage them and to educate caregivers about their nature.
