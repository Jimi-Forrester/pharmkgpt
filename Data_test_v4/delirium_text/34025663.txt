34025663|a|The symbiotic relationship between animals and their resident microorganisms has profound effects on host immunity. The human microbiota comprises bacteria that reside in the gastrointestinal tract and are involved in a range of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The gut microbiota's immunomodulatory effects extend to extraintestinal tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Specific symbiotic antigens responsible for inducing immunoregulation have been isolated from different bacterial species. Polysaccharide A (PSA) of Bacteroides fragilis is an archetypical molecule for host-microbiota interactions. Studies have shown that PSA has beneficial effects in experimental disease models, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the most widely used animal model for multiple sclerosis (MS). Furthermore, in vitro stimulation with PSA promotes an immunomodulatory phenotype in human T cells isolated from healthy and MS donors. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the interactions between gut microbiota and the host in the context of CNS inflammatory demyelination, the immunomodulatory roles of gut symbionts. More specifically, we also discuss the immunomodulatory effects of B. fragilis PSA in the gut-brain axis and its therapeutic potential in MS. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the microbiota's impact on host physiology offers tremendous promise for discovering new therapies.
