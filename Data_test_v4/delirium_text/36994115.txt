36994115|t|Characterization of Depressive Symptoms in Dementia and Examination of Possible Risk Factors.
36994115|a|Background: Depression in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is common, distressing, difficult to treat, and inadequately understood. It occurs more frequently in AD than in older adults without dementia. The reasons why some patients develop depression during AD and others do not remain obscure. Objective: We aimed to characterize depression in AD and to identify risk factors. Methods: We used data from three large dementia focused cohorts: ADNI (n = 665 with AD, 669 normal cognition), NACC (n = 698 with AD, 711 normal cognition), and BDR (n = 757 with AD). Depression ratings were available using the GDS and NPI and in addition for BDR the Cornell. A cut-off of>=8 was used for the GDS and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia,>=6 for the NPI depression sub-scale, and>=2 for the NPI-Q depression sub-scale. We used logistic regression to examine potential risk factors and random effects meta-analysis and an interaction term to look for interactions between each risk factor and the presence of cognitive impairment. Results: In individual studies there was no evidence of a difference in risk factors for depressive symptoms in AD. In the meta-analysis the only risk factor which increased the risk of depressive symptoms in AD was previous depression, but information on this was only available from one study (OR 7.78 95% CI 4.03-15.03). Conclusion: Risk factors for depression in AD appear to differ to those for depression per se supporting suggestions of a different pathological process, although a past history of depression was the strongest individual risk factor.
