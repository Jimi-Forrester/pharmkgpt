29635646|t|Developmental Exposure to Aluminum Chloride Irreversibly Affects Postnatal Hippocampal Neurogenesis Involving Multiple Functions in Mice.
29635646|a|Aluminum (Al) is neurotoxic to adults and also to infants. In this study, we investigated the developmental exposure effect of AlCl3 on postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis. Pregnant mice were administered 0-, 900-, or 1800-ppm AlCl3 via drinking water from gestational day 6 to postnatal day (PND) 21, with their offspring examined on PND 21 and PND 77. On PND 21, GFAP-immunoreactive (+) neural stem cells (NSCs) and p21Cip1/Waf1+ cells were decreased in number in the subgranular zone at 900 and >=900 ppm, respectively. Pcna transcript level examined at 1800 ppm was decreased in the dentate gyrus. These results suggest induction of compromised cell quiescence that caused impaired self-renewal capacity of NSCs accompanying slowing down of cell cycling, which ultimately resulted in exhaustion of the NSC pool. At 1800 ppm, Reelin+ hilar GABAergic interneurons were also decreased, suggesting a contribution to the NSC reduction. At this dose, TBR2+ or DCX+ progenitor and immature granule cells and PVALB+ interneurons were increased. Moreover, COX-2+ granule cells were increased at >=900 ppm. These results suggest facilitation of transient progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation during exposure. Moreover, TUNEL+ or Morin-stained granule cells were increased, together with Casp12 transcript upregulation, suggesting induction of Al accumulation-related endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated granule cell apoptosis. Transcript expression changes on cholinergic and glutamatergic signals and synaptic plasticity suggested contribution to disruptive neurogenesis. The NSC-targeting effects sustained through the adult stage despite no sustained Al-accumulation. These results suggest that developmental AlCl3-exposure irreversibly affects postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis involving multiple functions in mice.
