37460460|t|Altered brain dynamic in major depressive disorder: state and trait features.
37460460|a|Temporal neural synchrony disruption can be linked to a variety of symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), including mood rigidity and the inability to break the cycle of negative emotion or attention biases. This might imply that altered dynamic neural synchrony may play a role in the persistence and exacerbation of MDD symptoms. Our study aimed to investigate the changes in whole-brain dynamic patterns of the brain functional connectivity and activity related to depression using the hidden Markov model (HMM) on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. We compared the patterns of brain functional dynamics in a large sample of 314 patients with MDD (65.9% female; age (mean +- standard deviation): 35.9 +- 13.4) and 498 healthy controls (59.4% female; age: 34.0 +- 12.8). The HMM model was used to explain variations in rs-fMRI functional connectivity and averaged functional activity across the whole-brain by using a set of six unique recurring states. This study compared the proportion of time spent in each state and the average duration of visits to each state to assess stability between different groups. Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD showed significantly higher proportional time spent and temporal stability in a state characterized by weak functional connectivity within and between all brain networks and relatively strong averaged functional activity of regions located in the somatosensory motor (SMN), salience (SN), and dorsal attention (DAN) networks. Both proportional time spent and temporal stability of this brain state was significantly associated with depression severity. Healthy controls, in contrast to the MDD group, showed proportional time spent and temporal stability in a state with relatively strong functional connectivity within and between all brain networks but weak averaged functional activity across the whole brain. These findings suggest that disrupted brain functional synchrony across time is present in MDD and associated with current depression severity.
