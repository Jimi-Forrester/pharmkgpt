36984525|t|The Effects of Sarcopenia on Hip and Knee Replacement Surgery: A Systematic Review.
36984525|a|Sarcopenia is a progressive and generalized skeletal muscle disorder associated with poor outcomes and complications, including falls, fractures, physical disability, and death. The aim of this review is to assess the possible influence of sarcopenia on outcomes of sarcopenia in patients who underwent knee or hip replacement. A systematic review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, and CENTRAL bibliographic databases were searched. General study characteristics extracted were: primary author and country, year of publication, type of study, level of evidence (LOE), sample size, mean age, gender, follow-up, type of surgery, diagnosis, and outcomes. At the final screening, five articles met the selection criteria and were included in the review. Sarcopenia influences the Barthel Index (BI), which is significantly lower compared to patients without sarcopenia, which indicates that the patient is subjected to a worsening of this condition that can influence their normal life since they will become dependent on someone else. No difference in mortality rate was found was found between the studies. This systematic review addressed the possible role of sarcopenia in patients undergoing joint replacement surgery. Despite the lack of high-quality literature on this topic, a general trend in considering sarcopenia as a negative factor for quality of life in joint replacement patients was reported. However, the lack of significant results means it is not possible to report useful conclusions.
