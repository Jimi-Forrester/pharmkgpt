31695971|t|Singultus as an Unusual Debut of Plasmodium vivax Malaria.
31695971|a|Singultus is a common symptom with usually benign consequences. Although some rare associations with severe diseases have been described, no previous relationship between singultus and Plasmodium vivax malaria has been reported. The aim of this report is to detail the case of a 25-year-old male who had an unusual presentation for both singultus and laboratory-confirmed vivax malaria. We describe this previously unreported association, hypothesize on the potential mechanism and review the literature on singultus and unusual presentations of Plasmodium infections.
