37398361|a|Reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) are currently broadly prescribed for the treatment of HIV infection but are also thought to prevent Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression by protecting against amyloidosis. Our study evaluates the hypothesis that reverse transcriptase inhibitors protect against Alzheimer-type brain amyloidogenesis in the context of HIV infection. We compiled a case series of participants from a prospective study of the neurological consequences of HIV infection at the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program (HNRP) who had serial neuropsychological and neurological assessments and were on RTIs. Two participants had gross and microscopic examination and immunohistochemistry of the brain at autopsy; one was assessed clinically for Alzheimer's Disease by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis of phosphorylated-Tau, Total-Tau and Abeta42. Additionally, a larger cohort of autopsied individuals was evaluated for presence of amyloid plaques, Tau, and related pathologies. Three older, virally suppressed individuals with HIV who had long-term treatment with RTIs were included in analyses. Two cases demonstrated substantial cerebral amyloid deposition at autopsy. The third case met clinical criteria for AD based on a typical clinical course and CSF biomarker profile. In the larger cohort of autopsied individuals, the prevalence of cerebral amyloidosis among people with HIV (PWH) was greater for those on RTIs. Our study showed that long-term RTI therapy did not protect against Alzheimer-type brain amyloidogenesis in the context of HIV infection in these patients. Given the known toxicities of RTIs, it is premature to recommend them to individuals at risk or with Alzheimer's disease who do not have HIV infection.
