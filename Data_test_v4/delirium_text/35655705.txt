35655705|t|Versatile Electrochemical Synthesis of Selenylbenzo[b]Furan Derivatives Through the Cyclization of 2-Alkynylphenols.
35655705|a|We report an electrochemical oxidative intramolecular cyclization reaction between 2-alkynylphenol derivatives and different diselenides species to generate a wide variety of substituted-benzo[b]furans. Driven by the galvanostatic electrolysis assembled in an undivided cell, it provided efficient transformation into oxidant-, base-, and metal-free conditions in an open system at room temperature. With satisfactory functional group compatibility, the products were obtained in good to excellent yields.
