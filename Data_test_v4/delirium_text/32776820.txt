32776820|a|OBJECTIVE: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is considered the mini-invasive treatment of choice for patients with Stanford type B aortic dissection (TBAD). This study aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes and quality of life (QoL) in patients with acute and subacute TBAD after TEVAR. METHODS: From January 2014 until July 2016, 22 acute patients (Group A) and 18 subacute patients received TEVAR (Group B), and 13 patients were managed non-operatively (Group C). The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 was used to assess QoL preoperatively and after TEVAR. Operative techniques and complications were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The role emotion, vitality, and mental health domains scored well preoperatively. Except for role emotion, vitality, and mental health, the remaining domains significantly improved after TEVAR. There was no significant difference in QoL metrics between Groups A and B. In Group C, bodily pain and social functioning domains were improved, and role emotion was decreased, with no improvement in the remaining domains. The 3-year survival rates were 95.5%, 100%, and 85.7% for Groups A, B, and C, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: TEVAR may be safe and effective in patients with acute and subacute TBAD with similar and favorable clinical and QoL metrics.
