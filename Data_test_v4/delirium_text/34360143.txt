34360143|a|The elderly population in Korea is rapidly increasing. It is necessary to develop multi-faceted and complex interventions for prevention and delay of dementia, balance improvement, and physical activity, among the elderly living in the community. This study aimed to examine the effects of the cognitive/exercise dual-task program on cognitive function, health status, depression, and life satisfaction of the elderly living in the community. A quasi-experimental study design using a pretest-posttest control group was employed. The study included a total of 65 elderly participants (intervention: n = 32, control: n = 33) in Seoul, South Korea. The cognitive/exercise dual-task program as an intervention was composed of 20 sessions for a total of 10 weeks, held twice a week for about 50 min each session. Measures were general characteristics of study participants, the Korean version of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-K), Korean elderly health status assessment tool, Korean version of Geriatric Depression Scale, and the elderly life satisfaction scale. Data were collected from October 2020 to March 2021. There were statistically significant differences on cognitive function, health status, depression, and life satisfaction between two groups. The cognitive/exercise dual-task program was an effective intervention for improving cognitive function, health status, and life satisfaction, and for decreasing depression of the elderly living in the community. Health care providers need to pay attention to cognitive/exercise dual-task programs for elderly living in the community.
