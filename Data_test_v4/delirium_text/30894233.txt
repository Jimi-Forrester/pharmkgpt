30894233|t|Impacts of apolipoprotein E disclosure on healthy Asian older adults: a cohort study.
30894233|a|BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype provides information about Alzheimer's disease risk, yet genotype disclosure is discouraged due to concerns about possible distress. This is the first study investigating the psychological and behavioral impacts that genetic susceptibility testing for Alzheimer's disease has in an Asian population. METHODS: From March 2016 to November 2017, we ran a prospective cohort study at Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School. 280 healthy Chinese elderly filled in questionnaires that measured psychological symptoms and health behaviors, 1 week before and 6 weeks after APOE genotype disclosure. Responses from epsilon4-positive subjects (associated with greater Alzheimer's disease risk) were compared to responses from epsilon4-negative subjects. RESULTS: epsilon4 presence was not significantly associated with anxiety (p = 0.09) or depression (p = 0.25). No associations were found for changes to diet (p = 0.36), dietary supplements consumption (p = 0.90), physical activity (p = 0.15), or cognitive activity (p = 0.18). CONCLUSION: There is no evidence to suggest that disclosure of APOE to Asian populations was associated with any short-term adverse psychological or behavioral impacts.
