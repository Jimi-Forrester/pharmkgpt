21741993|t|Memantine prevents aluminum-induced cognitive deficit in rats.
21741993|a|Memantine, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor blocker, has been demonstrated to be neuroprotective against various neurotoxins. Aluminum, a well-known neurotoxin, has been suggested to be a contributing factor in Alzheimer's disease. In this study we investigated the possible effect of memantine on aluminum-induced cognitive impairment in rats. Rats were exposed to aluminum chloride (100mg/kg/day) and memantine (5, 10 and 20mg/kg/day) for 60 days. Cognitive functions were evaluated using three tests: Morris water maze, radial arm maze and passive avoidance tests. Results showed that memantine failed at low doses to have any significant influence on aluminum-induced memory deficit, but the 20mg/kg dose was found to cause significant enhancement of memory in the aluminum-exposed rats. This is the first study to demonstrate the protective role of memantine against aluminum-induced neuronal dysfunction. Biochemical and histological investigations are highly indicated to clarify the possible pharmacodynamic basis.
