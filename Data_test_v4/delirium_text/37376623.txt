37376623|t|Same but Different? Comparing the Epidemiology, Treatments and Outcomes of COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 ARDS Cases in Germany Using a Sample of Claims Data from 2021 and 2019.
37376623|a|BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung condition that can be caused by a variety of underlying illnesses. Due to SARS-CoV-2, the number of cases with ARDS has increased worldwide, making it essential to compare this form of acute respiratory failure with classical causes of ARDS. While there have been several studies investigating the differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS in early stages of the pandemic, little is known about the differences in later phases, especially in Germany. AIM: The aim of this study is to characterize and compare the comorbidities, treatments, adverse events, and outcomes of COVID-19-associated ARDS and non-COVID-19 ARDS using a representative sample of German health claims data from the years 2019 and 2021. METHODS: We compare percentages and median values of the quantities of interest from the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS group, with p-values calculated after conducting Pearson's chi-squared test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test. We also run logistic regressions to access the effect of comorbidities on mortality for COVID-19 ARDS and non-COVID-19 ARDS. RESULTS: Despite many similarities, we find that that there are some remarkable differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS cases in Germany. Most importantly, COVID-19 ARDS cases display fewer comorbidities and adverse events, and are more often treated with non-invasive ventilation and nasal high-flow therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of comprehending the contrasting epidemiological features and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS. This understanding can aid in clinical decision making and guide future research initiatives aimed at enhancing the management of patients afflicted with this severe condition.
