35739230|a|To date, no specific diagnostic criteria for sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) have been established. We studied 33 pediatric patients with sepsis prospectively and evaluated the level of consciousness, the presence of delirium, electroencephalographic (EEG) findings, and plasma levels of neuron-specific enolase and S100-calcium-binding protein-B. A presumptive diagnosis of SAE was primarily considered in the presence of a decreased level of consciousness and/or delirium (clinical criteria), but specific EEG abnormalities were also considered (EEG criteria). The time course of the biomarkers was compared between groups with and without clinical or EEG criteria. The Functional Status Scale (FSS) was assessed at admission, discharge, and 3-6 months post-discharge. Clinical criteria were identified in 75.8% of patients, EEG criteria in 26.9%, both in 23.1%, and none in 23.1%. Biomarkers did not differ between groups. Three patients had an abnormal FSS at discharge, but no one on follow-up. A definitive diagnostic pattern for SAE remained unclear. Clinical criteria should be the basis for diagnosis, but sedation may be a significant confounder, also affecting EEG interpretation. The role of biomarkers requires a better definition. The diagnosis of SAE in pediatric patients remains a major challenge. New consensual diagnostic definitions and mainly prognostic studies are needed.
