27896926|a|Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) is a widely investigated molecular target for numerous diseases including Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and diabetes mellitus. The present study was aimed to discover new scaffolds for GSK-3beta inhibition, through protein structure-guided virtual screening approach. With the availability of large number of GSK-3beta crystal structures with varying degree of RMSD in protein backbone and RMSF in side chain geometry, herein appropriate crystal structures were selected based on the characteristic ROC curve and percentage enrichment of actives. The validated docking protocol was employed to screen a library of 50,000 small molecules using molecular docking and binding affinity calculations. Based on the GLIDE docking score, Prime MMGB/SA binding affinity, and interaction pattern analysis, the top 50 ligands were selected for GSK-3beta inhibition. (Z)-2-(3-chlorobenzylidene)-3,4-dihydro-N-(2-methoxyethyl)-3-oxo-2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazine-6-carboxamide (F389-0663, 7) was identified as a potent inhibitor of GSK-3beta with an IC50 value of 1.6 mum. Further, GSK-3beta inhibition activity was then investigated in cell-based assay. The treatment of neuroblastoma N2a cells with 12.5 mum of F389-0663 resulted in the significant increase in GSK-3beta Ser9 levels, which is indicative of the GSK-3beta inhibitory activity of a compound. The molecular dynamic simulations were carried out to understand the interactions of F389-0663 with GSK-3beta protein.
