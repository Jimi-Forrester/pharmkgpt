29166854|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence agitation (EA) is a common phenomenon in preschool children during emergence from general anesthesia. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of dezocine for emergence agitation in preschool children anesthetized with sevoflurane-remifentanil. METHODS: A total of 100 preschool children, scheduled for elective laparoscopic repair of an inguinal hernia by high ligation of the hernia sac under sevoflurane-remifentanil anesthesia were randomized into two groups: Group C (n = 50) received Ringer's lactate 10 mL and Group D received Ringer's lactate 10 mL containing dezocine 0.1 mg/kg, postoperatively. RESULTS: Incidence of EA, defined as a score >= 3 on Aono's four point scale or Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) score >= 10 in the PACU (10% vs. 76%) and the percentage of patients with severe EA (PAED score >= 13) (12% vs. 76%) were significantly lower in Group D compared to Group C (P < 0.05). Mean Children and Infants Postoperative Pain Scale (CHIPPS) score was significantly lower in Group D compared to Group C (1.2 +- 0.5 vs. 5.2 +- 0.6; P < 0.05). Patients need for fentanyl (18% vs. 4%) or propofol rescue (20% vs. 0) was significantly greater in Group C compared to Group D. No significant differences in other relative aspects after surgery between groups. CONCLUSION: Administration of dezocine 0.1 mg/kg decreased the incidence and severity of EA in preschool children that had undergone laparoscopic repair of an inguinal hernia by high ligation of the hernia sac under sevoflurane-remifentanil anesthesia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: A single dose of dezocine suppresses emergence agitation in preschool children anesthetized with sevoflurane-remifentanil effectively: A double-blind, prospective, randomized, controlled study, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ID: ChiCTR-IOR-16010033), retrospectively registered on November 21, 2016.
