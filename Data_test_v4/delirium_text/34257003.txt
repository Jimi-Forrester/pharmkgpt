34257003|t|Altered Mental Status: An Important but Overlooked Presenting Symptom of COVID-19 in Older Adults.
34257003|a|OBJECTIVES: To determine whether altered mental status (AMS) as a presenting symptom in older adults with COVID-19 is independently associated with adverse outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective single center observational study of admitted patients (n = 421) age greater than 60 and a positive COVID-19 test. Outcomes included mortality, intubation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac injury. Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine if presenting with AMS was associated with adverse outcomes. RESULTS: There was an increased risk of mortality (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.05-1.57), intubation (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.09-2.12) and AKI (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.13-1.78) in patients that presented with AMS. CONCLUSIONS: During a global pandemic, prognostic indicators are vital to help guide the clinical course of patients, reduce healthcare cost, and preserve life. Our study suggests that AMS can play a major role in diagnostic algorithms in older adults with COVID-19.
