36292530|t|Analysis of Antidepressants Utilization for Patients Visiting Psychiatric Out-Patient Clinic in a Tertiary Care Hospital.
36292530|a|Depression is a prevalent mental health condition treated with antidepressants and other psychotropic medications. This study aimed to assess the utilization pattern of antidepressants among patients visiting the outpatient clinic of the psychiatry department of a tertiary care hospital. The study included the patients who visited the study site and fulfilled the mental and behavioral diagnostic criteria for depression. The demographic and clinical details, including drugs prescribed, were documented in a study-specific data collection form. The ratio of Prescribed Daily Dose to Defined Daily Dose (PDD: DDD) was calculated to assess the adequacy of antidepressant utilization. Data total of 154 patients were collected. A total of 22 psychotropic drugs were used among the study patients as mono (n = 70), dual (n = 69), triple (n = 10), or quadruple therapy (n = 1). Escitalopram was the most often prescribed antidepressant out of the nine antidepressants alone and in combination and was used in slightly high doses (PDD: DDD ratio 1.6). Sertraline, paroxetine, and desvenlafaxine, were used in adequate doses (PDD: DDD between 1 and 1.1), and fluoxetine, duloxetine, amitriptyline, imipramine, and mirtazapine, were used in inadequate doses (PDD: DDD <0.5). Our study findings reveal the need for continuous assessment of antidepressants medications usage in a hospital set up.
