1635624|t|Clinical and cerebral blood flow studies in patients with intracranial hemorrhage and amyloid angiopathy typical of Alzheimer's disease.
1635624|a|Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages can occur in patients with severe amyloid angiopathy and other morphological signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We observed 15 patients in whom histological examination of brain tissue specimens obtained at surgery revealed characteristic congophilic amyloid deposits in subcortical arteries and/or nerve cells. Clinical follow-up examinations were carried out up to 9 years after diagnosis. In addition, three survivors from the operated group were investigated by neuropsychological testing and single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) using Tc-99m-HMPAO for determination of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). SPECT could not differentiate between the "typical Alzheimer disease pattern" of bilateral temporo-parietal rCBF reduction and flow deficits resulting from previous hemorrhage. Intellectual functioning was found to be impaired to various degrees ranging from normal function to severe dementia (MMS test scores varied between 15 and 26 points); again, it was difficult to differentiate clinically between the nosologic entities mentioned above. On the basis of our present experience we cannot distinguish between brain dysfunction due to Alzheimer's disease and intracranial hemorrhage from amyloid angiopathy. This supports the idea that intracranial hemorrhage may only be one clinical manifestation of amyloid deposits, another one being "Alzheimer's disease" with varying preponderance.
