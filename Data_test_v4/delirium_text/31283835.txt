31283835|t|C-reactive protein for risk prediction of post-operative delirium and post-operative neurocognitive disorder.
31283835|a|BACKGROUND: Post-operative delirium (POD) and post-operative neurocognitive disorder (NCD) are frequently seen in the elderly. Development of biomarkers for pre-operative risk prediction is of major relevance. As inflammation present before surgery might predispose to POD and post-operative NCD development, we aim to determine associations between pre-operative C-reactive protein (CRP) and the incidence of POD and post-operative NCD. METHODS: In this observational study, we analyzed 314 patients enrolled in the SuDoCo trial, who had a pre-operative CRP measurement the day before surgery. Primary outcomes were POD assessed according DSM-4 from day 1 until day 7 after surgery and post-operative NCD assessed 3 months after surgery. We conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, randomization, body mass index, MMSE, ASA status, infection/autoimmune disease/malignoma and types of surgery to determine associations between CRP with POD and post-operative NCD, respectively. RESULTS: Pre-operative CRP was independently associated with POD [OR 1.158 (95% CI 1.040, 1.291); P = .008]. Patients with CRP values >=5 mg/dL had a 4.8-fold increased POD risk [OR 4.771 (95% CI 1.765, 12.899; P = .002)] compared to patients with lower CRP values. However, no association was seen between pre-operative CRP and post-operative NCD [OR 0.552 (95% CI 0.193, 1.581); P = .269]. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative CRP levels were independently associated with POD but not post-operative NCD after three months. Moreover, higher pre-operative CRP levels showed higher risk for POD. This strengthens the role of inflammation in the development of POD. Assessment of CRP before surgery might allow risk stratification of POD.
