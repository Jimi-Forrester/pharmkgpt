36233620|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) present with cognitive function deterioration, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS)-especially depression-and low quality of life (QoL). Management of AD remains difficult, especially in the elderly. Reminiscence therapy (RT) is a well-known cognitive rehabilitation intervention that can be adopted in nursing and residential care homes to restore autobiographical memory, ameliorate NPS, and improve the QoL of people with dementia. However, the evidence-based efficacy of RT for elderly patients with AD remains to be determined. METHODS: Here, we synthesized findings of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the effects of RT on cognition, depression, and QoL in elderly people with AD, according to the most recent PRISMA statement. We searched for RCTs in PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and in trial registries (i.e., clinicaltrials.gov and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organization). Two review authors extracted data of interest, with cognition, depression, and QoL measures as outcomes. RESULTS: A total of five articles were included in the final analysis. Findings globally showed that RT, both administered in individual or group sessions at least once a week for 30-35 min over a period of 12 weeks, is effective in supporting global cognition, ameliorating depression, and improving specific aspects of the QoL in elderly people with AD. CONCLUSIONS: RT has the potential to be a routine non-pharmacological therapy for elderly people with AD, thanks to its wider effects on the individual in terms of cognitive vitality and emotional status promotion, with positive implications for patient's daily life. Despite such evidences, caution should be used in findings' generalizability in relation to the paucity of existing RCTs with long-term follow-up.
