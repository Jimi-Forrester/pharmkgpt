37208478|a|The objective of this study was to investigate the potential association between the use of four frequently prescribed drug classes, namely antihypertensive drugs, statins, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and proton-pump inhibitors, and the likelihood of disease progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia using electronic health records (EHRs). We conducted a retrospective cohort study using observational EHRs from a cohort of approximately 2 million patients seen at a large, multi-specialty urban academic medical center in New York City, USA between 2008 and 2020 to automatically emulate the randomized controlled trials. For each drug class, two exposure groups were identified based on the prescription orders documented in the EHRs following their MCI diagnosis. During follow-up, we measured drug efficacy based on the incidence of dementia and estimated the average treatment effect (ATE) of various drugs. To ensure the robustness of our findings, we confirmed the ATE estimates via bootstrapping and presented associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our analysis identified 14,269 MCI patients, among whom 2501 (17.5%) progressed to dementia. Using average treatment estimation and bootstrapping confirmation, we observed that drugs including rosuvastatin (ATE = - 0.0140 [- 0.0191, - 0.0088], p value < 0.001), citalopram (ATE = - 0.1128 [- 0.125, - 0.1005], p value < 0.001), escitalopram (ATE = - 0.0560 [- 0.0615, - 0.0506], p value < 0.001), and omeprazole (ATE = - 0.0201 [- 0.0299, - 0.0103], p value < 0.001) have a statistically significant association in slowing the progression from MCI to dementia. The findings from this study support the commonly prescribed drugs in altering the progression from MCI to dementia and warrant further investigation.
