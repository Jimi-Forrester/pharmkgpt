27111489|t|Determination of the protonation state for the catalytic dyad in beta-secretase when bound to hydroxyethylamine transition state analogue inhibitors: A molecular dynamics simulation study.
27111489|a|BACE1 is an aspartyl protease of pharmacological interest for its direct participation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) through beta-amyloid peptide production. Two aspartic acid residues are present in the BACE1 catalytic region which can adopt multiple protonation states depending on the chemical nature of its inhibitors, i.e., monoprotonated, diprotonated and di-deprotonated states. In the present study a series of protein-ligand molecular dynamics (MD) simulations was carried out to identify the most feasible protonation state adopted by the catalytic dyad in the presence of hydroxyethylamine transition state analogue inhibitors. The MD trajectories revealed that the di-deprotonated state is most prefered in the presence of hydroxyethilamine (HEA) family inhibitors. This appears as a result after evaluating, for all 9 protonation state configurations during the simulation time, the deviations of a set of distances and dihedral angles measured on the ligand, protein and protein-ligand complex with reference to an X-ray experimental BACE1/HEA crystallographic structure. These results will help to clarify the phenomena related to the HEAs inhibitory pathway, and improve HEAs databases' virtual screening and ligand design processes targeting beta-secretase protein.
