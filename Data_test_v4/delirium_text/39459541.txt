39459541|t|Nilotinib as a Prospective Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease: Effect on Proteins Involved in Neurodegeneration and Neuronal Homeostasis.
39459541|a|Nilotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the Abelson tyrosine kinase (c-Abl) signaling pathway, is FDA-approved to treat chronic myeloid leukemia. Nilotinib has properties indicative of a possible utility in neuroprotection that have prompted exploration of repurposing the drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). AD is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of extracellular amyloid-beta plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. It is incurable and affects approximately 50 million patients worldwide. Nilotinib reduces c-Abl phosphorylation, amyloid-beta levels, and dopaminergic neuron degeneration in preclinical AD models. This study explores the effects of nilotinib on amyloid processing and mitochondrial functioning in the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line. SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to nilotinib (1, 5, and 10 microM). Real-time PCR and immunoblot analysis were performed to quantify the expression of genes pertaining to amyloid-beta processing and neuronal health. Nilotinib did not significantly change APP, BACE1, or ADAM10 mRNA levels. However, BACE1 protein was significantly increased at 1 microM, and ADAM10 was increased at 10 microM nilotinib without affecting APP protein expression. Further, nilotinib treatment did not affect the expression of genes associated with neuronal health and mitochondrial functioning. Taken together, our findings do not support the efficacy of nilotinib treatment for neuroprotection.
