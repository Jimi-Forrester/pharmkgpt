25484794|t|Crystallographic study of PET radio-tracers in clinical evaluation for early diagnosis of Alzheimers.
25484794|a|The title compound, C24H25NO3 2CH3OH, which crystallized as a methanol disolvate, has applications as a PET radiotracer in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The dihedral angle between the biphenyl rings is 8.2 (2)  and the heterocyclic ring adopts a half-chair conformation with the N atom adopting a pyramidal geometry (bond-angle sum = 327.6 ). The C atoms of both meth-oxy groups lie close to the plane of their attached ring [deviations = 0.107 (6) and 0.031 (6) A]. In the crystal, the components are linked by O-H O and O-H N hydrogen bonds, generating [010] chains. C-H O inter-actions are also observed.
