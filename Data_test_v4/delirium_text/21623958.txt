21623958|a|The overall ability of the brain to synthesise neuroactive steroids led us to the identification of compounds that would reproduce aspects of neurosteroid pharmacology. The rate-determining step in neurosteroid biosynthesis is the import of the substrate cholesterol into the mitochondria, where it is metabolised into pregnenolone via the intermediate 22R-hydroxycholesterol. The levels of translocator protein 18-kDa, mediating the import of cholesterol into mitochondria, correlated with increased pregnenolone formation and reduced levels of 22R-hydroxycholesterol in biopsies from Alzheimer's disease (AD), but not age-matched control, brains. 22R-hydroxycholesterol was shown to protect against beta-amyloid (Abeta(42) )-induced neurotoxicity. In search of 22R-hydroxycholesterol stable analogues, we identified the naturally occurring heterospirostenol, (22R,25R)-20alpha-spirost-5-en-3beta-yl hexanoate (caprospinol) and derivatives that protect neuronal cells against Abeta(1-42)  neurotoxicity. The neuroprotective effect of caprospinol is the result of a combination of overlapping properties, including: (i) the ability to bind to Abeta(42)  and reduce plaque formation in the brain in vivo; (ii) interaction with components of the mitochondria respiratory chain resulting in an anti-uncoupling effect; (iii) the capacity to scavenge Abeta(42)  monomers present in mitochondria; and (iv) the property of being a sigma-1 receptor ligand. In vivo, caprospinol crosses the blood-brain barrier, accumulates in the brain, and restores cognitive impairment in a pharmacological rat model of AD. Caprospinol is stable, does not bind to known steroid receptors, is devoid of mutagenic and genotoxic properties, and is devoid of acute toxicity in rodents. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of caprospinol were studied, and long-term toxicity studies are under investigation, aiming to develop this compound as a disease-modifying drug for the treatment of AD.
