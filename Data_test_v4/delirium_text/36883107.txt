36883107|t|The Effect of the Continuous Care on the Self-Care Behavior in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Recipients: A Semi-Experimental Study.
36883107|a|Background: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation strongly affects the care of patients suffering from malignant hematologic disorders and the implementation of interventions such as continuous care can affect the outcomes of treatment in a positive way. The aim of the current study was to determine the effect of implementing a continuous care model on self-care behavior in patients receiving HSCT between 2019 and 2020 in Shariati Hospital affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Materials and Methods: This semi-experimental study was conducted on 48 patients who were considered as candidates for HSCT at the Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant Research Center, Shariati Hospital. Participants for the present study were selected by the continuous care model based on the inclusion criteria. A 4-stage continuous care model (CCM) developed was used as an intervention in the study. A valid and reliable assessment questionnaire designed to measure the self-care behaviors of the patient (PHLP2) was used for the collection of demographic information. It was completed in the first and fourth stages of implementing the continuous care model. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22 software (Chicago, IL, USA). Moreover, the Chi-square test, pair t-test, and independent samples t-test were used in this study. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control group in terms of demographic variables (p>0.05). Prior to intervention, no statistically significant difference was observed in the mean self-care score among HSCT patients in the intervention and control group (p=0.590), while, after the intervention, a statistically significant difference was observed in the mean self-care score among HSCT patients in the intervention and control group (p<0.001). Conclusion: The study concluded that due to the increase in the number of patients undergoing HSCT across the country in recent years as well as the ease of implementation and low cost of this strategy to promote the self-care of HSCT recipients, relevant authorities ought to do it with the proper planning and policy nationwide. According to the results of the study, the use of a continuous care model on self-care behavior in patients receiving HSCT is recommended.
