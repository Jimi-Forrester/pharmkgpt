36413808|t|Galectin-3 Binding to alpha5beta1 Integrin in Pore Suspended Biomembranes.
36413808|a|Galectin-3 (Gal3) is a beta-galactoside binding lectin that mediates many physiological functions, including the binding of cells to the extracellular matrix for which the glycoprotein alpha5beta1 integrin is of critical importance. The mechanisms by which Gal3 interacts with membranes have not been widely explored to date due to the complexity of cell membranes and the difficulty of integrin reconstitution within model membranes. Herein, to study their interaction, Gal3 and alpha5beta1 were purified, and the latter reconstituted into pore-suspended lipid bilayers comprised eggPC:eggPA. Using electrochemical impedance and fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy, we found that on incubation with low nanomolar concentrations of wild-type Gal3, the membrane's admittance and fluidity, as well as integrin's lateral diffusivity, were enhanced. These effects were diminished in the following conditions: (i) absence of integrin, (ii) presence of lactose as a competitive inhibitor of glycan-Gal3 interaction, and (iii) use of a Gal3 mutant that lacked the N-terminal oligomerization domain (Gal3DeltaNter). These findings indicated that WTGal3 oligomerized on alpha5beta1 integrin in a glycan-dependent manner and that the N-terminal domain interacted directly with membranes in a way that is yet to be fully understood. At concentrations above 10 nM of WTGal3, membrane capacitance started to decrease and very slowly diffusing molecular species appeared, which indicated the formation of protein clusters made from WTGal3-alpha5beta1 integrin assemblies. Overall, our study demonstrates the capacity of WTGal3 to oligomerize in a cargo protein-dependent manner at low nanomolar concentrations. Of note, these WTGal3 oligomers appeared to have membrane active properties that could only be revealed using our sensitive methods. At slightly higher WTGal3 concentrations, the capacity to generate lateral assemblies between cargo proteins was observed. In cells, this could lead to the construction of tubular endocytic pits according to the glycolipid-lectin (GL-Lect) hypothesis or to the formation of galectin lattices, depending on cargo glycoprotein stability at the membrane, the local Gal3 concentration, or plasma membrane intrinsic parameters. The study also demonstrates the utility of microcavity array-suspended lipid bilayers to address the biophysics of transmembrane proteins.
