36286017|t|Analysis of SOD2 rs4880 Genetic Variant in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
36286017|a|A few gene loci that contribute to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) onset have been identified. Few studies have been published about the relationship between SOD2 rs4880 single nucleotide variant and AD, revealing inconsistent results. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to further examine the role of the SOD2 rs4880 in AD. We performed a case-control study with a total of 641 subjects (320 patients with probable AD, and 321 healthy controls). The statistical analysis was performed assuming five genetic models. The threshold for statistical significance was set at 0.05. The results revealed no association between SOD2 rs4880 and AD in any of the assumed genetic models that were examined [log-additive OR = 0.95 (0.76-1.19), over-dominant OR = 1.15 (0.85-1.57), recessive OR = 0.85 (0.59-1.22), dominant OR = 1.03 (0.72-1.47), and co-dominant OR1 = 1.10 (0.75-1.60) and OR2 = 0.90 (0.58-1.40)]. Adjustment for sex and subgroup analyses based on sex did not reveal any statistically significant results either. Based on our findings, SOD2 rs4880 does not appear to play a determining role in the risk of developing AD. Larger studies are warranted to elucidate the connection between rs4880 and AD.
