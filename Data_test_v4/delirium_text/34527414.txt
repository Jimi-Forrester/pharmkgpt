34527414|a|The journal, Aging and Disease, has released a special issue on "Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) in Health and Disease." The special issue comprises review and original research articles discussing the role of EVs in aging and senescence, the utility of evaluating EVs in body fluids for understanding the pathophysiology or progression of various diseases such as Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, and Morphine induced amyloidopathy. Also, a series of articles discussed the promise of stem cell-derived EVs for treating Parkinson's Disease, Sjogren's Syndrome, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and advancements in loading EVs to deliver nucleic acid therapies. This editorial discusses the highlights from these articles.
