39001280|t|Hematological Malignancies in Older Patients: Focus on the Potential Role of a Geriatric Assessment Management.
39001280|a|Geriatric assessment management is a multidimensional tool used to evaluate prognosis for clinical outcomes and targets for interventions in older adults with cancer receiving chemotherapy. In this review, we evaluated the possible application of geriatric assessment management (GAM) in hematological malignancies. In older patients with Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma, GAM might be helpful in both predicting planned hospital admissions and improving quality of life. In chronic myeloid leukemia, the Charlson Comorbidity Index demonstrates how comorbidities could affect treatment compliance and overall outcomes. In multiple myeloma, the application of different scores such as the International Myeloma Working Group Frailty Index and the Revised Myeloma Comorbidity Index can identify frail patients who need suitable interventions in treatment plan (reducing drug dose or changing treatment). Therefore, including GAM in the management plan of older patients with hematological malignancies may direct and optimize cancer care.
