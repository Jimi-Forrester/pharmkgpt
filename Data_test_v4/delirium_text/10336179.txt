10336179|a|The projection from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus and hippocampus is severely affected in Alzheimer's disease and there is a depletion of cholinergic terminals but an upregulation of the neuropeptide galanin, which inhibits the release of acetylcholine. Evidence for changes to galanin-immunoreactive terminals in the hippocampal formation was therefore examined after unilateral entorhinal cortex lesions in the adult rat. An increase in the density of galanin-immunoreactive terminals on the lesioned side was evident in the stratum lacunosum moleculare of the hippocampus and the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus at 17 days post-lesion, and it increased gradually until the last time point examined, at 40 days post-lesion. Thus we demonstrate that there is an increase in galanin-immunoreactive terminals in the hippocampal formation following entorhinal cortex lesions.
