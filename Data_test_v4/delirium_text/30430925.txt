30430925|a|Phenylethanoid glycosides (PHG), derived from Herba cistanche, were found to exert protective effects on cognitive dysfunctions by improving synaptic plasticity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) rat model. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects of PHG on synaptic plasticity remain to be determined. Thus the aim of this study was to examine the influence of PHG on synaptic plasticity in male AD rat model induced by bilateral central nervous system ventricle injections of beta amyloid 1-42 oligomers (Abeta1-42). The following parameters were measured: (1) number of intact pyramidal cells in hippocampal CA1 region by Nissl staining, (2) post synaptic density 95 (PSD-95), phosphorylated N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-1(p-NMDAR1) and (3) phosphorylated Tau protein (p-Tau) by immunohistochemistry and western blot. In addition, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were determined. Abeta1-42 lowered the number of intact pyramidal cells in hippocampal CA1 region. In contrast, treatment with PHG significantly elevated this cell number. Abeta1-42 significantly diminished protein expression levels of PSD-95 accompanied by elevated protein expression levels of p-NMDAR1 and p-Tau. PHG markedly increased protein expression levels of PSD-95, but significantly reduced protein expression levels of p-NMDAR1 and p-Tau. Further, Abeta1-42 markedly increased MDA content concomitantly with reduced activities of SOD and GSH-Px. PHG significantly decreased MDA content accompanied by elevated activities of SOD and GSH-Px. Data suggest that the protective effects of PHG on synaptic plasticity may involve inhibition of cytotoxicity-mediated by Abeta-1-42 administration and reduction of oxidant stress.
