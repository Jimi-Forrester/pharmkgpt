38369574|a|Antibiotics are indispensable to infection management. However, use of antibiotics can cause gut microbiota dysbiosis, which has been linked to cognitive impairment by disrupting communication between the gut microbiota and the brain. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of long-term antibiotic use on cognitive outcomes. We have searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library and Scopus for English publications before March 2023 following the PRISMA guidelines. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed in duplicate. 960 articles were screened and 16 studies which evaluated the effect of any antibiotic compared to no antibiotics or placebo were included. Case-reports, in vitro and animal studies were excluded. We found that antibiotic use was associated with worse cognitive outcomes with a pooled effect estimate of - 0.11 (95% CI - 0.15, - 0.07, Z = 5.45; P < 0.00001). Subgroup analyses performed on adult vs pediatric patients showed a similar association of antibiotic on cognition in both subgroups. Antibiotic treatment was not associated with worse cognition on subjects with existing cognitive impairment. On the other hand, antibiotic treatment on subjects with no prior cognitive impairment was associated with worse cognitive performance later in life. This calls for future well-designed and well-powered studies to investigate the impact of antibiotics on cognitive performance.
