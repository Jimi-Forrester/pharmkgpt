27595479|t|Electroencephalography Is a Good Complement to Currently Established Dementia Biomarkers.
27595479|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Dementia biomarkers that are accessible and easily applicable in nonspecialized clinical settings are urgently needed. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) is a good candidate, and the statistical pattern recognition (SPR) method has recently provided promising results. We tested the diagnostic value of qEEG-SPR in comparison to cognition, structural imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. METHODS: A total of 511 individuals were recruited from the multicenter NORD EEG study [141 healthy controls, 64 subjective cognitive decline, 124 mild cognitive impairment, 135 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 15 dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson's disease with dementia (DLB/PDD), 32 other dementias]. The EEG data were recorded in a standardized way. Structural imaging data were visually rated using scales of atrophy in the medial temporal, frontal, and posterior cortex. RESULTS: qEEG-SPR outperformed structural imaging, cognition, and CSF biomarkers in DLB/PDD diagnosis, outperformed structural imaging in AD diagnosis, and improved the differential diagnosis of AD. In addition, qEEG-SPR allowed differentiation of two clinically different AD subtypes. CONCLUSION: Adding qEEG to the diagnostic workup substantially increases the detection of AD pathology even in pre-dementia stages and improves differential diagnosis. EEG could serve as a good complement to currently established dementia biomarkers since it is cheap, noninvasive, and extensively applied outside academic centers.
