36411826|t|Nanozymes in the Treatment of Diseases Caused by Excessive Reactive Oxygen Specie.
36411826|a|Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) may generate deleterious effects on biomolecules, such as DNA damage, protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation, causing cell and tissue damage and eventually leading to the pathogenesis of diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, ischemia/reperfusion ((I/R)) injury, and inflammatory diseases. Therefore, the modulation of ROS can be an efficient means to relieve the aforementioned diseases. Several studies have verified that antioxidants such as Mitoquinone (a mitochondrial-targeted coenzyme Q10 derivative) can scavenge ROS and attenuate related diseases. Nanozymes, defined as nanomaterials with intrinsic enzyme-like properties that also possess antioxidant properties, are hence expected to be promising alternatives for the treatment of ROS-related diseases. This review introduces the types of nanozymes with inherent antioxidant activities, elaborates on various strategies (eg, controlling the size or shape of nanozymes, regulating the composition of nanozymes and environmental factors) for modulating their catalytic activities, and summarizes their performances in treating ROS-induced diseases.
