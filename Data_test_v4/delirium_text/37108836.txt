37108836|a|Haematological malignancies are heterogeneous groups of cancers of the bone marrow, blood or lymph nodes, and while therapeutic advances have greatly improved the lifespan and quality of life of those afflicted, many of these cancers remain incurable. The iron-dependent, lipid oxidation-mediated form of cell death, ferroptosis, has emerged as a promising pathway to induce cancer cell death, particularly in those malignancies that are resistant to traditional apoptosis-inducing therapies. Although promising findings have been published in several solid and haematological malignancies, the major drawbacks of ferroptosis-inducing therapies are efficient drug delivery and toxicities to healthy tissue. The development of tumour-targeting and precision medicines, particularly when combined with nanotechnologies, holds potential as a way in which to overcome these obstacles and progress ferroptosis-inducing therapies into the clinic. Here, we review the current state-of-play of ferroptosis in haematological malignancies as well as encouraging discoveries in the field of ferroptosis nanotechnologies. While the research into ferroptosis nanotechnologies in haematological malignancies is limited, its pre-clinical success in solid tumours suggests this is a very feasible therapeutic approach to treat blood cancers such as multiple myeloma, lymphoma and leukaemia.
