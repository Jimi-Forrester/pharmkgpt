37153268|t|Cardiac Arrest as First Presentation of Thyroid Storm.
37153268|a|Thyroid storm is a life-threatening condition characterized by a high level of circulating thyroid hormones and harbors high mortality and morbidity, even if diagnosed and treated early. The condition is frequently overlooked and under-recognized in emergency departments owing to its rarity. Here, we present a case of a 24-year-old male patient, previously healthy, who presented with cardiac arrest and was found to have heart failure and high thyroid hormone levels after investigations. Consequently, the presentation was attributed to thyroid storm. His clinical status and cardiac function improved after treatment of the hyperthyroidism.
