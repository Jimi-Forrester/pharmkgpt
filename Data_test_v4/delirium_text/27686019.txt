27686019|t|Neprilysin Inhibitors: Emerging Therapy for Heart Failure.
27686019|a|Biologically active natriuretic peptides (NPs) are an integral part of cardiac homeostasis as they help to maintain sodium and fluid balance. When homeostasis is perturbed by neurohormonal activation in heart failure, levels of NPs rise in response. Neprilysin (NEP) is a naturally occuring enzyme that breaks down NPs. Scientists have recently discovered a novel pharmacologic agent that combines a NEP inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker. In a large clinical trial, this new drug was found to reduce hospitalization and mortality in systolic heart failure. The challenges of implementing this therapy include patient selection, cost, and risk of side effects including angioedema and Alzheimer's disease.
