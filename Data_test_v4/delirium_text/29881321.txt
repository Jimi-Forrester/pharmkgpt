29881321|t|Pharmacotherapy of Insomnia.
29881321|a|Insomnia remains a common clinical concern that is associated with negative daytime consequences for patients and represents a significant public health problem for our society. Although a variety of therapies may be employed to treat insomnia, the use of medications has been a dominant approach. Regulatory agencies have now classified insomnia medications into 4 distinct pharmacodynamics classes. Medications with indications approved for insomnia treatment include benzodiazepine receptor agonists, a melatonin receptor agonist, a selective histamine receptor antagonist, and a dual orexin/hypocretin receptor antagonist. Both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic advances with hypnotic medications in recent years have expanded the pharmacopoeia to allow personalized treatment approaches for different patient populations and individual sleep disturbance patterns.
