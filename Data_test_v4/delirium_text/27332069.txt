27332069|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess correlations among gait apraxia, balance impairment and cognitive performance in mild (AD1, n = 30) and moderate (AD2, n = 30) AD. METHOD: The following evaluations were undertaken: gait apraxia (Assessment Walking Skills); balance performance (Berg Balance Scale); Clinical Dementia Rating and Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE). RESULTS: While disregarding AD subgroups, Berg Balance Scale and the MMSE correlated significantly with Assessment Walking Skills and 23% of all subjects scored below its cut-off. After stratification, Berg Balance Scale correlated significantly with Assessment Walking Skills in both AD subgroups, and with the MMSE only in AD1. CONCLUSIONS: Balance impairment does not necessarily coexist with gait apraxia. Gait apraxia is more prevalent in moderate AD when compared with mild AD.
