23758115|t|Extending the ABCDE bundle to the post-intensive care unit setting.
23758115|a|A recently proposed interprofessional, evidence-based, multicomponent approach to mitigating the effects of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired delirium and weakness has the potential to radically transform the way care is delivered to older adults requiring sedation, mechanical ventilation, or both. The Awakening and Breathing Coordination, Delirium Monitoring and Management, and Early Mobility (ABCDE) bundle empowers members of the interdisciplinary ICU team to implement the best available evidence regarding mechanical ventilation, sedation, weakness, and delirium in a safe, effective, and patient-centered manner. Considering that critically ill older adults are cared for in a number of different settings during the course of hospitalization and recovery, the purpose of this article is to explore the rationale and possible benefits of extending the ABCDE bundle into the post-ICU setting. We provide a case study that illustrates how ABCDE bundle adoption could be the key to improving the quality of care provided to seriously ill older adults in the ICU and beyond.
