31755379|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction underlies several human chronic pathologies, including cardiovascular disorders, cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Impaired mitochondrial function associated with oxidative stress can be a result of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. Neurological disorders associated with mtDNA mutations include mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, neurogenic weakness, and Leigh syndrome. Moreover, mtDNA mutations were shown to play a role in the development of Parkinson and Alzheimer's diseases. In this review, current knowledge on the distribution and possible roles of mtDNA mutations in the onset and development of various neurodegenerative diseases, with special focus on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases has been discussed.
