21057140|a|Terminal delirium is a common symptom that is frequently underdiagnosed in geriatric patients with cancer at end of life and is a major cause of distress for the patient as well as their family. This article explores the hyperactive and hypoactive delirium subtypes as well as the pathophysiology of terminal delirium and the theory of acetylcholine deficiency and dopamine excess. The causes for terminal delirium underdiagnosis as well as the causes of terminal delirium itself are identified. The use of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is discussed as a means of delirium diagnosis and the Memorial Delirium Assessment scale (MDAS) is presented as a tool to measure its severity. Lastly, nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment measures are reviewed and an algorithm is presented to assist the clinician in the identification and management of terminal delirium.
