29854939|a|INTRODUCTION: Several studies have tested the N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor antagonist memantine as an add-on to pre-existing treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combined memantine and galantamine-CR de novo regimen compared with galantamine-CR only treatment in never treated patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Antidementia drug-naive participants (n = 232) with probable, mild-to-moderate AD, and mini-mental state examination scores between 15 and 26 (inclusive) were randomized to receive either 20 mg/day memantine plus 24 mg/day galantamine-CR or 24 mg/day galantamine-CR plus placebo in a 52-week, prospective, double-blind, controlled trial. The primary outcome measurement was the change on the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognition score. Secondary measures comprised the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-activities of daily living inventory and the clinical dementia rating. RESULTS: At the end of the trial, there were no statistically significant differences between the galantamine-CR/memantine combination and galantamine-CR only group in primary and secondary outcome measurements. The incidence and the severity of adverse events were similar between the groups. DISCUSSION: In this trial, memantine in combination with galantamine-CR did not show an advantage with respect to cognition, function, and behavior in previously never treated patients with mild-to-moderate AD. There were no significant differences in tolerability and safety between the groups. Thus, a de novo combination treatment results in no significant improvement in disease progression (current controlled trials number: NCT01921972).
