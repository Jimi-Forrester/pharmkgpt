33255248|t|Excessive Gestational Weight Gain: Long-Term Consequences for the Child.
33255248|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to analyse the impact of mothers' gestational weight gain (GWG) and age at birth on the long-term risk of overweight and obesity in preschool and school-aged children. METHODS: The study involved 749 mothers and children at ages between four and 15 years old. Each child was assessed for height and body weight, and then, the body mass category was determined based on the body mass index (BMI) percentile according to the sex and age of the subjects. Information on the perinatal risk factors for overweight and obesity came from the child's health card or mother's maternity card. They contained information about the mother's age at the time of childbirth and the mother's gestational weight gain during pregnancy. RESULTS: In the group of 7-11-year-olds, the maternal weight gain during pregnancy was higher in obese children than in children with normal weight (18.8 kg vs. 14.3 kg; p = 0.002). This relationship was shown analogously in the group of 7-11-years-olds boys (20.6 kg vs. 15.1 kg; p = 0.005). Positive correlations were also shown between mother's gestational weight gain and the BMI percentage of the whole group (p = 0.004). In the case of the mother's age, no statistically significant relationship was found with the child's weight category. CONCLUSIONS: Mothers' weight gain during pregnancy is a factor that promotes overweightness and obesity in the child. Maternal age at birth does not appear to lead to any propensity toward overweightness and obesity in the later life of a child.
