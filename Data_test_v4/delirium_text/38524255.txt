38524255|t|Characterizing Cardiac Function in ICU Survivors of Sepsis: A Pilot Study Protocol.
38524255|a|Background: Sepsis is one of the most common reasons for ICU admission and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. More than one-half of survivors experience significant physical, psychological, or cognitive impairments, often termed post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Sepsis is recognized increasingly as being associated with a risk of adverse cardiovascular events that is comparable with other major cardiovascular risk factors. It is plausible that sepsis survivors may be at risk of unidentified cardiovascular disease, and this may play a role in functional impairments seen after ICU discharge. Research Question: What is the prevalence of myocardial dysfunction after an ICU admission with sepsis and to what extent might it be associated with physical impairments in PICS? Study Design and Methods: Characterisation of Cardiovascular Function in ICU Survivors of Sepsis (CONDUCT-ICU) is a prospective, multicenter, pilot study characterizing cardiovascular function and functional impairments in survivors of sepsis taking place in the west of Scotland. Survivors of sepsis will be recruited at ICU discharge and followed up 6 to 10 weeks after hospital discharge. Biomarkers of myocardial injury or dysfunction (high sensitivity troponin and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide) and systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) will be measured in 69 patients at recruitment and at follow-up. In addition, a cardiovascular magnetic resonance substudy will be performed at follow-up in 35 patients. We will explore associations between cardiovascular magenetic resonance indexes of cardiac function, biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction and inflammation, and patient-reported outcome measures. Interpretation: CONDUCT-ICU will provide data regarding the cause and prevalence of cardiac dysfunction in survivors of sepsis and will explore associations with functional impairment. It will provide feasibility data and operational learning for larger studies investigating mechanisms of functional impairment after ICU admission and the association between sepsis and adverse cardiovascular events.
