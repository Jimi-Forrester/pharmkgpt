33882808|t|Do Naturally Occurring Antioxidants Protect Against Neurodegeneration of the Dopaminergic System? A Systematic Revision in Animal Models of Parkinson's Disease.
33882808|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by a significant decrease in dopamine levels, caused by progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. Multiple mechanisms have been implicated in its pathogenesis, including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, insufficient support for neurotrophic factors and cell apoptosis. The absence of treatments capable of slowing or stopping the progression of PD has increased the interest in the natural antioxidant substances present in the diet, since they have multiple beneficial properties and it is possible that they can influence the mechanisms responsible for the dysfunction and death of dopaminergic neurons. Thus, the purpose of this systematic review is to analyze the results obtained in a set of studies carried out in the last years, which describe the neuroprotective, antioxidant and regenerative functions of some naturally occurring antioxidants in experimental models of PD. The results show that the exogenous no enzymatic antioxidants can significantly modify the biochemical and behavioral mechanisms that contribute to the pathophysiology of Parkinsonism in experimental animals. Therefore, it is possible that they may contribute to effective neuroprotection by providing a significant improvement in neuropathological markers. In conclusion, the results of this review suggest that exogenous antioxidants can be promising therapeutic candidates for the prevention and treatment of PD.
