34069802|t|Effect of Protease Type and Peptide Size on the In Vitro Antioxidant, Antihypertensive and Anti-Diabetic Activities of Eggplant Leaf Protein Hydrolysates.
34069802|a|Solanum macrocarpon (eggplant) leaf protein isolate (ELI) was hydrolyzed using four different enzymes to produce hydrolysates from alcalase (AH), chymotrypsin (CH) pepsin (PH) and trypsin (TH). CH had an overall stronger antioxidant property and was separated using ultrafiltration membranes into <1, 1-3 and 3-5 kDa peptide fractions. Gel-permeation chromatography confirmed conversion of the ELI (average of 22 kDa) into protein hydrolysates that contained smaller peptides (<6 kDa). A total of 23 peptides consisting of tri and tetrapeptides were identified from the CH, which is a wider spectrum when compared to seven for AH and four each for TH and PH. CH exhibited stronger scavenging activities against DPPH and hydroxyl radicals. CH and TH exhibited the strongest inhibitions against angiotensin-converting enzyme. In contrast, AH was the strongest inhibitor of alpha-amylase while AH and PH had strong inhibitory activities against alpha-glucosidase when compared with other hydrolysates. Ultrafiltration fractionation produced peptides that were stronger (p < 0.05) scavengers of DPPH, and hydroxyl radicals, in addition to better metal-chelating and enzyme inhibition agents. The study concluded that the eggplant protein hydrolysates and the UF fractions may find applications in tackling oxidative stress-related diseases and conditions involving excessive activities of the metabolic enzymes.
