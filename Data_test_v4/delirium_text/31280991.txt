31280991|a|PURPOSE: To identify the effectiveness and feasibility of blindfold training on preventing pediatric psychological behavior disorders during the anesthesia recovery period. DESIGN: This study investigated the effect of blindfold training through the assessment of anxiety, delirium, and pain in children during the anesthesia recovery period. METHODS: This study was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Pediatric patients were randomized into either a control (routine practice) or blindfold training group (routine practice + blindfold training). Anxiety, delirium, and pain levels of children were assessed by the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale, Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale, and the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale. FINDINGS: The blindfold training group had significantly lower scores for emergence delirium, anxiety, and pain during the anesthesia recovery period and a lower incidence of anesthesia complications (all P's < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative blindfold training was able to reduce anxiety, pain, and the incidence of delirium during the anesthesia recovery period in pediatric patients.
