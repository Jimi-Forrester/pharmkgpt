38420751|t|Beyond the burn: An observational study of cardiovascular risk in burn survivors in the north of Iran.
38420751|a|Burn survivors experience profound physiological changes following injury, which may have lasting implications for cardiovascular health. This study aims to investigate the cardiovascular risk profile among burn survivors treated at a burn center in northern Iran. This observational study was conducted from 2022 to 2023 at the burn centre affiliated with Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran. This study assessed a cohort study of 210 burn survivors, focusing on individuals with >=20% TBSA burn injuries who had recovered and returned to their daily lives. This study assessed patients' lipid profiles, Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score (FGCRS) and risk factors, including demographics, clinical variables and physical activity. Statistical analysis employed descriptive and inferential statistics. The mean age was 49.23 years, and the mean TBSA burned was 37.06%. The risk of cardiovascular disease in 66% of the study population was less than 10%, and in 13%, it was more than 20%. Significant associations were identified between CVD risk and sex, diabetes, hypertension, BMI, TBSA burned, years after burn, physical activity level and LDL. Of the lipid profile measures, LDL, triglycerides and TC/HDL exceeded the desirable levels. This research highlights the heightened cardiovascular risk in burn survivors, emphasizing the necessity for targeted interventions and regular monitoring. Identifying modifiable risk factors enables healthcare practitioners to develop tailored strategies, enhancing cardiovascular health in this vulnerable population and improving overall outcomes and quality of life.
