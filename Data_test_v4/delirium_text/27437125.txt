27437125|t|Effects of Psychoeducation on Mental Health in Patients With Coronary Heart Disease.
27437125|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with coronary heart disease are at high risk for mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Psychoeducation is a well-known intervention for psychiatric patients, but its use has been limited in other health conditions, such as coronary heart disease. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of psychoeducation on mental health in coronary heart disease patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized clinical trial included 70 patients with coronary heart disease at Shahid Beheshti hospital, in Kashan, Iran, in 2014. The patients were randomly assigned into two groups: the experimental group, which received eight sessions of psychoeducation, and the control group, which received routine care. Data were collected with the Goldberg mental health questionnaire (GHQ) and were analyzed using independent and paired t-tests performed with SPSS version 16. RESULTS: The means of overall GHQ scores were significantly decreased post-test in the intervention group, and the differences between the two groups were statistically significant in the overall GHQ scores (P = 0.0001). A significant difference was observed between the mean GHQ scores of the intervention group prior to and after the psychoeducational program (PEP) intervention (30 +- 4.66 vs. 20.50 +- 3.30) (P = 0.0001). No significant changes were observed in the control group pre- and post-test (P = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Psychoeducation resulted in improved mental health in patients with coronary heart disease. Therefore, it is recommended that this approach be performed as a complementary, effective, non-invasive, low-cost nursing intervention to reduce psychological problems in these patients.
