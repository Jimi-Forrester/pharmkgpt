38634273|t|In vitro and in silico investigation of FDA-approved drugs to be repurposed against Alzheimer's disease.
38634273|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the main causes of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder. Cholinesterase inhibitors are used in the treatment of AD, but prolonged use of these drugs can lead to serious side effects. Drug repurposing is an approach that aims to reveal the effectiveness of drugs in different diseases beyond their clinical uses. In this work, we investigated in vitro and in silico inhibitory effects of 11 different drugs on cholinesterases. The results showed that trimebutine, theophylline, and levamisole had the highest acetylcholinesterase inhibitory actions among the tested drugs, and these drugs inhibited by 68.70 +- 0.46, 53.25 +- 3.40, and 44.03 +- 1.20%, respectively at 1000 microM. In addition, these drugs are bound to acetylcholinesterase via competitive manner. Molecular modeling predicted good fitness in acetylcholinesterase active site for these drugs and possible central nervous system action for trimebutine. All of these results demonstrated that trimebutine was determined to be the drug with the highest potential for use in AD.
