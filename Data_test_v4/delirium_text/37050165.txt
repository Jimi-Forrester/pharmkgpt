37050165|t|An Insight into In Vitro Antioxidant, Antimicrobial, Cytotoxic, and Apoptosis Induction Potential of Mangiferin, a Bioactive Compound Derived from Mangifera indica.
37050165|a|Due to their low cost, toxicity, and health risks, medicinal plants have come to be seen as useful products and sources of biologically active compounds. Mangifera indica L., a medicinal plant with a long history, has a high bioactive metabolites content. Mangiferin (C19H18O11) is primary isolated from M. indica's leaves, which has many pharmacological benefits. In this investigation, ultrasonic-assisted extraction with ethanol as the extraction solvent was applied to obtain mangiferin from a local type of M. indica leaves. HPLC was performed after a dichloromethane-ethyl acetate liquid-liquid fractionation method. Further, UV-vis, FTIR, and NMR spectroscopy were utilized to elucidate the structure. Interestingly, purified mangiferin displayed promising antimicrobial efficacy against a diverse variety of fungal and bacterial pathogens with MICs of 1.95-62.5 and 1.95-31.25 microg/mL, respectively. Time-kill patterns also showed that mangiferin had both bactericidal and fungicidal action. Furthermore, it exhibited strong radical dosage-dependent scavenging activity (IC50 = 17.6 mug/mL) compared to vitamin C (Vc, IC50 = 11.9 mug/mL), suggesting it could be developed into a viable antioxidant agent. To our delight, the IC50 values of mangiferin for the MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines were 41.2 and 44.7 mug/mL, respectively, from MTT cell viability testing, and it was less harmful when tested against the noncancerous cell line. Notably, it significantly induced cell apoptosis in MCF-7 cells by 62.2-83.4% using annexin V-FITC/PI labeling. Hence, our findings suggest that mangiferin can be used in the medical industry to create therapeutic interventions and medication delivery systems for society.
