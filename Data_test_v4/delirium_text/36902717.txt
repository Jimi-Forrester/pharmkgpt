36902717|a|Previous studies have shown that COVID-19 inpatients exhibited significant attentional deficits on the day of discharge. However, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) has not been evaluated. Here, we aimed to verify: (1) whether COVID-19 patients with GIS exhibited specific attention deficits; (2) which attention subdomain deficits discriminated patients with GIS and without gastrointestinal symptoms (NGIS) from healthy controls. On admission, the presence of GIS was recorded. Seventy-four physically functional COVID-19 inpatients at discharge and sixty-eight controls underwent a Go/No-go computerized visual attentional test (CVAT). A Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) was performed to examine group differences in attentional performance. To discriminate which attention subdomain deficits discriminated GIS and NGIS COVID-19 patients from healthy controls, a discriminant analysis was applied using the CVAT variables. The MANCOVA showed a significant overall effect of COVID-19 with GIS on attention performance. The discriminant analysis indicated that the GIS group could be differentiated from the controls by variability of reaction time and omissions errors. The NGIS group could be differentiated from controls by reaction time. Late attention deficits in COVID-19 patients with GIS may reflect a primary problem in the sustained and focused attention subsystems, whereas in NGIS patients the attention problems are related to the intrinsic-alertness subsystem.
