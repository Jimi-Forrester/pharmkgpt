37232225|a|The hippocampal-entorhinal system supports cognitive function and is selectively vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Little is known about global transcriptomic changes in the hippocampal-entorhinal subfields during AD. Herein, large-scale transcriptomic analysis is performed in five hippocampal-entorhinal subfields of postmortem brain tissues (262 unique samples). Differentially expressed genes are assessed across subfields and disease states, and integrated genotype data from an AD genome-wide association study. An integrative gene network analysis of bulk and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) data identifies genes with causative roles in AD progression. Using a system-biology approach, pathology-specific expression patterns for cell types are demonstrated, notably upregulation of the A1-reactive astrocyte signature in the entorhinal cortex (EC) during AD. SnRNA-Seq data show that PSAP signaling is involved in alterations of cell- communications in the EC during AD. Further experiments validate the key role of PSAP in inducing astrogliosis and an A1-like reactive astrocyte phenotype. In summary, this study reveals subfield-, cell type-, and AD pathology-specific changes and demonstrates PSAP as a potential therapeutic target in AD.
