34804189|a|The 2nd phase of COVID-19 infection outbreak experienced worldwide is an attestation to the decline in the efficiency of COVID-19 detection kits available worldwide. rRT-PCR still remains the best confirmatory test for COVID-19 infection. Sadly, most medical professionals are not conversant with the rRT-PCR protocols. Therefore, more easy-to-use alternatives are required as backup, to compensate for these lapses. "Etaware-CDT-2020" is a virtual system designed for early detection of COVID-19 infection. A comparative COVID-19 diagnosis was conducted using Etaware-CDT-2020, corroborated by rRT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 results obtained from China (Latitude 35.8617oN and Longitude 104.1954oE), which was the epicentre for COVID-19 infection outbreak. A cross-comparison of results showed that there was a positive correlation between the output result from Etaware-CDT-2020 and rRT-PCR diagnosis from Wuhan (r = 0.92) and Hubei (r = 0.97). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the diagnostic results of "Etaware-CDT-2020" and rRT-PCR, when compared by T-test (P(t = 0) > 0.05) and Pearson's Chi-Square test (0.04 >= P <= 0.12). Etaware-CDT-2020 is unique and can be used anywhere, anytime and by anyone. It is accessible, affordable, easy to install, simple to understand and user friendly.
