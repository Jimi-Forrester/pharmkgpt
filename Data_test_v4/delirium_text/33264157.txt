33264157|t|Reversible Splenial Lesion Syndrome (RESLES) After Chemotherapy of Oral Tegafur-uracil in a Female With Locally Rectal Adenocarcinoma.
33264157|a|A 42-year-old woman with reversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES) and rectal adenocarcinoma presented with sudden-onset delirium after the sixth cycle of her chemotherapy drug, oral tegafur-uracil (300 mg/m/day, days 1-14, with treatment cycle repeated every 21 days). Accompanied by the anti-CV2 antibody, paraphasia, and a loss of bimanual coordination, the patient's etiology and clinical manifestations of RESLES are unlike those of other reported cases of RESLES. Tegafur-uracil is an oral fluoropyrimidine that has a similar effect to 5-fluorouracil as an adjuvant treatment for colorectal cancer. The possibility that the toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs may play a role in the pathogenesis of cytotoxic edema in the splenium of the corpus callosum and extracallosal white matter should be investigated further.
