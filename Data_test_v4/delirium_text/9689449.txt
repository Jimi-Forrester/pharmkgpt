9689449|a|Messenger RNA (mRNA) for cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COX II) was localized by in situ hybridization in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal formation of postmortem brain tissue from normal human subjects and from patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). In the control entorhinal cortex, COX II mRNA was detected mainly in neuronal cell bodies of layers II and IV. In control hippocampal formation, highest levels were localized in neuronal cell bodies of the dentate gyrus and the CA3 and CA1 regions, neurons that are involved in the major input and output pathways of the hippocampal formation. In AD brain, COX II mRNA was markedly reduced in the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampal formation compared with control brain. In the AD hippocampal formation, reductions were in regions severely affected by AD pathology as well as in regions that were relatively spared. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that reduced mitochondrial energy metabolism reflects loss of neuronal connections in AD.
