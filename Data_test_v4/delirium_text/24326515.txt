24326515|a|Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is characterized by lateralized motor disturbance due to levodopa nonresponsive parkinsonism and progressive apraxia. Although CBS is neuropathologically heterogeneous, it remains unclear whether the clinical features of all CBS cases are the same. We report two autopsy cases diagnosed clinically as CBS and pathologically as Alzheimer's disease characterized by lateralized cerebral cortical degeneration and absence of significant nigrostriatial lesions. Cerebral cortical degeneration in both cases was contralateral to their motor disturbances. Thus, nigrostriatial lesions and contralateral cerebral cortical lesions can cause motor disturbances in CBS, necessitating the need for bedside examination in patients with CBS.
