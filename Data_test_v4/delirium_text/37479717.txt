37479717|t|Anaesthesia by intravenous propofol reduces the incidence of intra-operative gastric electrical slow-wave dysrhythmias compared to isoflurane.
37479717|a|Gastric motility is coordinated by bioelectrical slow-wave activity, and abnormal electrical dysrhythmias have been associated with nausea and vomiting. Studies have often been conducted under general anaesthesia, while the impact of general anaesthesia on slow-wave activity has not been studied. Clinical studies have shown that propofol anaesthesia reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) compared with isoflurane, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of two anaesthetic drugs, intravenous (IV) propofol and volatile isoflurane, on slow-wave activity. In vivo experiments were performed in female weaner pigs (n = 24). Zolazepam and tiletamine were used to induce general anaesthesia, which was maintained using either IV propofol (n = 12) or isoflurane (n = 12). High-resolution electrical mapping of slow-wave activity was performed. Slow-wave dysrhythmias occurred less often in the propofol group, both in the duration of the recorded period that was dysrhythmic (propofol 14 +- 26%, isoflurane 43 +- 39%, P = 0.043 (Mann-Whitney U test)), and in a case-by-case basis (propofol 3/12, isoflurane 8/12, P = 0.015 (Chi-squared test)). Slow-wave amplitude was similar, while velocity and frequency were higher in the propofol group than the isoflurane group (P < 0.001 (Student's t-test)). This study presents a potential physiological biomarker linked to recent observations of reduced PONV with IV propofol. The results suggest that propofol is a more suitable anaesthetic for studying slow-wave patterns in vivo.
