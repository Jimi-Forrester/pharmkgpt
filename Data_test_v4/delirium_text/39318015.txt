39318015|a|BACKGROUND: Associative learning deficits are constantly found in subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). Despite achieving normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, a considerable number of patients undergoing levothyroxine (LT-4) treatment frequently complain about memory retrieval. The Paired Association Learning (PAL) task involves computerised testing on the CANTAB- Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, also considered a screening tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD). PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the impact of different levels of TSH on visual associative learning in SCH and determine if these impairments were reversed with LT-4. METHODS: A total of 134 participants were included in this cross-sectional study. Group 1: 35 healthy controls; patients with SCH (Group 2: 33 newly identified cases; Group 3: 32 patients on LT-4 with elevated TSH; Group 4: 34 euthyroid but on LT-4). A thyroid profile and a neuropsychological clinical assessment were done. The visual PAL task was performed on CANTAB. RESULTS: PAL was significantly impaired (p = <0.05) in all 3 patient groups as compared to Group 1. The PAL total errors (adjusted) scores were significantly higher in Groups 2 and 3, indicating that associative learning is definitely impaired in SCH, reaching levels previously seen in patients with AD. CONCLUSION: Our findings encourage screening for visual associative learning or memory retrieval in patients with SCH. The study present has established a more reasonable threshold of TSH 2.5mIU/L to encourage examination of associative learning and the initiation of LT-4 in SCH. Poor PAL task performance in patients with SCH may have significant implications in clinical settings for suspecting AD.
