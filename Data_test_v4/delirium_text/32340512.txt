32340512|a|MicroRNAs are involved in the regulation of the autophagy and proliferation in several diseases. This study aims to verify the role of miR-25-3p in the proliferation and autophagy of renal cells in polycystic kidney disease (PKD). We found that kidney to body weight and blood urea content were increased in PKD mice. Cystic dilations were increased in kidney tissue from PKD mice, and autophagy-related protein ULK1 and the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I were decreased, indicating autophagy was inhibited in PKD mice. In addition, miR-25-3p was upregulated in PKD mice, and inhibition of miR-25-3p decreased cystic dilations in kidney tissues, increased ULK1 expression and the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I, indicating inhibition of miR-25-3p enhanced the autophagy in PKD. Besides, inhibition of miR-25-3p suppressed the proliferation of renal cells and downregulated E2F-1 and PCNA expressions. Importantly, miR-25-3p targetedly suppressed ATG14 expression in PKD cells. Finally, silencing ATG14 abolished the inhibition effect of miR-25-3p inhibitor on renal cell proliferation, and reversed the inhibition effect of miR-25-3p inhibitor on E2F-1 and PCNA expressions in in vitro and in vivo experiments, which suggested that ATG14 was involved in the regulation of miR-25-3p-mediated kidney cell proliferation. Therefore, inhibition of miR-25-3p promoted cell autophagy and suppressed cell proliferation in PKD mice through regulating ATG14.
