37841923|a|Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a subtype of stroke with a high mortality rate. Oxidative stress cascades play an important role in brain injury after ICH. Cannabidiol, a major non-psychotropic phytocannabinoids, has drawn increasing interest in recent years as a potential therapeutic intervention for various neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the potential therapeutic effects of cannabidiol in countering oxidative stress resulting from ICH. The review elaborates on the various sources of oxidative stress post-ICH, including mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, iron toxicity, inflammation, and also highlights cannabidiol's ability to inhibit ROS/RNS generation from these sources. The article also delves into cannabidiol's role in promoting ROS/RNS scavenging through the Nrf2/ARE pathway, detailing both extranuclear and intranuclear regulatory mechanisms. Overall, the review underscores cannabidiol's promising antioxidant effects in the context of ICH and suggests its potential as a therapeutic option.
