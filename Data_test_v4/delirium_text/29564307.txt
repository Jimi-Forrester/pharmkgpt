29564307|t|Prevalence and Associated Risk Factors of Sarcopenia in Female Patients with Osteoporotic Fracture.
29564307|a|BACKGROUND: We determined the prevalence of sarcopenia according to fracture site and evaluated the associated risk factors in female patients with osteoporotic fractures. METHODS: A total of 108 patients aged 50 years or older with an osteoporotic fracture (hip, spine, or wrist) were enrolled in this retrospective observational study. A diagnosis of sarcopenia was confirmed using whole-body densitometry for skeletal muscle mass measurement. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors for sarcopenia. RESULTS: Of 108 female patients treated for osteoporotic fractures between January 2016 and June 2017, sarcopenia was diagnosed in 39 (36.1%). Of these, 41.5% (17/41) had hip fractures, 35% (14/40) had spine fractures, and 29.6% (8/27) had distal radius fractures. Body mass index (BMI; P=0.036) and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD; P=0.046) and rheumatoid arthritis (P=0.051) were significantly different between the groups. In multivariable analysis, BMI (odds ratio [OR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-1.05, P=0.098) and CKD (OR 2.51; 95% CI, 0.38-16.2; P=0.233) were associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia; however, this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluated the prevalence of sarcopenia according to the fracture site and identified associated risk factors in patients with osteoporotic fractures. A longterm, observational study with a larger population is needed to validate our results.
