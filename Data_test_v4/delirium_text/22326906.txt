22326906|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) fragment containing amino acids 667-676, (APP667-676), is a substrate for beta-secretase which is responsible for generating amyloid beta peptides. Conformational analysis of APP667-676 peptide [Ac-Ser-Glu-Val-Lys-Met-Asp-Ala-Glu-Phe-Arg-NH2] and the effect of substitution of Asp672 with D-Asp and iso-L-Asp, studied for the first time, demonstrate that the peptide backbone of APP667-676 is flexible and adopts different conformations in different solvent environments (water, trifluoroethanol and dimethylsulfoxide). A major conformational difference was observed in trifluoroethanol solvent when Asp672 is substituted with D-Asp and iso-Asp. These conformational changes involved in APP667-676 may assist in understanding the interactions between beta-secretase and APP667-676, with relevance to Alzheimer's disease.
