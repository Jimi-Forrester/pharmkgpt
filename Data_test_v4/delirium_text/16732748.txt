16732748|a|A 3-D volumetric study of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) was performed to evaluate how a minimum thickness of the MTL (mtMTL), a visually estimated measure, is associated with other MTL measures, maximal and minimal hippocampal length (max-HL, min-HL) and hippocampal volume, all measured with a 3-D device, Neurolucida, in 33 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), seven patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 20 age-matched controls. Cognitive impairment was evaluated with Mini-Mental State examination (MMSE). The T1-weighted horizontal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with slices 5 mm thick were analyzed with Neurolucida and the mtMTL was measured with visual estimation. The MTL was divided into the amygdala and hippocampus. Max-HL on both sides was longer in controls than in AD and MCI, whereas min-HL and mtMTL were longer in controls than in AD, and no difference was observed between MCI and controls. Similarly hippocampal volume was larger in controls than in AD, and no differences were seen within the MCI and controls. No difference in amygdala and midbrain volumes was observed among AD, MCI and controls. Correlation of MMSE score with min-HL and mtMTL was higher than that with max-HL. Although hippocampal and MTL measures examined here failed to show significant difference between AD and MCI, max-HL could be a diagnostic neuroimaging sign of AD. The high correlation of MMSE with mtMTL as well as with min-HL compared with that with max-HL, also will support neuroimaging diagnosis of AD.
