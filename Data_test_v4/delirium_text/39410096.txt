39410096|t|Hardness Analysis of Foods in a Diet Based on the Mediterranean Diet and Adapted to Chilean Gastronomy.
39410096|a|The human diet is a factor for disease prevention and the extension of life expectancy. Loss of teeth can adversely affect chewing capacity, which can lead patients to modify their diet and subsequently result in a poor dietary intake. This work is conducted within the framework of an ongoing research project in the Dentistry School of Universidad de la Frontera aimed at designing a diet for patients with complete removable dental prostheses (CRDP). This study aimed to evaluate the hardness of foods in a diet designed for patients using CRDP, using texture profile analysis (TPA). TPA was used to measure the hardness of 43 foods, categorized into seven groups, dairy, animal protein, fruits, vegetables, cereals and grains, high-lipid foods, and vegetable protein, to understand their impact on masticatory performance in CRDP wearers. TPA consists of two compression cycles where the food sample is compressed until it reaches a pre-established deformation. The first force peak achieved in the first cycle is used as a measure of sample hardness. Significant differences in hardness were identified within each food group, indicating a wide spectrum of textural properties that could influence chewing behavior. These findings suggest that assessing food hardness can help tailor dietary recommendations to improve masticatory efficiency in patients with dental prostheses.
