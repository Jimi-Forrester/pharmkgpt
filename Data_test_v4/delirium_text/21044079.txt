21044079|t|Role of matrix metalloproteinase-3 in neurodegeneration.
21044079|a|Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) is a member of the class of zinc-dependent proteases known to degrade the extracellular matrix. MMP-3 activity is regulated at three different levels: gene expression, proteolytic activation of the zymogen, and inhibition by the endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase. A line of evidence indicates a role of MMP-3 in neurodegeneration. In neuronal cells, MMP-3 expression is increased in response to cell stress, and the cleaved, active MMP-3 participates in apoptotic signaling. In the extracellular space, MMP-3 triggers microglia to produce proinflammatory and cytotoxic molecules as well as MMP-3, which in turn contribute to neuronal damage. MMP-3 is increased in various experimental models of Parkinson's disease that are produced by selective toxins and by inflammagen, and the neuronal death is attenuated by various ways that inhibit MMP-3. alpha-Synuclein, whose gene mutations are associated with familial forms of Parkinson's disease, is proteolyzed by MMP-3. Contribution of MMP-3 toward the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases has also been suggested. Thus, modulation of MMP-3 expression and/or activity could be of therapeutic value for neurodegenerative diseases.
