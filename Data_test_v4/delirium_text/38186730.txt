38186730|t|Haplotype analysis of long-chain non-coding RNA NONHSAT102891 promoter polymorphisms and depression in Chinese individuals: A case-control association study.
38186730|a|BACKGROUND: Our previous study reported that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs155979 GC in the promoter region of long-chain non-coding RNA (lncRNA) NONHSAT102891 affects depression susceptibility in a Chinese population. AIM: To explored associations of two SNPs and haplotypes in the lncRNA NONHSAT102891 promoter region with depression susceptibility in Chinese population. METHODS: This this case-control association study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Chengdu Medical College (approval number: 201815). Patient diagnosis was based on DSM-IV criteria. We selected a total of 480 patients with depression and 329 healthy controls with no history of psychopathology, and performed genotyping of two SNPs by extracting peripheral venous blood samples from the subjects. The function of the two lncRNA NONHSAT102891 promoter G/C and A/T haplotypes was detected by dual-luciferase reporter assays of human embryonic kidney 293T transfected cells. RESULTS: Stratified analysis of clinical and genotypic characteristics of our cohort showed that the degree of mild depressive episodes associated with the rs6230 TC/CC genotype increased by 1.59 times [TC/CC vs TT: odds ratio (OR) = 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-2.35, P = 0.019]. The haploid analysis revealed linkage disequilibrium between rs3792747 and rs6230, and the double SNP CG haplotype was more common in the control group compared to case group, indicating that this haplotype significantly reduced the risk of depression (C/G vs T/A: OR = 0.42, 95%CI: 0.21-0.83, P = 0.01). There was no significant difference in the dual-luciferase reporter activity of the G/C and A/T haplotypes compared with the control group (P > 0.05), indicating that the double SNP haplotype has no transcriptional activity. CONCLUSION: The rs3792747 and rs6230 CG haplotypes of the lncRNA NONHSA T102891 promoter may be related to a reduced risk of depression in the Han Chinese population.
