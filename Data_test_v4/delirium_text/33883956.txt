33883956|a|PURPOSE: Depressive symptoms can negatively influence patient outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Preoperative depressive symptoms can be associated with a longer hospitalization. Perceived control moderates the effect of anxiety on length of stay (LOS) among CABG patients, but its effect on depressive symptoms and LOS is not well studied. This study tests whether perceived control moderates the relationship between depressive symptoms and LOS among patients following CABG. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted on 220 participants recruited from three hospitals in Jordan. Participants' depressive symptom levels were measured using the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Perceived control was measured by the Arabic version of the Control Attitude Scale-Revised. Length of stay was obtained from medical records. Data were analyzed using multiple regression and simple slope analysis. RESULTS: Females had higher levels of depressive symptoms (mean [SD]: 16.7 [5.2] vs 11.6 [5.6], P<0.05), and longer LOS (mean [SD]: 17.5 [12.7] vs 10.3 [9.0], P<0.001) compared to male patients. Being female increased the length of stay by 0.18 days. Every one-unit increase in preoperative depressive symptoms increased LOS by 0.37 days. Perceived control has a protective effect; every one unit increase in perceived control decreased LOS by 0.28 days. Moreover, perceived control moderates the relationship between depressive symptoms and LOS. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that depressive symptoms and perceived control play an important role in the recovery among post-CABG patients. Application of policies to assess depressive symptoms and improve perceived control prior to CABG by health care providers might decrease morbidity and mortality.
