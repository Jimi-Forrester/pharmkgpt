35846794|t|DOCK4 as a Potential Biomarker Associated with Immune Infiltration in Stomach Adenocarcinoma: A Database Analysis.
35846794|a|Purpose: The involvement of dedicator for cytokinesis 4 (DOCK4), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1, in immune infiltration in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) remains unclear. Methods: The UALCAN database was used to analyze the expression of the DOCK family. The Kaplan-Meier method and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases were used to assess the prognostic value of the DOCK family in STAD. Furthermore, the correlation between expression of DOCK4 as well as other immune-related marker genes and tumor immune infiltration in STAD was explored using the TIMER and GEPIA websites. Subsequently, the relationship between DOCK4 expression and clinical characteristics was verified using the UALCAN database. Finally, DOCK4 mutation was analyzed via the TIMER2.0 and cBioPortal databases and the DOCK4 protein-protein interaction networks were constructed using the GeneMANIA and STRING websites. Results: DOCK4 was found to be a new prognostic biomarker in STAD. DOCK4 expression in tumors was thoroughly evaluated relative to paracancerous tissues; overexpression of DOCK4 had a negative impact on the prognosis of patients with STAD. DOCK4 was found to be significantly associated with tumor immune infiltration in STAD. Conclusion: In summary, DOCK4 is a potential regulator of the recruitment and regulation of immune-infiltrating cells, thus serving as a valuable prognostic biomarker in STAD.
