35596317|t|In Vitro Studies on Accelerating the Degradation and Clearance of Amyloid-beta Fibrils by an Antiamyloidogenic Peptide.
35596317|a|The clearance of overloaded amyloid-beta (Abeta) species, especially the toxic aggregates, was thought to be an attractive and promising strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy in the past decade. In this work, an active Abeta inhibitor decapeptide RR was used to transform mature Abeta fibrils (fAbeta) into nanorod-like Abeta assemblies (rAbeta) as well as loosen the beta-structure of rAbeta. Compared with fAbeta, rAbeta could be engulfed by PC12 cells more efficiently and showed a 1.46-fold difference. More importantly, the rAbeta was colocated with lysosomes after endocytosis, and in vitro study illustrated that rAbeta were easily degraded by lysosome protease cathepsin B when compared with the fibrils. Thus, our study indicated the potential application of RR in Abeta fibrils clearance by a cell-participated and enzyme-mediated pathway.
