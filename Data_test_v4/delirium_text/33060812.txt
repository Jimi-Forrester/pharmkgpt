33060812|t|Sarcopenia in hospitalized geriatric patients: insights into prevalence and associated parameters using new EWGSOP2 guidelines.
33060812|a|BACKGROUND: Data on prevalence of sarcopenia and its associated parameters in hospitalized geriatric patients are heterogeneous due to various definitions of the disease. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia using latest recommendations of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2), and to investigate associated parameters in patients admitted to acute geriatrics and geriatric rehabilitation. METHODS: In this cross-sectional single-centre study including 305 hospitalized geriatric patients, handgrip strength (pneumatic hand dynamometer) and muscle quantity (body impedance analysis) were assessed. Probable sarcopenia was defined by low handgrip strength, and the diagnosis was confirmed when both handgrip strength and muscle quantity were below cut-off points. Furthermore, parameters of the geriatric baseline examination were analyzed for association with probable and confirmed sarcopenia using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Median age of the study population was 84.0 years, and 65.6% were female. The prevalence of probable sarcopenia was 24.6% (CI 19.8-29.4%), and the prevalence of confirmed sarcopenia was 22.6% (CI 17.9-27.3%). Low calf circumference, low body mass index, cognitive impairment and an increased risk of malnutrition were found to be associated with confirmed sarcopenia. In contrast, only cognitive impairment was positively associated with probable sarcopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is highly prevalent in geriatric inpatients, and multiple parameters were found to be associated with the disease. To reduce negative clinical outcomes, our findings support the need for routinely performed admission examinations for prompt diagnosis of sarcopenia, and a timely start of treatment in hospitalized geriatric patients.
