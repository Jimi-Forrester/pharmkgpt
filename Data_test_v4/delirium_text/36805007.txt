36805007|t|Epidemiology and Clinical Presentation of COVID-19 in Older Adults.
36805007|a|Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains asymptomatic in 33% to 90% of older adults depending on their immune status from prior infection, vaccination, and circulating strain. Older adults symptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 often both present atypically, such as with a blunted fever response, and develop more severe disease. Early and late reports showed that older adults have increased severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with higher case fatality rates and higher intensive care needs compared with younger adults. Infection and vaccine-induced antibody response and long-term effects of COVID-19 also differ in older adults.
