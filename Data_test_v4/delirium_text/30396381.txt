30396381|a|The aim of this work was to investigate the biomolecular targets for a library of indolizines, study their molecular properties, drug likeness, target prediction, performing docking studies and exploring their ADMET profile in search for a lead compound. All compounds appeared to comply with Lipinski's rule without any violation, additionally their solubility is viewed good except for compounds 4a-c which are anticipated to be reasonably soluble, their Milog P score was 4.18-4.9, proposing that these compounds are the most lipophilic with least water solubility, however this may be helpful as the cannabinoid receptor-1 is the most probable target for these three compounds. The inclusive target for the selected library was tau protein. Structure based studies demonstrated great fitting of indolizines with tau protein, along these lines they are expected to have pharmacological action in vivo. This urged us to think about the ADMET properties of this library. These investigations suggested the ability of the selected compounds to pass the blood brain barrier (BBB) (aside from them compounds 2c and 3c) and affect tau proteins, which will be valuable for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, particularly compound 5 which does not require any SAR modifications to attain the BBB.
