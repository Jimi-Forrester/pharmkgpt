37038808|t|Association of Caffeine Consumption and Brain Amyloid Positivity in Cognitively Normal Older Adults.
37038808|a|BACKGROUND: Several epidemiological studies have reported the protective role of caffeine on health outcomes; however, it remained debatable on caffeine consumption and brain amyloid positivity. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the relationship between caffeine consumption and brain amyloid pathology in cognitively normal older adults. METHODS: The dataset used for analysis in this cross-sectional study was selected from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) Study. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the association between caffeine consumption and amyloid positivity using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: In total, 4,394 participants were included in the final analysis. No significant association between caffeine consumption and amyloid positivity was observed in the whole participants (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.78-1.14; p = 0.558). Subgroup analysis showed that caffeine intake was significantly associated with decreased amyloid positivity in males (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54-0.97; p = 0.032) but not in females (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.90-1.46; p = 0.280), and the association between caffeine and amyloid positivity was not affected by age or APOE genotypes. In addition, different levels of caffeine were not associated with amyloid positivity. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that caffeine consumption was not significantly associated with amyloid positivity in the whole sample. However, caffeine consumption may be inversely associated with amyloid positivity among males but not females. More studies are needed to explore the mechanisms underlying caffeine consumption and brain amyloid positivity.
