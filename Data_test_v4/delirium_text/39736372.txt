39736372|t|3-N-Butylphthalide alleviate Abeta-induced cellular senescence through the CDK2-pRB1-Caspase3 axis.
39736372|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and leading to cellular senescence and cognitive deficits. Cellular senescence contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of AD through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), exacerbating Abeta deposition. This study investigates the protective effects of 3-N-Butylphthalide (NBP), a compound derived from Apium graveolens Linn (Chinese celery), on Abeta-induced cellular senescence in U87 cells. Using RNA-sequencing and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that NBP ameliorate Abeta oligomer-induced cellular senescence and apoptosis, and regulated the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and components of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)- phosphorylated retinoblastoma 1 (pRB1)-Caspase3 pathway. Moreover, NBP was shown to suppress the expression of SASP-related genes. These findings suggest that NBP rescues U87 cells from Abeta oligomer-induced senescence and apoptosis through modulating the CDK2-pRB1-Caspase3 axis and SASP expression. Our results underscore the potential of NBP as a senostatic agent for AD which have not been reported in previous studies, offering insights into its mechanisms of action and paving the way for future studies on its efficacy in vivo and in clinical settings. Thus, we contribute to growing evidence supporting the use of senolytic and senostatic agents in the treatment of AD.
