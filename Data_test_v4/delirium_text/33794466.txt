33794466|a|PURPOSE: Hyperactive delirium is common after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We aimed to identify risk factors for delirium and to evaluate its impact on outcome. METHODS: We collected daily Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) scores in 276 SAH patients. Hyperactive delirium was defined as ICDSC >=4 when RASS was >0. We investigated risk factors for delirium and its association with 3-month functional outcome using generalized linear models. RESULTS: Patients were 56 (IQR 47-67) years old and had a Hunt&Hess (H&H) grade of 3 (IQR 1-5). Sixty-five patients (24%) developed hyperactive delirium 6 (IQR 3-16) days after SAH. In multivariable analysis, mechanical ventilation>48 h (adjOR = 4.46; 95%-CI = 1.89-10.56; p = 0.001), the detection of an aneurysm (adjOR = 4.38; 95%-CI = 1.48-12.97; p = 0.008), a lower H&H grade (adjOR = 0.63; 95%-CI = 0.48-0.83; p = 0.001) and a pre-treated psychiatric disorder (adjOR = 3.17; 95%-CI = 1.14-8.83; p = 0.027) were associated with the development of delirium. Overall, delirium was not associated with worse outcome (p = 0.119). Interestingly, patients with delirium more often had a modified Rankin Scale Score (mRS) of 1-3 (77%) compared to an mRS of 0 (14%) or 4-6 (9%). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that hyperactive delirium is common after SAH patients and requires a certain degree of brain connectivity based ono the highest prevalence found in SAH patients with intermediate outcomes.
