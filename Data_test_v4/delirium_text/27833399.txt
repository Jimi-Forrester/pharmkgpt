27833399|a|With the rise of aging population, clinical concern and research attention has shifted towards neuroimaging of dementia. The advent of 3T, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has permitted the anatomical imaging of neurodegenerative disease, specifically dementia, with improved resolution. Furthermore, more powerful techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging, quantitative susceptibility mapping, and magnetic transfer imaging have successfully emerged for the detection of micro-structural abnormalities. In the present review article, we provide a brief overview of Alzheimer's disease and explore recent neuroimaging developments in the field of dementia with an emphasis on structural MR imaging in order to propose a simple and easily applicable systematic approach to the imaging diagnosis of dementia.
