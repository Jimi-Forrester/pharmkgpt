30337026|a|BACKGROUND: Aluminum a known neuro and cholinotoxin has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Its exposure is associated with impairment of the memory and cognition. OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to evaluate the anti-Alzheimer's activity of Vitis vinifera in aluminum induced Alzheimer's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we investigated the behavioral and biochemical effects of aluminum in Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were exposed to aluminum chloride (100 mg/kg/day) orally for a period of 8 weeks. Vitis was given in doses of 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg for 16 weeks and the possible effects of Vitis vinifera on the expression of Tau and amyloid precursor protein were evaluated by PCR analysis and the possible activities of lipid peroxidation, inflammation and anti-cholinesterase activity were evaluated. RESULTS: Aluminum intoxication was associated with significant impairment in learning and memory in Morris water maze test. A significant improvement was observed with Vitis vinifera in a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study revealed the significant neuroprotective actions of Vitis vinifera by modifying the biochemical parameters and inhibited the mRNA expression of Amyloid Precursor Protein and Tau, which are the key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, which was further confirmed by histopathological observations.
