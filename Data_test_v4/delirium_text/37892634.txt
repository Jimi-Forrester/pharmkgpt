37892634|t|The Relationship between Oral Health and Schizophrenia in Advanced Age-A Narrative Review in the Context of the Current Literature.
37892634|a|Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that makes patients incompetent to perform day-to-day activities due to their progressing mental illness. In addition to disturbances with thoughts, behavioral changes, and impaired cognitive functions, oro-systemic health also becomes compromised. Even though the population with schizophrenia is primarily made up of older people, little is known about this group's oral health treatment. The present review explores the relationship between oral healthcare and elderly patients with schizophrenia. Our literature search included databases, like PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar, for appropriate and evidence-based information. Preventive and management strategies outlined in the included articles and future research perspectives in this field are discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that looked at dental care and related characteristics in older schizophrenia patients. The findings highlight the necessity for targeted dental interventions to address the dental health challenges faced by this vulnerable population. Integrating dental health into the overall medical management of elderly individuals with schizophrenia is crucial. Although specific therapies remain limited, the emphasis is on preventive dentistry to reduce the occurrence and progression of oral diseases in this group.
