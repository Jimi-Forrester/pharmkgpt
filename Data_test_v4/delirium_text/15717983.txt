15717983|a|Mild cognitive impairment in the elderly may represent a transitional phase between normal aging and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). It recently has been recognized as a distinct clinical entity with potentially different cognitive subtypes and etiologies. Like AD, studies have shown that psychiatric symptoms are more common than in the cognitively normal geriatric population. Understanding these symptoms has been recognized as important not only because they may impair patient function and caregiver burden, but also these symptoms may be relevant to understanding the development of AD in general. This article presents current information on psychiatric symptoms in mild cognitive impairment, their suggested role in the pathophysiology of AD and future research considerations on the subject.
