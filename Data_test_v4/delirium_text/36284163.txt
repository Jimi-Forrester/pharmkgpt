36284163|a|Recent studies suggest that sensory impairment is related to cognitive function at older ages. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the impact of sensory impairment on cognitive function in the Korean population. We used the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging data from 2006 to 2018. Cognitive function was measured by the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination scale. A score < 24 at the time of assessment was defined as cognitive impairment. Sensory impairment was assessed according to the self-reported levels of hearing or vision, and the development of sensory impairment was investigated using records of prior survey. We used the generalized estimating equation model to determine association between cognitive function and sensory impairment. A total of 4844 participants (age range: 47-95 years; mean age: 58) were included in the study. Compared to people without sensory impairment, people with a single sensory impairment of hearing or vision had a higher risk of cognitive impairment (odds ratio (OR) = 1.65 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.49-1.82]). People with dual sensory impairment had the greatest risk of cognitive impairment (OR = 3.23 [95% CI, 2.52-4.12]). The findings suggested the need for timely assessment of sensory function in older persons, which may be useful in identifying individuals at risk for cognitive impairment.
