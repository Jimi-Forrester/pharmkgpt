37571519|t|Implementing Wearable Sensors for Clinical Application at a Surgical Ward: Points to Consider before Starting.
37571519|a|Incorporating technology into healthcare processes is necessary to ensure the availability of high-quality care in the future. Wearable sensors are an example of such technology that could decrease workload, enable early detection of patient deterioration, and support clinical decision making by healthcare professionals. These sensors unlock continuous monitoring of vital signs, such as heart rate, respiration rate, blood oxygen saturation, temperature, and physical activity. However, broad and successful application of wearable sensors on the surgical ward is currently lacking. This may be related to the complexity, especially when it comes to replacing manual measurements by healthcare professionals. This report provides practical guidance to support peers before starting with the clinical application of wearable sensors in the surgical ward. For this purpose, the Non-Adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework of technology adoption and innovations in healthcare organizations is used, combining existing literature and our own experience in this field over the past years. Specifically, the relevant topics are discussed per domain, and key lessons are subsequently summarized.
