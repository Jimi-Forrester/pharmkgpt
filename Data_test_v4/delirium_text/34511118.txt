34511118|t|Inverted U-shaped correlation between serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and cognitive functions of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
34511118|a|BACKGROUND: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) metabolic disorder is common in individuals with diabetes. The role of LDL-C in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains to be explored. We aim to investigate the associations between LDL-C at different levels and details of cognition decline in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Patients with T2DM (n = 497) were recruited. Clinical parameters and neuropsychological tests were compared between patients with MCI and controls. Goodness of fit was assessed to determine the linear or U-shaped relationship between LDL-C and cognitive function. The cut-off point of LDL-C was calculated. Correlation and regression were carried out to explore the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and LDL-C levels above and below the cut-off point. RESULTS: Although no significant difference in LDL-C levels was detected in 235 patients with MCI, compared with 262 patients without MCI, inverted-U-shaped association was determined between LDL-C and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The cut-off point of LDL-C is 2.686 mmol/l. LDL-C (>2.686 mmol/l) is positively related to Trail Making Test B (TMTB) indicating executive function. LDL-C (<2.686 mmol/l) is positively associated with Clock Drawing Test (CDT) reflecting visual space function in patients with T2DM. CONCLUSION: Inverted U-shaped correlation was found between serum LDL-C and cognitive function in patients with T2DM. Despite that the mechanisms of different LDL-C levels involved in special cognitive dysfunctions remain incompletely clarified, excessive LDL-C damages executive function, while the deficient LDL-C impairs visual space function.
