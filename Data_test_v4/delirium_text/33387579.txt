33387579|a|Cardiac impairment contributes significantly to the mortality associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), primarily recognized as brain pathologies. These diseases may be caused by aggregation of a misfolded protein, most often, in the brain, although new evidence also reveals peripheral abnormalities. After characterization of the cardiac involvement in neurodegenerative diseases, several studies concentrated on elucidating the cause of the impaired cardiac function. However, most of the current knowledge is focused on the mechanical aspects of the heart rather than the electrical disturbances. The main objective of this review is to summarize the most recent advances in the elucidation of cardiac electrical remodeling in the neurodegenerative environment. We aimed to determine a crosstalk between the heart and the brain in three neurodegenerative conditions: AD, PD, and HD. We found that the most studies demonstrated important alterations in the electrocardiogram (ECG) of patients with neurodegeneration and in animal models of the conditions. We also showed that little is described when considering excitability disruptions in cardiomyocytes, for example, action potential impairments. It is a matter of contention whether central nervous system abnormalities or the peripheral ones increase the risk of heart diseases in patients with neurodegenerative conditions. To determine this notion, there is a need for new heart studies focusing specifically on the cardiac electrophysiology (e.g., ECG and cardiomyocyte excitability). This review could serve as an important guide in designing novel accurate approaches targeting the heart in neuronal conditions.
