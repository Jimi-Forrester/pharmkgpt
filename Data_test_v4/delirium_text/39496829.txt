39496829|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are often accompanied by neuroinflammation and impairment of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) mediated by activated glial cells through their release of proinflammatory molecules. To study the effects of glial cells on mouse brain endothelial cells (mBECs), we developed an in vitro BBB model with inflammation by preactivating mixed glial cells (MGCs) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) before co-culturing with mBECs to study the influence of molecules released by activated MGCs. The response of the mBECs to activated MGCs was compared to direct stimulation with LPS. The cytokine profile of activated MGCs was analyzed together with their effects on the mBEC's integrity, expression of tight junction proteins, adhesion molecules, and BBB-specific transport proteins. Stimulation of MGCs significantly upregulated mRNA expression and secretion of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Co-culturing mBECs with pre-stimulated MGCs significantly affected the barrier integrity of mBECs similar to direct stimulation with LPS. The gene expression levels of tight junction proteins were unaltered, but tight junction proteins revealed rearrangements with respect to subcellular distribution. Compared to direct stimulation with LPS, the expression of cell-adhesion molecules was significantly increased when mBECs were co-cultured with prestimulated MGCs and thus pre-activating MGCs transforms mBECs into a proinflammatory phenotype.
