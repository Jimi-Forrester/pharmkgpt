33586033|t|Study on the Correlation Between NF-kappaB and Central Fatigue.
33586033|a|In recent years, the World Health Organization (WHO) has included fatigue as a major risk factor for human life and health. The incidence rate of fatigue is high. In Europe and America, nearly 1/3 of the population is suffering from fatigue. Due to the acceleration of modern people's life rhythm and the increase of work pressure, more and more attention has been paid to central fatigue. The activation of NF-kappaB is related to central fatigue, which has been paid little attention by previous studies. At the same time, previous studies have mostly focused on the immune regulation function of NF-kappaB, while the NF-kappaB pathway plays an equally important role in regulating nerve function. NF-kappaB can participate in the occurrence and development of central fatigue by mediating immune inflammatory response, regulating central excitability and inhibitory transmitters, regulating synaptic plasticity and regulating central nervous system (CNS) functional genes. In addition to neuroprotective effects, NF-kappaB also has nerve damage effects, which is also closely related to the occurrence and development of central fatigue. In this review, we focus on the relationship between NF-kappaB pathway and central fatigue and further explore the biological mechanism of central fatigue. At the same time, the clinical application and potential of typical NF-kappaB inhibitors in the treatment of fatigue were analyzed to provide reference for the clinical treatment of central fatigue.
