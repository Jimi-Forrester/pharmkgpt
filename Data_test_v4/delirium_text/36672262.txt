36672262|t|Sex-Specific Whole-Transcriptome Analysis in the Cerebral Cortex of FAE Offspring.
36672262|a|Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are associated with systemic inflammation and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Several candidate genes were found to be associated with fetal alcohol exposure (FAE)-associated behaviors, but a sex-specific complete transcriptomic analysis was not performed at the adult stage. Recent studies have shown that they are regulated at the developmental stage. However, the sex-specific role of RNA in FAE offspring brain development and function has not been studied yet. Here, we carried out the first systematic RNA profiling by utilizing a high-throughput transcriptomic (RNA-seq) approach in response to FAE in the brain cortex of male and female offspring at adulthood (P60). Our RNA-seq data analysis suggests that the changes in RNA expression in response to FAE are marked sex-specific. We show that the genes Muc3a, Pttg1, Rec8, Clcnka, Capn11, and pnp2 exhibit significantly higher expression in the male offspring than in the female offspring at P60. FAE female mouse brain sequencing data also show an increased expression of Eno1, Tpm3, and Pcdhb2 compared to male offspring. We performed a pathway analysis using a commercial software package (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis). We found that the sex-specific top regulator genes (Rictor, Gaba, Fmri, Mlxipl) are highly associated with eIF2 (translation initiation), synaptogenesis (the formation of synapses between neurons in the nervous system), sirtuin (metabolic regulation), and estrogen receptor (involved in obesity, aging, and cancer) signaling. Taken together, our transcriptomic results demonstrate that FAE differentially alters RNA expression in the adult brain in a sex-specific manner.
