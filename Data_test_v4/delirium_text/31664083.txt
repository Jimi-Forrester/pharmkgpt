31664083|a|Sunitinib is a multispecific kinase inhibitor and one of its targets is the kinase GRK5, which is regulating a multitude of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this study we demonstrate that a decreased GRK5 expression induced by knock-down experiments or sunitinib treatment hampers the migration of cancer cell lines. A proteomic analysis revealed many pathways related to cell migration which were down regulated upon the GRK5 knock-down. Furthermore, we found in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells that the inhibition of migration is mediated by the GPCR gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) leading to a reduced expression of migration regulating downstream targets like CDC42 and ROCK1. An in silico Kaplan Meier analysis revealed that GRK5 and GRPR overexpression reduces the distant metastasis free survival in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Thus, we suggest a novel anti-migratory effect of impaired GRK5 expression which induces a negative feedback loop on GRPR signalling.
