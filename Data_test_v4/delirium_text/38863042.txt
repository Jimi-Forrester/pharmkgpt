38863042|a|BACKGROUND: Vascular dementia (VD) is an extremely common neurological dysfunction in the elderly population, and greatly affects the patient's ability to take care of themselves. Recent research suggests that VD patients need more targeted and individualized nursing during treatment, so as to enhance cognitive function and therapeutic efficacy. The objective of this study is to observe the effect of reminiscence, reality, and remotivation (3R) nursing combined with dietary and nutritional interventions on elderly patients with VD, so as to provide clinical evidence for the management of VD in older adults. METHODS: 120 elderly VD patients admitted between December 2022 and December 2023 were selected, including 64 cases receiving 3R nursing combined with dietary and nutritional interventions (the research group) and 56 cases receiving routine nursing (the control group). The two groups were compared in terms of neurological function, self-care ability, and nutritional status before and after nursing, as well as nursing compliance. After the completion of the care, patients' quality of life and family satisfaction were investigated. RESULTS: In comparison with the control group, the research group displayed higher scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), greater self-care ability, and higher levels of nutritional proteins and grip strength (p < 0.05). In addition, patients in the research group displayed greater nursing compliance and quality of life of patients, as well as higher family satisfaction (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 3R nursing combined with dietary and nutritional interventions can effectively improve the neurological function of VD patients and enhance their self-care ability.
