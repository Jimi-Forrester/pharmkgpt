31768196|a|Fungal endocarditis is a rare subtype of infective endocarditis that often presents with nonspecific symptoms in patients with complex medical histories, making diagnosis challenging. Patients with a history of ALL may present with congestive heart failure, chemo-induced cardiomyopathy, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac lymphomatous metastasis, or infections. We present the case of a patient with a history of ALL who presented with acute coronary syndrome and imaging concerning for primary cardiac lymphoma, when in fact the patient ended up suffering from culture proven fungal endocarditis.
