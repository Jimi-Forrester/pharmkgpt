38488983|a|PURPOSE: To clarify the predictive performance of different measures of frailty, including Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), 11-factor modified Frailty Index (mFI-11), and 5-factor modified Frailty Index (mFI-5), on adverse outcomes. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and other databases were retrieved from the inception of each database to June 2023. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the summary receiver operating curve (SROC) values were analyzed to determine the predictive power of CFS, mFI-11, and mFI-5 for adverse outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 25 studies were included in quantitative synthesis. The pooled sensitivity values of CFS for predicting anastomotic leakage, total complications, and major complications were 0.39, 0.57, 0.45; pooled specificity values were 0.70, 0.58, 0.73; the area under SROC values were 0.58, 0.6, 0.66. The pooled sensitivity values of mFI-11 for predicting total complications and delirium were 0.38 and 0.64; pooled specificity values were 0.83 and 0.72; the area under SROC values were 0.64 and 0.74. The pooled sensitivity values of mFI-5 for predicting total complications, 30-day mortality, and major complications were 0.27, 0.54, 0.25; pooled specificity values were 0.82, 0.84, 0.81; the area under SROC values were 0.63, 0.82, 0.5. CONCLUSION: The results showed that CFS could predict anastomotic leakage, total complications, and major complications; mFI-11 could predict total complications and delirium; mFI-5 could predict total complications and 30-day mortality. More high-quality research is needed to support the conclusions of this study further.
