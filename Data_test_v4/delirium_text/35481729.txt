35481729|a|Objectives: To analyze emergency and outpatient admissions by glaucoma patients during complete lockdown due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to assess the effect of pandemic-related complete lockdown on glaucoma patients. Materials and Methods: This retrospective chart review included all glaucoma patients who were either examined and/or underwent emergency surgery between March 11, 2020 and May 31, 2020, a period of complete COVID-19-related lockdown in Turkey. The data were compared with data from patients seen during the same time period in 2019. Visual acuity and intraocular pressure data from patients examined after the lifting of the lockdown were also evaluated. Results: According to Turkish Ministry of Health guidelines, only emergency examinations and surgeries could be performed during the 82 days of the COVID-19 lockdown. During this period, a total of 11 eyes of 10 patients were operated and 123 patients were examined in the outpatient clinic. During the same period in 2019, 122 surgeries were performed, 39 of which were emergencies. In the first 4 weeks after the lockdown ended, 163 patients were examined at the outpatient clinic and marked visual loss was detected in 10 eyes of 9 (5.5%) patients who did not attend follow-up visits due to the pandemic. Conclusion: During the lockdown, emergency surgeries related to glaucoma decreased by 71.7% and marked visual loss was detected in 5.5% of the patients examined after the lockdown. These findings suggest that some patients were unable to present to clinics despite needing emergency care.
