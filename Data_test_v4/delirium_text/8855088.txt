8855088|t|An ultrastructural and molecular perspective of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.
8855088|a|An update review of selected issues of the current knowledge of the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, by far the most common cause of human dementia is presented. The molecular basis of the most prominent ultrastructural features of AD including neurofibrillary tangles and the amyloid plaque as well as dystrophic neurites and neuropil threads. The major role of betaAPP and its metabolic pathways in the pathogenesis of AD has been strongly pointed out.
