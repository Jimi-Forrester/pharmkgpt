31893589|a|Objectives: To compare biochemical outcomes, effectiveness, and tolerance of two high-density silicone oils (HDSOs), silicone oil- RMN3 (Oxane  HD) and silicone oil-Densiron-68 (Densiron  68), for the management of complicated retinal detachment (RD) associated with inferior proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective, single-centre, comparative case series of 23 patients treated between September 2014 and June 2016. The main inclusion criteria were RD with inferior PVR receiving Oxane  HD or Densiron  68 following pars plana vitrectomy. The main outcome measures were anatomical success, rate of RD recurrence, and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were short-term complications. Results: Twenty-three eyes were included: 16 eyes with Densiron  68 tamponade and 7 eyes with Oxane  HD tamponade. Anatomical success under HDSO was significantly higher in the Densiron  68 group (100%) than in the Oxane  HD group (42.8%) (p=0.0455). Recurrent RD was observed in 42.8% of eyes under Oxane  HD, but in none of the patients under Densiron  68 (p=0.001). Six months after surgery, mean BVCA values (+/- standard deviation) with Densiron  68 and Oxane  HD were 0.83+-0.62 logMAR and 1.81+-0.65 logMAR, respectively. BVCA was significantly better in the Densiron  68 group (p=0.006). No significant differences were observed with regard to intraocular pressure, emulsification, or intraocular inflammation. Conclusion: Densiron  68 appears to be more effective than Oxane  HD for the management of RD associated with PVR. A randomized, controlled, interventional study is needed to demonstrate this difference.
