35683447|t|The Effect of Coenzyme Q10/Collagen Hydrogel on Bone Regeneration in Extraction Socket Prior to Implant Placement in Type II Diabetic Patients: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.
35683447|a|BACKGROUND: The healing of an extraction socket leads to alveolar ridge resorption that can hinder future implant placement and further rehabilitation with special concerns in diabetes mellitus. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) has been developed as a new material for alveolar socket augmentation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of CoQ10 hydrogel on bone regeneration after extraction of mandibular teeth in Type II diabetic patients. METHODS: This trial was registered under the number NCT05122299 and included eighteen patients. The hydrogel was first prepared and characterized. After tooth extraction, the hydrogel was placed in the extraction sockets. Bone formation was evaluated three months after tooth extraction. RESULTS: The bone density was significantly higher in the CoQ10 group than the other two groups measured on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). The relative gene expression of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and Osteopontin (OPN) showed significant increase in the presence of CoQ10. Histomorphometry revealed significantly less fibrous tissue in the CoQ10 group in comparison to the control or collagen group. CONCLUSION: The local application of CoQ10 after tooth extraction provided a simple, inexpensive, yet effective treatment facilitating bone formation and healing in the extraction sockets of diabetic patients.
