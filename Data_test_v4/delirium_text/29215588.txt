29215588|t|Cutting Edge Methods for Non-Invasive Disease Diagnosis Using E-Tongue and E-Nose Devices.
29215588|a|Biomimetic cross-reactive sensor arrays (B-CRSAs) have been used to detect and diagnose a wide variety of diseases including metabolic disorders, mental health diseases, and cancer by analyzing both vapor and liquid patient samples. Technological advancements over the past decade have made these systems selective, sensitive, and affordable. To date, devices for non-invasive and accurate disease diagnosis have seen rapid improvement, suggesting a feasible alternative to current standards for medical diagnostics. This review provides an overview of the most recent B-CRSAs for diagnostics (also referred to electronic noses and tongues in the literature) and an outlook for future technological development.
