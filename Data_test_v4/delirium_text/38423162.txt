38423162|a|Our previous study revealed that acupuncture may exhibit therapeutic effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD) through the activation of metabolism in memory-related brain regions. However, the underlying functional mechanism remains poorly understood and warrants further investigation. In this study, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to explore the potential effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. We found that the EA group exhibited significant improvements in the number of platforms crossed and the time spent in the target quadrant when compared with the Model group (p < 0.05). The functional connectivity (FC) of left hippocampus (Hip) was enhanced significantly among 12 regions of interest (ROIs) in the EA group (p < 0.05). Based on the left Hip as the seed point, the rsfMRI analysis of the entire brain revealed increased FC between the limbic system and the neocortex in the 5xFAD mice after EA treatment. Additionally, the expression of amyloid-beta(Abeta) protein and deposition in the Hip showed a downward trend in the EA group compared to the Model group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, our findings indicate that EA treatment can improve the learning and memory abilities and inhibit the expression of Abeta protein and deposition of 5xFAD mice. This improvement may be attributed to the enhancement of the resting-state functional activity and connectivity within the limbic-neocortical neural circuit, which are crucial for cognition, motor function, as well as spatial learning and memory abilities in AD mice.
