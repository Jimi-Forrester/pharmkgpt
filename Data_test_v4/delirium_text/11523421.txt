11523421|t|[Current strategies of pathogenetic therapy of Alzheimer's disease].
11523421|a|This is a review of the data available in the literature and the authors' own findings on pathogenetical rationale for the use and clinical study of current treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (synonym: Alzheimer-type dementia). In the past decade many attempts have been made at targeting different links of the pathogenesis of a neurodegenerative process that underlie AD. Several areas of pathogenetical therapy for AD have been developed on the basis of experimental studies and pilot clinical tests. The most developed areas are as follows: various compensatory (replacement) treatments aimed at overcoming neurotransmitter deficit in different neuronal systems that are damaged in AD to a greater or lesser extent; neuroprotective therapy promoting increased viability (survival) of neurons and their plasticity, and vasoactive therapy. Rather new directions of AD pathogenetic therapy, such as antiinflammatory and hormonal therapy along with antiamyloid therapeutic strategies are still under study.
