34494711|t|Relationships among tau burden, atrophy, age, and naming in the aphasic variant of Alzheimer's disease.
34494711|a|INTRODUCTION: Examination of pathologic, anatomic, and cognitive relationships has been limited in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) with underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. METHODS: Spatial relationships between tau positron emission tomography (PET), cortical thickness, age, and naming on the Boston Naming Test (BNT) in PPA with biomarker evidence of AD (PPA-AD) were examined. RESULTS: Higher tau PET burden was associated with atrophy and younger age. There was a significant left-lateralized relationship between lower BNT and more atrophy, and between lower BNT and increased tau burden. Variance in naming was primarily shared between tau and atrophy (51%), but naming was uniquely explained more by atrophy (32%) than tau (16%). Higher left anterior temporal tau burden was associated with greater 1-year rate of decline in naming. DISCUSSION: PPA-AD has a similar relationship between abnormal biomarkers as first described in amnestic AD, with differing spatial extent, reflecting the left-lateralized nature of the language network.
