34480030|t|Association of APOE4 genotype and treatment with cognitive outcomes in breast cancer survivors over time.
34480030|a|This prospective longitudinal study of breast cancer survivors (n = 167) examined the association of apolipoprotein epsilon4 (APOE epsilon4) genotype with cognition and interactions with chemotherapy or endocrine therapy up to 6 years after treatment. In general, we found no effects of epsilon4 across timepoints and treatment exposures; post hoc analysis at 3-6 years suggested a trend towards worse cognition in the domains of attention and learning among epsilon4 carriers exposed to endocrine therapy. Further study is needed.
