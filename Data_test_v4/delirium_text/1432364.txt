1432364|t|Automated microparticle enzyme immunoassay for neural thread protein in cerebrospinal fluid from Alzheimer's disease patients.
1432364|a|An automated microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) with the IMx analyzer for the detection of neural thread protein (NTP) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients was developed. This assay uses monoclonal antibodies produced against the purified pancreatic form of the protein. The assay employs one monoclonal antibody covalently coupled to the microparticle to capture immunoreactive material in CSF or brain tissue. The second monoclonal antibody was conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and serves as detection antibody. The assay provides results in approximately 45 minutes with a sensitivity of 60 pg/ml (3 fmoles/ml). The titration curve of both normal and AD CSF resulted in a linear relationship with respect to the volume of CSF used. A similar relationship was observed when normal and AD brain tissue extracts were serially diluted. The molecular weight of NTP in CSF was approximately 20 kD as determined by gel filtration method under non-denaturing conditions. The recovery for pancreatic thread protein (PTP) spiked in either normal or AD CSF was 104% and 108%, respectively. Intra-, inter-, and total assay CVs (coefficient of variation) for controls were less than 2.9%, 3.3% and 3.0%, respectively. This assay will provide a useful tool in the study of the Alzheimer's disease and may help research in diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.
