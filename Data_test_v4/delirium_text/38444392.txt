38444392|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating brain disorder with rapidly mounting prevalence worldwide, yet no proven AD cure has been discovered. Using a multi-omics approach in a transgenic AD mouse model, the current study demonstrated the efficacy of a modified Mediterranean-ketogenic diet (MkD) on AD-related neurocognitive pathophysiology and underlying mechanisms related to the gut-microbiome-brain axis. The findings revealed that MkD induces profound shifts in the gut microbiome community and microbial metabolites. Most notably, MkD promoted growth of the Lactobacillus population, resulting in increased bacteria-derived lactate production. We discovered elevated levels of microbiome- and diet-derived metabolites in the serum as well, signaling their influence on the brain. Importantly, these changes in serum metabolites upregulated specific receptors that have neuroprotective effects and induced alternations in neuroinflammatory-associated pathway profiles in hippocampus. Additionally, these metabolites displayed strong favorable co-regulation relationship with gut-brain integrity and inflammatory markers, as well as neurobehavioral outcomes. The findings underscore the ameliorative effects of MkD on AD-related neurological function and the underlying gut-brain communication via modulation of the gut microbiome-metabolome arrays.
