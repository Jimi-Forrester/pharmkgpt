32781863|a|Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) inhibition represents a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases. In this study, a series of 3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(2H)-one (DHN; 6a-n, 7a-c) derivatives were synthesised and characterised by NMR and HRMS. We assessed the toxicity and anti-neuroinflammatory properties of these compounds and found that 6m showed the greatest anti-neuroinflammatory properties, with relatively low toxicity. Specifically, 6m significantly reduced reactive oxygen species production, down-regulated the expression of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), and caspase-1 and prevented lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BV2 microglia cells polarisation towards an M1 phenotype. Furthermore, 6m significantly decreased IkappaBalpha and NF-kB p65 phosphorylation, thus inhibiting the NF-kB signalling pathway. This suggests that 6m may be explored as a functional anti-neuroinflammatory agent for the treatment of inflammatory diseases in the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, stroke and spinal cord injury.
