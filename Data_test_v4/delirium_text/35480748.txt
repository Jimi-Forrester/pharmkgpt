35480748|a|Herein we report a multifunctional high performance metal organic framework (Zn-DHNDC MOF) based chemosensor that displays an exceptional excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) tuned fluorescence turn-on-off response for OH-, Al3+ and Fe3+ ions along with mitochondria targeted bio-imaging. Properly tuning ESIPT as well as the hydroxyl group (-OH) allows Zn-DHNDC MOF to optimize and establish chelation enhanced fluorescence (CHEF) and chelation enhanced quenching (CHEQ) based sensing mechanisms. The MOF benefits from acid-base interactions with the ions which generate a turn-on bluish green fluorescence (lambda Em 492 nm) for OH-, an intense turn-on green fluorescence (lambda Em 528 nm) for Al3+ and a turn-off fluorescence quenching response for Fe3+ ions. The aromatic -OH group indeed plays its part in triggering CHEF and CHEQ processes responsible for the turn-on-off events. Low limits of detection (48 nM of OH-, 95 nM for Al3+, 33 nM for Fe3+ ions), high recyclability and fast response time (8 seconds) further assist the MOF to implement an accurate quantitative sensing strategy for OH-, Al3+ and Fe3+ ions. The study further demonstrates the MOF's behaviour in cellular medium by subjecting it to live cell confocal microscopy. Along with a bio-compatible nature the MOF exhibited successful accumulation inside the mitochondria of MCF7 cancer cells, which defines it as a significant bio-marker. Therefore the present work successfully represents the multidisciplinary nature of Zn-DHNDC MOFs, primarily in sensing and biomedical studies.
