34165838|t|Remodeling of the Fibrillation Pathway of alpha-Synuclein by Interaction with Antimicrobial Peptide LL-III.
34165838|a|Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a key mechanism for intracellular organization, and many recent studies have provided important insights into the role of LLPS in cell biology. There is also evidence that LLPS is associated with a variety of medical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders. Pathological aggregation of alpha-synuclein, which is causally linked to Parkinson's disease, can proceed via droplet condensation, which then gradually transitions to the amyloid state. We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL-III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of alpha-synuclein, leading to stabilization of the droplet and preventing conversion to the fibrillar state. The anti-aggregation activity of LL-III was also confirmed in a cellular model. We anticipate that studying the interaction of antimicrobial-type peptides with liquid condensates such as alpha-synuclein will contribute to the understanding of disease mechanisms (that arise in such condensates) and may also open up exciting new avenues for intervention.
