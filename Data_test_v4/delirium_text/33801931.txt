33801931|t|Pumpkin, Cauliflower and Broccoli as New Carriers of Thiamine Compounds for Food Fortification.
33801931|a|The aim of the study is to explore the possibility of vegetables being used as carriers of thiamine. The influence of carrier type (thiamine hydrochloride-TCh and thiamine pyrophosphate-TP) for the thiamine stability were investigated. Two varieties of pumpkin, Muscat and Hokkaido, as well as Cauliflower and Broccoli, were used as a matrix for the thiamine applied. The impregnated and freeze-dried vegetables were stored (230 days) with changing access to light (access to and restriction of light) and temperature (21  C and 40  C). The analyzed carriers were also used in the production of gnocchi dumplings. The content of thiamine was analyzed using the thiochromium method. In the study, consumer tests (n = 199) and sensory profiling were used to assess the impact of thiamine carriers on the sensory quality of gnocchi dumplings. It was found that the introduction of dried vegetables at the level of 30% allows for high sensory desirability of analyzed products, as well as suggesting the possibility of their frequent consumption. Such a product could potentially become an alternative to pork meat as a good source of thiamine. However, it should be noted that the thiamine losses may occur during the storage of dried vegetables and their culinary preparation.
