25009157|t|Relationships between testosterone levels and cognition in patients with Alzheimer disease and nondemented elderly men.
25009157|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous research suggests that low levels of testosterone may be associated with the development of Alzheimer disease (AD), as well as poorer performance on certain neuropsychological tests and increased risk of depression. METHODS: This study utilized data from 61 nondemented older men and 68 men with probable AD. RESULTS: Testosterone levels did not differ between the groups. Regression analyses in men with AD revealed that testosterone levels did not significantly predict performance on neuropsychological tests or a measure of depression. Among controls, testosterone levels predicted estimated premorbid verbal IQ and performance on a verbal fluency test. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that testosterone is not associated with most neuropsychological test performances in patients with AD.
