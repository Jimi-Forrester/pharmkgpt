8870877|t|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy. A review.
8870877|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a condition characterized by amyloid deposition in cerebral blood vessels. It occurs most frequently in association with clinical Alzheimer's disease but also occurs in some nondemented elderly people. CAA is a cause of spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage and may therefore present as a sudden unexpected death in an elderly person. The amyloid is deposited in cortical blood vessels, and on hematoxylin-eosin sections takes the form of pink hyaline thickening of arteries and arterioles, often with narrowing of the lumina. For diagnosis apple-green birefringence after Congo red staining is the most widely practiced and reliable tool. CAA-related hemorrhage may also occur in any lobe of the cerebrum close to the external surface and may occur at multiple sites and at the same or different times. CAA-related hemorrhage may occur in the setting of trauma necessitating distinction between the two and raising the question of whether it precipitated trauma or vice versa. Usually CAA-related hemorrhage is infrequent in sites where traumatic hemorrhages occur, and traumatic hemorrhages are often associated with other hemorrhages in sites typical for trauma. Five cases demonstrating many of the clinical and pathological features of CAA-related hemorrhage are presented. In two of the five cases, the hemorrhage followed trauma, suggesting that trauma as a precipitating factor for CAA-related hemorrhage may be more common than is generally recognized. CAA-associated hemorrhage should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cerebral hemorrhage in the elderly whether or not dementia is present.
