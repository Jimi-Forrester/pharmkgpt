33421595|t|PET measurement of longitudinal amyloid load identifies the earliest stages of amyloid-beta accumulation during Alzheimer's disease progression in Down syndrome.
33421595|a|INTRODUCTION: Adults with Down syndrome (DS) are predisposed to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and reveal early amyloid beta (Abeta) pathology in the brain. Positron emission tomography (PET) provides an in vivo measure of Abeta throughout the AD continuum. Due to the high prevalence of AD in DS, there is need for longitudinal imaging studies of Abeta to better characterize the natural history of Abeta accumulation, which will aid in the staging of this population for clinical trials aimed at AD treatment and prevention. METHODS: Adults with DS (N = 79; Mean age (SD) = 42.7 (7.28) years) underwent longitudinal [C-11]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET. Global Abeta burden was quantified using the amyloid load metric (AbetaL). Modeled PiB images were generated from the longitudinal AbetaL data to visualize which regions are most susceptible to Abeta accumulation in DS. AbetaL change was evaluated across Abeta(-), Abeta-converter, and Abeta(+) groups to assess longitudinal Abeta trajectories during different stages of AD-pathology progression. AbetaL change values were used to identify Abeta-accumulators within the Abeta(-) group prior to reaching the Abeta(+) threshold (previously reported as 20 AbetaL) which would have resulted in an Abeta-converter classification. With knowledge of trajectories of Abeta(-) accumulators, a new cutoff of Abeta(+) was derived to better identify subthreshold Abeta accumulation in DS. Estimated sample sizes necessary to detect a 25% reduction in annual Abeta change with 80% power (alpha 0.01) were determined for different groups of Abeta-status. RESULTS: Modeled PiB images revealed the striatum, parietal cortex and precuneus as the regions with earliest detected Abeta accumulation in DS. The Abeta(-) group had a mean AbetaL change of 0.38 (0.58) AbetaL/year, while the Abeta-converter and Abeta(+) groups had change of 2.26 (0.66) and 3.16 (1.34) AbetaL/year, respectively. Within the Abeta(-) group, Abeta-accumulators showed no significant difference in AbetaL change values when compared to Abeta-converter and Abeta(+) groups. An Abeta(+) cutoff for subthreshold Abeta accumulation was derived as 13.3 AbetaL. The estimated sample size necessary to detect a 25% reduction in Abeta was 79 for Abeta(-) accumulators and 59 for the Abeta-converter/Abeta(+) group in DS. CONCLUSION: Longitudinal AbetaL changes were capable of distinguishing Abeta accumulators from non-accumulators in DS. Longitudinal imaging allowed for identification of subthreshold Abeta accumulation in DS during the earliest stages of AD-pathology progression. Detection of active Abeta deposition evidenced by subthreshold accumulation with longitudinal imaging can identify DS individuals at risk for AD development at an earlier stage.
