26948379|a|Increased APP (amyloid precursor protein) processing causes beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it is unclear if it also affects sporadic Abeta accumulation. We tested healthy controls and patients with mild cognitive symptoms (N=331) in the BioFINDER study, using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta40 as a surrogate for amyloidogenic APP processing. We find that levels of brain Abeta fibrils (measured by 18F-flutemetamol PET) are independently associated with high CSF Abeta40 (P<0.001) and APOE e4 (P<0.001). The association between CSF Abeta40 and brain Abeta is stronger in APOE e4-negative than in positive people (P=0.0080). The results are similar for CSF Abeta38 and for a combination of CSF Abeta38 and CSF Abeta40. In conclusion, sporadic Abeta accumulation may be partly associated with increased amyloidogenic APP production, especially in APOE e4-negative subjects. The risk for sporadic AD may consequently depend on increased Abeta production, in addition to decreased Abeta clearance.
