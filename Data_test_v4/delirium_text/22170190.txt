22170190|t|Resources for people with dementia: the Alzheimer Society and beyond.
22170190|a|OBJECTIVE: To summarize services provided by the Alzheimer Society and discuss other supports and resources available for the management of people with dementia. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: Ovid MEDLINE was searched using the terms dementia, Alzheimer disease, community health services utilization, and caregiver stress. MAIN MESSAGE: Early diagnosis of dementia has been shown to be of benefit to patients and caregivers. Referral to the Alzheimer Society can help with nonpharmacologic management of dementia at the time of diagnosis and at any time during the course of the illness. Services include education about dementia, caregiver support, coordination of community services, and a variety of written resources for patients and caregivers. When available, the First Link program can assist with referral by minimizing the need for patients or caregivers to contact their local society branches. Other resources, including respite care and technological approaches to managing wandering, are discussed. CONCLUSION: The Alzheimer Society is an important part of dementia management, and family physicians should always consider referral at the time of diagnosis, regardless of the severity of the condition. First Link, when it is available, can facilitate referral. Resources such as respite care and day programs should be considered when available.
