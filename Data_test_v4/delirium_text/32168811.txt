32168811|t|Separation and Characterization of Phenolamines and Flavonoids from Rape Bee Pollen, and Comparison of Their Antioxidant Activities and Protective Effects Against Oxidative Stress.
32168811|a|Phenolamines and flavonoids are two important components in bee pollen. There are many reports on the bioactivity of flavonoids in bee pollen, but few on phenolamines. This study aims to separate and characterize the flavonoids and phenolamines from rape bee pollen, and compare their antioxidant activities and protective effects against oxidative stress. The rape bee pollen was separated to obtain 35% and 50% fractions, which were characterized by HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS. The results showed that the compounds in 35% fraction were quercetin and kaempferol glycosides, while the compounds in 50% fraction were phenolamines, including di-p-coumaroyl spermidine, p-coumaroyl caffeoyl hydroxyferuloyl spermine, di-p-coumaroyl hydroxyferuloyl spermine, and tri-p-coumaroyl spermidine. The antioxidant activities of phenolamines and flavonoids were evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. It was found that the antioxidant activity of phenolamines was significantly higher than that of flavonoids. Moreover, phenolamines showed better protective effects than flavonoids on HepG2 cells injured by AAPH. Furthermore, phenolamines could significantly reduce the reactive oxygen species (ROS), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, and increase the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) levels. This study lays a foundation for the further understanding of phenolamines in rape bee pollen.
