32977020|t|Functional genomics, genetic risk profiling and cell phenotypes in neurodegenerative disease.
32977020|a|Human genetics provides unbiased insights into the causes of human disease, which can be used to create a foundation for effective ways to more accurately diagnose patients, stratify patients for more successful clinical trials, discover and develop new therapies, and ultimately help patients choose the safest and most promising therapeutic option based on their risk profile. But the process for translating basic observations from human genetics studies into pathogenic disease mechanisms and treatments is laborious and complex, and this challenge has particularly slowed the development of interventions for neurodegenerative disease. In this review, we discuss the many steps in the process, the important considerations at each stage, and some of the latest tools and technologies that are available to help investigators translate insights from human genetics into diagnostic and therapeutic strategies that will lead to the sort of advances in clinical care that make a difference for patients.
