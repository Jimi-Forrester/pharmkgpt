34811845|a|AIM: To synthesise quantitative evidence on factors that impact hospital readmission rates following ACS with comorbidities. DESIGN: Systematic review and narrative synthesis. DATA SOURCES: A search of eight electronic databases, including Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Scopus and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). REVIEW METHODS: The search strategy included keywords and MeSH terms to identify English language studies published between 2001 and 2020. The quality of included studies was assessed by two independent reviewers, using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools. RESULTS: Twenty-four articles were included in the review. All cause 30-day readmission rate was most frequently reported and ranged from 4.2% to 81%. Reported factors that were associated with readmission varied across studies from socio-demographic, behavioural factors, comorbidity factors and cardiac factors. Findings from some of the studies were limited by data source, study designs and small sample size. CONCLUSION: Strategies that integrate comprehensive discharge planning and individualised care planning to enhance behavioural support are related to a reduction in readmission rates. It is recommended that nurses are supported to influence discharge planning and lead the development of nurse-led interventions to ensure discharge planning is both coordinated and person-centred.
