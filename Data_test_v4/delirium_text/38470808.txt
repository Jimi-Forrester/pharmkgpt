38470808|a|In order to maximally reduce the toxicity of fullerenol (the first derivative of C60, FD-C60), and increase its biomedical efficiency, the second derivative SD-C60 (3HFWC, Hyper-Harmonized Hydroxylated Fullerene Water Complex) was created. Several different methods were applied in the comparative characterization of FD-C60 and SD-C60 with the same OH groups in their core. FD-C60 as an individual structure was about 1.3 nm in size, while SD-C60 as an individual structure was 10-30 nm in size. Based on ten physicochemical methods and techniques, FD-C60 and SD-C60 were found to be two different substances in terms of size, structure, and physicochemical properties; FD-C60, at 100  C, had endothermic characteristics, while SD-C60, at 133  C, had exothermic characteristics; FD-C60 did not have water layers, while SD-C60 had water layers; the zeta potential of FD-C60 was -25.85 mV, while it was -43.29 mV for SD-C60. SD-C60 is a promising substance for use in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.
