25750501|t|Synthesis of quinoline/naphthalene-containing azaphenothiazines and their potent in vitro antioxidant properties.
25750501|a|New tetracyclic and pentacyclic azaphenothiazines containing one or two quinoline rings instead of benzene rings were obtained in the original reactions of isomeric diquinodithiins, dichlorodiquinolinyl sulfides, and disulfide with aromatic amines. The type of ring fusion in the azaphenothiazine system was concluded from the 1H NMR spectra. The obtained azaphenothiazines were evaluated in vitro for their antioxidant activity on rat hepatic microsomal membranes for protection of non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation promoted by the Fe2+/ascorbic acid redox system. Most compounds exhibited a very significant antioxidant activity with IC50 values between 1 and 23 muM. The degree of antioxidant activity depends on the lipophilicity and molecular size as well as the (non)substitution of the thiazine nitrogen atom and type of ring system fusion. It is the first time to our knowledge that azaphenothiazines are shown to exhibit such potent antioxidant activity.
