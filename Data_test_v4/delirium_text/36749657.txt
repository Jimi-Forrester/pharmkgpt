36749657|t|Supporting families during pediatric critical illness: Opportunities identified in a multicenter, qualitative study.
36749657|a|Critical illness resulting in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission is a profoundly stressful experience for a child and their family. Increasing evidence for emotional and behavioral sequelae post-PICU emphasizes a need to provide better support for families throughout this period of care and recovery. The aim of this qualitative investigation was to identify salient and modifiable aspects of a critical care experience that can be addressed to better support families of critically ill children. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 caregivers of children who survived a PICU admission. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim; themes were identified via thematic analysis. Caregivers were enrolled using convenience sampling from seven tertiary care PICUs in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network. Themes from caregiver interviews were identified within two overarching categories containing three themes each. Advice for future PICU families: (1) Be intentional about caring for your own well-being, (2) speak up, ask questions, and challenge decisions you're not comfortable with, and (3) continue to engage with your child. Characteristics of a satisfactory PICU experience: (1) A caregiver-provider relationship of mutual trust established through clear communication and respectful collaboration, (2) hospital environments that provide physical and social supports to maintain humanity in healthcare, and (3) preparing families for care transitions. Targeted, interdisciplinary approaches to partner with families during critical care may improve their PICU experience and contribute to improved long-term outcomes for PICU survivors.
