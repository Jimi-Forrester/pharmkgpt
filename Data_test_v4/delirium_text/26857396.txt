26857396|t|An Integrated Strategy for Implementation of Dried Blood Spots in Clinical Development Programs.
26857396|a|Dried blood spot (DBS) sample collection has gained increased interest across the pharmaceutical industry as a potential alternative to plasma for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluations. However, regulatory guidelines and examples of late-stage clinical trial applications in the literature are lacking. This paper communicates Merck's strategy for the implementation of DBS exemplified by experience on a late-stage program (MK-8931). In this program, DBS was proposed as the sole matrix for phase 3 studies to decrease logistical burden in an aging target patient population (Alzheimer's disease). In vitro and bioanalytical tests demonstrated initial method feasibility and suitability for further evaluations in the clinic. An in vivo dataset was developed initially in healthy subjects (phase 1 study) and then in patients (phase 2/3 study) to establish a quantitative relationship between the blood and plasma concentrations (bridging dataset) using descriptive and population PK analyses. This allowed for PK conclusions to be seamlessly drawn across the clinical program without impact from the choice of matrix. This integrated information package (in vitro, bioanalytical and clinical) was presented to major regulatory agencies (FDA and EMA) for regulatory input. Based on this package, regulatory concurrence was gained on accepting DBS as the sole matrix in late-stage clinical trials.
