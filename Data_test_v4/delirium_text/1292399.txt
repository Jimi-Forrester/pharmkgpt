1292399|t|Psychiatric disorders associated with burns.
1292399|a|A study was made of burns patients who were referred for psychiatric problems. There were a total of 69 subjects, divided into three groups. The first group comprised thirty-four cases who attempted suicide by burning themselves--there were more women than men, the majority were less than forty years, and Indians were overrepresented. The majority of these were suffering from schizophrenia or a major depressive disorder. The second group of twenty-three patients were those who had a non-psychotic psychological reaction to their burns. The majority were also less than 40 years of age, and the main reactions were anxiety neurosis or reactive depression. The third group of twelve patients were suffering from delirium. All were pyrexic and in eleven, infective agents were cultured. Some of them also had electrolyte abnormalities and two had respiratory burns.
