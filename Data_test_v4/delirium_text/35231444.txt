35231444|t|c-Abl kinase-mediated phosphorylation of gamma-tubulin promotes gamma-tubulin ring complexes assembly and microtubule nucleation.
35231444|a|Cytoskeletal microtubules (MTs) are nucleated from gamma-tubulin ring complexes (gammaTuRCs) located at MT organizing centers (MTOCs), such as the centrosome. However, the exact regulatory mechanism of gammaTuRC assembly is not fully understood. Here, we showed that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl was associated with and phosphorylated gamma-tubulin, the essential component of the gammaTuRC, mainly on the Y443 residue by in vivo (immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation) or in vitro (surface plasmon resonance) detection. We further demonstrated that phosphorylation deficiency significantly impaired gammaTuRC assembly, centrosome construction, and MT nucleation. c-Abl/Arg deletion and gamma-tubulin Y443F mutation resulted in an abnormal morphology and compromised spindle function during mitosis, eventually causing uneven chromosome segregation. Our findings reveal that gammaTuRC assembly and nucleation function are regulated by Abl kinase-mediated gamma-tubulin phosphorylation, revealing a fundamental mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of MT function.
