26061601|t|Synthesis, characterization, and preclinical validation of a PET radiopharmaceutical for interrogating Abeta (beta-amyloid) plaques in Alzheimer's disease.
26061601|a|BACKGROUND: PET radiopharmaceuticals capable of imaging beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque burden in the brain could offer highly valuable diagnostic tools for clinical studies of Alzheimer's disease. To further supplement existing armamentarium of FDA-approved agents as well as those under development, and to correlate multiphoton-imaging data reported earlier, herein, we describe preclinical validation of a PET tracer. METHODS: A novel PET radiopharmaceutical ((18)F-7B) was synthesized and characterized. To assess its affinity for Abeta, binding assays with Abeta1-42 fibrils, Alzheimer's disease (AD) homogenates, and autoradiography studies and their IHC correlations were performed. For assessing its overall pharmacokinetic profiles in general and its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in particular, biodistribution studies in normal mice were performed. Finally, for evaluating potential for (18)F-7B to serve as a targeted Abeta probe, the microPET/CT imaging was performed in age-matched amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) mice and wild-type (WT) counterparts. RESULTS: The radiotracer (18)F-7B shows saturable binding to autopsy-confirmed AD homogenates (K d = 17.7 nM) and Abeta1-42 fibrils (K d = 61 nM). Preliminary autoradiography studies show binding of (18)F-7B to cortical Abeta plaques in autopsy-confirmed AD tissue sections, inhibition of that binding by unlabeled counterpart 7A-indicating specificity, and a good correlation of tracer binding with Abeta immunostaining. The agent indicates high initial penetration into brains (7.23 +- 0.47%ID/g; 5 min) of normal mice, thus indicating a 5-min/120-min brain uptake clearance ratio of 4.7, a benchmark value (>4) consistent with the ability of agents to traverse the BBB to enable PET brain imaging. Additionally, (18)F-7B demonstrates the presence of parental species in human serum. Preliminary microPET/CT imaging demonstrates significantly higher retention of (18)F-7B in brains of transgenic mice compared with their WT counterparts, consistent with expected binding of the radiotracer to Abeta plaques, present in APP/PS1 mice, compared with their age-matched WT counterparts lacking those Abeta aggregates. CONCLUSIONS: These data offer a platform scaffold conducive to further optimization for developing new PET tracers to study Abeta pathophysiology in vitro and in vivo.
