31305436|a|BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to depression has been considered as a risk factor for adverse childhood, while it is accompanied by unknown molecular mechanisms. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and associated biological processes between cord blood samples from neonates born to mothers who exposed to major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy mothers. METHODS: The microarray data GSE114852 were downloaded to analyze the mRNA expression profiles of umbilical cord blood with 31 samples exposed to prenatal MDD and 62 samples with healthy mothers. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway and Gene ontology enrichment analyses were conducted to identify associated biochemical pathways and functional categories of the DEGs. The protein-protein interaction network was constructed and the top 10 hub genes in the network were predicted. RESULTS: The results showed several immunity related processes, such as "phagosome", "Epstein-Barr virus infection", "proteasome", "positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling", "interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway", and "tumor necrosis factor" presented significant differences between two groups. Most of the hub genes (for example PSMD2, PSMD6, PSMB8, PSMB9) were also associated with immune pathways. CONCLUSION: This bioinformatic analysis demonstrated immune-mediated mechanisms might play a fatal role in abnormalities in fetal gene expression profiles caused by prenatal MDD.
