1731777|a|The recent discovery that point mutations in the beta/A4 amyloid precursor protein may be the cause of certain forms of familial Alzheimer's disease provides strong support for the view that a thorough understanding of the metabolism of this protein may elucidate the pathogenesis of most forms of the disease and thus serve as a basis for rational prevention and therapy. Here we show that overexpression of a portion of the amyloid precursor protein molecule produces at least four distinct fragments of the COOH-terminus of amyloid precursor protein, suggesting altered proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein, and that such overexpression is associated with cytotoxicity. The degree of toxicity in the P19 cell culture model (differentiating mouse embryonal carcinoma cells) is shown to be related to the two larger novel COOH-terminal protein fragments (16 and 14 kilodalton), as well as to levels of expression of these two fragments. The toxicity is manifested in several differentiated cell lineages, including neuronal cells.
