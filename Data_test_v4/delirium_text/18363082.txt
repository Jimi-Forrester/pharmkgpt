18363082|t|Entangled Matters--Alzheimer's, interiority, and the 'unflattening' of the world.
18363082|a|When, in the 1980s, Alzheimer's disease became a disease of major public concern, 'personhood' also became an important, related topic of discussion. Those in caring professions (psychology, social work, etc.) and caregiver groups advocated for the 'person within' who was getting lost in a forgetful body and in a reductionist biomedical system. This essay aims to critically approach the dualism of this kind of argument by focusing on the moral positioning of claims such as personhood or biomedical reductionism.
