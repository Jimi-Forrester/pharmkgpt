39566583|t|Scopolamine animal model of memory impairment.
39566583|a|In this study, we reassessed the suitability of one the most commonly used pharmacological animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) - scopolamine-induced memory impairment. The goal of the study was to explore if this animal model induces other behavioral changes associated with AD. One of the key behavioral features of AD, manifesting already during the early stages of the illness, is apathy-like behavior. We also evaluated how behavioral alterations induced by scopolamine compare to those seen in healthy aging animals. To achieve these goals, locomotor activity and short-term memory of young male Wistar rats were tested in the open field, novel object recognition (NOR) and T-maze spontaneous alternation tests before, during and after 21 daily administrations of scopolamine. Three-, ten- and nineteen-month-old male and female rats were used to measure age-related changes in these behaviors. Our data showed that although both scopolamine treatment and aging reduced the number of approaches to the objects and their exploration time during the NOR test, correlation with impaired object recognition memory was only observed in the scopolamine treated animals. Furthermore, treatment with scopolamine significantly increased the locomotor activity, which could be observed even one week after treatment discontinuation. Contrary, locomotor activity in older rats was significantly lower than that of younger rats. These findings demonstrate that the animal model of scopolamine-induced memory impairment fails to incorporate apathy-like symptoms characteristic to the AD and age-related reduction in physical activity of older rats.
