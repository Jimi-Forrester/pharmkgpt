35086758|t|Incidence and risk factors associated with hospital-acquired pressure ulcers following total hip arthroplasty: A retrospective nationwide inpatient sample database study.
35086758|a|AIM: To examine the incidence and risk factors associated with hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs) following total hip arthroplasty (THA) using a large-scale national database. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective database analysis was performed based on Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2005 to 2014. Patients who underwent THA were included. Patient demographics, hospital characteristics, length of stay (LOS), total charges during hospitalization, in-hospital mortality, preoperative comorbidities, and perioperative complications were assessed. RESULTS: The general incidence of HAPUs after THA was 0.05%, with a fluctuating trend annually. Patients suffered from HAPUs were older, less likely through elective admission, more likely in large hospital, more usage of Medicare, and less possibly paying via Private insurance. Additionally, the occurrence of HAPUs was associated with more preoperative comorbidities, longer LOS, extra total charges, and higher in-hospital mortality. Risk factors associated with HAPUs included advanced age (>=75 years), large hospital, multiple comorbidities (n >= 3), diabetes with chronic complications, drug abuse, liver disease, fluid and electrolyte disorders, metastatic cancer, peripheral vascular disorders, psychoses, chronic renal failure, peptic ulcer disease, and weight loss. Besides, HAPUs were associated with inflammatory arthritis and femoral neck fracture (compared with primary/secondary osteoarthritis), frailty/senility, osteoporosis, acute renal failure, pneumonia, postoperative delirium, urinary tract infection, deep vein thrombosis, sepsis/septicemia, wound dehiscence/non-healing surgical wound, periprosthetic joint infection, and mechanical prosthesis-related complications. CONCLUSION: It is beneficial to study the risk factors associated with HAPUs after THA to ensure the preventive management and optimize outcomes although a low incidence was identified.
