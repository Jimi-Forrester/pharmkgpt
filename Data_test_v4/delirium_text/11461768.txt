11461768|a|Some catecholamines and indolamines inhibit lipid peroxidation. Recent studies indicate that catecholaminergic inhibition of lipid peroxidation may be receptor mediated in vivo and in cell cultures. Because oxidative stress is one of the hypothesized pathogenic mechanisms for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), we hypothesized that catecholaminergic and indolaminergic inhibition of lipid peroxidation would be altered in AD as compared to age-matched non-AD. To test this hypothesis we studied the effect of a variety of neurotransmitters and their antagonists on ascorbate-stimulated lipid peroxidation in membrane fragment preparations derived from postmortem human brain. In this in vitro system, the inhibition of lipid peroxidation by dopamine and serotonin did not appear to be receptor mediated. Further, our findings indicate that there is no apparent effect of age or AD on the inhibition of lipid peroxidation by catecholaminergic and indolaminergic agents.
