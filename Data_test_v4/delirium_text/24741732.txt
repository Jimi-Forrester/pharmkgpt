24741732|t|Positron Emission Tomography in Neurology and Cardiology: A Review of Guidelines and Recommendations
24741732|a|Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, since the introduction of the concept of emission and transmission tomography in 1950, has been a major part of nuclear medicine and has proved to be a valuable non-invasive tool in the diagnosis and management of various disorders in many fields, from clinical oncology to neurology, from musculo-skeletal imaging to cardiology. PET has been used with success for the evaluation of neurological disorders such as cognitive function in Alzheimer s disease and diagnosis of brain tumours. PET also has shown its significant roles in the detection and prognosis of various cardiac disorders such as coronary artery disease (CAD), cardiac sarcoidosis, as well as in the assessment of myocardial perfusion and viability. This Rapid Response report aims to review the guidelines and recommendations associated with the use of PET in neurology and cardiology.
