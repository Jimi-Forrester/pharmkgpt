7888465|t|Hypoxaemia in the general surgical ward--a potential risk factor?
7888465|a|After major operations, hypoxaemia is common in the late postoperative period in the surgical ward. Recent studies of humans after major operations showed that such hypoxaemia may be related to the development of myocardial ischaemia and cardiac arrhythmias, even in patients with no preoperative signs or symptoms of coronary artery disease. Experimental studies have shown an adverse effect of tissue hypoxia on wound healing and on resistance to bacterial wound infections. Finally, mental confusion and surgical delirium may be related to inadequate arterial oxygenation during the late postoperative period. Hypoxaemia may therefore prove to be a risk factor in the late postoperative period, and further studies are needed to clarify its pathogenesis and rational treatment.
