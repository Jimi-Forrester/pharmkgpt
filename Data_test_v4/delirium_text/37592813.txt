37592813|a|INTRODUCTION: Research-oriented autopsy cohorts provide critical insights into dementia pathobiology. However, different studies sometimes report disparate findings, partially because each study has its own recruitment biases. We hypothesized that a straightforward metric, related to the percentage of research volunteers cognitively normal at recruitment, would predict other inter-cohort differences. METHODS: The National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) provided data on N = 7178 autopsied participants from 28 individual research centers. Research cohorts were grouped based on the proportion of participants with normal cognition at initial clinical visit. RESULTS: Cohorts with more participants who were cognitively normal at recruitment contained more individuals who were older, female, had lower frequencies of apolipoprotein E epsilon4, Lewy body disease, and frontotemporal dementia, but higher rates of cerebrovascular disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology was little different between groups. DISCUSSION: The percentage of participants recruited while cognitively normal predicted differences in findings in autopsy research cohorts. Most differences were in non-AD pathologies. HIGHLIGHTS: Systematic differences exist between autopsy cohorts that serve dementia research. We propose a metric to use for gauging a research-oriented autopsy cohort. It is essential to consider the characteristics of autopsy cohorts.
