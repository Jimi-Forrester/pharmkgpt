33410377|a|Accumulating data manifest that long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) are involved in all kinds of neurodegenerative disorders, consisting of the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study was for the research of the mechanism of lncRNA H19 (H19) in viability and apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by Abeta25-35 in a cellular model of AD with the regulation of microRNA (miR)-129 and high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1). An AD cellular model of PC12 cells was established using Abeta25-35. The Abeta25-35-induced PC12 cells were transfected with si-H19 or miR-129 mimic to figure their roles in cell viability,apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential dysfunction and oxidative stress in AD. Luciferase reporter assay and RNA-pull down assay were employed for verification of the binding relationship between H19 and miR-129 and the targeting relationship between miR-129 and HMGB1. An AD mouse model was induced and brain tissues were collected. H19, miR-129 and HMGB1 were detected in Abeta25-35-treated cells and brain tissues of AD mice. Elevated H19, HMGB1 and decreased miR-129 were found in Abeta25-35-treated PC12 cells as well as in brain tissues of AD mice. Silenced H19 or elevated miR-129 promoted viability, inhibited apoptosis, prevented mitochondrial membrane potential dysfunction and decreased oxidative stress in Abeta25-35-treated PC12 cells. H19 could specifically bind to miR-129. MiR-129 specifically suppressed HMGB1 expression. This study suggests that silenced H19 and up-regulated miR-129 accelerates viability and represses apoptosis of PC12 cells stimulated by Abeta25-35 in AD, which is beneficial for AD treatment.
