24165705|t|Photodegradation of beta-sheet amyloid fibrils associated with Alzheimer's disease by using polyoxometalates as photocatalysts.
24165705|a|Herein we report that POMs can not only inhibit Abeta aggregation but also photodegrade Abeta, especially the oligomers, showing enhanced inhibition effects.
