34410583|a|Microvascular procedures require visual magnification of the surgical field, e.g. by a microscope. This can be accompanied by an unergonomic posture with musculoskeletal pain or long-term degenerative changes as the eye is bound to the ocular throughout the whole procedure. The presented study describes the advantages and drawbacks of a 3D exoscope camera system. The RoboticScope -system (BHS Technologies , Innsbruck, Austria) features a high-resolution 3D-camera that is placed over the surgical field and a head-mounted-display (HMD) that the camera pictures are transferred to. A motion sensor in the HMD allows for hands-free change of the exoscope position via head movements. For general evaluation of the system functions coronary artery anastomoses of ex-vivo pig hearts were performed. Second, the system was evaluated for anastomosis of a radial-forearm-free-flap in a clinical setting/in vivo. The system positioning was possible entirely hands-free using head movements. Camera control was intuitive; visualization of the operation site was adequate and independent from head or body position. Besides technical instructions of the providing company, there was no special surgical training of the surgeons or involved staff upfront performing the procedures necessary. An ergonomic assessment questionnaire showed a favorable ergonomic position in comparison to surgery with a microscope. The outcome of the operated patient was good. There were no intra- or postoperative complications. The exoscope facilitates a change of head and body position without losing focus of the operation site and an ergonomic working position. Repeated applications have to clarify if the system benefits in clinical routine.
