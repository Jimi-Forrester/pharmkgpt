17926230|a|SUBJECT: Pilot study on an early-interventional group therapy for patients with incipient Alzheimer disease and their relatives. The present study investigates whether scientific progress in terms of earlier time of diagnostic certainty can be used for psychoeducation, maintenance of positive activities and prevention of comorbid depressive episodes. METHODS: 12 patients (66.8 +/- 5.8 years, MMSE 24.0 +/- 4.0) together with 12 relatives have been treated with a bi-weekly group therapy program. RESULTS: For the patients treatment resulted in reduced anxiety, anergia and withdrawal, for their relatives reduced sleep disturbances, irascibility, and aggressiveness have been found. Only one of the patients suffered from a depressive episode. All participants expressed positive feedback and a high level of quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: By the straightforward psychosocial intervention it seems possible to use the earlier time of diagnostic certainty for early diagnosed patients suffering from incipient Alzheimer disease. However, results have to be replicated by a controlled, prospective study with larger sample sizes.
