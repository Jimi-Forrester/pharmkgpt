9672379|a|Levels of soluble amyloid beta protein (sAbeta), amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) and apolipoprotein E (apoE) were examined in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained twice, at baseline and after 3-year follow-up, from 25 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Levels of sAbeta and apoE from patients with the apoE4 allele decreased with time, whereas the levels were similar in patients without apoE4 allele. Changes of sAbeta and apoE concentrations correlated significantly with those of mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores. Levels of sAbeta did not change with time in patients with mild dementia, whereas they decreased significantly in patients with moderate dementia. ApoE concentrations decreased in both groups whereas APP levels were similar. We conclude that measurements of CSF sAbeta and apoE levels may be helpful in monitoring progression of the disease.
