39483494|a|Amyloid-beta oligomers are a cytotoxic structure that is key for the establishment of the beginning stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These structures promote subcellular alterations that cause synaptic dysfunction, loss of cell communication, and even cell death, generating cognitive deficits. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of amyloid-beta1-42 oligomers (AbetaOs) on the membranous organelles involved in protein processing: the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (GA). The results obtained with 10 muM AbetaOs in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells showed that oligomeric structures are more toxic than monomers because they cause cell viability to decrease as exposure time increases. Survivor cells were analyzed to further understand the toxic effects of AbetaOs on intracellular organelles. Survivor cells showed morphological alterations associated with abnormal cytoskeleton modification 72-96 h after exposure to AbetaOs. Moreover, the ER and GA presented rearrangement throughout the cytoplasmic space, which could be attributed to a lack of constitutive protein processing or to previous abnormal cytoskeleton modification. Interestingly, the disorganization of both ER and GA organelles exposed to AbetaOs is likely an early pathological alteration that could be related to aberrant protein processing and accumulation in AD.
