9187213|t|Movement disorders associated with withdrawal from high-dose intravenous haloperidol therapy in delirious ICU patients.
9187213|a|Intravenous haloperidol is recommended as the drug of choice to treat delirium in ICU patients. Movement disorders and other adverse events commonly occur with oral haloperidol use but are rarely seen with IV haloperidol use, and withdrawal symptoms have not been reported with short-term ICU use. We describe self-limited dyskinesia during withdrawal of high-dose continuous IV haloperidol therapy in five ICU patients.
