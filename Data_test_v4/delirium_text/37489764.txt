37489764|a|INTRODUCTION: As the chemokine receptor5 (CCR5) may play a role in ischemia, we studied the links between CCR5 deficiency, the sensitivity of neurons to oxidative stress, and the development of dementia. METHODS: Logistic regression models with CCR5/apolipoprotein E (ApoE) polymorphisms were applied on a sample of 205 cognitively normal individuals and 189 dementia patients from Geneva. The impact of oxidative stress on Ccr5 expression and cell death was assessed in mice neurons. RESULTS: CCR5-Delta32 allele synergized with ApoEepsilon4 as risk factor for dementia and specifically for dementia with a vascular component. We confirmed these results in an independent cohort from Italy (157 cognitively normal and 620 dementia). Carriers of the ApoEepsilon4/CCR5-Delta32 genotype aged >=80 years have an 11-fold greater risk of vascular-and-mixed dementia. Oxidative stress-induced cell death in Ccr5-/- mice neurons. DISCUSSION: We propose the vulnerability of CCR5-deficient neurons in response to oxidative stress as possible mechanisms contributing to dementia.
