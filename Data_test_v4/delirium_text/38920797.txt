38920797|t|Association between COVID-19 and the Risk of Vascular Dementia: A Mendelian Randomisation Study of the Potential Cognitive Sequela of COVID-19.
38920797|a|A growing body of observational studies and Mendelian Randomisation analyses suggest an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia following COVID-19 infection. However, evidence on the potential association between COVID-19 and vascular dementia, which is plausible given the vascular complications of COVID-19 infection, is still limited. In this study, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian Randomisation analysis to examine the potential causal relationship between COVID-19 phenotypes and the risk of vascular dementia, using summary data from large-scale GWASs. The two-sample Mendelian Randomisation analysis did not detect any significant associations of COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 hospitalisation, or critical COVID-19 with the risk of vascular dementia, with weighted average beta values of -0.29 (95% CI: -0.84, 0.26; p = 0.301), -0.12 (95% CI: -0.36, 0.13; p = 0.345), and -0.07 (95% CI: -0.23, 0.09; p = 0.374), respectively. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that vascular dementia is one of the long-term sequelae of COVID-19.
