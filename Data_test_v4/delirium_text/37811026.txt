37811026|t|Dexmedetomidine as a myocardial protector in pediatric heart surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass: a systematic review.
37811026|a|Background: In recent years, dexmedetomidine has been studied as a cardioprotective agent. However, studies on its application in pediatric heart surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) remain limited. This systematic review aimed to provide information on the cardioprotective effect of dexmedetomidine in children undergoing heart surgery using CPB. Methods: The authors searched several databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, etc.) to identify all trials comparing the levels of myocardial injury via biomarkers, including pediatric patients undergoing heart surgery using CPB who received dexmedetomidine versus placebo or other anesthetic agents. Literatures from non-primary studies were excluded. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility and extracted data. The Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool was implemented to evaluate any potential biases. Information from eligible studies was summarized and correspondingly reviewed based on any quantitative outcomes. Results: We identified six trials composed of 419 participants, three of which (n=241) showed significantly reduced interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the dexmedetomidine group, while one study (n=40) showed no IL-6 difference between groups. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and creatinine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), as myocardial injury biomarkers, were found to be lower in two trials (n=180). Despite several limitations hindering this review from pooling the data objectively, the majority of published studies indicated that dexmedetomidine is a seemingly efficacious agent protecting against cardiac injury during bypass. Conclusions: These studies suggest that dexmedetomidine has cardioprotective effects through the lowering of cardiac injury biomarkers while improving its clinical outcomes after heart surgery using bypass.
