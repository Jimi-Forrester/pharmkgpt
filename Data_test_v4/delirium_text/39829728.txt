39829728|t|Role of Quetiapine in the Prevention of ICU Delirium in Elderly Patients at a High Risk.
39829728|a|Background: The aim of the present study was to denote the effectiveness of Quetiapine as additive to preventive bundle of delirium in elderly patients with multiple risks for delirium. Patients and methods: The study was performed on 90 elderly patients over 60 years. The patients were divided into Group Q (Quetiapine) and Group C (No Quetiapine). Delirium was assessed using Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). Results: The incidence of delirium was significantly higher in group C. The severity of delirium was higher among group C; however, it was not statistically significant. The dominant type of delirium was hypoactive in group Q whereas hyperactive in group C. The interrater reliability between CAM-ICU-7 and ICDSE showed a kappa 0.98 denoting excellent correlation between the two scores. Somnolence was the most common side effect of Quetiapine (25%) followed by dry mouth (18%). Conclusions: Prophylactic low dose of Quetiapine in elderly population in the preventive bundle could reduce the incidence of delirium with a low incidence of a major side effect, as well as CAM-ICU-7 is as effective as ICDSC in monitoring and early diagnosis of delirium.
