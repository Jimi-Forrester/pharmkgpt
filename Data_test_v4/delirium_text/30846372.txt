30846372|t|Trajectory of Physical Functioning Among Persons Living With HIV in Nursing Homes.
30846372|a|OBJECTIVE(S): To examine the change in physical functional status among persons living with HIV (PLWH) in nursing homes (NHs) and how change varies with age and dementia. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: NHs in 14 states in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: PLWH who were admitted to NHs between 2001 and 2010 and had stays of >=90 days (N = 3550). MEASUREMENTS: We linked Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) and Minimum Data Set (MDS) data for NH residents in the sampled states and years and used them to determine HIV infection. The main outcome was improvement in physical functional status, defined as a decrease of at least 4 points in the activities of daily living (ADL) score within 90 days of NH admission. Independent variables of interest were age and dementia (Alzheimer's disease or other dementia). Multivariate logistic regression was used, adjusting for individual-level covariates. RESULTS: The average age on NH admission of PLWH was 58. Dementia prevalence ranged from 14.5% in the youngest age group (age <40 years) to 38.9% in the oldest group (age >=70 years). Overall, 44% of the PLWH experienced ADL improvement in NHs. Controlling for covariates, dementia was related to a significantly lower likelihood of ADL improvement among PLWH in the oldest age group only: the adjusted probability of improvement was 40.6% among those without dementia and 29.3% among those with dementia (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS/RELEVANCE: PLWH, especially younger persons, may be able to improve their ADL function after being admitted into NHs. However, with older age, PLWH with dementia are more physically dependent and vulnerable to deterioration of physical functioning in NHs. More and/or specialized care may be needed to maintain physical functioning among this population. Findings from this study provide NHs with information on care needs of PLWH and inform future research on developing interventions to improve care for PLWH in NHs.
