36381936|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) pose increased morbidity and mortality, especially to elderly patients. The effect of anesthesia is debatable. The databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched from inception until 24 February 2022 to identify randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) studying the effect of depth of anesthesia on POD and POCD primarily. Data on length of hospital stay and mortality were also extracted. Trial sequential analysis was also performed. Seventeen studies were eligible for systematic review and 15 studies of 5392 patients were eligible for meta-analysis. High bispectral index (BIS) favored a reduction in POD and POCD at three months. We found no significant difference between High BIS and Low BIS for mini-mental state exam (MMSE) score and POCD on day 7. However, this did not translate to a significant difference in length of stay and mortality. The data was also underpowered and heterogeneous. Future RCTs should focus on high-risk patients. A standardized methodology of reporting postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction is needed to improve comparisons across trials.
