35601322|t|Understanding the Link between Inflammasome and Apoptosis through the Response of THP-1 Cells against Drugs Using Droplet-Based Microfluidics.
35601322|a|Droplet-based microfluidic devices are used to investigate monocytic THP-1 cells in response to drug administration. Consistent and reproducible droplets are created, each of which acts as a bioreactor to carry out single cell experiments with minimized contamination and live cell tracking under an inverted fluorescence microscope for more than 2 days. Here, the effects of three different drugs (temsirolimus, rifabutin, and BAY 11-7082) on THP-1 are examined and the results are analyzed in the context of the inflammasome and apoptosis relationship. The ASC adaptor gene tagged with GFP is monitored as the inflammasome reporter. Thus, a systematic way is presented for deciphering cell-to-cell heterogeneity, which is an important issue in cancer treatment. The drug temsirolimus, which has effects of disrupting the mTOR pathway and triggering apoptosis in tumor cells, causes THP-1 cells to express ASC and to be involved in apoptosis. Treatment with rifabutin, which inhibits proliferation and initiates apoptosis in cells, affects ASC expression by first increasing and then decreasing it. CASP-3, which has a role in apoptosis and is directly related to ASC, has an increasing level in inflammasome conditioning. Thus, the cell under the effect of rifabutin might be faced with programmed cell death faster. The drug BAY 11-7082, which is responsible for NFkappaB inhibition, shows similar results to temsirolimus with more than 60% of cells having high fluorescence intensity (ASC expression). The microfluidic platform presented here offers strong potential for studying newly developed small-molecule inhibitors for personalized/precision medicine.
