9307585|t|Behavioral complications and their treatment in Alzheimer's disease.
9307585|a|Agitation, psychotic features, and depression are common behavioral complications seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Agitation tends to be common and persistent in these patients, while psychotic features are less common and moderately persistent over time. Depressed mood with vegetative signs is uncommon and usually does not persist. The limited data available from controlled trials suggest that neuroleptics should be the first choice for the treatment of psychotic features and agitation. Anticonvulsants like valproate and benzodiazepines can be used to treat agitation in the absence of psychotic features. Trazodone and zolpidem are effective hypnotics, and buspirone may treat anxiety. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be the first choice for persistent depressed mood. Low doses of psychotropic medication are indicated, particularly for neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. Specific target symptoms and potential side effects should be identified and monitored during treatment. Drug interactions can be a problem, and the use of multiple psychotropic medications is discouraged because of the potential for neurologic toxicity. To avoid long-term side effects and unnecessary treatment for symptoms that may be transient, periodic attempts should be made to taper or discontinue the psychotropic medication.
