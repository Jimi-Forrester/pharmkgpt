24783278|t|Update search on report A05-19A (Cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease): Executive summary of rapid report A09-03, Version 1.0
24783278|a|In February 2007 the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) produced a final report on  Cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease  (commission A05-19A). This final report represented the first in the series on the topic of  Alzheimer's disease . When the fourth and last assessment (commission A05-19C:  Memantine in Alzheimer's disease ) was completed, the literature search for the final report A05-19A was already 3 years old. The Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) therefore commissioned IQWiG to determine whether substantive new evidence on cholinesterase inhibitors had been published since then that could decisively change the conclusions of that report so that a new assessment of cholinesterase inhibitors would be desirable.
