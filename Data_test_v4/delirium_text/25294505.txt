25294505|a|Traditionally, haloperidol has been the recommended antipsychotic drug for pharmacological treatment of delirium, which is a frequent complication in the critical care setting. Due to a less frequent occurrence of extrapyramidal adverse effects, second-generation antipsychotic drugs have been evaluated. In the present paper we review the current randomized prospective studies of second-generation antipsychotics as treatment for delirium in hospitalized patients and conclude that so far the evidence in favour of these drugs compared with haloperidol is still sparse.
