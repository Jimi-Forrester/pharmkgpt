32211805|a|The aims of the present study are to investigate the role of hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-like 2 (HSDL2) in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma and illuminate the underlying molecular mechanisms. ShRNA targeting HSDL2 gene (siHSDL2) was utilized to knockdown (KD) HSDL2 expression. In vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of siHSDL2 on the progression of lung adenocarcinoma. Microarray hybridization and gene expression analysis were used to investigate effect of siHSDL2 on mRNA expression profile in lung cancer cell line H1299. Our data demonstrated that HSDL2 was up-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma tissue samples (P<0.001). Patients with high HSDL2 expression in cancer tissues had a worse overall survival (P<0.001). HSDL2 KD not only inhibited the proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, clone-formation, invasion and migration of lung adenocarcinoma cells in vitro (P<0.05), but also suppressed the growth and metastasis in vivo (P<0.05). HSDL2 KD resulted in up-regulation of 681 genes and down-regulation of 276 genes. HSDL2 KD down-regulated the protein expression and phosphorylation of protein kinase B beta (AKT2) (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively) and protein expression of baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 3 (BIRC3; P=0.001), and up-regulated the phosphorylation of ERK (P<0.001). Rescue experiments showed that AKT2 overexpression reversed the suppression effect of siHSDL2 on cell proliferation (P<0.001), invasion (P<0.001) and migration (P<0.001) significantly. HSDL2 functions as an oncogene to promote the growth and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma via promoting the expression of AKT2.
