35890350|t|Fiscalin Derivatives as Potential Neuroprotective Agents.
35890350|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) share common molecular/cellular mechanisms that contribute to their progression and pathogenesis. In this sense, we are here proposing new neuroprotection strategies by using marine-derived compounds as fiscalins. This work aims to evaluate the protective effects of fiscalin derivatives towards 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)- and iron (III)-induced cytotoxicity in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, an in vitro disease model to study ND; and on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transport activity, an efflux pump of drugs and neurotoxins. SH-SY5Y cells were simultaneously exposed to MPP+ or iron (III), and noncytotoxic concentrations of 18 fiscalin derivatives (0-25 muM), being the cytotoxic effect of both MPP+ and iron (III) evaluated 24 and 48 h after exposure. Fiscalins 1a and 1b showed a significant protective effect against MPP+-induced cytotoxicity and fiscalins 1b, 2b, 4 and 5 showed a protective effect against iron (III)-induced cytotoxicity. Fiscalins 4 and 5 caused a significant P-gp inhibition, while fiscalins 1c, 2a, 2b, 6 and 11 caused a modest increase in P-gp transport activity, thus suggesting a promising source of new P-gp inhibitors and activators, respectively. The obtained results highlight fiscalins with promising neuroprotective effects and with relevance for the synthesis of new derivatives for the treatment/prevention of ND.
