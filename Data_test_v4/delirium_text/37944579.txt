37944579|a|Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta induces apoptosis, and gasdermin-E (GSDME) expression can switch apoptosis to pyroptosis. In this study, we demonstrated that GSDME was highly expressed in the hippocampus of APP23/PS45 mouse models compared to that in age-matched wild-type mice. Abeta treatment induced pyroptosis by active caspase-3/GSDME in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of GSDME improved the cognitive impairments of APP23/PS45 mice by alleviating inflammatory response. Our findings reveal that GSDME, as a modulator of Abeta and pyroptosis, plays a potential role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and shows that GSDME is a therapeutic target for AD.
