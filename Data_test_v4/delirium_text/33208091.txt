33208091|a|BACKGROUND: Although many studies have reported numerous risk factors for postoperative delirium, data are scarce about preoperative anxiety as a risk factor. The study aimed to investigate the association between preoperative anxiety and postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: Secondary data analysis of a randomized, observer-blind, controlled trial. A total of 190 patients 65 years or older and admitted to the intensive care unit and cardiac surgery unit of a university hospital scheduled for elective on-pump cardiac surgery were included. State anxiety was measured preoperatively using the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale and the Visual Analogue Scale for anxiety. Incidence of delirium was measured during the first 5 postoperative days using the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit (when ventilated), or the 3 Minute Diagnostic Interview for Confusion Assessment Method (when extubated) and by daily chart review. RESULTS: Preoperative state anxiety was reported by 31% of the patients and 41% had postoperative delirium. A multiple step logistic regression analyses revealed no association between preoperative anxiety and postoperative delirium. Significant risk factors for postoperative delirium were age (OR = 1.10, 95% CI (1.03-1.18)), activities of daily living (0.69, 95% CI (0.50-0.96)), diabetes mellitus (OR = 3.15, 95% CI (1.42-7.00)) and time on cardiopulmonary bypass (OR = 1.01, 95% CI (1.00 to 1.02)). CONCLUSIONS: No relationship could be found between preoperative anxiety and postoperative delirium.
