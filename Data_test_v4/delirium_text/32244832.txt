32244832|a|The treatment options for a patient diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are currently limited. The cerebral accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a critical molecular event in the pathogenesis of AD. When the amyloidogenic beta-secretase (BACE1) is inhibited, the production of Abeta peptide is reduced. Henceforth, the main goal of this study is the discovery of new small bioactive molecules that potentially reach the brain and inhibit BACE1. The work was conducted by a customized molecular modelling protocol, including pharmacophore-based and molecular docking-based virtual screening (VS). Structure-based (SB) and ligand-based (LB) pharmacophore models were designed to accurately screen several drug-like compound databases. The retrieved hits were subjected to molecular docking and in silico filtered to predict their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Additionally, 34 high-scoring compounds structurally distinct from known BACE1 inhibitors were selected for in vitro screening assay, which resulted in 13 novel hit-compounds for this relevant therapeutic target. This study disclosed new BACE1 inhibitors, proving the utility of combining computational and in vitro approaches for effectively predicting anti-BACE1 agents in the early drug discovery process.
