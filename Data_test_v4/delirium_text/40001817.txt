40001817|t|Exploring Cognitive Stimulation as a Therapy for the Prevention of Delirium in a Hospital Setting: A Narrative Review.
40001817|a|Delirium is a highly prevalent and costly neuropsychiatric condition that affects up to 87% of critically ill hospitalized patients. It impacts various cognitive domains, including attention, memory, perception, and motor functions, with symptoms such as behavioral changes, hallucinations, slurred speech, visual impairments, and fatigue. Non-pharmacological interventions have been shown to reduce the incidence and duration of delirium, with strategies like reality orientation, cognitive stimulation, family support, and physical support. However, the scalability of these interventions in hospital settings is limited by resource constraints, low patient engagement, and the complexity of delivery. Digital technology-based cognitive stimulation offers a potential solution to these barriers, though evidence supporting its effectiveness is currently insufficient. This narrative literature review explores both traditional and novel digital technology-based cognitive stimulation techniques for the prevention and management of delirium in acute hospital settings.
