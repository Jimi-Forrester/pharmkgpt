38321775|t|Sensorineural hearing loss as an atypical presentation of typhoid fever: A case report.
38321775|a|Typhoid fever, also known as enteric fever, is a multisystemic infection primarily caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, and less commonly by Salmonella enterica serotypes Paratyphi A, B, and C. The classic presentation includes fever, malaise, diffuse abdominal pain, and constipation. If left untreated, typhoid fever can progress to delirium, obtundation, intestinal haemorrhage, bowel perforation, and death within a month of onset. However, the clinical course can deviate from the classic stepladder fever pattern, which now occurs in as few as 12% of cases.1 In this report, we describe an atypical presentation as sensorineural hearing loss in an otherwise healthy young male.
