27886407|a|BACKGROUND: alpha-Synuclein is a major component of pathologic inclusions that characterize Parkinson's disease. PRX002 is an antibody that targets alpha-synuclein, and its murine parent antibody 9E4 has been shown in preclinical studies to reduce alpha-synuclein pathology and to protect against cognitive and motor deteriorations and progressive neurodegeneration in human alpha-synuclein transgenic mice. METHODS: This first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 study assessed the impact of PRX002 administered to 40 healthy participants in 5 ascending-dose cohorts (n = 8/cohort) in which participants were randomly assigned to receive a single intravenous infusion of study drug (0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg; n = 6/cohort) or placebo (n = 2/cohort). RESULTS: PRX002 demonstrated favorable safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profiles at all doses tested, with no immunogenicity. No serious adverse events, discontinuations as a result of adverse events, or dose-limiting toxicities were reported. Serum PRX002 exposure was dose proportional; the average terminal half-life across all doses was 18.2 days. A significant dose-dependent reduction in free serum alpha-synuclein (unbound to PRX002) was apparent within 1 hour after PRX002 administration, whereas total alpha-synuclein (free plus bound) increased dose-dependently, presumably because of the expected change in kinetics following antibody binding. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that serum alpha-synuclein can be safely modulated in a dose-dependent manner after single intravenous infusions of an anti-alpha-synuclein antibody. These findings support continued development of PRX002, including further characterization of its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects in the central nervous system in patients with Parkinson's disease.   2016 The Authors.
