26065065|a|It has been proposed that the tremendous burden of Alzheimer s disease (AD) could be reduced by improved diagnosis. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has received a request for a national coverage decision on the use of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for the diagnosis and management of Medicare beneficiaries with suspected AD and other dementias linked to old age. CMS referred the request to the Medicare Coverage Advisory Committee (MCAC) and asked the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to review the existing scientific evidence with regard to the demonstrated and potential role of PET in reducing the burden of disease for individuals with possible AD. The Duke Evidence-based Practice Center has been commissioned by AHRQ to produce this report in support of the deliberations of the MCAC Diagnostic Imaging panel.
