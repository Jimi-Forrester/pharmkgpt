31138761|a|Purpose: To determine if aqueous humour (AH) concentrations of Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE)'s biomarkers are modified after subthreshold micropulse laser (SMPL) treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME).Methods: Naive DME and healthy subjects were enrolled. All DME patients received SMPL treatments (577-nm yellow light, 5% duty cycle of 0.2 s, power 250 mW), according to study protocol. AH of DME eyes was sampled at baseline and periodically after first SMPL treatment. Control eyes were sampled before cataract surgery. Pigment Epithelium Derived Factor (PEDF) and Erythropoietin (EPO) were quantified with glass-chip protein array.Results: Eighteen DME patients (central retinal thickness <= 400 mum on Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT)) and ten controls were enrolled. The main exclusion criteria were high refractive error, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and neurodegenerative disorders. PEDF concentration was decreased in DME patients at baseline versus controls (P=0.012), while EPO was increased (P=0.029). Both molecules' concentrations remained stable during follow-up after treatments, compared with DME-baseline.Conclusions: The AH concentrations of RPE biomarkers were significantly different in DME treatment-naive eyes versus controls. The expression of PEDF and EPO remained unchanged after treatments with SMPL in DME eyes. These data are relevant for future research and applications of SMPL.
