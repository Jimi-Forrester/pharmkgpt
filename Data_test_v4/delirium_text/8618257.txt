8618257|t|Marijuana and hyperthermia.
8618257|a|BACKGROUND: Animal and human laboratory studies suggest marijuana may cause hyperthermia. However, there are no clinical case reports of life-threatening hyperthermia associated with use of marijuana alone. CASE REPORT: We report a patient who developed severe hyperthermia after smoking a marijuana cigarette and jogging on a warm day. He presented with delirium; hot, red, dry skin; and a rectal temperature of 41.7 degrees C. Historical and laboratory data indicated he had used cannabinoids and no other drugs. This is the first report of life-threatening hyperthermia temporally associated with use of marijuana alone.
