30747419|t|Genetic Risk Factors for Alzheimer Disease: Emerging Roles of Microglia in Disease Pathomechanisms.
30747419|a|The accumulation of aggregated amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain is deeply involved in Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis. Mutations in APP and presenilins play major roles in Abeta pathology in rare autosomal-dominant forms of AD, whereas pathomechanisms of sporadic AD, accounting for the majority of cases, remain unknown. In this chapter, we review current knowledge on genetic risk factors of AD, clarified by recent advances in genome analysis technology. Interestingly, TREM2 and many genes associated with disease risk are predominantly expressed in microglia, suggesting that these risk factors are involved in pathogenicity through common mechanisms involving microglia. Therefore, we focus on factors closely associated with microglia and discuss their possible roles in pathomechanisms of AD. Furthermore, we review current views on the pathological roles of microglia and emphasize the importance of microglial changes in response to Abeta deposition and mechanisms underlying the phenotypic changes. Importantly, functional outcomes of microglial activation can be both protective and deleterious to neurons. We further describe the involvement of microglia in tau pathology and the activation of other glial cells. Through these topics, we shed light on microglia as a promising target for drug development for AD and other neurological disorders.
