36060856|a|Objectives: To determine if there was excess mortality in Alberta, Canada during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, to confirm if excess mortality affected all age groups equally, and to determine what proportions of excess deaths were directly related to COVID-19 and non-pharmaceutical drug poisoning. Methods: Weekly all-cause data used to estimate excess mortality were modelled against the pre-pandemic period (January 2015-February 2020). Age-adjusted weekly mortality rates for March 2020 to December 2021 were compared with the preceding 5 years. Results: From March 2020 to December 2021, there was an 11% excess mortality rate, corresponding to an average of 265 monthly excess deaths (maximum >30%). COVID-19-related deaths (n=3202) accounted for 54.9% of total excess deaths (n=5833) that occurred in the 22-month period. The increase in all-cause excess deaths was proportionately higher, and with significantly greater numbers, in younger age groups. Significant increases in monthly drug poisoning deaths occurred from March 2020 to April 2021, with a total of 1819 deaths. Eight hundred and 25 excess drug poisoning deaths, representing 25.4% of total all-cause excess deaths, occurred, mainly among those aged 25-60 years. Overall, 54.9% of all excess deaths were directly related to COVID-19 and 25.4% were related to drug poisoning. Conclusions: There was a significant increase in all-cause mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although older adults are more likely to die of COVID-19, a massive increase in non-COVID-19-related mortality was observed among younger people. These factors should be considered in public policy decisions on epidemic/pandemic management.
