38959684|t|Design, synthesis and evaluation of bioactivity of peptidomimetics based on chloroalkene dipeptide isosteres.
38959684|a|Ample biologically active peptides have been found, identified and modified for use in drug discovery to date. However, several factors, such as low metabolic stability due to proteolysis and non-specific interactions with multiple off-target molecules, might limit the therapeutic use of peptides. To enhance the stability and/or bioactivity of peptides, the development of "peptidomimetics," which mimick peptide molecules, is considered to be idealistic. Hence, chloroalkene dipeptide isosteres (CADIs) was designed, and their synthetic methods have been developed by us. Briefly, in a CADI an amide bond in peptides is replaced with a chloroalkene structure. CADIs might be superior mimetics of amide bonds because the Van der Waals radii (VDR) and the electronegativity value of a chlorine atom are close to those of the replaced oxygen atom. By a developed method of the "liner synthesis", N-tert-butylsulfonyl protected CADIs can be synthesized via a key reaction involving diastereoselective allylic alkylation using organocopper reagents. On the other hand, by a developed method of the "convergent synthesis", N-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-protected carboxylic acids can be also constructed based on N- and C-terminal analogues from corresponding amino acid starting materials via an Evans syn aldol reaction and the Ichikawa allylcyanate rearrangement reaction involving a [3.3] sigmatropic rearrangement. Notably, CADIs can also be applied for Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis and therefore introduced into bioactive peptides including as the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide and the amyloid beta fragment Lys-Leu-Val-Phe-Phe (KLVFF) peptide, which are correlated with cell attachment and Alzheimer's disease (AD), respectively. These CADI-containing peptidomimetics stabilized the conformation and enhanced the potency of the cyclic RGD peptide and the cyclic KLVFF peptide.
