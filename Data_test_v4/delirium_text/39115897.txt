39115897|a|INTRODUCTION: Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and dementia disproportionately burden patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The association between CHIP and cognitive impairment in CKD patients is unknown. METHODS: We conducted time-to-event analyses in up to 1452 older adults with CKD from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort who underwent CHIP gene sequencing. Cognition was assessed using four validated tests in up to 6 years mean follow-up time. Incident cognitive impairment was defined as a test score one standard deviation below the baseline mean. RESULTS: Compared to non-carriers, CHIP carriers were markedly less likely to experience impairment in attention (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 0.44 [0.26, 0.76], p = 0.003) and executive function (adjusted HR [95% CI] = 0.60 [0.37, 0.97], p = 0.04). There were no significant associations between CHIP and impairment in global cognition or verbal memory. DISCUSSION: CHIP was associated with lower risks of impairment in attention and executive function among CKD patients. HIGHLIGHTS: Our study is the first to examine the role of CHIP in cognitive decline in CKD. CHIP markedly decreased the risk of impairment in attention and executive function. CHIP was not associated with impairment in global cognition or verbal memory.
