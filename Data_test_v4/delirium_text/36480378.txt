36480378|a|OBJECTIVES: There is currently a lack of consensus among neuropsychologists about which cognitive assessment paradigms hold the most promise in identifying subtle cognitive deficits in preclinical Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and which are most useful for monitoring risk of cognitive deterioration. Many widely used instruments are older versions of tests originally developed for the assessment of dementia or traumatic brain injury. Current efforts to digitize these measures provides more uniform and remote assessment, which is an advancement, but does not reflect significant changes in paradigmatic underpinnings or recent advances in cognitive neuroscience. METHOD: This work provides an overview of novel Cognitive Challenge Tests (CCTs) that employ semantic interference paradigms that uniquely measure the failure to recover from proactive semantic interference (frPSI). Other salient methods to measure meaningful cognitive change in early stage AD are also presented, as well as how they compare with traditional neuropsychological assessments. Finally, future directions for the development of more effective assessment paradigms are discussed. RESULTS: frPSI is a cognitive marker which measures the persistent inability to learn new semantically competing stimuli despite multiple opportunities to do so. frPSI and deficits in semantic inhibitory control have repeatedly shown utility for the early detection of AD during its preclinical stages. These novel cognitive markers have been related to various biomarkers of AD and neurodegeneration among culturally diverse older adults. CONCLUSIONS: To meet the critical needs of a rapidly evolving field, cognitive assessment instruments must show sufficient scientific rigor including robust sensitivity, specificity, and predictive utility among culturally and linguistically diverse populations and importantly, be correlated to AD biomarkers.
