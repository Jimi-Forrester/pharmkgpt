34356628|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. Various pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to disease progression, and recent research provided evidence linking dysregulated circadian rhythms/sleep and energy metabolism with AD. Previously, we found that the natural compound Nobiletin (NOB) can directly activate circadian cellular oscillators to promote metabolic health in disease models and healthy aging in naturally aged mice. In the current study, using the amyloid-beta AD model APP/PS1, we investigated circadian, metabolic and amyloid characteristics of female mice and the effects of NOB. Female APP/PS1 mice showed reduced sleep bout duration, and NOB treatment exhibited a trend to improve it. While glucose tolerance was unchanged, female APP/PS1 mice displayed exaggerated oxygen consumption and CO2 production, which was mitigated by NOB. Likewise, cold tolerance in APP/PS1 was impaired relative to WT, and interestingly was markedly enhanced in NOB-treated APP/PS1 mice. Although circadian behavioral rhythms were largely unchanged, real-time qPCR analysis revealed altered expression of several core clock genes by NOB in the cerebral cortex, notably Bmal1, Npas2, and Rora. Moreover, NOB was also able to activate various clock-controlled metabolic genes involved in insulin signaling and mitochondrial function, including Igf1, Glut1, Insr, Irs1, Ucp2, and Ucp4. Finally, we observed that NOB attenuated the expression of several AD related genes including App, Bace1, and ApoE, reduced APP protein levels, and strongly ameliorated Abeta pathology in the cortex. Collectively, these results reveal novel genotype differences and importantly beneficial effects of a natural clock-enhancing compound in biological rhythms and related pathophysiology, suggesting the circadian clock as a modifiable target for AD.
