37357881|t|Is alumina suitable for solid phase extraction of catecholamines from brain tissue?
37357881|a|Occupational and environmental toxicology specialists find catecholamine fluctuations in brain tissue relevant for research of neurotoxicity, such as that induced by manganese or zinc, pesticides, industrial solvents, plastic, air pollution, or irradiation. Considering that catecholamine tissue concentrations are generally very low, their extraction requires a reliable and optimal method that will achieve maximum recovery and minimise other interferences. This study aimed to evaluate whether the aluminium (III) oxide (Al2O3, alumina) based cartridges designed for catecholamine isolation from plasma could be used for solid-phase extraction (SPE) of catecholamine from the brain tissue. To do that, we homogenised Wistar rat brain tissue with perchloric acid and compared three extraction techniques: SPE, the routine filtration through a 0.22 microm membrane filter, and their combination. In the extracts, we compared relative chromatographic catecholamine mobility measured with high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Chromatographic patterns for norepinephrine and epinephrine were similar regardless of the extraction technique, which indicates that the alumina cartridge is good enough to isolate them from brain tissue. However, the dopamine pattern was unsatisfactory, and further experiments are needed to identify the issue and optimise the protocol.
