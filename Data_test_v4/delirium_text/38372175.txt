38372175|t|Spatially resolved transcriptome of the aging mouse brain.
38372175|a|Brain aging is associated with cognitive decline, memory loss and many neurodegenerative disorders. The mammalian brain has distinct structural regions that perform specific functions. However, our understanding in gene expression and cell types within the context of the spatial organization of the mammalian aging brain is limited. Here we generated spatial transcriptomic maps of young and old mouse brains. We identified 27 distinguished brain spatial domains, including layer-specific subregions that are difficult to dissect individually. We comprehensively characterized spatial-specific changes in gene expression in the aging brain, particularly for isocortex, the hippocampal formation, brainstem and fiber tracts, and validated some gene expression differences by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. We identified aging-related genes and pathways that vary in a coordinated manner across spatial regions and parsed the spatial features of aging-related signals, providing important clues to understand genes with specific functions in different brain regions during aging. Combined with single-cell transcriptomics data, we characterized the spatial distribution of brain cell types. The proportion of immature neurons decreased in the DG region with aging, indicating that the formation of new neurons is blocked. Finally, we detected changes in information interactions between regions and found specific pathways were deregulated with aging, including classic signaling WNT and layer-specific signaling COLLAGEN. In summary, we established a spatial molecular atlas of the aging mouse brain (http://sysbio.gzzoc.com/Mouse-Brain-Aging/), which provides important resources and novel insights into the molecular mechanism of brain aging.
