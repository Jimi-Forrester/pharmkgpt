7964589|t|Modeling Alzheimer's disease in transgenic mice.
7964589|a|Alzheimer's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology characterized by the accumulation of beta amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Attempts have been made to engineer an animal model of the disease using a variety of transgenic approaches. So far the models have only been partially successful. The methods used and the models generated are discussed.
