36253921|t|(Dis-)Connected Dots in Dementia with Lewy Bodies-A Systematic Review of Connectivity Studies.
36253921|a|Studies on dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) have mainly focused on the degeneration of distinct cortical and subcortical regions related to the deposition of Lewy bodies. In view of the proposed trans-synaptic spread of the alpha-synuclein pathology, investigating the disease only in this segregated fashion would be detrimental to our understanding of its progression. In this systematic review, we summarize findings on structural and functional brain connectivity in DLB, as connectivity measures may offer better insights on how the brain is affected by the spread of the pathology. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched Web of Science, PubMed, and SCOPUS for relevant articles published up to November 1, 2021. Of 1215 identified records, we selected and systematically reviewed 53 articles that compared connectivity features between patients with DLB and healthy controls. Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-positron emission computer tomography, and electroencephalography assessments of patients revealed widespread abnormalities within and across brain networks in DLB. Frontoparietal, default mode, and visual networks and their connections to other brain regions featured the most consistent disruptions, which were also associated with core clinical features and cognitive impairments. Furthermore, graph theoretical measures revealed disease-related decreases in local and global network efficiency. This systematic review shows that structural and functional connectivity characteristics in DLB may be particularly valuable at early stages, before overt brain atrophy can be observed. This knowledge may help improve the diagnosis and prognosis in DLB as well as pinpoint targets for future disease-modifying treatments.   2022 The Authors.
