36505780|t|KIAA1429 regulates alternative splicing events of cancer-related genes in hepatocellular carcinoma.
36505780|a|Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the most fatal malignancies with high morbidity and mortality rates in the world, whose molecular pathogenesis is incompletely understood. As an RNA-binding protein participating in the processing and modification of RNA, KIAA1429 has been proved to be implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple cancers. However, how KIAA1429 functions in alternative splicing is not fully reported. In the current study, multi-omics sequencing data were used to analyze and decipher the molecular functions and the underlying mechanisms of KIAA1429 in HCC samples. RNA sequencing data (RNA-seq) analysis demonstrated that in HCCLM3 cells, alternative splicing (AS) profiles were mediated by KIAA1429. Regulated AS genes (RASGs) by KIAA1429 were enriched in cell cycle and apoptosis-associated pathways. Furthermore, by integrating the RNA immunoprecipitation and sequencing data (RIP-seq) of KIAA1429, we found that KIAA1429-bound transcripts were highly overlapping with RASGs, indicating that KIAA1429 could globally regulate the alternative splicing perhaps by binding to their transcripts in HCCLM3 cells. The overlapping RASGs were also clustered in cell cycle and apoptosis-associated pathways. In particular, we validated the regulated AS events of three genes using clinical specimens from HCC patients, including the exon 6 of BPTF gene and a marker gene of HCC. In summary, our results shed light on the regulatory functions of KIAA1429 in the splicing process of pre-mRNA and provide theoretical basis for the targeted therapy of HCC.
