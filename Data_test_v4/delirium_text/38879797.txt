38879797|t|Pain and psychopathology after intensive care unit admission.
38879797|a|Pain and psychopathology are observed in 18% and 55% of patients, respectively, 1 year after intensive care unit (ICU) admission. It is well known that chronic pain and psychopathology have a bidirectional relation in the general population, but it is not known whether this holds true for ICU survivors. The aim of this study was to investigate whether pain before, during and after ICU admission is related to psychopathology in ICU survivors 1 year after discharge. We performed a cohort study in a mixed ICU in the Netherlands between 2013 and 2016. At 1-year follow-up, patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Impact of Event Scale/Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and answered standardised questions regarding pain. Psychopathology was defined as having anxiety, depressive and/or post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to evaluate the association of pain before, during and after ICU admission with psychopathology at 1 year follow-up. We included 1105 patients of whom 558 (50%) (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.54) had psychopathology at 1 year follow-up. Pain before ICU admission (odds ratio (OR) 1.18; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.26) and pain after ICU admission (OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.68 to 3.35) were associated with psychopathology. Pain during ICU stay was not associated with psychopathology, but the memory of insufficient pain management during ICU stay was (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.39 to 3.45). Paying attention to pain and pain treatment experiences related to ICU admission may therefore contribute to early identification of ICU survivors at risk of psychopathology development.
