38868764|t|TUFM in health and disease: exploring its multifaceted roles.
38868764|a|The nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein Tu translation elongation factor, mitochondrial (TUFM) is well-known for its role in mitochondrial protein translation. Originally discovered in yeast, TUFM demonstrates significant evolutionary conservation from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Dysregulation of TUFM has been associated with mitochondrial disorders. Although early hypothesis suggests that TUFM is localized within mitochondria, recent studies identify its presence in the cytoplasm, with this subcellular distribution being linked to distinct functions of TUFM. Significantly, in addition to its established function in mitochondrial protein quality control, recent research indicates a broader involvement of TUFM in the regulation of programmed cell death processes (e.g., autophagy, apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis) and its diverse roles in viral infection, cancer, and other disease conditions. This review seeks to offer a current summary of TUFM's biological functions and its complex regulatory mechanisms in human health and disease. Insight into these intricate pathways controlled by TUFM may lead to the potential development of targeted therapies for a range of human diseases.
