36704272|t|Psychiatric disorders in post-traumatic brain injury patients: A scoping review.
36704272|a|Background: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is an important antecedent in the evaluation of patients with psychiatric disorders. The association between TBI and the subsequent appearance of psychiatric disorders has been documented, however, the findings found in the literature are diverse and controversial. Objective: To identify the most prevalent psychiatric disorders after head trauma. Design: An exploratory review (SCOPING) was carried out using the PRISMA extension protocol. Articles published between the years 2010-2022 were used to identify and describe the most prevalent psychiatric disorders after a TBI. Psychiatric disorders were classified according to clinical characteristics in neurotic syndromes, psychotic syndromes, cognitive disorders, among others. Results: A total of 32 articles were included. In the framework of neurotic syndromes, depression is the most prevalent psychiatric alteration after a TBI, becoming a sequel that shows a higher incidence in the first year after the traumatic event. The findings found in relation to post-traumatic stress disorder are controversial, showing great variability regarding the degree of severity of the injury. The prevalence of psychotic syndromes is relatively low because it is difficult to determine if the psychosis is a direct consequence of a TBI. In the cognitive sphere, it was found that people with TBI presented alterations in cognitive functions. Conclusions: The findings found in the review respond to the hypothesis initially raised, which assumes that head trauma is an important etiological factor in the appearance of psychiatric disorders.
