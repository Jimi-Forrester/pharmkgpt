36907887|a|Treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be more effective in the early stages. Although we do not completely understand the aetiology of the early stages of AD, potential pathological factors (amyloid beta [Abeta] and tau) and other co-factors have been identified as causes of AD, which may indicate some of the mechanism at work in the early stages of AD. Today, one of the primary techniques used to help delay or prevent AD in the early stages involves alleviating the unwanted effects of oxidative stress on Abeta clearance. 4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE), a product of lipid peroxidation caused by oxidative stress, plays a key role in the adduction of the degrading proteases. This HNE employs a mechanism which decreases catalytic activity. This process ultimately impairs Abeta clearance. The degradation of HNE-modified proteins helps to alleviate the unwanted effects of oxidative stress. Having a clear understanding of the mechanisms associated with the degradation of the HNE-modified proteins is essential for the development of strategies and for alleviating the unwanted effects of oxidative stress. The strategies which could be employed to decrease the effects of oxidative stress include enhancing antioxidant activity, as well as the use of nanozymes and/or specific inhibitors. One area which shows promise in reducing oxidative stress is protein design. However, more research is needed to improve the effectiveness and accuracy of this technique. This paper discusses the interplay of potential pathological factors and AD. In particular, it focuses on the effect of oxidative stress on the expression of the Abeta-degrading proteases through adduction of the degrading proteases caused by HNE. The paper also elucidates other strategies that can be used to alleviate the unwanted effects of oxidative stress on Abeta clearance. To improve the effectiveness and accuracy of protein design, we explain the application of quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approach.
