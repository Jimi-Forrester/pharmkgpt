33023416|a|Mitochondrial energetic deficit is one of the hallmarks of neurodegenerative disorders, e.g. Alzheimer s disease (AD). Adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with lower incidence of cognitive decline and AD and extra virgin olive oil's (poly)phenols such as oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol (HT) are being actively studied in this respect. In this study, we assessed the effects of HT on mitochondrial energetic dysfunction in the 7PA2 cells cellular model, i.e. one of the best cellular models of Abeta toxicity with a well-characterized mitochondrial dysfunction typically observed in AD. We report an increase of new mitochondria at 8 h post HT-treatment, which was followed by higher mitochondrial fusion. Further, ATP concentrations were significantly increased after 24 h of treatment with HT as compared with controls. Our data suggest that HT may revert the energetic deficit of a cellular model of AD by potentiating mitochondrial activity. Because HT is being proposed as dietary supplement or component of functional foods, future studies in appropriate animal models and - eventually - humans are warranted to further investigate its potential neuroprotective actions in AD.
