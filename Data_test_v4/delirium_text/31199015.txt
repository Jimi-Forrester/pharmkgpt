However, the association of APOE allele with MRI evidence of intracranial lesions has not been well understood. METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect the APOE genotype; MRI was examined for intracranial lesions. Their association was evaluated in a cohort of 226 AD patients and 2607 healthy individuals in southern China. RESULTS: The frequencies of epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4 alleles were 8.0%, 82.9%, and 9.1% in the whole study population. The frequency of APOE-epsilon4 allele was significantly higher in the AD subjects than that in the control group (14.4% vs 8.6%, P < 0.001). We found that brain atrophy occurred at a rate of 12.3% in epsilon4 allele group vs 8.5% in non-epsilon4 genotype group, with a significance of P = 0.008. Severe brain atrophy occurred at a rate of 1.0% in epsilon4 allele group vs 0.2% in non-epsilon4 genotype group (P = 0.011). The individuals carrying APOE epsilon4/epsilon4 had an odds ratio (OR) of 7.64 (P < 0.01) for developing AD, while the APOE epsilon3/epsilon4 gene carriers had an OR of 1.47 (P = 0.031) and the OR in APOE epsilon2/epsilon3 carriers is 0.81 (P = 0.372). Interestingly, we found that the risk of epsilon4/epsilon4 allele carrier developing AD was significantly higher in male (P < 0.001) than female (P = 0.478). CONCLUSION: Compared to epsilon2 and epsilon3 alleles, the presence of APOE-epsilon4 allele might increase the risk for AD in a dose-dependent manner in southern China. Moreover, the presence of APOE-epsilon4 allele results in a higher incidence of brain atrophy.
