37032493|t|Abnormal expression and role of MicroRNA-214-3p/SLC8A1 in neonatal Hypoxic-Ischaemic encephalopathy.
37032493|a|Neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) refers to brain damage caused by intra-uterine distress and asphyxia/hypoxia during the perinatal and neonatal periods. MicroRNA (MiR)-214-3p plays a critical role in cell growth and apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and role of miR-214-3p in neonatal HIE development, and to explore the underlying mechanisms. The expression of miR-214-3p was significantly down-regulated, while that of Slc8a1, a direct target of miR-214-3p, was significantly up-regulated, in the brain tissue of neonatal HIE rats. The over-expression of miR-214-3p promoted the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of neurones, while its down-regulation had the opposite effect. Our results indicate that miR-214-3p expression was down-regulated in neonatal HIE rats, and the up-regulation of miR-214-3p expression protected against HIE development by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis.
