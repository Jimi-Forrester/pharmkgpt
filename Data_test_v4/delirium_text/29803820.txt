29803820|t|Improved synaptic and cognitive function in aged 3 x Tg-AD mice with reduced amyloid-beta after immunotherapy with a novel recombinant 6Abeta15-TF chimeric vaccine.
29803820|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder impairing memory and cognition. In this study, we describe the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the novel recombinant 6Abeta15-TF chimeric antigen as a subunit protein vaccine for AD. Recombinant 6Abeta15-TF chimeric vaccine induced strong Abeta-specific humoral immune responses without Abeta-specific T cell immunity in C57/BL6 and 3 x Tg-AD mice at different ages. As an early immunotherapy model for AD, this vaccine induced high titers of long-lasting anti-Abeta42 antibodies in aged 3 x Tg-AD mice, which led to improve behavioral performance and markedly reduced the levels of insoluble and soluble Abeta and Abeta oligomers. In agreement with these findings, immunotherapy with 6Abeta15-TF prevented the Abeta-induced decrease of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins in aged 3 x Tg-AD mice. Our results suggest that this novel and highly immunogenic recombinant 6Abeta15-TF chimeric vaccine provides neuroprotection in AD mice and can be considered an effective AD candidate vaccine.
