39476811|a|Background Established structured weaning approaches, which are effective for patients in simple and difficult weaning, are often not appropriate for patients undergoing prolonged weaning. Addressing the complexity of weaning failure requires personalized precision medicine. The therapeutic concept of Treatable Traits (TTs) has been proposed as a new paradigm for the management of chronic respiratory diseases. It is based on a multidimensional assessment of specific characteristics, which can be addressed by specific interventions that go beyond traditional diagnostic criteria. The concept is increasingly adopted for other complex diseases. Summary This is a narrative review and an expert opinion on the development of a concept of TTs for patients undergoing prolonged weaning. The proposed TTs are based on a systematic review of risk factors for prolonged weaning, an analysis of claims data to assess risk factors within 96 hours of IMV onset and data from the WEAN-SAFE study. A multidisciplinary team identified clinically important TTs and determined appropriate interventions. The following TTs have been identified: Airway disorders and complications associated with tracheostomy or intubation, such as airway obstruction, strictures or tracheomalacia, infectious aspects, anxiety, depression, delirium, post-traumatic stress disorder, anemia, pulmonary and cardio-renal disease. The multidimensional holistic approach also includes tailored sedation and pain management, nutritional therapy, early mobilization and physiotherapy. Key message We propose a framework of relevant considerations for a multidimensional approach to the management of patients undergoing prolonged weaning that supports the regain of respiratory capacity, reduces the respiratory load and thus could resolve the respiratory workload imbalance.
