38474437|t|Conjugated Polymer-Based Hydrogel Film for a Fast and Sensitive Detection of Fe(III) in Vegetables.
38474437|a|Fluorescent film sensors are ideal for the real-time outdoor detection of heavy metal ions of Fe3+, but they are limited because of their low sensitivity and long response time due to their special structure. In this work, we constructed a fluorescent hydrogel for the specific detection of Fe3+, utilizing poly(9-fluorenecarboxylic acid) (PFCA) as the sensing moiety and sodium alginate (SA) as the cross-linking substrate, which exhibited a rapid and selective recognition of Fe3+ among a panel of 16 anions and 21 cations. It can sense Fe3+ at 0.1 nM immediately owing to the porous network structure of the PFCA-SA film that provided enhanced ion transport channels and active sites, and the "molecular line effect" of polymer PFCA. Moreover, we successfully applied this platform to detect Fe3+ in four different vegetable samples. This work provides an innovative and effective strategy for fabricating green and sustainable fluorescent sensors.
