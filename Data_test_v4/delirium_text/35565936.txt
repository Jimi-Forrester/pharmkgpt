35565936|t|Poultry Meat and Eggs as an Alternative Source of n-3 Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids for Human Nutrition.
35565936|a|The beneficial effects of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA) on human health are widely known. Humans are rather inefficient in synthesizing n-3 LC-PUFA; thus, these compounds should be supplemented in the diet. However, most Western human diets have unbalanced n-6/n-3 ratios resulting from eating habits and the fact that fish sources (rich in n-3 LC-PUFA) are not sufficient (worldwide deficit ~347,956 t/y) to meet the world requirements. In this context, it is necessary to find new and sustainable sources of n-3 LC-PUFA. Poultry products can provide humans n-3 LC-PUFA due to physiological characteristics and the wide consumption of meat and eggs. The present work aims to provide a general overview of the main strategies that should be adopted during rearing and postproduction to enrich and preserve n-3 LC-PUFA in poultry products. The strategies include dietary supplementation of alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA) or n-3 LC-PUFA, or enhancing n-3 LC-PUFA by improving the LA (Linoleic acid)/ALA ratio and antioxidant concentrations. Moreover, factors such as genotype, rearing system, transport, and cooking processes can impact the n-3 LC-PUFA in poultry products. The use of a multifactorial view in the entire production chain allows the relevant enrichment and preservation of n-3 LC-PUFA in poultry products.
