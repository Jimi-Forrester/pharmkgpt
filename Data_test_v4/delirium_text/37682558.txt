37682558|a|The abnormal aggregation of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) is one of the main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and thus development of potent scavengers targeting Abeta is considered an effective strategy for AD treatment. Herein, photosensitizer-doped carbonized polymer dots (PS-CPDs) were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method using photosensitizer (PS) and o-phenylenediamine (oPD) as precursors, and furtherly applied to inhibit Abeta aggregation via photooxygenation. The inhibition efficiency of such PS-CPDs can be adjusted by varying the type of photosensitizer, and among them, methylene blue-doped carbonized polymer dots (MB-CPDs) showed the strongest photooxygenation inhibition capability. The results demonstrated that under 650 nm NIR light irradiation, MB-CPDs (2 mug/mL) produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) to efficiently inhibit Abeta fibrillization and disaggregate mature Abeta fibrils and increased the cultured cell viability from 50% to 83%. In vivo studies confirmed that MB-CPDs extended the lifespan of AD nematodes by 4 days. Notably, the inhibitory capability of MB-CPDs is much stronger than that of MB and previously reported carbonized polymer dots. This work indicated that potent photooxygenation carbon dots can be obtained by using a photosensitizer as one of the precursors, and the results have provided new insights into the design of potent photooxygenation carbon nanomaterials targeting Abeta in AD treatment.
