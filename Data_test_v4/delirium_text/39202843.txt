39202843|a|Degenerative conditions, such as neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD)) and cardiovascular diseases, are complex, multifactorial disorders whose pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated yet. As a result, the available treatment options cannot eliminate these diseases radically, but only alleviate the symptoms. Both inflammatory processes and oxidation are key factors in the development and evolution of neurodegeneration, while acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the most used therapeutic options against AD. In this work, following the multi-targeting compound approach, we designed and synthesized a series of proline and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) amides with various acidic moieties that possess an antioxidant and/or anti-inflammatory potency. Proline is the pharmacophore of nootropic drugs (e.g., piracetam) used for memory improvement, while GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The designed molecules were subjected to a preliminary screening of their bioactivity in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory assays, as well as against acetylcholinesterase. Most of the synthesized compounds could inhibit lipid peroxidation (IC50 as low as 8 muMu) and oxidative protein glycation (inhibition of up to 48%) and reduce the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH). In addition, all of the compounds were moderate inhibitors of lipoxygenase (LOX) (up to 46% at 100 muMu) and could decrease carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats by up to 55%. Finally, some of the compounds were moderate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (IC50 as low as 219 muMu). The results confirmed the design rationale, indicating that the compounds could be further optimized as multi-targeting molecules directed against degenerative conditions.
