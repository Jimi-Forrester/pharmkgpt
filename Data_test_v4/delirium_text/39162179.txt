39162179|t|Role of pericytes in regulating penile angiogenesis and nerve regeneration.
39162179|a|Pericytes are multifunctional mural cells that surround the abluminal wall of endothelial cells and are associated with vascular development, vascular permeability, and angiogenesis. Additionally, pericytes demonstrate stem cell-like properties and contribute to neuroinflammatory processes. Pericytes have been extensively studied in the central nervous system. However, specific mechanisms underlying its involvement in various physiological and pathological conditions, especially in erectile dysfunction (ED), remain poorly understood. Advancements in in vitro and in vitro techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, are expanding our understanding of pericytes. Recent studies have shown that pericyte dysfunction is considered an important factor in the pathogenesis of vascular and neurological ED. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the specific role of pericytes in ED, focusing on diabetic and neurogenic ED. This article provides a comprehensive review of research findings on PubMed from 2000 to 2023, concerning pericyte dysfunction in the process of ED, offering valuable insights, and suggesting directions for further research.
