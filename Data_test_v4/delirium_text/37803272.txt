37803272|a|BACKGROUND: Increasing expectancy of life and levels of activity in the growing geriatric population lead to a rising number of prosthetic implants of the hip and consequently the incidence of periprosthetic fractures of the femur increase. The fracture pattern and the possible instability of the stem are a challenge to the orthopaedic surgeon. Treatment options are complete replacement of the implant or a solitary osteosynthesis. The goal of this study was to analyse the feasibility of the operative intervention using a contralateral reversed anatomic distal femoral LISS  locking plate and the radiological and functional outcome in a geriatric cohort. METHODS: We included all patients older than 75 years of age with a Vancouver type B fracture, which have been treated by osteosynthesis using a LISS  (contralateral reversed) plate in our institution in an interdisciplinary ortho-geriatric setting between 7/2013 and 12/2021. Perioperative morbidities, clinical and radiological outcome during follow-up were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: During the observed time period, 83 patients (mean age: 88 years (range: 76-103), male/female: 26/57) were treated. Most fractures were Vancouver type B2 (n = 45, 54%) followed by B1 (n = 20, 24%) and B3 (n = 18, 22%). The most prevalent postoperative surgical complication was anaemia (n = 73, 88%) followed by infections (n = 12, 14%, urinary infections, pneumonia) and cardiovascular decompensation (n = 8, 10%). Clinical and radiological follow up 6-8 weeks postoperative was possible for 59 patients (70%). The majority of them did not describe pain (n = 50, 85%) and had a good or excellent radiological outcome. Three cases needed revision surgery due to infection and another three due to non-union, loosening of the stem or an additional fracture. 1-year mortality was 30%. CONCLUSION: We are convinced that the reversed contralateral LISS-plate is an easy-to-use implant with a small complication rate but a very successful and high healing rate in a geriatric, polymorbid cohort.
