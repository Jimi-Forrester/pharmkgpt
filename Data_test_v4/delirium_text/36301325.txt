36301325|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD) is a widespread but often undetected problem. Additional delirium significantly reduces the quality of life in patients with dementia. Awareness of this condition must be increased among professionals to recognize its development at an early stage, distinguish it from dementia and treat it accordingly. OBJECTIVE: This review describes the current state of diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic methods in dealing with DSD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the PubMed database using the terms "dementia", "delirium", "delirium superimposed on dementia" and "DSD". An additional literature search was performed via Google Scholar. RESULTS: The diagnostic techniques for detecting DSD are currently limited to delirium-only diagnostic tools, such as the confusion assessment method. A multiprofessional screening of high-risk patients on a regular basis is essential for the early detection and prevention of this disease. An interdisciplinary approach is also required for treatment. Pharmacological therapy is indicated when nonpharmacological measures are insufficient or to treat delirium-inducing causes. The focus lies on the mental and physical care of the patient and on the elimination of risk factors for developing DSD. CONCLUSION: DSD is a serious syndrome, however, there is still no gold standard for diagnosis and treatment. Multicomponent nonpharmacological intervention programs have been shown to reduce the incidence of delirium. Their benefit in DSD must be verified in large multicenter studies.
