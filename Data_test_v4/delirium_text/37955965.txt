37955965|t|Development and Validation of a Prognostic Classification Model Predicting Postoperative Adverse Outcomes in Older Surgical Patients Using a Machine Learning Algorithm: Retrospective Observational Network Study.
37955965|a|BACKGROUND: Older adults are at an increased risk of postoperative morbidity. Numerous risk stratification tools exist, but effort and manpower are required. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a predictive model of postoperative adverse outcomes in older patients following general surgery with an open-source, patient-level prediction from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics for internal and external validation. METHODS: We used the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model and machine learning algorithms. The primary outcome was a composite of 90-day postoperative all-cause mortality and emergency department visits. Secondary outcomes were postoperative delirium, prolonged postoperative stay (>=75th percentile), and prolonged hospital stay (>=21 days). An 80% versus 20% split of the data from the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH) and Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) common data model was used for model training and testing versus external validation. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with a 95% CI. RESULTS: Data from 27,197 (SNUBH) and 32,857 (SNUH) patients were analyzed. Compared to the random forest, Adaboost, and decision tree models, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression model showed good internal discriminative accuracy (internal AUC 0.723, 95% CI 0.701-0.744) and transportability (external AUC 0.703, 95% CI 0.692-0.714) for the primary outcome. The model also possessed good internal and external AUCs for postoperative delirium (internal AUC 0.754, 95% CI 0.713-0.794; external AUC 0.750, 95% CI 0.727-0.772), prolonged postoperative stay (internal AUC 0.813, 95% CI 0.800-0.825; external AUC 0.747, 95% CI 0.741-0.753), and prolonged hospital stay (internal AUC 0.770, 95% CI 0.749-0.792; external AUC 0.707, 95% CI 0.696-0.718). Compared with age or the Charlson comorbidity index, the model showed better prediction performance. CONCLUSIONS: The derived model shall assist clinicians and patients in understanding the individualized risks and benefits of surgery.
