32707497|t|An evaluation on potential anti-inflammatory effects of beta-lapachone.
32707497|a|Inflammation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases. Inflammatory diseases such as bacterial diseases, Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and so on, impose huge costs on the health systems. On the other hand, some side effects have been reported for the classic drugs used to treat these diseases. Plants phytochemicals have revealed important prospects in the handling and controlling of human diseases. beta-lapachone, is a derivative of the naturally occurring element lapachol, from Tabebuia avellanedae and its anti-inflammatory effects have been reported in several reports. This review summarized the evidence from cell and animal studies supporting the anti-inflammatory role of beta-lapachone and discussed its potential mechanisms.
