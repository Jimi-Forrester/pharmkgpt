29398902|a|BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, which plays a role in glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Based on the plausible role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEG), we investigated whether there is any relationship between the levels of plasma TNF-alpha and PEG or any of its clinical indices in comparison to normal controls. METHODS: The study was designed as a retrospective analysis. Plasma samples from 49 PEG patients and 88 non-glaucomatous controls were evaluated for TNF-alpha levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The assay was performed in duplicates on a biochemical/ELISA analyzer. RESULTS: The two study groups were similar in age, sex and systemic disease distribution. The mean TNF-alpha concentration was significantly higher in the PEG patients (5.54+-4.58 pg/mL) than in the control subjects (0.93+-1.49 pg/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] =3.50-5.72; p=0.000). The overall dose-response trend was significant (chi2=57.07, df=2; p=0.000). A moderate positive and significant correlation was seen between TNF-alpha level and cup/disc ratio, an important clinical index for PEG. Besides, binary logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of PEG was most significantly affected by TNF-alpha level as compared to no association with age and sex. In receiver operating characteristic analysis, the area under the curve was 0.777 (95% CI =0.682-0.872) and statistically significant (p=0.000). CONCLUSION: Elevated systemic levels of inflammatory marker, TNF-alpha, are associated with PEG and may possibly serve as a biomarker for undiagnosed early glaucoma and/or as a marker for disease progression.
