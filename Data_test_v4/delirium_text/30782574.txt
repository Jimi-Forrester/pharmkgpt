30782574|t|Chlorinated tacrine analogs: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of their anti-cholinesterase activity as potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
30782574|a|In search of potent acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors with low hepatotoxicity for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, introduction of a chloro substitution to tacrine and some of its analogs has proven to be beneficial in maintaining or potentiating the cholinesterase inhibitory activity. Furthermore, it was found to be able to reduce the hepatotoxicity of the synthesized compounds, which is the main target of the study. Accordingly, a series of new 4-(chlorophenyl)tetrahydroquinoline derivatives, was synthesized and characterized. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro and in vivo anti-cholinesterase activity using tacrine as a reference standard. Furthermore, they were investigated for their hepatotoxicity compared to tacrine. The obtained biological results revealed that all synthesized compounds displayed equivalent or significantly higher anti-cholinesterase activity and lower hepatotoxicity in comparison to tacrine. In addition, in silico drug-likeness of the synthesized compounds were predicted and their practical logP were assessed indicating that all synthesized compounds can be considered as promising hits/leads. Furthermore, docking study of the compound showing the highest in vitro anticholinesterase activity was performed and its binding mode was compared to that of tacrine.
