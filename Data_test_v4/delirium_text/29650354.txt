29650354|a|The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors for postoperative delirium in patients undergoing free flap reconstruction for defects after oral cancer resection. This was a non-randomized, retrospective cohort study involving 102 patients who underwent oral cancer resection and free flap reconstruction. Data were collected from the medical records. Postoperative delirium occurred in 34 patients (33.3%), of whom 27 were male and seven were female. High preoperative total protein and albumin, diabetes mellitus, history of smoking, use of hypnotics or antipsychotics, time until getting out of bed after surgery, and postoperative insomnia were significantly related to delirium in the univariate analysis (P<0.05). In a multiple logistic regression model, high preoperative albumin (odds ratio 4.45), postoperative insomnia (odds ratio 10.72), and history of smoking (odds ratio 2.91) were significant risk factors for delirium (P<0.05). The analysis of laboratory data before and after surgery showed greater decreases in albumin, total protein, and haemoglobin after surgery in patients with postoperative delirium than in those without this condition. These results show that the perioperative maintenance of nutritional status and early postoperative management of the sleep cycle are important to prevent delirium after oral cancer resection and free flap reconstruction.
