22271565|t|Death following recreational use of designer drug "bath salts" containing 3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV).
22271565|a|INTRODUCTION: 3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) is a designer stimulant drug that has gained popularity in the USA. Although adverse effects of MDPV have been described, to our knowledge, this is the first reported death. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 40-year-old male who injected and snorted "bath salts" containing MDPV and subsequently became agitated, aggressive, and experienced a cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated after his initial arrest; however, he developed hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, coagulopathy, acidosis, anoxic brain injury, and subsequently died. DISCUSSION: This is the first case in the medical literature to report death due to isolated confirmed MDPV intoxication. The manner of death is also consistent with excited delirium syndrome.
