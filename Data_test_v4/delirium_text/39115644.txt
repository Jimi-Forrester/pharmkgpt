39115644|t|Navigating the Fractional Calcium Dynamics of Orai Mechanism in Polar Dimensions.
39115644|a|Calcium plays a crucial role as a second messenger in neuronal signal transduction pathways. The influx of calcium ions through various physicochemical gating channels activates neuronal calcium signaling. The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) is a significant intracellular structure that sequesters calcium and controls signaling through SERCA, IPR, and leak channel mechanisms. Disruption of calcium dynamics can trigger intrinsic dyshomeostasis, cell damage, and apoptosis. The present study articulates a Caputo fractional time derivative in the polar coordinate dimensions to investigate the role of nonlocal calcium-free ions in the neuron through the Orai channel, and ER fluxes, incorporating various physiological parameters. The solution was obtained through the hybrid integral transform technique for analytical form. The closed form was generated using Green's function in terms of Mainardi and Wright's functions. Our simulation uncovered the calcium concentration bandwidth of interaction with different neuronal parameters. Parameters and calcium ion synergy show normal and Alzheimer's disease-impacted interaction through different illustrations. Our simulation reveals that S100B and BAPTA have significant calcium-controlling behavior.
