10840274|a|Presenilin 1 has been shown to be mutated in a high proportion of cases of familial Alzheimer's disease. Immunoreactive epitopes of the protein have been found mainly in neurones devoid of neurofibrillary tangles - an observation that has led to the conclusion that presenilin 1 could have a protective role. In this study, the relationship between deposits of Abeta peptide (both the 40 and 42 isoforms), tau positive neurofibrillary tangles and presenilin 1-positive neuronal profiles were analysed in three cases of presenilin 1 mutation, four cases of sporadic Alzheimer's disease and five controls. Immunohistochemistry was performed in a sample from the supramarginal gyrus. The proportion of volume occupied by the Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 deposits (amyloid load) was evaluated by a point-counting technique. Tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles, and presenilin 1-positive neuronal profiles were directly counted. The location of the lesions in the thickness of the cortex was recorded. The density of PS1-positive neuronal profiles in Alzheimer's disease cases was lower than in the controls. The deficit was significant only in the upper layers of the cortex. The density of presenilin 1 neuronal profiles was negatively correlated with Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 loads, and with the density of tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles. Multivariate analysis showed that the Abeta1-42 load was the best determinant of the decrease in presenilin 1-positive neuronal profiles. Presenilin 1-positive neurones appear to be lost rather than protected in the course of Alzheimer disease.
