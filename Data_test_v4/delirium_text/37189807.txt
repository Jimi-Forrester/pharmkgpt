37189807|t|Potential for Therapeutic-Loaded Exosomes to Ameliorate the Pathogenic Effects of alpha-Synuclein in Parkinson's Disease.
37189807|a|Pathogenic forms of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) are transferred to and from neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, which spread alpha-syn pathology in the olfactory bulb and the gut and then throughout the Parkinson's disease (PD) brain and exacerbate neurodegenerative processes. Here, we review attempts to minimize or ameliorate the pathogenic effects of alpha-syn or deliver therapeutic cargo into the brain. Exosomes (EXs) have several important advantages as carriers of therapeutic agents including an ability to readily cross the blood-brain barrier, the potential for targeted delivery of therapeutic agents, and immune resistance. Diverse cargo can be loaded via various methods, which are reviewed herein, into EXs and delivered into the brain. Genetic modification of EX-producing cells or EXs and chemical modification of EX have emerged as powerful approaches for the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to treat PD. Thus, EXs hold great promise for the development of next-generation therapeutics for the treatment of PD.
