31176787|t|Lorazepam versus chlordiazepoxide for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and prevention of delirium tremens in general medicine ward patients.
31176787|a|Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a serious complication of abrupt alcohol cessation. Severe AWS can develop into delirium tremens (DT), which is potentially life-threatening. Lorazepam (LOR) and chlordiazepoxide (CDE) are mainstays of therapy for AWS. Current literature lacks studies comparing outcomes between the two drugs for patients who are not in a de-addiction ward specifically for withdrawal treatment. The primary objective of the study was to determine the incidence rate of DT between the groups. Of 2112 patients screened, 142 met inclusion criteria (LOR = 74, CDE = 68). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. No significant difference in the primary outcome of DT development was observed (7% LOR, 9% CDE; p = 0.76). No significant differences in cumulative doses of scheduled LOR or CDE were observed (LOR 14.6 +- 8 mg, CDE 15.4 +- 12; p = 0.64). However, significant differences were found in the amount of "as needed" (PRN) LOR required for the two groups (LOR 3.2 +- 4 mg, CDE 6.6 +- 13 mg; p = 0.03) and the amount of scheduled plus PRN LOR required (LOR 17.7 +- 10 mg, CDE 21.9 +- 14 mg; p = 0.04). Doses are reported in LOR equivalents. There were no observed differences in duration of treatment (LOR 3.6 +- 1.3 days, CDE 3.9 +- 2.1 days; p = 0.3) or length of stay (LOR 5.28 +- 3.8 days, CDE 4.73 +- 4.2 days p = 0.4). No adverse events related to BZD were noted in either group. Hospital outcomes did not differ between the groups, but patients treated with CDE may require more adjuvant therapy to control symptoms of AWS. Both agents appear equally effective at preventing the development of DT in those patients admitted to general medicine wards.
