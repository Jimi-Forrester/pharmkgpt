34189047|a|We have described two cases of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia presenting with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction with normal liver enzymes and serum lactate. These older adults presented predominantly with constitutional symptoms, silent hypoxia, distended abdomen, sluggish bowel sounds, and colonic dilatation supported by abdominal imaging (plain X-ray and computerized tomography of abdomen) to a tertiary care center in South India. Both patients received standard treatment for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and acute colonic pseudo-obstruction according to available guidelines but succumbed to complications during hospital stay. Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction in patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection requires high index of suspicion as it warrants early mitigation by cessation of offending agents, optimizing electrolytes, and colonic decompression to prevent morbidity and mortality.
