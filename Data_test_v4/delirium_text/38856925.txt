38856925|t|Associations of CSF BACE1 with amyloid pathology, neurodegeneration, and cognition in Alzheimer's disease.
38856925|a|Beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme (BACE1) is a crucial protease in the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, the side effects observed in clinical trials of BACE1 inhibitors, including reduction in brain volume and cognitive worsening, suggest that the exact role of BACE1 in AD pathology is not fully understood. To further investigate this, we examined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of BACE1 and its cleaved product sAPPbeta that reflects BACE1 activity in the China Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorder Initiative cohort. We found significant correlations between CSF BACE1 or sAPPbeta levels and CSF Abeta40, Abeta42, and Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio, but not with amyloid deposition detected by 18F-Florbetapir PET. Additionally, CSF BACE1 and sAPPbeta levels were positively associated with cortical thickness in multiple brain regions, and higher levels of sAPPbeta were linked to increased cortical glucose metabolism in frontal and supramarginal areas. Interestingly, individuals with higher baseline levels of CSF BACE1 exhibited slower rates of brain volume reduction and cognitive worsening over time. This suggests that increased levels and activity of BACE1 may not be the determining factor for amyloid deposition, but instead, may be associated with increased neuronal activity and potentially providing protection against neurodegeneration in AD.
