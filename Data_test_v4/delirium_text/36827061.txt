36827061|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) is an acute cognitive dysfunction that is mainly characterized by memory impairment and disturbances in consciousness. POD can prolong the hospital stay and increase the 1-month mortality rate of patients. The overall incidence of POD is approximately 23%, and its prevalence can go up to 50% in high-risk surgeries. Neuroinflammation is an important pathogenic mechanism of POD that mediates microglial activation and leads to synaptic remodeling. Neuroinflammation, as an indispensable pathogenesis of POD, can occur due to a variety of factors, including aseptic inflammation caused by surgery, effects of anesthetic drugs, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and epigenetics. Understanding these factors and avoiding the occurrence of risk factors may help prevent POD in time. This review provides a brief overview of POD and neuroinflammation and summarizes various factors affecting POD development mediated by neuroinflammation, which may serve as future targets for the prevention and treatment of POD.
