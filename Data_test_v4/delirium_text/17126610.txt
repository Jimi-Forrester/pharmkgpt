17126610|t|Donepezil is a strong antagonist of voltage-gated calcium and potassium channels in molluscan neurons.
17126610|a|Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used in Alzheimer's disease therapy. The neuroprotective effect of donepezil has been demonstrated in a number of different models of neurodegeneration including beta-amyloid toxicity. Since the mechanisms of neurodegeneration involve the activation of both Ca(2+)- and K(+)-channels, the study of donepezil action on voltage-gated ionic currents looked advisable. In the present study, the action of donepezil on voltage-gated Ca(2+)- and K(+)-channels was investigated on isolated neurons of the edible snail (Helix pomatia) using the two-microelectrodes voltage-clamp technique. Donepezil rapidly and reversibly inhibited voltage activated Ca(2+)-current (I(Ca)) (IC(50)=7.9 microM) and three types of high threshold K(+)-current: Ca(2+)-dependent K(+)-current (I(C)) (IC(50)=6.4 microM), delayed rectifier K(+)-current (I(DR)) (IC(50)=8.0 microM) and fast transient K(+)-current (I(Adepol)) (IC(50)=9.1 microM). The drug caused a dual effect on low-threshold fast transient K(+)-current (I(A)), potentiating it at low (5 microM) concentration, but inhibiting at higher (7 microM and above) concentration. Donepezil also caused a significant hyperpolarizing shift of the voltage-current relationship of I(Ca) (but not of any type of K(+)-current). Results suggest the possible contribution of the blocking effect of donepezil on the voltage-gated Ca(2+)- and K(+)-channels to the neuroprotective effect of the drug.
