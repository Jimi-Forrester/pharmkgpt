37849629|t|Normative Data for Single-Letter Controlled Oral Word Association Test in Older White Australians and Americans, African-Americans, and Hispanic/Latinos.
37849629|a|Background: The Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) is a commonly used measure of verbal fluency. While a normal decline in verbal fluency occurs in late adulthood, significant impairments may indicate brain injury or diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Normative data is essential to identify when test performance falls below expected levels based on age, gender, and education level. Objective: This study aimed to establish normative performance data on single-letter COWAT for older community-dwelling adults. Methods: Over 19,000 healthy men and women, without a diagnosis of dementia or a Modified Mini-Mental State Examination score below 77/100, were recruited for the ASPREE trial. Neuropsychological assessments, including the COWAT with letter F, were administered at study entry. Results: Median participant age was 75 years (range 65-98), with 56.5% being women. The majority of participants had 9-11 years of education in Australia and over 12 years in the U.S. The COWAT performance varied across ethno-racial groups and normative data were thus presented separately for 16,335 white Australians, 1,084 white Americans, 896 African-Americans, and 316 Hispanic/Latinos. Women generally outperformed men in the COWAT, except for Hispanic/Latinos. Higher education levels consistently correlated with better COWAT performance across all groups, while the negative association with age was weaker. Conclusions: This study provides comprehensive normative data for the COWAT stratified by ethno-racial groups in Australia and the U.S., considering age, gender, and education level. These norms can serve as reference standards for screening cognitive impairments in older adults in both clinical and research settings.
