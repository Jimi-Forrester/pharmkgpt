36432705|a|Impaired mitophagy is one of the hallmarks of the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, which highlights the importance of the proper functioning of mitochondria, as well as the processes of mitochondrial dynamics for the functioning of dopaminergic neurons. At the same time, the main factors leading to disruption of mitophagy in Parkinson's disease are mutations in the Pink1 and Parkin enzymes. Based on the characterized mutant forms, the marked cellular localization, and the level of expression in neurons, these proteins can be considered promising targets for the development of drugs for Parkinson's therapy. This review will consider such class of drug compounds as mitophagy activators and these drugs in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
