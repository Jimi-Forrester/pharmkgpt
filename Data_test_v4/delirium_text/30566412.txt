30566412|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the current findings on clinical retinal diseases and retinal imaging changes with dementia, focusing on Alzheimer's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies observed that clinical retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, open-angle glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy are related to dementia, but the associations are not entirely consistent. In terms of the retinal neuronal structure, multiple retinal neuronal layers are significantly thinner in Alzheimer's disease dementia, such as the parapapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL). Recent studies further demonstrated that macular GC-IPL and macular RNFL are also significantly thinner in the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease. A thinner RNFL is also associated with a significantly increased risk of developing both cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease dementia. In addition, studies consistently showed that retinal vascular changes are associated with poorer cognitive performance, as well as prevalent and incident Alzheimer's disease dementia. SUMMARY: The current findings support the concept that changes in the retina, particular in retinal neuronal structure and vasculature, can reflect the status of cerebral neuronal structure and vasculature, highlighting the potential role of retinal changes as biomarkers of dementia.
