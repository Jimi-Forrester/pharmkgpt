38646240|t|Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis Complicating Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus Ophthalmoplegia.
38646240|a|Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare cause of strokes and is most common in younger patients particularly those less than 50 years of age. It is more common in females than in males and is known to be associated with pregnancy, puerperium, oral contraception, congenital and acquired thrombophilia, and malignancy. Less commonly, it has been shown to be associated with infections and more recently has been found to be associated with COVID-19 infection with thrombocytopenia and the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca. Rare cases have been reported in association with varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection (chickenpox) and its reactivated version of herpes zoster virus (HZV) infection (shingles). We report the case of a 68-year-old lady with herpes zoster ophthalmicus ophthalmoplegia who developed cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT).
