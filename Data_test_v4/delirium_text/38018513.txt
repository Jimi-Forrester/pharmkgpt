38018513|t|Diagnostic biomarker for type 2 diabetic peripheral neuropathy via comprehensive bioinformatics analysis.
38018513|a|BACKGROUND: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which frequently results in disabling neuropathic pain and lower-limb amputation. The identification of noninvasive biomarkers for DPN may help early detection and individualized treatment of DPN. METHODS: In this study, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DPN and the control based on blood-source (GSE95849) and tissue-source gene expression profiles (GSE143979) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database using limma, edgeR, and DESeq2 approaches. KEGGG and GO functional enrichments were performed. Hub genes and their correlation with infiltrating immune cells were analyzed. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to quantify hub gene expression. RESULTS: In total, 144 DEGs between DPN and the control were identified. Functional enrichment revealed that the DEGs were mainly enriched in immune-related pathways like the Fc epsilon receptor Ig signaling pathway. By protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, FCER1G, SYK, ITGA4, F13A1, MS4A2, and PTK2B were screened as hub genes with higher expression in DPN patients, among which half were immune genes (FCER1G, PTK2B, and SYK). RT-qPCR demonstrated that mRNA expression of FCER1G, PTK2B, and SYK was significantly increased in patients with DPN compared with both diabetic nonperipheral neuropathy (DNN) and normal subjects. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of FCER1G, PTK2B, and SYK was 0.84, 0.81, and 0.73, respectively, suggesting their great advantages as diagnostic biomarkers to predict the progression of neuropathy in T2DM. Further analysis indicated that the expression of FCER1G, PTK2B, and SYK was negatively correlated with the cell proportion of significantly altered resting natural killer cells, T follicular helper cells, and activated mast cells, but positively correlated with monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated FCER1G, PTK2B, and SYK are potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for DPN, which provides new insight into DPN pathogenesis and therapies.
