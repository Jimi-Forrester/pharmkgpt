38236996|a|INTRODUCTION: The roles of anti-adhesive podocalyxin (PODXL), anti-angiogenetic tumstatin/ Col-IValpha3 and neuro-inflammation and innate immunity modulator Chitinase 1 (CHIT-1) in the etiology of vitiligo have not been studied yet. OBJECTIVES: This study was planned to detect changes in serum PODXL, tumstatin/Col-IValpha3 and CHIT1 levels in vitiligo patients. METHODS: This case-controlled study was performed on a total of 50 patients, 25 with vitiligo and 25 healthy controls. Participants in the vitiligo and control groups were matched in pairs for age and sex. At least 8-10 hours of overnight fasting, venous blood samples were taken from the participants in both groups and serum levels of podocalyxin, tumstatin/Col-IValpha3 and CHIT 1 levels were measured by sandwich enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: In the classification made according to the vitiligo European Task Force evaluation criteria, 18 of 25 vitiligo patients were in the slowly progressive phase and 7 patients were in the active progressive phase. Serum podocalyxin levels increased significantly in the vitiligo group compared to the controls (7.03+-2.09 ng/ml vs. 4.99+-1.20 ng/ml, p<0.02). However, serum tumstatin levels in vitiligo patients showed a significantly lower course compared to controls (4.88+-1.76 ng/ml vs. 6.05+-2.19 ng/nl, p<0.03). Serum CHIT-1 levels of vitiligo patients (42.4+-7.22 ng/ml) were found to be significantly higher than the serum levels of the control group (34.5+-5.33 ng/ml) (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: High podocalyxin and CHIT1versus low tumstatin levels are new biomarkers that support the role of anti-adhesive, anti-angiogenic and neuroinflammatory pathways in the formation of vitiligo.
