32510120|t|Signs for Early Detection of Dysphagia in Older Adults with Severe Alzheimer's Disease.
32510120|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to detect signs of dysphagia in older adults with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD). STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 280 institutionalized older adults (with AD = 145; without AD = 135), aged > 70 years, with oral feeding, both sexes were examined. MEASUREMENTS: Modified water-swallowing test determined the dysphagia. Independent variables were dependency level (modified Barthel Index), oral health and function status (residual teeth, occlusal contacts, passive lip sealing, tongue function, rinsing and gargling ability), nutritional status (Body Mass Index, Mini Nutritional Assessment), and diet-related assessments (appetite, storing or stuffing food in the mouth). Statistical analysis was carried out by Fisher s Exact and chi-square tests. The analyzes of associations with the dysphagia outcome were performed by simple and multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: Severity of AD was significantly associated with dysphagia. The signs associated with dysphagia were decreased nutritional status, absence of appetite, and storing food in the mouth. CONCLUSION: These signs can be useful tools for early diagnosis of dysphagia in AD older adults.
