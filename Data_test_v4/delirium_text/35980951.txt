35980951|a|BACKGROUND: Headache, a highly prevalent neurological disorder, has consistently been linked with an elevated risk of dementia. However, most studies are focused on the relationship with migraine in limited age groups. Therefore, the objective of this research was to look at the link between various type of headaches and dementias based on longitudinal population-based data. METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants diagnosed with headache from 2002 to 2005 were selected and major covariates were collected. The diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and other dementias were observed from 2006 until 2013. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of dementias according to headache type were calculated by Cox proportional hazards regression. A number of 470,652 participants were observed for a mean of 7.6 years (standard deviation: 1.2), for approximately 3.6 million person-years. Both tension type headache (TTH) and migraine elevated the risk of all-cause dementias (TTH, aHR 1.18, 95% CI 1.13-2.24; migraine, aHR 1.18, 95% CI 1.13-2.24). Headaches had a greater influence in females and non-smokers as a risk factor of dementias. Patients with migraine who consumed alcohol had a higher risk of dementia, however this was not true with TTH patients. Among participants without comorbidities, TTH patients were more susceptible to dementia than migraine patients. Headache patients had a higher proportion of females regardless of headache type and approximately 1.5 times more individuals had three or more comorbidities compared to those without headache. CONCLUSIONS: Headache could be an independent predictor for subsequent dementia risk. Future studies should focus on clarifying pathogenic pathways and possible dementia-related preventive measures in headache populations.
