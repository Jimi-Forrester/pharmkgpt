38404698|t|Beyond the joint: Exploring the interplay between mental health and shoulder arthroplasty outcomes.
38404698|a|Considering the fact that mental health illnesses increase with age, and that shoulder arthroplasty procedures are often indicated in the older population, exploring the relationship between mental health and shoulder arthroplasty outcomes can have pivotal implications for shoulder surgeons and patients worldwide. The literature has shown that patients with poor mental health report lower patient-reported outcomes, higher peri-operative complications (such as anemia, infection, delirium, and others), lengthier hospital stays, and higher readmission rates than the normal patient. Employing a holistic approach when managing shoulder arthroplasty patients is necessary for optimizing outcomes and setting up recovery expectations.
