35563713|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) heavily impacts the body: it damages the brain tissue and the peripheral nervous system and shifts homeostasis in many types of tissue. An acute brain injury compromises the "brain-gut-microbiome axis", a well-balanced network formed by the brain, gastrointestinal tract, and gut microbiome, which has a complex effect: damage to the brain alters the composition of the microbiome; the altered microbiome affects TBI severity, neuroplasticity, and metabolic pathways through various bacterial metabolites. We modeled TBI in rats. Using a bioinformatics approach, we sought to identify correlations between the gut microbiome composition, TBI severity, the rate of neurological function recovery, and blood metabolome. We found that the TBI caused changes in the abundance of 26 bacterial genera. The most dramatic change was observed in the abundance of Agathobacter species. The TBI also altered concentrations of several metabolites, specifically citrulline and tryptophan. We found no significant correlations between TBI severity and the pre-existing gut microbiota composition or blood metabolites. However, we discovered some differences between the two groups of subjects that showed high and low rates of neurological function recovery, respectively. The present study highlights the role of the brain-gut-microbiome axis in TBI.
