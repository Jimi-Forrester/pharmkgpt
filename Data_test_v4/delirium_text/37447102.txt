37447102|a|Sideritis scardica Griseb. is a Balkan endemic species traditionally used for the treatment of pulmonary emphysema and angina pectoris. Recent research has also shown its phytotherapeutic potential as an anticancer and neuroprotective agent. These findings, as well as the endangered status of the species in its wild habitats, have motivated the present research on application of plant cell tissue and organ culture for the purposes of both valuable germplasm conservation and secondary metabolites production. Shoot cultures of the plant were initiated from sterile germinated seeds and the effects of activated charcoal (AC), as well benzyl adenine and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid treatments, were experimented. The phenolic profile analysis was performed by HPLC/DAD/MSn. Comparison with samples collected from wild plants in their natural habitat was performed. It was established that in vitro multiplication induced by plant growth regulators (PGRs) was accompanied by a higher impairment of leaf morphology and trichome formation, as well as by the occurrence of plantlet hyperhydricity and callus formation, as compared with the AC treatments. Shoot culture-derived plant material was shown to produce two phenylethanoids and five flavone glycosides, not detected in the wild collected plant material. In addition, the two types of in vitro culture treatments led to the stimulation of either flavone glycosides or phenylethanoids in the in vitro cultivated plants. Thus, AC stimulated, to a higher extent, flavone glycosides' accumulation, leading to an elevated flavone/phenylethanoid ratio, as compared with PGR treatments.
