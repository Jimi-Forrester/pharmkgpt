37383469|t|Predictive value of IOM in clipping of unruptured intracranial aneurysms - A prospective study from the surgeon's point of view.
37383469|a|Introduction: Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IOM) of motor/somatosensory evoked potentials is a well-established approach for reducing ischemic complications after aneurysm clipping. Research question: To determine the predictive validity of IOM for postoperative functional outcome and its perceived added value for intraoperative real-time feedback of functional impairment in the surgical treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs). Material and methods: Prospective study of patients scheduled for elective clipping of UIAs between 02/2019-02/2021. Transcranial motor evoked potentials (tcMEP) were used in all cases, a significant decline was defined as loss of >=50% in amplitude or 50% latency increase. Clinical data were correlated to postoperative deficits. A surgeon's questionnaire was conceived. Results: 47 patients were included, median age 57 years (range 26-76). IOM was successful in all cases. In 87.2%, IOM was stable throughout surgery, although 1 patient (2.4%) demonstrated a permanent postoperative neurological deficit. All patients with an intraoperatively reversible tcMEP-decline (12.7%) showed no surgery-related deficit, regardless of the decline duration (range 0.5-40.0 min; mean: 13.8). Temporary clipping (TC) was performed in 12 cases (25.5%), with a decline in amplitude in 4 patients. After clip-removal, all amplitudes returned to baseline. IOM provided the surgeon with a higher sense of security in 63.8%. Discussion and conclusion: IOM remains invaluable during elective microsurgical clipping, particularly during TC of MCA and AcomA-aneurysms. It alerts the surgeon of impending ischemic injury and offers a way of maximizing the time frame for TC. IOM has highly increased surgeons' subjective feeling of security during the procedure.
