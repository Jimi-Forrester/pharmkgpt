33430368|a|Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social communication, poor social interactions, and repetitive behaviors. We aimed to examine autism-like behaviors and related gene expressions in rats exposed to diesel exhaust (DE)-origin secondary organic aerosol (DE-SOA) perinatally. Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats were exposed to clean air (control), DE, and DE-SOA in the exposure chamber from gestational day 14 to postnatal day 21. Behavioral phenotypes of ASD were investigated in 10~13-week-old offspring using a three-chambered social behavior test, social dominance tube test, and marble burying test. Prefrontal cortex was collected to examine molecular analyses including neurological and immunological markers and glutamate concentration, using RT-PCR and ELISA methods. DE-SOA-exposed male and female rats showed poor sociability and social novelty preference, socially dominant behavior, and increased repetitive behavior. Serotonin receptor (5-HT(5B)) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNAs were downregulated whereas interleukin 1 beta (IL-beta) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) mRNAs were upregulated in the prefrontal cortex of male and female rats exposed to DE-SOA. Glutamate concentration was also increased significantly in DE-SOA-exposed male and female rats. Our results indicate that perinatal exposure to DE-SOA may induce autism-like behavior by modulating molecules such as neurological and immunological markers in rats.
