38035262|a|We investigated the association of social strain from friends, depression, and systemic inflammation (C-Reactive Protein [CRP]) with cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND) and dementia among 9,262 participants (age >= 65). We analyzed data from the Health Retirement Study (HRS), performing Chi-squared and logistic regression analyses. Measures included the 27-point HRS cognition scale, social strain scale, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale, and dried-blood CRP levels. Black and Hispanic participants had a significantly increased dementia risk (OR = 2.69 and OR = 2.54). Black participants also had a high risk of CIND (OR = 2.80), but no association of Hispanic participants with CIND. Increased social strain from friends and depression were significantly associated with CIND (OR = 1.50 and OR = 1.44) and dementia (OR = 1.57 and OR = 1.78). Elevated CRP levels were only linked to CIND risk (OR = 1.03), not dementia. Early detection and interventions targeting social strain, depression, and CRP levels may help promote cognitive functioning in older adults.
