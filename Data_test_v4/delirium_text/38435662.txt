38435662|t|Comparison of airway collapsibility following single induction dose ketamine with propofol versus propofol sedation in children undergoing magnetic resonance imaging: A randomised controlled study.
38435662|a|Background and Aims: Adequate sedation is essential for children undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) console. Propofol is commonly used for sedation, but it has the drawback of upper airway collapse at higher doses, which may be overcome by ketamine. This study was designed to evaluate the beneficial effect of ketamine on propofol in preventing airway collapse. Methods: Fifty-eight children undergoing MRI were randomised to Group P (propofol bolus dose followed by infusion or Group KP (bolus dose of ketamine and propofol followed by propofol infusion). The primary aim is to compare the upper airway cross-sectional area (CSA) and diameters (transverse diameter [TD] and anteroposterior diameter [APD]) obtained from MRI during inspiration and expiration. Results: Upper airway collapse as measured by delta CSA in mean (SD) [95% confidence interval] was statistically more significant between the two groups [at the soft palate level, 16.9 mm2 (19.8) [9.3-24.4] versus 9.0 mm2 (5.50) [6.9-11.1] (P = 0.043); at the base of the tongue level, 15.4 mm2 (11.03) [11.2-19.6] versus 7.48 mm2 (4.83) [5.64-9.32] (P < 0.001); at the epiglottis level, 23.9 (26.05) [14.0-33.8] versus 10.9 mm2 (9.47) [7.35-14.5] (P = 0.014)]. A significant difference was obtained for TD at all levels and for APD at the soft palate and base of tongue level. Conclusion: Adding a single dose of ketamine to propofol reduced the upper airway collapse significantly, as evidenced by the MRI-based measurements of upper airway dimensions, compared to propofol alone.
