30001953|a|OBJECTIVE: In this study, we characterised the use of physical restraints in three intensive care units (ICUs) in a general hospital in Nantong, China. Additionally, we explored risk factors potentially related to physical restraint use. BACKGROUND: Despite their numerous harmful effects, physical restraints are frequently used in ICUs worldwide. Few studies have investigated the factors that contribute to physical restraint use in Chinese hospitals. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional, observational study of 312 patients in three ICUs at a general hospital in China. The quantitative data were collected during a 5-month period using a physical restraint observation form and patient records. The data obtained were analysed using descriptive statistics. The independent risk factors for physical restraint use were assessed using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 312 patients in the three ICUs, 191 (61.2%) were restrained, and physical restraints were used more than once for 46 (24.1%) patients during their ICU stay. The median length of physical restrain use was 20 shifts (interquartile range = 10-36 shifts). Physical restraints were applied in 6664 of 12374 (53.9%) nurse shifts. The most common time at which physical restraints were applied was the beginning of the evening shift. According to the forward stepwise logistic regression analysis, delirium (P < 0.001), mechanical ventilation (P < 0.001), and age (P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for physical restraint use. The use of analgesics (P = 0.001) exerted an independent protective effect against physical restraint use. CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of physical restraint use in Chinese ICUs was higher than that reported in previous investigations. The patients' nursing notes lacked complete physical restraint records, reflecting a need for standard guidelines and policies for physical restraint use in hospital ICUs in China. In addition, in this study, we explored the risk factors related to physical restraint use and found that age, delirium, mechanical ventilation, and analgesic use are associated with physical restraint use.
