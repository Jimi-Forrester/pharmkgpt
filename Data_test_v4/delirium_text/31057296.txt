31057296|a|The aging of the organ function causes sensitivity to the disease progression and need careful consideration for the medical treatment. With the increase of aging population, the opportunity to provide medical treatment for people in very old age is rapidly increasing therefore, the understanding of the various physiological changes of cellular function, size and function of organs are essential for the decision of therapeutic options. Among the various chronic conditions seen in elderly people, we have focused on liver cirrhosis, since despite specific therapeutic options for many of liver diseases including direct acting antivirals for hepatitis C virus, nucleoside analogs for hepatitis B, and corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis, there is currently no standard therapy to treat liver cirrhosis, which is the final stage of these liver diseases. Therefore, management of the various symptoms of liver cirrhosis is essential, and aging-related parameters must be considered in the decision making for therapeutic strategies and dosage of the available medicine. In this mini-review, we have summarized the therapeutic options to manage various symptoms of liver cirrhosis, carefully considering the physiological changes of various organs associated with aging.
