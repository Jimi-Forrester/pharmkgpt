35453615|t|Increases of Phosphorylated Tau (Ser202/Thr205) in the Olfactory Regions Are Associated with Impaired EEG and Olfactory Behavior in Traumatic Brain Injury Mice.
35453615|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to long-term cognitive impairments, with an increased risk for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Among these various impairments, olfactory dysfunction is one of the most common symptoms in TBI patients. However, there are very few studies that show the association between olfactory dysfunction and repetitive TBI. To investigate the effects of repetitive TBI on olfactory functioning and the related pathological neuronal injuries in mice, we applied a weight-drop model of TBI and performed neuropathological examinations and electroencephalography (EEG) in olfactory-bulb-associated areas. Through neuropathological examinations, we found significant increases of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) (S202/T205) in olfactory-bulb-associated areas. Neuronal atrophy in the lateral anterior olfactory nucleus (AOL), granule layer olfactory bulb (GrO), and dorsal tenia tecta (DTT) was also found to be correlated with p-Tau levels. However, there was no difference in the total Tau levels in the olfactory-bulb-associated areas of TBI mice. Electroencephalography (EEG) of repetitive TBI mouse models showed impaired spontaneous delta oscillation, as well as altered cross-frequency coupling between delta phase and amplitudes of the fast oscillations in the resting-state olfactory bulb. Furthermore, abnormal alterations in EEG band powers were observed during the olfactory oddball paradigm test. TBI also led to impairments of the olfactory-function-associated behaviors. This study provides evidence of behavioral, neuropathological, and physiological alterations in the mouse olfactory system caused by repetitive TBI. Together, p-Tau alterations and EEG impairments may serve as important biomarkers of olfactory-track-associated dysfunctions in repetitive TBI.
