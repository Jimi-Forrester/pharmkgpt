32519977|t|Postoperative sleep disorders and their potential impacts on surgical outcomes.
32519977|a|Postoperative sleep disturbance is a common occurrence with significant adverse effects on patients including delayed recovery, impairment of cognitive function, pain sensitivity and cardiovascular events. The development of postoperative sleep disturbance is multifactorial and involves the surgical inflammatory response, the severity of surgical trauma, pain, anxiety, the use of anesthetics and environmental factors such as nocturnal noise and light levels. Many of these factors can be managed perioperatively to minimize the deleterious impact on sleep. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies for postoperative sleep disturbance include dexmedetomidine, zolpidem, melatonin, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol and controlling of environmental noise and light levels. It is likely that a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies will have the greatest impact; however, further research is required before their use can be routinely recommended.
