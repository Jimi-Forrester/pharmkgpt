30507928|a|There is a need for a screening tool with capacities of accurate detection of early mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia and is suitable for use in a range of languages and cultural contexts. This research aims to evaluate the psychometric and diagnostic properties of the Taiwan version of Qmci (Qmci-TW) screen and to explore the discriminating ability of the Qmci-TW in differentiating among normal controls (NCs), MCI and dementia. Thirty-one participants with dementia and 36 with MCI and 35 NCs were recruited from a neurology department of regional hospital in Taiwan. Their results on the Qmci-TW, Taiwanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Traditional Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were compared. For analysis, we used Cronbach's alpha, intraclass correlation coefficient, Spearman's rho, Kruskal-Wallis test, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and multivariate analysis, as appropriate. The Qmci-TW exhibited satisfactory test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and interrater reliability as well as a strong positive correlation with results from the MoCA and MMSE. The optimal cut-off score on the Qmci-TW for differentiating MCI from NC was <= 51.5/100 and dementia from MCI was <= 31/100. The MoCA exhibited the highest accuracy in differentiating MCI from NC, followed by the Qmci-TW and then MMSE; whereas, the Qmci-TW and MMSE exhibited the same accuracy in differentiating dementia from MCI, followed by the MoCA. The Qmci-TW may be a useful clinical screening tool for a spectrum of cognitive impairments.
