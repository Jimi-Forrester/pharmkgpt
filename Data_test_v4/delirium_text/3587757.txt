3587757|t|Localization of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) mRNA in human brain.
3587757|a|In situ hybridization with biotinylated DNA and RNA probes derived from the 3' untranslated region of human neuron-specific or gamma gamma-enolase (NSE) permits histochemical detection of NSE mRNA in autopsy samples of human brain. In both aged controls and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, NSE probe hybridized with variable intensity to nerve cells in visual cortex and cerebellum, but not to glial or liver cells. These results provide evidence that NSE mRNA is expressed in neurons in human brain tissue, pattern of NSE mRNA expression in unaffected brain regions in AD is qualitatively normal, and NSE mRNA expression may vary widely among different classes of neurons.
