6228933|a|The present study provided a neuropsychological assessment of impaired attention in Alzheimer's patients (57-89 years of age). Three control groups were evaluated: young normals (ages 18-32 years of age), an older group (55-69 years of age), and an elderly group (70-85 years of age). Alzheimer's patients showed an absence of CNV rebound and impairment in attention performance. They also showed significantly less facilitation in speed of response by a preparatory signal than the non-patient groups. These findings suggested a possible discontinuity between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, a comparison of young, normal elderly, and Alzheimer's groups indicated a pattern of systematic decrease in CNV rebound, lowered short-term memory performance, and slowing of reaction time during divided-attention, a finding that suggests normal aging and senile dementia to represent quantitative differences on a continuum of gradual age-related deterioration. Alzheimer's patients showed elevated levels of basal heart rate and eyeblink rate and increased oculomotor responsiveness in divided-attention conditions. This finding was interpreted as compelling evidence against the concept of hypoactivity in senile dementia and as support for a distraction-arousal interpretation of impaired attention in Alzheimer's patients, although decreased basal myogenic activity and lowered heart rate levels during divided attention in the patients indicated selectively dampened psycho-physiological functioning. Distraction-arousal processes appeared to be curtailed in the patient group after Hydergine treatment.
