37706346|a|The adipose tissue (AT) has recently been recognized as an important endocrine organ that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism and in the immune response in multiple metabolic tissues. With this regard, emerging evidence indicates that an important crosstalk exists between the AT and the brain. However, the AT contribution in the development of age-related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), remains poorly defined. New studies suggest that the AT modulates brain function through multiple bioactive factors known as adipokines, which can cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) to reach the brain target-areas or even regulate the BBB function. In this review, we discuss the effect of multiple adipokines in the BBB physiology, their contribution to the development of AD and their therapeutic potential.
