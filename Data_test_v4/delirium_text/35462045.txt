35462045|t|Hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and case-fatality outcomes in US veterans with COVID-19 disease between years 2020-2021.
35462045|a|PURPOSE: Although veterans represent a significant proportion (7%) of the USA population, the COVID-19 disease impact within this group has been underreported. To bridge this gap, this study was undertaken. METHOD: A total of 419,559 veterans, who tested positive for COVID-19 disease in the Veterans Affairs hospital system from March 1st, 2020 to December 31st, 2021 with 60-days follow-up, was included in this retrospective review. Primary outcome measures included age-adjusted incidences and relative incidences of COVID-19 hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and case-fatality outcomes. RESULTS: Of this veteran cohort with COVID-19 disease, predominately 85.7% were male, 59.1% were White veterans, 27.5% were ages 50-64, and 40.5% were obese. Although Black veterans were at 63% higher relative risk (RR) for hospitalization incidences, they had a similar risk RR for in-hospital deaths compared to the White-veteran referent. Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native races, advanced age >=65, and the underweight were at high RR for mechanical ventilator and/or in-hospital deaths compared to respective referent groups. Veterans who are >=85 years old had a nearly 5-fold higher incidence of death compared respective referent group. The monthly outcomes for hospitalization, ventilation, and case-fatality data showed decreasing trends with time. CONCLUSION: An increased incidence of death was associated with age >=65 years and underweight veterans compared to the referent group. Age-adjusted data, however, did not show any increased incidence of death in Black veterans compared to White veterans. RATINGS OF THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE: 3 (Case-control studies; retrospective cohort study).
