26097047|a|One of the hallmarks of Alzheimers disease is the deposition of amyloid plaques, which consist of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides in fibrillar states. Nonfibrillar Abeta aggregates have been considered as an important intermediate in the pathway of fibrillization, but little is known about the formation mechanism. The on-pathway beta-sheet intermediates of Abeta40 peptides can be trapped by incubating the peptides in liposomes formed by zwitterionic lipids. The aggregates of Abeta40 peptides have been prepared at a peptide concentration of less than 10 mum. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy data show that the backbone conformation of the aggregates is almost identical to that of the fibrils formed in free solution. In contrast to anionic lipids, zwitterionic lipids, which are typical of neuronal soma, did not induce any significant conformational difference in Abeta40 fibrils. This liposome-Abeta system may serve as a useful model to study the fibril formation mechanism.
