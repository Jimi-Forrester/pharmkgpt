32724114|t|Ubiquitin-proteasome system, lipid metabolism and DNA damage repair are triggered by antipsychotic medication in human oligodendrocytes: implications in schizophrenia.
32724114|a|Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe and disabling psychiatric disorder, whose treatment is based on psychosocial interventions and the use of antipsychotic drugs. While the effects of these drugs are well elucidated in neuronal cells, they are still not so clear in oligodendrocytes, which play a vital role in schizophrenia. Thus, we aimed to characterize biochemical profiles by proteomic analyses of human oligodendrocytes (MO3.13) which were matured using a protocol we developed and treated with either haloperidol (a typical antipsychotic), clozapine (an atypical antipsychotic) or a clozapine + D-serine co-treatment, which has emerged lately as an alternative type of treatment. This was accomplished by employing shotgun proteomics, using nanoESI-LC-MS/MS label-free quantitation. Proteomic analysis revealed biochemical pathways commonly affected by all tested antipsychotics were mainly associated to ubiquitination, proteasome degradation, lipid metabolism and DNA damage repair. Clozapine and haloperidol treatments also affected proteins involved with the actin cytoskeleton and with EIF2 signaling. In turn, metabolic processes, especially the metabolism of nitrogenous compounds, were a predominant target of modulation of clozapine + D-serine treatment. In this context, we seek to contribute to the understanding of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in the action of antipsychotics on oligodendrocytes, along with their possible implications in schizophrenia.
