38613648|t|The Impact of Prevotella on Neurobiology in Aging: Deciphering Dendritic Cell Activity and Inflammatory Dynamics.
38613648|a|Prevotella species, notably Prevotella copri, significantly populate the human gut. In particular, P. copri is prevalent among non-Western populations with diets high in fiber. These species show complex relationships with diverse health aspects, associating with beneficial outcomes, including reduced visceral fat and improved glucose tolerance. Studies implicate various Prevotella species in specific diseases. Prevotella nigrescens and Porphyromonas gingivalis were linked to periodontal disease, promoting immune responses and influencing T helper type 17 (Th17) cells. Prevotella bivia was associated with bacterial vaginosis and a specific increase in activated cells in the vaginal mucosa. In contrast, they have shown substantial potential for inducing connective tissue degradation and alveolar bone resorption. Prevotella's role in neuroinflammatory disorders and autoinflammatory conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease has also been noted. The complex relationship between Prevotella and age-related conditions further extends to neurobiological changes in aging, with varying associations with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other inflammatory conditions. Studies have also identified Prevotella to be implicated in cognitive decline in middle aged and the elderly. Future directions in this research area are anticipated to explore Prevotella-associated inflammatory mechanisms and therapeutic interventions. Investigating specific drug targets and immunomodulatory measures could lead to novel therapeutic strategies. Understanding how Prevotella-induced inflammation interacts with aging diseases would offer promising insights for treatments and interventions. This review urges ongoing research to discover therapeutic targets and mechanisms for moderating Prevotella-associated inflammation to further enhance our understanding and improve health outcomes.
