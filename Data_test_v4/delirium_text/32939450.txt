32939450|t|Blood-brain barrier amenable gold nanoparticles biofabrication in aged cell culture medium.
32939450|a|Green fabrication of nanoscale materials is highly desirable because of associated adverse effects with conventional nanomaterial biomedical applications. Moreover, the higher selective nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the brain ailments treatment through conventional chemotherapy, thus providing room for nanotechnology-based modalities for BBB traversing. In this contribution, we have biosynthesized gold nanoparticles from the HAuCl4 solution in the aged cells culture medium. This approach is highly facile without any other chemical utilization. The cell culture medium age and cell number can tune the Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) size from 2 to several hundred nm. The 24 h MTT assay and cell uptake studies in vitro and murine models' vital organs (liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and heart) study up to 48 h demonstrated that biosynthesized AuNPs were biocompatible and BBB amenable. Interestingly, the transferrin and cell culture medium isolated proteins were found factors responsible for HAuCl4 solution biomineralization and size control. Moreover, the protein corona on biosynthesized AuNPs could help them traverse BBB both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting their potential applications for brain disease theranostics. In conclusion, the biosynthesis of AuNPs from aged cells medium is highly facile, green, and biocompatible for brain disease theranostics.
