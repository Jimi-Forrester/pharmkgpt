38472261|a|Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Since dopaminergic cell transplantation is a clinical method to treat PD, this study investigated the effects of dopaminergic cell therapy on the expression of some lncRNAs and genes related to PD. In this study, Twenty-eight rats were randomly assigned to four experimental groups. The control group (Sal group) received saline injections. The Par group was a PD rat model with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection in right striatum (ST). PD animals were transplanted by undifferentiated P19 stem cells (Par-E group), and P19-derived dopaminergic cells (Par-N group). Cell transplant effects were evaluated using behavioral tests (cylinder, open field, and rotarod tests), and histological methods (H&E and Nissl staining, and immunohistochemistry). Moreover, the expression of lncRNAs MALAT1, MEG3, and SNHG1, alongside specific neuronal (synaptophysin) and dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase) markers was evaluated by qRT-PCR. Behavioral and histopathological examinations revealed that cell transplantation partially compensated dopaminergic cell degeneration in ST and substantia nigra (SN) of PD rats. The expression of MALAT1, SNHG1, and MEG3 was decreased in the ST of the Par group, while MEG3 and SNHG1 gene expression was increased in PBMC relative to the Sal group. In PBMC of the Par-N group, all three lncRNAs showed a reduction in their expression. Conversely, MALAT1 and SNHG1 expression was increased in ST tissue, while MEG3 gene expression was decreased compared to the Sal group. In conclusion, dopaminergic cell transplantation could change the lncRNAs expression. Furthermore, it partially improves symptoms in PD rats.
