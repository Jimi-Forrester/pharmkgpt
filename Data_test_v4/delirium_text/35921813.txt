35921813|a|Astrocytes are brain cells that react to Alzheimer's disease pathology in ways that can have either beneficial or detrimental effects. In this issue of Cell Metabolism, Ju et al. outline a novel strategy for coercing astrocytes to a neuroprotective state by maintaining liver-like detoxification in the brain without producing damaging byproducts.
