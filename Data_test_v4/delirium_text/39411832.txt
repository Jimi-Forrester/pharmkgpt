39411832|a|An anti-inflammatory diet is characterised by incorporating foods with potential anti-inflammatory properties, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, spices, herbs and plant-based protein. Concurrently, pro-inflammatory red and processed meat, refined carbohydrates and saturated fats are limited. This article explores the effects of an anti-inflammatory diet on non-communicable diseases (NCD), concentrating on the underlying mechanisms that connect systemic chronic inflammation, dietary choices and disease outcomes. Chronic inflammation is a pivotal contributor to the initiation and progression of NCD. This review provides an overview of the intricate pathways through which chronic inflammation influences the pathogenesis of conditions including obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, CVD, autoinflammatory diseases, cancer and cognitive disorders. Through a comprehensive synthesis of existing research, we aim to identify some bioactive compounds present in foods deemed anti-inflammatory, explore their capacity to modulate inflammatory pathways and, consequently, to prevent or manage NCD. The findings demonstrated herein contribute to an understanding of the interplay between nutrition, inflammation and chronic diseases, paving a way for future dietary recommendations and research regarding preventive or therapeutic strategies.
