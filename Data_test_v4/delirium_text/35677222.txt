35677222|t|Serum Level of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) Associated with Depression in Patients with Rosacea: A Candidate Predictive Biomarker.
35677222|a|Background: The biomarker to predict the depression in patients with rosacea was absent. Objective: We aimed to explore the potential association between BDNF and depression in patients with rosacea, and also to determine whether serum BDNF level is a potential biomarker for identifying depression in patients with rosacea. Methods: The patients with rosacea, rosacea with depression and healthy control were included, clinical evaluation (DLQI, RSSs, BDI-II) and serum BDNF levels detection were performed on subjects, the comparisons and correlation analysis of the obtained data were performed. Results: In clinical evaluation, whether DLQI or RSSs, rosacea with depression group was significantly higher compared to rosacea group. Besides, we found the serum BDNF levels were lower in patients with rosacea and rosacea with depression compared to healthy controls, also in the rosacea with depression group, serum BDNF levels were lower than in rosacea patients. Whatever in rosacea or rosacea with depression group, the statistical significance of serum BDNF levels between the different subtypes like the ETR and PPR was not found. In further correlation analysis, we found no correlation between serum BDNF and RSSs in patients with rosacea whatever the subtype of ETR or PPR. Interestingly, we found a negative correlation between serum BDNF levels and BDI-II in rosacea with depression group, the decreased serum BDNF levels were associated with the increased BDI-II, also the ROC confirmed it can evaluate the depression in patients with rosacea. Conclusion: Serum BDNF level is a potential biomarker for identifying depression in patients with rosacea.
