36397617|t|Sensorimotor Alterations Induced by Novel Fentanyl Analogs in Mice: Possible Impact on Human Driving Performances.
36397617|a|Operating a vehicle is a complex task that requires multiple cognitive functions and psychomotor skills to cooperate. Driving might be impaired by licit or illicit drugs, including novel psychoactive substances (NPS) and novel synthetic opioids (NSO), the effects of which are still yet to be elucidated in humans. In the present work, a revision of the literature regarding the psychomotor impairing effects of Fentanyl (FENT) and three analogues (Acrylfentanyl, Ocfentanyl and Furanylfentanyl) is presented, as emerged by experimental studies on humans, driving under the influence of a drug (DUID) and intoxication cases. An experimental study on a mouse model evaluated the sensorimotor alterations induced by FENT and the three fentalogs. Acute systemic administration of the four opioids (0.01-15 mg/kg i.p.) dose-dependently decreased the visual object and placing tests, the acoustic and the tactile responses of mice. The preclinical data are in accordance with the data that emerged from the revision of the literature regarding experimental data on humans, driving under the influence of drugs and intoxication cases, suggesting that novel synthetic opioids might affect the psychomotor performances on daily human tasks with a particular focus on driving.
