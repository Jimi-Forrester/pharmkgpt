39516425|t|Neurological, psychological, psychosocial complications of long-COVID and their management.
39516425|a|Since it first appeared, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a significant and lasting negative impact on the health and economies of millions of individuals all over the globe. At the level of individual health too, many patients are not recovering fully and experiencing a long-term condition now commonly termed 'long-COVID'. Long-COVID is a collection of symptoms which must last more than 12 weeks following initial COVID infection, and which cannot be adequately explained by alternate diagnoses. The neurological and psychosocial impact of long-COVID is itself now a global health crisis and therefore preventing, diagnosing, and managing these patients is of paramount importance. This review focuses primarily on: neurological functioning deficits; mental health impacts; long-term mood problems; and associated psychosocial issues, among patients suffering from long-COVID with an eye towards the neurological basis of these symptoms. A concise account of the clinical relevance of the neurological and psychosocial impacts of long-COVID, the effects on long-term morbidity, and varied approaches in managing patients with significant chronic neurological symptoms and conditions was extracted from the literature, analysed and reported. A comprehensive account of plausible pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of long-COVID, its management, and future research needs have been discussed.
