31782342|t|Educational Revolution: Integrating Concept-Based Curriculum and Active Learning for Mental Health Nursing Students.
31782342|a|OBJECTIVE: To disseminate knowledge to mental health nurse educators regarding a course that is successfully preparing registered nurse (RN) students to pass the psychosocial integrity portion of the National Council Licensing Exam for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN). METHOD: Following the implementation of a new concept-based nursing program curricular design, faculty teaching in a psychiatric mental health nursing course embarked on converting lecture-based, content-saturated teaching strategies into active learning strategies. In this article, the overall conceptual framework for the course and specific examples of active learning teaching strategies related to nursing concepts in mental health are described. Information on objectives, clinical placements, testing, class organization, and curricular content are provided. Outcomes are shared revealing success in helping students pass the psychosocial integrity section of the NCLEX-RN. RESULTS: Predictive scores on the HESI RN Psychiatric Mental Health Specialty Exam have been consistently higher than the national average for the United States, and the NCLEX-RN pass rate for the cohort of 90 students was 97%. The majority of student evaluations of the course were positive. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the integration of conceptual and active learning in a psychiatric mental health nursing course may increase the likelihood of student success.
