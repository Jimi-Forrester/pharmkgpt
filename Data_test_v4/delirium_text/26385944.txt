26385944|a|INTRODUCTION: Falls are one of the major problems among the elderly population. It has been established that people with dementia fall down more often. It is believed that this is a consequence of risky decision making by people with dementia resulting from cognitive deterioration. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between cognitive status and postural stability while standing. METHODS: A total of 47 people, aged 71.6 years on average (+-7.2), were divided based on results of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) into a dementia group (MMSE <= 23) and a control group (MMSE > 23). Postural stability was tested using a force plate (with eyes open, with eyes closed, and with visual biofeedback). The parameters of movement of the center of pressure were analyzed. RESULTS: Both in test with eyes open and eyes closed, significant difference was shown between the dementia group and the control groups. In visual feedback test, the dementia group showed 32% poorer performance than the controls. CONCLUSION: The falls experienced in dementia group may be caused by a disturbed balance control process of the central nervous system.
