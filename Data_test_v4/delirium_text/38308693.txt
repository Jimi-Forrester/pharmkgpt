38308693|a|The aggregation, mislocalization, and phosphorylation of TDP-43 are pathologic hallmarks of several neurodegenerative diseases and provide a defining criterion for the neuropathologic diagnosis of Limbic-predominant Age-related TDP-43 Encephalopathy (LATE). LATE neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC) are often comorbid with other neurodegenerative pathologies including Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC). We examined whether TDP-43 regulated cryptic exons accumulate in the hippocampus of neuropathologically confirmed LATE-NC cases. We found that several cryptic RNAs are robustly expressed in LATE-NC cases with or without comorbid ADNC and correlate with pTDP-43 abundance; however, the accumulation of cryptic RNAs is more robust in LATE-NC with comorbid ADNC. Additionally, cryptic RNAs can robustly distinguish LATE-NC from healthy controls and AD cases. These findings expand our current understanding and provide novel potential biomarkers for LATE pathogenesis.
