38114943|t|Association between perioperative blood transfusion and length of hospital stay in patients with osteoporotic fractures.
38114943|a|BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the relationship between perioperative blood transfusion (PBT) and length of hospital stay (LOS) in patients with osteoporotic fractures. This research aims to study the association between PBT and LOS. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study from the Affiliated Kunshan Hospital of Jiangsu University, Suzhou, China, involving 2357 osteoporotic fractures (OPF) patients who received surgical treatment during hospitalization from January 2017 and March 2022. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between PBT and LOS. In the analysis, PBT volume was the dependent variable, whereas LOS was the independent variable. Simultaneously, age, gender, body mass index, hemoglobin, primary diagnosis, American Society of Anesthesiologists, creatinine (Cr), anesthesia, surgical method, and Charlson comorbidity index were included as covariates. The generalized additive model was then used to study nonlinear associations. Two piecewise linear regression exemplary evaluated the inception results for smoothing the curve. RESULTS: Our results proved that PBT was positively correlated with LOS in the fully adjusted model (beta, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.37; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, a "U-shape" nonlinear relationship existed between PBT and LOS. When the concentration of PBT was between 0 and 1.5 units, it was manifested as a negative correlation between PBT and LOS. However, there was a positive association between PBT and LOS when PBT levels exceeded 1.5 units. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that PBT and LOS in the OPF population were independent with a nonlinear relationship. These results suggest that PBT may be protective for patients with long LOS. If these findings are confirmed, the LOS in OPF patients can be regulated through appropriate perioperative blood transfusion.
