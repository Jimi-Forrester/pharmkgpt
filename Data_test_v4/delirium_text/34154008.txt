34154008|a|Demographic change is leading to an increasing number of old patients both in our society and in hospitals. With increasing age, not only the number of pre-existing conditions increases, but also the postoperative complication rate and mortality. Ultimately, however, it is not age that is decisive, but the condition of the patient and his or her capacity to face the physical and mental challenges of a surgical procedure. Frail patients are particularly at risk of complications, and an essential strategy - known as prehabilitation - is to put them in a better state pre-operatively through physical and mental training, as well as nutritional counselling. Delirium is one of the most frequent postoperative complications. Measures such as refraining from premedication with benzodiazepines, measuring the depth of anaesthesia, refraining from long-acting opioids, performing fast-track surgery, and providing glasses/hearing aids quickly postoperatively can reduce the risk of delirium. Close interdisciplinary consultation between surgeons, anaesthetists, geriatricians and physiotherapists is essential to coordinate the perioperative procedure and reduce the perioperative risk for elderly patients.
