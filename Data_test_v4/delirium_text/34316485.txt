34316485|a|The rhizomes of Cnidium officinale Makino have been used as a traditional medicine for many purposes, however, use of its aerial parts is very limited. We investigated the antioxidant properties and protective effects of the aerial parts (leaves and stems) from C. officinale on H2O2-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma. C. officinale methanol extracts (70%) were sequentially fractionated using hexane (non-polar fraction, NF), ethyl acetate (intermediate polar fraction, IF), and water (polar fraction, PF). Total phenolics and flavonoids contents were highest in IF, followed by PF. IF also showed the strongest radical scavenging activities against 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), as well as superoxide, with the half maximal inhibitory concentrations of 13.2, 23.2, and 12.8 mg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, all fractions significantly inhibited linoleic acid peroxidation induced by the Fenton reaction or by UV irradiation. Both PF and IF protected against H2O2-induced SH-SY5Y neuronal cell death by increasing the cell survival by 22.1~47.7 and 35.9~50.3% at concentrations of 25~100 and 25~400 mug/mL, respectively, whereas NF was toxic to the cells at these concentrations. IF also significantly decreased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species by 7.72~47.47% at a concentration of 25~200 mug/mL. Our results indicate that compounds from the aerial parts of C. officinale have potent antioxidant activities, which may help rescue neuronal cells from oxidative stress-induced injury. Therefore, the aerial parts, as well as the rhizomes, of C. officinale may have medicinal applications.
