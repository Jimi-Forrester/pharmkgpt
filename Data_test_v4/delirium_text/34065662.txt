34065662|t|Spatiotemporal Patterns of Menin Localization in Developing Murine Brain: Co-Expression with the Elements of Cholinergic Synaptic Machinery.
34065662|a|Menin, a product of MEN1 (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1) gene is an important regulator of tissue development and maintenance; its perturbation results in multiple tumors-primarily of the endocrine tissue. Despite its abundance in the developing central nervous system (CNS), our understanding of menin's role remains limited. Recently, we discovered menin to play an important role in cholinergic synaptogenesis in the CNS, whereas others have shown its involvement in learning, memory, depression and apoptosis. For menin to play these important roles in the CNS, its expression patterns must be corroborated with other components of the synaptic machinery imbedded in the learning and memory centers; this, however, remains to be established. Here, we report on the spatio-temporal expression patterns of menin, which we found to exhibit dynamic distribution in the murine brain from early development, postnatal period to a fully-grown adult mouse brain. We demonstrate here that menin expression is initially widespread in the brain during early embryonic stages, albeit with lower intensity, as determined by immunohistochemistry and gene expression. With the progression of development, however, menin expression became highly localized to learning, memory and cognition centers in the CNS. In addition to menin expression patterns throughout development, we provide the first direct evidence for its co-expression with nicotinic acetylcholine, glutamate and GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) receptors-concomitant with the expression of both postsynaptic (postsynaptic density protein PSD-95) and presynaptic (synaptotagamin) proteins. This study is thus the first to provide detailed analysis of spatio-temporal patterns of menin expression from initial CNS development to adulthood. When taken together with previously published studies, our data underscore menin's importance in the cholinergic neuronal network assembly underlying learning, memory and cognition.
