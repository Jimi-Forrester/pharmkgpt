33894910|a|The Alzheimer's plans have led to significant progress in the care management of elderly people suffering from Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia, but the medical and social network remains fragmented in geriatrics. We have proposed to caregivers a monthly videoconference combining expert presentations and discussion of clinical cases. Several health professions were represented. The main positive point was the time saved. The videoconferencing improved multidisciplinary exchanges, especially for patients with complex problems and their families.
