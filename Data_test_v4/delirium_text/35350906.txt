35350906|t|Clinical decision support system for early detection of Alzheimer's disease using an enhanced gradient boosted decision tree classifier.
35350906|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia contributing to more than 70% of the cases. The factors accounting for the cause and progression of neurodegenerative diseases like AD are primarily genetic, in addition to life style and environmental factors. Early and accurate diagnoses of AD empower practitioners to take timely clinical decisions and preventive actions. This being the motivation, the work proposes a novel pattern matching and scoring method on genetic material towards devising an effective classifier. We propose a distinctive disease causing gene sequence pattern identification using suffix trees as a base detection model with an accuracy of 91.5% in linear time complexity. A scoring mechanism is implemented to assign scores to genes based on the severity of the disease causing and disease resistant Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms associated with the genes. These scores are then used as a remarkable feature in the gradient boosted decision tree classifier to enhance the classification of AD versus healthy control. The efficiency of the proposed gene powered EGBDT classifier is evaluated on ADNI benchmark data set with the prediction accuracy of 94.16% and is found to be efficient compared to the recent works in the literature.
