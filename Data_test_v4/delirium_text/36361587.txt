36361587|a|Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) remains a global health challenge with poor prognosis and high mortality. FKBP1A was first discovered as a receptor for the immunosuppressant drug FK506 in immune cells and is critical for various tumors and cancers. However, the relationships between FKBP1A expression, cellular distribution, tumor immunity, and prognosis in LIHC remain unclear. Here, we investigated the expression level of FKBP1A and its prognostic value in LIHC via multiple datasets including ONCOMINE, TIMER, GEPIA, UALCAN, HCCDB, Kaplan-Meier plotter, LinkedOmics, and STRING. Human liver tissue microarray was employed to analyze the characteristics of FKBP1A protein including the expression level and pathological alteration in cellular distribution. FKBP1A expression was significantly higher in LIHC and correlated with tumor stage, grade and metastasis. The expression level of the FKBP1A protein was also increased in LIHC patients along with its accumulation in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). High FKBP1A expression was correlated with a poor survival rate in LIHC patients. The analysis of gene co-expression and the regulatory pathway network suggested that FKBP1A is mainly involved in protein synthesis, metabolism and the immune-related pathway. FKBP1A expression had a significantly positive association with the infiltration of hematopoietic immune cells including B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Moreover, M2 macrophage infiltration was especially associated with a poor survival prognosis in LIHC. Furthermore, FKBP1A expression was significantly positively correlated with the expression of markers of M2 macrophages and immune checkpoint proteins such as PD-L1, CTLA-4, LAG3 and HAVCR2. Our study demonstrated that FKBP1A could be a potential prognostic target involved in tumor immune cell infiltration in LIHC.
