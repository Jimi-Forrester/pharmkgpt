29532412|t|Comparative study of selective in vitro and in silico BACE1 inhibitory potential of glycyrrhizin together with its metabolites, 18alpha- and 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, isolated from Hizikia fusiformis.
29532412|a|Hizikia fusiformis (Harvey) Okamura is a brown seaweed widely used in Korea and Japan, and it contains different therapeutically active constituents. In the present study, we investigated the activities of glycyrrhizin isolated from H. fusiformis, including its metabolites, 18alpha- and 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid against Alzheimer's disease (AD) via acetyl and butyrylcholinesterase and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibition. Among these three compounds, 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (IC50 = 8.93 +- 0.69 microM) demonstrated two fold potent activity against BACE1 compared to the positive control, quercetin (IC50 = 20.18 +- 0.79 microM). Additionally, glycyrrhizin with an IC50 value of 20.12 +- 1.87 microM showed similarity to quercetin, while 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid showed moderate activity (IC50 = 104.35 +- 2.84 microM). A kinetic study revealed that glycyrrhizin and 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid were non-competitive and competitive inhibitiors of BACE1, demonstrated via K i values of 16.92 and 10.91 microM, respectively. Molecular docking simulation studies evidently revealed strong binding energy of these compounds for BACE1, indicating their high affinity and capacity for tighter binding to the active site of the enzyme. These data suggest that glycyrrhizin isolated from the edible seaweed, H. fusiformis and its metabolite, 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid demonstrated selective inhibitory activity against BACE1 to alleviate AD.
