32308053|t|An overview on natural farnesyltransferase inhibitors for efficient cancer therapy.
32308053|a|As one of the world's five terminally ills, tumours can cause important genetic dysfunction. However, some current medicines for tumours usually have strong toxic side effects and are prone to drug resistance. Studies have found that farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) extracted from natural materials have a good inhibiting ability on tumours with fewer side effects. This article describes several FTIs extracted from natural materials and clarifies the current research progress, which provides a new choice for the treatment of tumours.
