39023695|t|Delirium prevalence and delirium literacy across Italian hospital wards: a secondary analysis of data from the World Delirium Awareness Day 2023.
39023695|a|PURPOSE: Delirium, a common medical emergency among hospitalized patients, requires effective detection and management protocols. This study aims to evaluate the delirium point prevalence and its management across Italian hospitals, categorized by delirium literacy levels. Additionally, it seeks to identify prevailing barriers and future priorities in delirium practice and research. METHODS: We analyzed data from World Delirium Awareness Day (WDAD) on March 15th, 2023, collected by participating clinicians in Italian hospitals. High delirium literacy (HL) was determined based on the use of validated delirium assessment tools and the presence of a written protocol for delirium management. Conversely, low delirium literacy (LL) was determined by meeting only one or neither of these criteria. RESULTS: Fifty-eight hospital wards participated in the survey, with 25 (43.1%) classified as HL. The overall reported point prevalence of delirium was found to be approximately 10%. Notably, the reported prevalence was twice as high in the HL group compared to the LL group. Despite minimal differences compared to the other group, the HL group demonstrated greater adherence to appropriate delirium management strategies, encompassing both non-pharmacological and pharmacological strategies. Critical gaps in delirium care emerged, including suboptimal management practices, barriers to implementing evidence-based strategies, and insufficient awareness and training among professionals. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the suboptimal identification and management of delirium among Italian hospitals, emphasizing the necessity of enhancing awareness and implementing evidence-based strategies. Addressing these shortcomings is crucial for optimizing delirium care, improving patient outcomes, and mitigating the burden of delirium in hospital settings.
