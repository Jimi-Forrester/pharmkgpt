39152330|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore retinal changes in patients with Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) using Spectral Domain-Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) and Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA), aiming to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring. METHODS: A cross-sectional study analyzed 15 DLB patients and 18 matched controls. Participants underwent physical, neurological, neuropsychological, and ophthalmological evaluations, including SD-OCT and OCTA. Logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, and inter-eye correlation, was employed to identify retinal alterations in patients affected by DLB. RESULTS: OCTA revealed that DLB is associated with reduced superficial and deep vessel densities (SVD and DVD) in the macula (p < 0.01), as well as decreased peripapillary vessel density (ppVD, p < 0.01). SD-OCT parameters showed correlations with DLB, including reduced central macular thickness (CMT, p < 0.001) and thinning of the ganglion cell layer-inner plexiform layer (GCL-IPL, p < 0.01). Logistic regression (R2=0.26) identified reduced ppVD as a significant predictor of DLB (p = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Impairments in retinal capillaries, especially lower ppVD, might mirror cerebral hypoperfusion in DLB, potentially due to reduced Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) levels and increased alpha-synuclein. Further investigations are warranted to confirm the causal relationship between these observations, disease severity, and progression, as well as their potential role as biomarkers for DLB.
