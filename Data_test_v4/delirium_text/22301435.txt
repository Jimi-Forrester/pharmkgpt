22301435|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: To address the clinical neurocognitive roles of nerve growth factor (NGF) genetic polymorphism in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (A-MCI), we investigated the association between this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and executive dysfunction as a nonmemory cognitive impairment. METHODS: Among 200 outpatients with dementia and MCI whose NGF SNP rs6330 genotype was identified, those with A-MCI (n = 35) and early-stage AD (n = 67) were recruited and divided into three groups according to genotype (C/C: n = 58, C/T: n = 39, T/T: n = 5). Then, the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) scores were compared among the three (C/C, C/T, T/T) or two (C/C, T carrier) genotype groups. RESULTS: Among the subtests, a significant difference was only noted for the go/no-go scores (p < 0.01) between C/C and T carriers. However, no significant differences in the demographic variables and other neuropsychological subtest scores reflecting attentional and memory function were observed among the genotypes. CONCLUSION: Regarding the functional roles of neurotrophin polymorphisms as they relate to executive dysfunction, the NGF gene rs6330 might influence the inhibition task in Japanese patients with early-stage AD or A-MCI.
