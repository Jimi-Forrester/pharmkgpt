26064386|a|The aim of this observational study was to investigate the occurrence of post operation delirium in the elderly patients undergoing the transurethral prostatectomy and to identify these factors associated with the delirium. 485 patients, undergoing the transurethral prostatectomy, were selected. Demographics, medical, cognitive and functional data, IPSS and NIH-CPSI score were collected as predictors for delirium. After surgery, the patients were divided on the basis of delirium onset within one week observation period, and the delirium was diagnosed by the Confusion Assessment Method. Totally, 21.23% (103) subjects were identified as the delirium and it lasted 2.9 +- 0.8 days. Patients with post operation delirium were significantly older and single, widowed and divorced, had a previous history of prehospitalization, were with the poor International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) score, were more impaired in the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and had poor clock drawing test (CDT) and geriatric depression scale (GDS) score. Age, marital status, IPSS and NIH-CPIS score, cognitive and functional status and previous history of hospitalization are the predictors of post operation delirium. Our study has implications in preventing delirium via an early and targeted evaluation.
