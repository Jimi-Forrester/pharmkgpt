35760688|a|BACKGROUND: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients are prone to develop persistent symptoms and to show reduced quality of life following hospital admission. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital from March 1 to April 30, 2020. The primary outcome was to compare health related quality of life and persistent symptoms six months after hospital admission, of COVID-19 patients who required ICU admission with those who did not. RESULTS: Among the 242 patients hospitalized during the defined period of time, 44 (18.2%) needed ICU admission. Forty (16.5%) patients died during hospital admission. Two hundred and two (83.5%) patients were discharged alive from the hospital. At six months, 183 (75.6%) patients completed the questionnaires (32 ICU patients and 151 non ICU patients). Ninety-six (52.4%) reported decreased quality of life and 143 (78.1%) described persistent symptoms. More ICU patients showed worsening of their quality of life (71.9% vs 43.7%, P=0.004). There were no differences in the proportion of patients with persistent symptoms between ICU and non ICU patients (87.5% vs 76.2%, P=0.159). ICU patients showed more frequently dyspnea on exertion (78.1% vs 47.7%, P=0.02), dyspnea on light exertion (37.5% vs 4.6%, P<0.001), and asthenia (56.3 vs 29.1, P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of COVID-19 needing hospitalization had persistent symptoms and a decline in the quality of life. ICU patients referred a large decrease of their quality of life compared with non ICU patients.
