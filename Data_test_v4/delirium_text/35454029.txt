35454029|a|This study aims to evaluate significant gene expression in severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in newborns, which can be used as a predictable measure for high-risk HIE infants. The study prospectively recruited 77 inborn near-term or term HIE newborns between January 2018 and December 2020. We measured six different genes within 6 h of life among the HIE infants and compared the gene levels between the mild- and severe-HIE groups. Among these, 64 HIE infants (83.1%) did not receive therapeutic hypothermia (TH) because they were categorized as mild HIE, and the 13 remaining (16.9%) infants were categorized as >= moderate-HIE group and received TH. More abnormal MRI findings, seizure, and use of anti-convulsant were more found in the >= moderate = HIE group along with longer mechanical ventilation days and hospitalization. Heat-shock protein 70 family 1 A (HSPA1A) and serpin family H member 1 (SERPINH1) genes, which encode heat-shock protein (HSP) 70 and 47, respectively, were significantly elevated in the >= moderate-HIE, seizure, and abnormal MRI groups. HSP 70 and 47 were significantly elevated in the severe-HIE group, possibly playing protective roles in inhibiting exacerbated neuroinflammation and maintaining a cellular homeostasis. At 18-24 months, >= moderate-HIE group manifested a significant language delay.
