24928620|t|Intranasally-administered deferoxamine mitigates toxicity of 6-OHDA in a rat model of Parkinson s disease.
24928620|a|Deferoxamine (DFO) has shown therapeutic promise for the treatment of Parkinson s disease (PD) as it has reduced both behavioral and biochemical deficits when injected into the brain of rodent models of PD. Intranasally administered DFO targets the brain directly but non-invasively and has been effective in animal models of stroke and Alzheimer s disease. In this study we sought to determine whether intranasal (IN) DFO could be neuroprotective for PD in a rat model. PD was induced with a unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle, while sham surgery rats received saline injections. Rats were pre-treated three times with either IN DFO or saline (starting 4 days before 6-OHDA), and post-treated twice/wk for one month before behavioral tests. In the apomorphine-induced rotational test, IN DFO significantly decreased the number of contralateral turns after injection of apomorphine HCl (p<0.05). Also, IN DFO significantly decreased limb asymmetry in the rearing tube as measured with contralateral limb touches (p<0.05). The IN DFO treatment yielded a trend towards decreased contralateral foot-slips on the tapered balance beam, though the difference was not significant. Finally, IN DFO-treated rats had increased preservation of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons in the substantia nigra (p<0.05). These results confirm that DFO is beneficial in a 6-OHDA model and demonstrate improvement in motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal survival with non-invasive intranasal delivery, making this an attractive potential treatment for PD.
