38839386|t|Early predictive value of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase for 28-day mortality in cardiac arrest patients: study protocol for a prospective study.
38839386|a|INTRODUCTION: Public training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and treatment in emergency and intensive care unit have made tremendous progress. However, cardiac arrest remains a major health burden worldwide, with brain damage being a significant contributor to disability and mortality. Lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS), which is mainly localised in the central nervous system, has been previously shown to inhibit postischemia neuronal apoptosis. Therefore, we aim to observe whether serum L-PGDS can serve as a potential biomarker and explore its role in determining the severity and prognosis of patients who have achieved restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a prospective observational study. The participants (n = 60) who achieve ROSC will be distributed into two groups (non-survivor and survivor) based on 28-day survival. Healthy volunteers (n = 30) will be enrolled as controls. Each individual's relevant information will be extracted from Electronic Medical Record System in Xinhua Hospital, including demographic characteristics, clinical data, laboratory findings and so on. On days 1, 3 and 7 after ROSC, blood samples will be drawn and batch tested on the level of serum neuron-specific enolase, soluble protein 100beta, L-PGDS, procalcitonin, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. The cerebral performance category score was assessed on the 28th day after ROSC. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was performed with the approval of the Clinical Ethical Committee of Xinhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (Approval No. XHEC-C-2023-130-1). The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2300078564).
