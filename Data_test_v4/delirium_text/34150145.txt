34150145|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of dezocine on pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) and Ramsay sedation scores in patients undergoing Nuss procedures (minimally invasive surgery for repairing pectus excavatum). METHODS: Altogether, 100 patients with pectus excavatum who underwent Nuss procedures in our hospital were selected and randomly divided into group A (n=50) and group B (n=50). General anesthesia was carried out for each patient, with an anaesthetic of sufentanil for group A, and dezocine plus sufentanil for group B. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score and Ramsay sedation score were recorded at extubation (T0), 10 min after extubation (T1), 20 min after extubation (T2), 30 min after extubation (T3) and 60 min after extubation (T4) for assessment of pain intensity and sedative effect; PAED scale score was applied to observe the emergence delirium at awakening, 15 min after awakening and 30 min after awakening. Quality of recovery-15 (QoR-15) scale score was used to evaluate the quality of early rehabilitation 1 d after operation and 2 d after operation. The occurrence of adverse reactions was recorded. RESULTS: The VAS scores at T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4 in group B were lower than those in group A, and there was statistical significance between group A and group B (P<0.001). VAS scores at T1, T2 and T3 were lower than those recorded at T0 in both groups (P<0.01), while no significant difference was noted at other time points (P>0.05). Ramsay sedation scores were increased at T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4 in group B in comparison to that in group A (all P<0.001), while the scores recorded at T4 in group A and T3 and T4 in group B were increased compared with those recorded at T0 (all P<0.01), and there was no significant difference at other time points (all P>0.05). Compared with group A, PAED scores in group B were downregulated at each time point after wakening up (all P<0.01), while QoR-15 scores in group B were increased at 1 d and 2 d after surgery (all P<0.05); there was no significant difference in adverse reactions between the two groups (all P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Sufentanil combined with dezocine is efficacious in general analgesia and sedation, which can reduce emergence agitation, improves the quality of rehabilitation and is relatively safe for patients undergoing minimally invasive repairing of pectus excavatum.
