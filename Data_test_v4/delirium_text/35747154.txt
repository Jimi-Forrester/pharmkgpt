35747154|t|Luteolin suppresses TNF-alpha-induced inflammatory injury and senescence of nucleus pulposus cells via the Sirt6/NF-kappaB pathway.
35747154|a|Luteolin (3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxy flavone) is a flavonoid, which is widely distributed in various plants including flowers, vegetables, and medicinal herbs and spices. Luteolin can be applied in the treatment of various diseases due to its multiple biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antioxidative activity. However, its role in intervertebral disc degeneration has not been previously reported. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to explore the effects of luteolin on Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced inflammatory injury and senescence of human nucleus pulposus cells (HNPCs), as well as the underlying mechanisms of action of this compound. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by MTT assay and TUNEL staining, respectively. ELISA kits were applied to detect the levels of inflammatory cytokines and the activity of telomerase. Senescence beta-galactosidase staining was used to detect the activity levels of beta-galactosidase in the cells. Cell transfection was performed to achieve interference of sirtuin 6 (Sirt6). The protein expression levels were detected by western blot analysis. TUNEL staining and western blot analysis were performed to assess the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins. The results indicated that TNF-alpha induced a significant decrease in HNPC viability and an increase in inflammatory factor levels, while the application of luteolin effectively increased cell viability and decreased intracellular interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 expression levels. Furthermore, luteolin decreased apoptosis compared with the TNF-alpha groups in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the results of the detection kits suggested that luteolin reversed TNF-alpha-induced senescence. Notably, interference with Sirt6 partially reduced the protective effect of luteolin on TNF-alpha-induced HNPC senescence via the Sirt6/NF-kappaB pathway. In summary, the data indicated that luteolin suppresses TNF-alpha-induced inflammatory injury and senescence of HNPCs via the Sirt6/NF-kappaB pathway.
