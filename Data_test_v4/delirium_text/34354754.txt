34354754|t|Mortality Rates during Hospitalization and Affecting Factors in Geriatric Delirium Patients: a Retrospective Cohort Study.
34354754|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of mortality during hospitalization among patients diagnosed with delirium at geriatric consultations requested in the previous one year, together with the factors affecting this. METHODS: The electronic medical records of geriatric consultations requested from the psychiatry department between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019 were examined from the automation system. The 200 geriatric delirium patients were included in the study. Patients' age, sex, length of hospital stay (LOHS), time between hospitalization and consultation, the department requesting consultation, reason for consultation request, psychiatric recommendations after consultation, reason for hospitalization, number of comorbid medical diseases, number of daily medications used, and history of psychiatric disease were retrieved from the electronic medical records in the automation system. RESULTS: LOHS and time from hospitalization to consultation were longer in the exitus group. Numbers of comorbid disease and daily medications used were higher in the died patients. Male gender, higher numbers of comorbid diseases, and daily medications were predictors of death. CONCLUSIONS: Early detection of delirium may be important for short term results of disease. When evaluating these patients, reviewing the drugs used as much as possible can affect the outcome of the disease.
