36342537|t|Does pericapsular nerve group block have limited analgesia at the initial post-operative period? Systematic review and meta-analysis.
36342537|a|Perioperative pain management related to hip surgical procedures is challenging. Pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block is a novel technique that is assumed to provide better analgesia in addition to its post-operative motor-sparing effect. In this review, we aim to assess the safety and efficacy of PENG block on pain management in patients undergoing hip surgeries. Fifteen clinical trials with a total of 837 patients were included. Pain scores favored PENG group when compared to FICB group (fascia iliaca compartment block) or analgesics-only group, but the difference could only be detected in the early post-operative period. Afterward, it seems to lose its superiority, and no difference could be detected. In addition, cumulative opioid consumption favored PENG group at 24 h but not at 48 h. Regarding patients' satisfaction, our analysis showed results favoring PENG group, but there was no difference in time to first opioid or length of hospital stay. The incidence of vomiting was lower in PENG, but there was no difference in the incidence of nausea, pruritis, and dizziness. PENG provides better analgesia and lower opioid consumption in the initial post-operative period. Current evidence is not enough, and further high-quality randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are required.
