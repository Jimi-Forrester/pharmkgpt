21986527|a|Deposition of amyloid fibrils consisting of amyloid beta (Abeta) protein as senile plaques in the brain is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. However, a growing body of evidence shows that soluble Abeta oligomers correlate better with dementia than fibrils, suggesting that Abeta oligomers may be the primary toxic species. The structure and oligomerization mechanism of these Abeta oligomers are crucial for developing effective therapeutics. Here we investigated the oligomerization of Abeta42 in the context of a fusion protein containing GroES and ubiquitin fused to the N-terminus of Abeta sequence. The presence of fusion protein partners, in combination with a denaturing buffer containing 8M urea at pH 10, is unfavorable for Abeta42 aggregation, thus allowing only the most stable structures to be observed. Transmission electron microscopy showed that Abeta42 fusion protein formed globular oligomers, which bound weakly to thioflavin T and Congo red. SDS-PAGE shows that Abeta42 fusion protein formed SDS-resistant hexamers and tetramers. In contrast, Abeta40 fusion protein remained as monomers on SDS gel, suggesting that the oligomerization of Abeta42 fusion protein is not due to the fusion protein partners. Cysteine scanning mutagenesis at 22 residue positions further revealed that single cysteine substitutions of the C-terminal hydrophobic residues (I31, I32, L34, V39, V40, and I41) led to disruption of hexamer and tetramer formation, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions between these residues are most critical for Abeta42 oligomerization.
