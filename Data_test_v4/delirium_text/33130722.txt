33130722|t|[Covering Suture Line Using Bovine Pericardium during Mitral Valve Replacement for Third Time Infectious Endocarditis;Report of a Case].
33130722|a|A 33-year-old man presenting with fever, fatigue, and delirium was diagnosed with infectious endocarditis(IE). He had already undergone surgery for IE twice;initial valve repair 4 years ago and mitral valve replacement(MVR) 1 year later. He has refractory atopic dermatitis, which was considered to be the cause of his repeated IE. Initially, antibiotics were administered but the infection was not controlled. Therefore, we decided to perform the 3rd surgery. MVR was performed, and using bovine pericardium, we covered valve cuff and suture felts to separete these parts from blood stream. Postoperative echocardiography showed good prosthetic valve motion without transvalvular regurgitation or paravalvular leak. He was discharged on the 39th postoperative day and has been doing well for 2 years since.
