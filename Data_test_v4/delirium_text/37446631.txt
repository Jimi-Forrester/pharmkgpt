37446631|a|AIM: Drug abuse and addiction are major public health concerns, with millions of people worldwide affected by the negative consequences of drug use. To better understand this complex issue, a review was conducted to examine the mechanisms of action and effects of drugs of abuse, including their acute and chronic effects, the symptoms of abstinence syndrome, as well as their cardiovascular impacts. METHODS: The analyzed data were obtained after surveying an electronic database, namely PubMed, with no time limit, grey literature sources, and reference lists of relevant articles. RESULTS: The review highlights the different categories of drugs of abuse, such as opioids, stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and cannabis, and discusses the specific ways that each drug affects the brain and body. Additionally, the review explores the short-term and long-term effects of drug abuse on the body and mind, including changes in brain structure and function, physical health problems, and mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. In addition, the review explores the effects of drug abuse on cardiovascular health, focusing on electrocardiogram changes. Moreover, the analysis of relevant literature also highlighted possible genetic susceptibility in various addictions. Furthermore, the review delves into the withdrawal symptoms that occur when someone stops using drugs of abuse after a period of chronic use. CONCLUSION: Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on drug abuse and addiction. The findings of this review can inform the development of evidence-based prevention and intervention strategies to address this critical public health issue.
