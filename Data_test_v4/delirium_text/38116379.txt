38116379|a|Objective: Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) accounts for approximately 50%-70% of all dementia cases and poses a significant burden on existing medical systems. Identifying an optimal strategy for preventing VCI and developing efficient symptomatic treatments remains a significant challenge. Syndrome differentiation represents a fundamental approach for personalized diagnosis and treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and aligns with the principles of precision medicine. The objective of this study was to elucidate the metabolic characteristics of VCI based on TCM syndrome differentiation, thus providing novel insights into the diagnosis and treatment of VCI. Methods: A 2-year cross-sectional cognitive survey was conducted in four communities in Beijing between September 2020 and November 2022. The syndrome differentiation of participants was based on the Kidney-Yang Deficiency Syndrome Scale (KYDSS), which was originally developed by Delphi expert consultation. The identification of serum metabolites was performed by Ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analysis coupled with an electrospray ionization quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ESI-QTOF MS). Multivariate, univariate, and pathway analyses were used to investigate metabolic changes. Logistic regression models were also used to construct metabolite panels that were capable of discerning distinct groups. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) levels were measured by a commercial ELISA kit. Results: A total of 2,337 residents completed the survey, and the prevalence of VCI was 9.84%. Of the patients with VCI, those with Kidney-Yang deficiency syndrome (VCIS) accounted for 70.87% of cases and exhibited more severe cognitive impairments. A total of 80 participants were included in metabolomics study, including 30 with VCIS, 20 without Kidney-Yang deficiency syndrome (VCINS), and 30 healthy control participants (C). Ultimately, 45 differential metabolites were identified when comparing the VCIS group with group C, 65 differential metabolites between the VCINS group and group C, and 27 differential metabolites between the VCIS group and the VCINS group. The downregulation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) along with the upregulation of lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), phosphatidic acid (PA) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) can be considered as the general metabolic characteristics associated with VCI. Dysfunction of glycerophospholipids, particularly LPEs and PCs, was identified as a key metabolic characteristic of VCIS. In particular Glycerophospho-N-Arachidonoyl Ethanolamine (GP-NArE) was discovered for the first time in VCI patients and is considered to represent a potential biomarker for VCIS. The upregulation of PLA2 expression was implicated in the induction of alterations in glycerophospholipid metabolism in both VCIS and VCINS. Moreover, robust diagnostic models were established based on these metabolites, achieving high AUC values of 0.9322, 0.9550, and 0.9450, respectively. Conclusion: These findings contribute valuable information relating to the intricate relationship between metabolic disorders in VCI, neurodegeneration and vascular/neuroinflammation. Our findings also provide a TCM perspective for the precise diagnosis and treatment of VCI in the context of precision medicine.
