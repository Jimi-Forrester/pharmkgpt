35346297|t|Can really plasma interleukin-6 predict postoperative delirium among patients undergoing open repair surgery of acute type A aortic dissection?
35346297|a|The letter to the editor was written in response to "Plasma interleukin-6 is a potential predictive biomarker for postoperative delirium (POD) among acute type a aortic dissection patients treated with open surgical repair", which is recently published by Lv et al. (J Cardiothorac Surg 16(1):146, 2021). In this article, Lv et al. conclude that plasma IL-6 is a potential biomarker for prediction of POD. However, we note several issues in this study that would have made interpretation of their results questionable. Our main concerns include the use of a short POD assessment time, no providing the data of analgesics and sedatives used in the ICU, application of incorrect statistical methods when assessing predictive ability of plasma IL-6 for the development of POD, and incorrect interpretation for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We believe that addressing these issues will improve the transparency of this study and help the interpretation of findings.
