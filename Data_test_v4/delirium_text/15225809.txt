15225809|a|Although it was originally proposed that the major role of calbindin is to facilitate the vitamin D dependent movement of calcium through the cytosolic compartment of the intestinal or renal cell, we found that calbindin also has a major role in different cell types in protecting against apoptotic cell death. Calbindin, which buffers calcium, can inhibit apoptosis induced by different proapoptotic stimuli. Expression of calbindin-D(28k) in neural cell suppressed the proapoptotic actions of presenilin-1, which is causally linked to familial Alzheimer's disease, by preventing calcium mediated mitochondrial damage and the subsequent release of cytochrome c. Calbindin, by buffering intracellular calcium can also protect HEK 293 kidney cells from parathyroid hormone induced apoptosis that was found to be mediated by a phospholipase C dependent increase in intracellular calcium. In addition, cytokine mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells can be prevented by calbindin. Induction by cytokines of nitric oxide, peroxynitrite and lipid hydroperoxide production was significantly decreased in calbindin expressing beta cells. Thus, calbindin-D(28k), by inhibiting free radical formation, can protect islet beta cells from autoimmune destruction in type 1 diabetes. Calbindin-D(28k) can also protect against apoptosis in bone cells. Calbindin was found to block apoptosis in osteocytic and osteoblastic cells. Our findings suggest that calbindin is capable of directly inhibiting the activity of caspase-3, a common downstream effector of multiple apoptotic signaling pathways, and that this inhibition results in an inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) and glucocorticoid induced apoptosis in bone cells. Thus, while part of calbindin's protective effect may result from buffering rises in intracellular calcium, other mechanisms of action, such as inhibition of caspase activity, also play a significant role in the prevention of apoptosis by calbindin-D(28k). These findings have implications for the prevention of degeneration in different cell types and therefore could prove important for the therapeutic intervention of many diseases, including diabetes and osteoporosis.
