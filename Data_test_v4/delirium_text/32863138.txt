32863138|t|Cognitive Decline in Mild Cognitive Impairment With Lewy Bodies or Alzheimer Disease: A Prospective Cohort Study.
32863138|a|OBJECTIVE: We explored whether the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stages of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer disease (AD) differ in their cognitive profiles, and longitudinal progression. DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal design was utilized with annual follow-up (Max 5 years, Mean 1.9, standard deviation 1.1) after diagnosis. Participants underwent repeated cognitive testing, and review of their clinical diagnosis and symptoms, including evaluation of core features of DLB. SETTING: This was an observational study of independently living individuals, recruited from local healthcare trusts in North East England, UK. PARTICIPANTS: An MCI cohort (n = 76) aged >=60 years was utilized, differentially diagnosed with MCI due to AD (MCI-AD), or possible/probable MCI with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB). MEASUREMENTS: A comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological testing battery was administered, including ACE-R, trailmaking tests, FAS verbal fluency, and computerized battery of attention and perception tasks. RESULTS: Probable MCI-LB presented with less impaired recognition memory than MCI-AD, greater initial impairments in verbal fluency and perception of line orientation, and thereafter demonstrated an expedited decline in visuo-constructional functions in the ACE-R compared to MCI-AD. No clear diagnostic group differences were found in deterioration speeds for global cognition, language, overall memory, attention or other executive functions. CONCLUSION: These findings provide further evidence for differences in severity and decline of visuospatial dysfunctions in DLB compared with AD; further exploration is required to clarify when and how differences in attention, executive, and memory functions emerge, as well as speed of decline to dementia.
