23210724|a|UNLABELLED:  BACKGROUND: Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) is the main component of extraneuronal senile plaques typical of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Although Abeta is produced by normal neurons, it is shown to accumulate in large amounts within neuronal lysosomes in AD. We have recently shown that under normal conditions the majority of Abeta is localized extralysosomally, while oxidative stress significantly increases intralysosomal Abeta content through activation of macroautophagy. It is also suggested that impaired Abeta secretion and resulting intraneuronal increase of Abeta can contribute to AD pathology. However, it is not clear how Abeta is distributed inside normal neurons, and how this distribution is effected when Abeta secretion is inhibited. METHODS: Using retinoic acid differentiated neuroblastoma cells and neonatal rat cortical neurons, we studied intracellular distribution of Abeta by double immunofluorescence microscopy for Abeta40 or Abeta42 and different organelle markers. In addition, we analysed the effect of tetanus toxin-induced exocytosis inhibition on the intracellular distribution of Abeta. RESULTS: Under normal conditions, Abeta was found in the small cytoplasmic granules in both neurites and perikarya. Only minor portion of Abeta was colocalized with trans-Golgi network, Golgi-derived vesicles, early and late endosomes, lysosomes, and synaptic vesicles, while the majority of Abeta granules were not colocalized with any of these structures. Furthermore, treatment of cells with tetanus toxin significantly increased the amount of intracellular Abeta in both perikarya and neurites. Finally, we found that tetanus toxin increased the levels of intralysosomal Abeta although the majority of Abeta still remained extralysosomally. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that most Abeta is not localized to Golgi-related structures, endosomes, lysosomes secretory vesicles or other organelles, while the suppression of Abeta secretion increases intracellular intra- and extralysosomal Abeta.
