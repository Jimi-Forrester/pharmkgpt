37030245|a|BACKGROUND: Physiotherapy (PT) is important to optimize functional recovery in geriatric rehabilitation. The dose of PT received by inpatients during geriatric rehabilitation and the determinants of dose are unknown. OBJECTIVES: Describe PT dose in terms of total number of sessions, frequency, duration and type of sessions, and inpatient characteristics determining the frequency of PT in geriatric rehabilitation. METHODS: The observational, longitudinal REStORing health of acutely unwell adulTs (RESORT) cohort consists of geriatric inpatients undergoing rehabilitation including PT (Melbourne, Australia). Ordinal regression was used to assess the determinants of PT frequency (total number of sessions divided by length of stay in weeks). Malnutrition, frailty and sarcopenia were diagnosed according to the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition criteria, Clinical Frailty Scale and revised definition of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People respectively. RESULTS: Of the 1890 participants, 1799, median (quartile 1; quartile 3) age 83.4 (77.6; 88.4) years, 56% females received PT and were admitted for at least 5 days. Median total number of PT sessions was 15 (8; 24); median frequency was 5.2 sessions per week (3.0; 7.7); and duration was 27 (22; 34) minutes per session. Higher disease burden, cognitive impairment, delirium, higher anxiety and depression scores, malnutrition, frailty and sarcopenia were associated with a lower PT frequency. Older age, female sex, musculoskeletal reason for admission, greater independence in (instrumental) activities of daily living and handgrip strength were associated with a higher PT frequency. CONCLUSIONS: PT frequency varied widely with a median of 1 session per working day. PT frequency was lowest in participants with poorest health characteristics.
