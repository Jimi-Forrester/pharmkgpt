38328231|t|Identification of CK2alpha' selective inhibitors by the screening of an allosteric-kinase-inhibitor-like compound library.
38328231|a|Protein Kinase CK2 is a holoenzyme composed of two regulatory subunits (CK2beta) and two catalytic subunits (CK2alpha and CK2alpha'). CK2 controls several cellular processes including proliferation, inflammation, and cell death. However, CK2alpha and CK2alpha' possess different expression patterns and substrates and therefore impact each of these processes differently. Elevated CK2alpha participates in the development of cancer, while increased CK2alpha' has been associated with neurodegeneration, especially Huntington's disease (HD). HD is a fatal disease for which no effective therapies are available. Genetic deletion of CK2alpha' in HD mouse models has ameliorated neurodegeneration. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of CK2alpha' presents a promising therapeutic strategy for treating HD. However, current CK2 inhibitors are unable to discriminate between CK2alpha and CK2alpha' due to their high structural homology, especially in the targeted ATP binding site. Using computational analyses, we found a potential Type IV ("D" pocket) allosteric site on CK2alpha' that contained different residues than CK2alpha and was distal from the ATP binding pocket featured in both kinases. With this potential allosteric site in mind, we screened a commercial library containing ~29,000 allosteric-kinase-inhibitor-like compounds using a CK2alpha' activity-dependent ADP-Glo  Kinase assay. Obtained hits were counter-screened against CK2alpha revealing two CK2alpha' selective compounds. These two compounds might serve as the basis for further medicinal chemistry optimization for the potential treatment of HD.
