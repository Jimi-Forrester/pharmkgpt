38996101|a|RATIONALE: Patients with bone metastasis-associated cancer pain often experience a complex mix of pain types. Consequently, the use of multimodal combination therapy is essential. While monitoring for common adverse reactions in pain treatment, it is also crucial to be vigilant for the rare but serious serotonin syndrome. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 53-year-old female with metastatic gastric cancer was hospitalized due to severe, uncontrolled thoracic and cervical pain. During the titration of her cancer pain medication, she developed serotonin syndrome. DIAGNOSES: He was diagnosed with refractory cancer pain and serotonin syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: The complete process of cancer pain medication in a patient with gastric cancer and bone metastasis was analyzed, with a primary focus on the selection of analgesic medications, adjustment of opioid dosages, and prevention and treatment of medication-associated adverse reactions. OUTCOMES: The patient's cancer pain was well controlled, with the prompt management of adverse reactions. Furthermore, by adjusting the medication regimen, intolerable adverse reactions were prevented. LESSONS: In clinical settings, personalized analgesic regimens must be developed for patients with cancer pain to enhance patient compliance with medication, prevent the occurrence of severe adverse reactions, and improve the overall quality of life of patients with cancer. Healthcare professionals should pay increased attention to ADRs associated with opioid medications, whereas pharmacists should assist them in promptly identifying ADRs.
