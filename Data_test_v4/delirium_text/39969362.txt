39969362|a|RATIONALE: Vitamin D deficiency is common among the elderly due to limited sunlight exposure, increasing osteoporosis risk. Over-supplementation poses risks, especially with caregiver involvement. PATIENT CONCERNS: Rising vitamin D overdose cases underscore the need for better education on safe intake and monitoring practices to prevent toxicity, particularly hypercalcemia from excessive doses. DIAGNOSES: This case report details the clinical presentation and management of a woman who exhibited progressive lower limb weakness, delirium, and abdominal distension over a 3-day period. Initial assessments ruled out intracranial hemorrhage but revealed significant electrolyte imbalances, including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and severe hypercalcemia. Upon further inquiry, it was discovered that the patient had consumed an excessive amount of liquid Vitamin D3 over the preceding 3 weeks, surpassing the threshold for vitamin D intoxication. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous fluid hydration was initiated to promote calcium excretion. Bisphosphonates and calcitonin were administered to reduce serum calcium levels. Electrolyte imbalances, including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia, were corrected. Continuous monitoring and supportive care were provided in the geriatric ward. OUTCOMES: After these treatments, the patient's electrolyte levels stabilized, and her symptoms, such as confusion and muscle weakness, gradually improved, leading to a full recovery. LESSONS: This case underscores the importance of recognizing hypercalcemia, particularly in the elderly, where symptoms may manifest nonspecifically. Additionally, it highlights the potential risks associated with medication errors and inadvertent overdoses, particularly in situations involving elderly spousal caregivers.
