33039373|t|Choroidal Structural Analysis in Alzheimer Disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Cognitively Healthy Controls.
33039373|a|PURPOSE: To assess choroidal structural parameters in symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively healthy control subjects. DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: This study took place in an outpatient neurological disorders clinic. Participants included 67 patients (112 eyes) with AD, 74 patients (143 eyes) with MCI, and 137 (248 eyes) control subjects. Subjects with diabetes, glaucoma, or retinal pathology were excluded. High-definition enhanced depth imaging foveal scans were obtained using Zeiss Cirrus HD-5000 AngioPlex. Subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) was measured by 2 masked graders with a third adjudicator. Total choroidal area (TCA), luminal area (LA), and the choroidal vascularity index (CVI) were calculated after image binarization. Association of choroidal parameters with AD, MCI, or control subjects was assessed using multivariable generalized estimating equations, adjusted for age, sex, and visual acuity. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, and visual acuity, TCA was significantly greater in patients with AD (ss = 2.73; p = .001) and MCI (ss = 4.38; p < .001) compared with control subjects. LA was significantly greater in patients with AD (ss = 1.68; p = .001) and MCI (ss = 2.69; p < .001) compared with control subjects, and CVI was significantly lower in patients with MCI (ss = -0.58; p = .002) compared with control subjects. SFCT was similar among patients with AD and MCI and control subjects on multivariable analysis (p > .05). CONCLUSIONS: TCA, LA, and CVI may differ between patients with AD, MCI, and healthy cognition, whereas SFCT may not differ among these groups. TCA, LA, and CVI deserve further study in subjects on the Alzheimer continuum.
