18752644|a|Overwhelming evidence supports the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease that stipulates that the relative level of the 42 amino acid beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta(42)) in relationship to Abeta(40) is critical to the pathogenesis of the disease. While it is clear that the multi-subunit gamma secretase is responsible for cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into Abeta(42) and Abeta(40), the exact molecular mechanisms regulating the production of the various Abeta species remain elusive. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we replaced individual amino acid residues from positions 43 to 52 of Abeta with phenylalanine to examine the effects on the production of Abeta(40) and Abeta(42). All mutants, except for V50F, resulted in a decrease in total Abeta with a more prominent reduction in Abeta for residues 45, 48, and 51, following an every three residue repetition pattern. In addition, the mutations with the strongest reductions in total Abeta had the largest increases in the ratio of Abeta(42)/Abeta(40). Curiously, the T43F, V44F, and T48F mutations caused a striking decrease in the accumulation of membrane bound Abeta(46), albeit by a different mechanism. Our data suggest that initial cleavage of APP at the epsilon site is crucial in the generation of Abeta. The implicated sequential cleavage and an alpha-helical model may lead to a better understanding of the gamma-secretase-mediated APP processing and may also provide useful information for therapy and drug design aimed at altering Abeta production.
