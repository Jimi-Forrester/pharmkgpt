37838981|t|Molecular pharmacology of the onco-TRP channel TRPV6.
37838981|a|TRPV6, a representative of the vanilloid subfamily of TRP channels, serves as the principal calcium uptake channel in the gut. Dysregulation of TRPV6 results in disturbed calcium homeostasis leading to a variety of human diseases, including many forms of cancer. Inhibitors of this oncochannel are therefore particularly needed. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advances in structural pharmacology that uncovered the molecular mechanisms of TRPV6 inhibition by a variety of small molecules, including synthetic and natural, plant-derived compounds as well as some prospective and clinically approved drugs.
