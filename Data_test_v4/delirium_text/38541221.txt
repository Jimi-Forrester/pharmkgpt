38541221|a|Background and Objectives: the principal purpose of this literature review is to cluster adults with hematological malignancies after treatment or on maintenance with obinutuzumab who experienced disseminated EV infection to understand clinical characteristics and outcome of this rare condition in these patients. We report the first clinical case of a male affected by follicular lymphoma treated with immune-chemotherapy including obinutuzumab who was affected by disseminated EV infection with cardiovascular involvement. Materials and Methods: this narrative review summarizes all the research about disseminated EV infection in immunosuppressed adult patients treated with obinutuzumab from January 2000 to January 2024 using the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) flow-chart. We performed a descriptive statistic using the standard statistical measures for quantitative data. Results: we included six studies, five case reports, and one case report with literature analysis. We collected a total of seven patients, all female, with disseminated EV infection. The most common signs and clinical presentations of EV infection were fever and encephalitis symptoms (N = 6, 85.7%), followed by hepatitis/acute liver failure (N = 5, 71.4%). Conclusions: onco-hematological patients who receive immune-chemotherapy with a combination of treatments which depress adaptative immunity, which includes the antiCD20 obinutuzumab, could be at higher risk of disseminated EV infection, including CNS and cardiac involvement.
