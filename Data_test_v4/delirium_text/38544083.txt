38544083|t|Influence of a Three-Month Mixed Reality Training on Gait Speed and Cognitive Functions in Adults with Intellectual Disability: A Pilot Study.
38544083|a|People with intellectual disability (ID) are often subject to motor impairments such as altered gait. As gait is a task involving motor and perceptive dimensions, perceptual-motor training is an efficient rehabilitation approach to reduce the risk of falls which grows with age. Virtual, augmented, and mixed reality are recent tools which enable interaction with 3D elements at different levels of immersion and interaction. In view of the countless possibilities that this opens, their use for therapeutic purposes is constantly increasing. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence a mixed reality activity could have on motor and cognitive abilities in eighteen adults with intellectual disability. For three months, once a week, they had around 20 min to pop virtual balloons with a finger using a Microsoft HoloLens2  head-mounted mixed-reality device. Motor skills were assessed through gait analysis and cognitive abilities were measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Both walking speed and cognitive score increased after training. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that mixed reality holds potential to get used for therapeutic purposes in adults with ID.
