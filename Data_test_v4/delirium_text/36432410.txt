36432410|t|Prospects of Probiotic Adjuvant Drugs in Clinical Treatment.
36432410|a|In modern society, where new diseases and viruses are constantly emerging, drugs are still the most important means of resistance. However, adverse effects and diminished efficacy remain the leading cause of treatment failure and a major determinant of impaired health-related quality of life for patients. Clinical studies have shown that the disturbance of the gut microbial structure plays a crucial role in the toxic and side effects of drugs. It is well known that probiotics have the ability to maintain the balance of intestinal microecology, which implies their potential as an adjunct to prevent and alleviate the adverse reactions of drugs and to make medicines play a better role. In addition, in the past decade, probiotics have been found to have excellent prevention and alleviation effects in drug toxicity side effects, such as liver injury. In this review, we summarize the development history of probiotics, discuss the impact on drug side effects of probiotics, and propose the underlying mechanisms. Probiotics will be a new star in the world of complementary medicine.
