29451843|t|Caregiver Reactions to Dementia Symptoms: Effects on Coping Repertoire and Mental Health.
29451843|a|Currently, 15 million informal caregivers, most of whom are women, provide care for older adults with dementia (Alzheimer's Disease Association, 2016). Caregiving for these individuals often creates distress and may adversely affect female caregivers' psychosocial and spiritual well-being. Approximately 35% of dementia caregivers complain of health deterioration after initiating caregiving responsibilities as compared to 19% of caregivers of older adults who do not have dementia (Alzheimer's Disease Association, 2016). Persons with dementia exhibit symptoms and behaviors that often are challenging for their caregivers. The way that caregivers react to these symptoms and behaviors may affect their coping repertoire and their mental health. Adequate evaluation of caregiver reactions to symptoms of dementia will provide information useful for developing targeted interventions to promote optimal health of female dementia caregivers and to potentially postpone the need for nursing home or long-term placement of the care recipient.
