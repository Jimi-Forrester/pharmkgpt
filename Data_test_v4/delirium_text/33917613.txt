33917613|t|18F-THK-5351, Fluorodeoxyglucose, and Florbetaben PET Images in Atypical Alzheimer's Disease: A Pictorial Insight into Disease Pathophysiology.
33917613|a|The recent advance of positron emission tomography (PET) tracers as biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) provides more insight into pathophysiology, preclinical diagnosis, and further therapeutic strategies. However, synergistic processes or interactions between amyloid and tau deposits are still poorly understood. To better understand their relationship in focal brain changes with clinical phenotypes, we focused on region-specific or atypical AD characterized by focal clinical presentations: Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) and logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lpvPPA). We compared three different PET images with 18F-THK-5351 (tau), 18F-Florbetaben (amyloid beta, Abeta), and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (glucose metabolism) to investigate potential interactions among pathologies and clinical findings. Whereas the amyloid accumulations were widespread throughout the neocortex, tau retentions and glucose hypometabolism showed focal changes corresponding to the clinical features. The distinctly localized patterns were more prominent in tau PET imaging. These findings suggest that tau pathology correlates more closely to the clinical symptoms and the neurodegenerative processes than Abeta pathology in AD.
