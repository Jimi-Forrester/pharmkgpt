37455211|a|BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following intensive care unit (ICU) treatment may increase morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is important to identify patients at risk of suffering from such symptoms. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence and identify possible predictive factors associated with high levels of PTSS 3 months after ICU admission. METHODS: A multicentre, observational study was carried out in six ICUs in Norway. Patients aged >=18 years were included. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised measured PTSS 3 months after ICU admission. The impacts of pre-ICU measures; demographic and clinical measures; and daily measures of pain, agitation, and delirium were analysed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: In total, of the 273 patients included, the prevalence rate of high levels of PTSS was 19.8% (n = 54) 3 months after ICU admission (95% confidence interval [CI]: [15.2, 25.0]). Female gender, age, pre-ICU unemployment, a minimum of one episode of agitation or delirium, and pre-ICU level of functioning in daily living were all significantly associated with high levels of PTSS in univariate logistic analyses. In the multivariate logistic regression, two models were analysed. In model 1, episodes of agitation during ICU stay (odds ratio [OR] = 4.73; 95% CI: [1.17, 19.0]), pre-ICU unemployment (OR = 3.33; 95% CI: [1.26, 8.81]), and pre-ICU level of functioning in daily living (OR = 0.78; 95% CI: [0.63, 0.96]) (implying lower level) increased the odds of reporting high levels of PTSS. In model 2, pre-ICU unemployment (OR = 2.70; 95% CI: [1.05, 6.93]) and pre-ICU level of functioning in daily living (OR = 0.77; 95% CI: [0.62, 0.95]) (implying lower level) increased the odds of reporting high levels of PTSS. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare personnel are suggested to be aware of ICU patients' pre-ICU employment status, pre-ICU functioning in daily living, and agitation during ICU stay to identify those at risk of PTSS after discharge.
