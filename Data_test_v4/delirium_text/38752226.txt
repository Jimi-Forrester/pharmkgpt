38752226|t|Differential Effects of Post-translational Modifications on the Membrane Interaction of Huntingtin Protein.
38752226|a|Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine stretch near the N-terminus of the huntingtin (HTT) protein, rendering the protein more prone to aggregate. The first 17 residues in HTT (Nt17) interact with lipid membranes and harbor multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs) that can modulate HTT conformation and aggregation. In this study, we used a combination of biophysical studies and molecular simulations to investigate the effect of PTMs on the helicity of Nt17 in the presence of various lipid membranes. We demonstrate that anionic lipids such as PI4P, PI(4,5)P2, and GM1 significantly enhance the helical structure of unmodified Nt17. This effect is attenuated by single acetylation events at K6, K9, or K15, whereas tri-acetylation at these sites abolishes Nt17-membrane interaction. Similarly, single phosphorylation at S13 and S16 decreased but did not abolish the POPG and PIP2-induced helicity, while dual phosphorylation at these sites markedly diminished Nt17 helicity, regardless of lipid composition. The helicity of Nt17 with phosphorylation at T3 is insensitive to the membrane environment. Oxidation at M8 variably affects membrane-induced helicity, highlighting a lipid-dependent modulation of the Nt17 structure. Altogether, our findings reveal differential effects of PTMs and crosstalks between PTMs on membrane interaction and conformation of HTT. Intriguingly, the effects of phosphorylation at T3 or single acetylation at K6, K9, and K15 on Nt17 conformation in the presence of certain membranes do not mirror that observed in the absence of membranes. Our studies provide novel insights into the complex relationship between Nt17 structure, PTMs, and membrane binding.
