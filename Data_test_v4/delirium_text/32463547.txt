32463547|t|Design of a surrogate Anticalin protein directed against CD98hc for preclinical studies in mice.
32463547|a|The human CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc) offers a promising biomedical target both for tumor therapy and for drug delivery to the brain. We have previously developed a cognate Anticalin protein with picomolar affinity and demonstrated its effectiveness in a xenograft animal model. Due to the lack of cross-reactivity with the murine ortholog, we now report the development and X-ray structural analysis of an Anticalin with high affinity toward CD98hc from mouse. This binding protein recognizes the same protruding epitope loop-despite distinct structure-in the membrane receptor ectodomain as the Anticalin selected against human CD98hc. Thus, this surrogate Anticalin should be useful for the preclinical assessment of CD98hc targeting in vivo and support the translational development for medical application in humans.
