31250578|a|PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, with a rising prevalence worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to play important roles in the development and treatment of AD. However, the exact role of lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) in neuronal damage in AD is largely unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The AD model was established in SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH cells via treatment with amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta). The expression of NEAT1 and microRNA-107 (miR-107) was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected by MTT assay, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry. The expression of phosphorylated tau protein (p-Tau) was measured by Western blot. The interaction between NEAT1 and miR-107 was explored by bioinformatics analysis, luciferase activity, and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. RESULTS: NEAT1 expression was enhanced in Abeta-treated SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH cells, and its knockdown attenuated Abeta-induced inhibition of viability and promotion of apoptosis and p-Tau levels. NEAT1 was indicated as a decoy of miR-107. miR-107 abundance was reduced in Abeta-treated cells, and its overexpression reversed Abeta-induced injury. Moreover, interference of miR-107 abated silencing of NEAT1-mediated inhibition of neuronal damage in Abeta-treated SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH cells. CONCLUSION: LncRNA NEAT1 aggravated Abeta-induced neuronal damage by sponging miR-107, indicating a novel avenue for treatment of AD.
