36362280|t|Alu Deletions in LAMA2 and CDH4 Genes Are Key Components of Polygenic Predictors of Longevity.
36362280|a|Longevity is a unique human phenomenon and a highly stable trait, characterized by polygenicity. The longevity phenotype occurs due to the ability to successfully withstand the age-related genomic instability triggered by Alu elements. The purpose of our cross-sectional study was to evaluate the combined contribution of ACE*Ya5ACE, CDH4*Yb8NBC516, COL13A1*Ya5ac1986, HECW1*Ya5NBC182, LAMA2*Ya5-MLS19, PLAT*TPA25, PKHD1L1*Yb8AC702, SEMA6A*Yb8NBC597, STK38L*Ya5ac2145 and TEAD1*Ya5ac2013 Alu elements to longevity. The study group included 2054 unrelated individuals aged from 18 to 113 years who are ethnic Tatars from Russia. We analyzed the dynamics of the allele and genotype frequencies of the studied Alu polymorphic loci in the age groups of young (18-44 years old), middle-aged (45-59 years old), elderly (60-74 years old), old seniors (75-89 years old) and long-livers (90-113 years old). Most significant changes in allele and genotype frequencies were observed between the long-livers and other groups. The search for polygenic predictors of longevity was performed using the APSampler program. Attaining longevity was associated with the combinations LAMA2*ID + CDH4*D (OR = 2.23, PBonf = 1.90 x 10-2) and CDH4*DD + LAMA2*ID + HECW1*D (OR = 4.58, PBonf = 9.00 x 10-3) among persons aged between 18 and 89 years, LAMA2*ID + CDH4*D + SEMA6A*I for individuals below 75 years of age (OR = 3.13, PBonf = 2.00 x 10-2), LAMA2*ID + HECW1*I for elderly people aged 60 and older (OR = 3.13, PBonf = 2.00 x 10-2) and CDH4*DD + LAMA2*D + HECW1*D (OR = 4.21, PBonf = 2.60 x 10-2) and CDH4*DD + LAMA2*D + ACE*I (OR = 3.68, PBonf = 1.90 x 10-2) among old seniors (75-89 years old). The key elements of combinations associated with longevity were the deletion alleles of CDH4 and LAMA2 genes. Our results point to the significance for human longevity of the Alu polymorphic loci in CDH4, LAMA2, HECW1, SEMA6A and ACE genes, involved in the integration systems.
