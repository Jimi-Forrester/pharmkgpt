33967682|a|Overnutrition and modern diets containing high proportions of saturated fat are among the major factors contributing to a low-grade state of inflammation, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. In the last decades, the global rise of type 2 diabetes and obesity prevalence has elicited a great interest in understanding how changes in metabolic function lead to an increased risk for premature brain aging and the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cognitive impairment and decreased neurogenic capacity could be a consequence of metabolic disturbances. In these scenarios, the interplay between inflammation and insulin resistance could represent a potential therapeutic target to prevent or ameliorate neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. The present review aims to provide an update on the impact of metabolic stress pathways on AD with a focus on inflammation and insulin resistance as risk factors and therapeutic targets.
