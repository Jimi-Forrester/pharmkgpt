26984755|t|Autophagy in Plasma Cell Ontogeny and Malignancy.
26984755|a|Autophagy is a highly conserved pathway that recycles cytosolic material and organelles via lysosomal degradation. Once simplistically viewed as a non-selective survival strategy in dire straits, autophagy has emerged as a tightly regulated process ensuring organelle function, proteome plasticity, cell differentiation and tissue homeostasis, with key roles in physiology and disease. Selective target recognition, mediated by specific adapter proteins, enables autophagy to orchestrate highly specialized functions in innate and adaptive immunity. Among them, the shaping of plasma cells for sustainable antibody production through a negative control on their differentiation program. Moreover, memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells require autophagy to exist. Further, the plasma cell malignancy, multiple myeloma deploys abundant autophagy, essential for homeostasis, survival and drug resistance.
