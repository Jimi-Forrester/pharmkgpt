10907203|t|Identifying patients "at risk" for alcohol withdrawal syndrome and a treatment protocol.
10907203|a|Alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are common problems. It is estimated that more than 10 million Americans have problems with alcohol dependence that adversely affect their lives and the lives of their families. Many of these patients, if hospitalized, have the potential to experience symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Major alcohol withdrawal symptoms may include seizures and the development of delirium tremens. Obtaining an alcohol consumption history is a critical component to identifying patients at risk and determining the appropriate treatment plan for potential alcohol withdrawal. A protocol was established for identifying and treating patients at risk for alcohol withdrawal. The initiation of the treatment protocol is history- and symptom-based; treatment is symptom-triggered on the basis of frequent objective assessments. The purpose of the protocol is to prevent and control withdrawal symptoms without heavily sedating or hindering a patients' neurological assessment.
