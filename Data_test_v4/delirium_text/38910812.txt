38910812|t|Burden of delirium on mortality and healthcare resource utilization in geriatric patients hospitalized for inflammatory bowel disease.
38910812|a|Background: Delirium is prevalent in elderly patients, linked to elevated mortality rates, heightened healthcare resource use, and caregiver burden. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) poses various delirium risk factors, yet the impact on geriatric IBD patient outcomes remains unexplored. Methods: Using 2016-2019 National Inpatient Sample data, we identified >=65-year-old patients admitted for IBD (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis) management stratified by delirium presence as a secondary diagnosis. The study aimed to assess delirium's impact on geriatric IBD patient outcomes. Results: Among 67,534 elderly IBD admissions, 0.7% (470) developed delirium. The delirium group had a 4.8-fold increase in in-hospital mortality risk (odds ratio 4.80, P < 0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.94-11.8). IBD patients with delirium experienced prolonged length of stay (adjusted mean difference 5.15 days, 95% CI 3.24-7.06, P < 0.001) and increased care costs (adjusted mean difference $48,328, 95% CI $26,485-$70,171, P < 0.001) compared to those without delirium. Conclusion: Elderly IBD patients with delirium face higher mortality risk, prolonged hospitalization, and increased healthcare costs. Clinicians should recognize delirium's detrimental effects in this vulnerable group and adhere to preventive protocols for improved care.
