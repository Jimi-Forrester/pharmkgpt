33188852|a|Accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) soluble forms in the cerebral parenchyma is the mainstream concept underlying memory deficit in the early phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PKMzeta plays a critical role in the maintenance of long-term memory. Yet, the role of this brain-specific enzyme has not been addressed in AD. We examined the impact of hippocampal PKMzeta overexpression on AD-related memory impairment in rats. Oligomeric form of Abeta (oAbeta) or vehicle was bilaterally microinjected into the dorsal hippocampus of male Wistar rats under stereotaxic surgery. One week later, 2 mul of lentiviral vector (108 T.U. / ml.) encoding PKMzeta genome was microinjected into the dorsal hippocampus. Seven days later, behavioral performance was assessed using shuttle box and Morris water maze. The expression levels of GluA1, GluA2 and KCC2 were determined in the hippocampus using western blot technique. Our data showed that oAbeta impairs both passive avoidance and spatial learning and memory. However, overexpression of PKMzeta in the dorsal hippocampus restored the behavioral performance. This improving effect was blocked by microinjection of ZIP, a PKMzeta inhibitor, into the hippocampus. oAbeta or PKMzeta did not significantly change GluA1 level in the hippocampus. Furthermore, PKMzeta failed to restore elevated KCC2 level induced by oAbeta. However, oAbeta decreased GluA2 level, and overexpression of PKMzeta restored its expression toward the control level. In conclusion, hippocampal overexpression of PKMzeta restored memory dysfunction induced by amyloidopathy in part, through preserving hippocampal GluA2 containing AMPA receptors. PKMzeta's signaling pathway could be considered as a therapeutic target to battle memory deficits in the early phase of AD.
