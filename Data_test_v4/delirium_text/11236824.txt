11236824|t|Activation mechanism of brain microglia in patients with diffuse neurofibrillary tangles with calcification: a comparison with Alzheimer disease.
11236824|a|Diffuse neurofibrillary tangles with calcification (DNTC) is an atypical dementia and is characterized pathologically by diffuse neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) without senile plaques (SPs). In this study, we investigated the distribution of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR-positive activated microglia in postmortem brain tissue of six patients with DNTC and six patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). HLA-DR-positive activated microglia were observed to associate with SPs in AD. In the DNTC brain, which lacks SPs, HLA-DR-positive microglia were mainly accumulated around weakly tau-positive NFTs, which were also positive for anti-amyloid-P and anti-C3d antibodies. The results of this study suggest that the complement pathway is also activated in the DNTC brain and that immune and inflammatory responses, including microglia activation, may occur around extracellular NFTs in DNTC patients.
