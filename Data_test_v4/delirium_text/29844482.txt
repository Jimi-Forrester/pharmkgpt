29844482|a|In this study, we report a novel method for the in situ measurement of autophagy under nutrient starvation using a principle of semiconductor technology. A semiconductor-based field-effect transistor (FET) biosensor enables the direct detection of ionic or molecular charges under biological conditions. In particular, cellular respiration accompanied by the generation of carbon dioxide can be continuously and directly monitored as a change in pH at a cell/sensor interface. When autophagy was induced in HeLa cells on a FET biosensor under nutrient starvation, the surface potential increased more significantly for about 15 h than that for nonstarved cells. This positive shift indicates an increase in the number of hydrogen ions produced from the respiration of starved cells because the sensing surface was previously designed to be sensitive to pH variation. Therefore, we have found that cellular respiration is more activated by autophagy under nutrient starvation because the amino acids that decomposed from proteins in autophagic cells would have been rapidly spent in cellular respiration.
