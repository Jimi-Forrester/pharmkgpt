30319395|t|Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 Specifically Modulates the Hippocampus Functional Connectivity Network in Patients With Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment.
30319395|a|The presence of both apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are considered to be risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous neuroimaging studies have suggested that the modulation of APOE epsilon4 affects intrinsic functional brain networks, both in healthy populations and in AD patients. However, it remains largely unclear whether and how epsilon4 allele modulates the brain's functional network architecture in subjects with aMCI. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and graph-theory approaches-functional connectivity strength (FCS), we investigate the topological organization of the whole-brain functional network in 28 aMCI epsilon4 carriers and 38 aMCI epsilon3epsilon3 carriers. In the present study, we first observe that epsilon4-related FCS increases in the right hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus (HIP/PHG). Subsequent seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis revealed that, compared with the epsilon3epsilon3 carriers, the epsilon4 carriers had lower or higher RSFCs between the right HIP/PHG seed and the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) or the occipital cortex, respectively. Further correlation analyses have revealed that the FCS values in the right HIP/PHG and lower HIP/PHG-RSFCs with the bilateral MPFC were significantly correlated with the impairment of episodic memory and executive function in the aMCI epsilon4 carriers. Importantly, the logistic regression analysis showed that the HIP/PHG-RSFC with the bilateral MPFC predicted aMCI-conversion to AD. These findings suggest that the APOE epsilon4 allele may modulate the large-scale brain network in aMCI subjects, facilitating our understanding of how the entire assembly of the brain network reorganizes in response to APOE variants in aMCI. Further longitudinal studies need to be conducted, in order to examine whether these network measures could serve as primary predictors of conversion from aMCI epsilon4 carriers to AD.
