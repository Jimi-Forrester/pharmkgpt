9572276|t|Role of potassium channels in amyloid-induced cell death.
9572276|a|Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are severely depleted early in Alzheimer's disease and appear particularly susceptible to amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) toxicity in vivo. To model this effect in vitro, a cholinergic septal cell line (SN56) was exposed to A beta. SN56 cells exhibited a tetraethylammonium (TEA)-sensitive outward K+ current with delayed rectifier characteristics. Increases of 64% (+/-19; p < 0.02) and 44% (+/-12; p < 0.02) in K+ current density were noted 6-12 and 12-18 h following the addition of A beta to SN56 cell cultures, respectively. Morphological observation and staining for cell viability showed that 25 +/- 4 and 39 +/- 4% of SN56 cells were dead after 48- and 96-h exposures to A beta, respectively. Perfusion of SN56 cells with 10-20 mM TEA blocked 71 +/- 6 to 92 +/- 2% of the outward currents, widened action potentials, elevated [Ca2+]i, and inhibited 89 +/- 14 and 68 +/- 14% of the A beta toxicity. High [K+]o, which depolarizes cell membranes and increases [Ca2+]i, also protected SN56 cells from A beta toxicity. This effect appeared specific since glucose deprivation of SN56 cells did not alter K+ current density and TEA did not protect these cells from hypoglycemic cell death. Furthermore, A beta was toxic to a dopaminergic cell line (MES23.5) that expressed a K+ current with delayed rectifier characteristics; K+ current density was not altered by A beta and MES23.5 cells were not protected by TEA from A beta toxicity. In contrast, a noncholinergic septal cell line (SN48) that shows minimal outward K+ currents was resistant to the toxicity of A beta. These data suggest that a K+ channel with delayed rectifier characteristics may play an important role in A beta-mediated toxicity for septal cholinergic cells.
