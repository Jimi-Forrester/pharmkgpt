However, THMs have rarely been used to treat hypertension, and moreover few studies have investigated the interaction of blood pressure with the coadministration of synthetic antihypertensives. We aimed to evaluate the vasorelaxant and hypotensive effects of the traditional herbal prescription Cheonwangbosimdan (CWBSD; "Tianwangbuxindan" in Chinese) and the combination of CWBSD with amlodipine. CWBSD was extracted with distilled water at 100 C for 2 h. To investigate vasorelaxant activities, CWBSD with amlodipine (10 mug/ml) was added cumulatively (10-1,000 mug/ml) to isolated rat aortic rings precontracted using phenylephrine or potassium chloride in organ chambers. To investigate hypotensive effects, CWBSD (2,476 mg/kg) was orally administered with or without amlodipine (5 mg/kg) to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). CWBSD increased the relaxation of rat aortic rings induced by amlodipine (P < 0.01). In vivo, CWBSD coadministration with amlodipine also significantly decreased the blood pressure of SHRs compared to the amlodipine-treated group. These results suggested that CWBSD could be a useful herbal prescription to treat hypertension and we recommend establishing guidelines for the use of herbal medicines in conjunction with antihypertensive drugs, including amlodipine.
