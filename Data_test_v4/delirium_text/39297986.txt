OBJECTIVE: To offer evidence-based recommendations for defining and diagnosing PD, incorporating contemporary clinical, imaging, biomarker, and genetic insights. METHODS: The guideline development began with the steering committee establishing key PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcome) questions, which were refined by the coauthors. Systematic literature searches identified relevant studies, reviews, and meta-analyses. Recommendations were drafted, evaluated, optimized, and voted upon by the German Parkinson's Guideline Group. RESULTS: Parkinson's disease (PD) is now understood to encompass a broader spectrum of etiologies than previously recognized. Advances in molecular pathogenesis, neuroimaging, and early clinical phenotypes suggest that PD is not a uniform disease entity and is often not idiopathic. This necessitates an updated framework for PD definition and diagnosis. The German Society for Neurology now endorses a broader concept of PD, incorporating both idiopathic and hereditary forms, as opposed to the previously narrower concept of "idiopathic Parkinson syndrome." The revised guidelines recommend using the 2015 Movement Disorders Society diagnostic criteria, emphasize the importance of long-term clinical follow-up for improved diagnostic accuracy, and highlight the significance of non-motor symptoms in clinical diagnosis. Specific recommendations are provided for the use of imaging and fluid biomarkers and genetic testing to support the clinical diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The updated guidelines from the German Society for Neurology enhance diagnostic accuracy for PD, promoting optimized clinical care.
