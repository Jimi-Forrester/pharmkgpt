29366326|t|Detection of a Peptide Biomarker by Engineered Yeast Receptors.
29366326|a|Directed evolution of membrane receptors is challenging as the evolved receptor must not only accommodate a non-native ligand, but also maintain the ability to transduce the detection of the new ligand to any associated intracellular components. The G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily is the largest group of membrane receptors. As members of the GPCR family detect a wide range of ligands, GPCRs are an incredibly useful starting point for directed evolution of user-defined analytical tools and diagnostics. The aim of this study was to determine if directed evolution of the yeast Ste2p GPCR, which natively detects the alpha-factor peptide, could yield a GPCR that detects Cystatin C, a human peptide biomarker. We demonstrate a generalizable approach for evolving Ste2p to detect peptide sequences. Because the target peptide differs significantly from alpha-factor, a single evolutionary step was infeasible. We turned to a substrate walking approach and evolved receptors for a series of chimeric intermediates with increasing similarity to the biomarker. We validate our previous model as a tool for designing optimal chimeric peptide steps. Finally, we demonstrate the clinical utility of yeast-based biosensors by showing specific activation by a C-terminally amidated Cystatin C peptide in commercially sourced human urine. To our knowledge, this is the first directed evolution of a peptide GPCR.
