37490670|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency and risk factors of delirium in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four hundred and forty patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital of the University Clinical Hospital No.3 of Sechenov University were included in the study. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screening Questionnaire-7 (GAD-7), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Delirium severity rating scale (DRS-R-98) were administered. RESULTS: Delirium was detected in 27.8% of patients. Significant risk factors were age (p=0.002), severity of respiratory failure (p=0.005), concomitant somatic disease (p=0.003), and respiratory therapy (p<0.001). There was an association between severe anxiety (p<0.001) and insomnia (p=0.07) observed at admission with the risk of developing delirium during the hospital stay. CONCLUSION: The study reveals a high prevalence of delirium in patients with COVID-19. In order to prevent delirium and/or reduce the risk, early diagnosis and identification of preclinical forms are of particular importance.
