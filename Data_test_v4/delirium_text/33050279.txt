33050279|t|An Emerging Role of m6A in Memory: A Case for Translational Priming.
33050279|a|Investigation into the role of methylation of the adenosine base (m6A) of RNA has only recently begun, but it quickly became apparent that m6A is able to control and fine-tune many aspects of mRNA, from splicing to translation. The ability of m6A to regulate translation distally, away from traditional sites near the nucleus, quickly caught the eye of neuroscientists because of implications for selective protein translation at synapses. Work in the brain has demonstrated how m6A is functionally required for many neuronal functions, but two in particular are covered at length here: The role of m6A in 1) neuron development; and 2) memory formation. The purpose of this review is not to cover all data about m6A in the brain. Instead, this review will focus on connecting mechanisms of m6A function in neuron development, with m6A's known function in memory formation. We will introduce the concept of "translational priming" and discuss how current data fit into this model, then speculate how m6A-mediated translational priming during memory consolidation can regulate learning and memory locally at the synapse.
