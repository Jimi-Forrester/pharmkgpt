8947284|a|We investigated the genetic association between intronic polymorphism in Presenilin-1 (PS-1) gene and patients with various types of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD) and alcohol associated dementia (ALD), in Japanese population. Homozygosity for allele 1 of the PS-1 polymorphism was significantly increased in late-onset sporadic AD, but not in early-onset sporadic AD, familial AD, VD and ALD. When late-onset sporadic AD patients were divided on the basis of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, homozygosity for the allele 1 of the PS-1 polymorphism was significantly increased in patients with late-onset sporadic AD without APOE epsilon 4 allele, but not in those with APOE epsilon 4 allele. Intronic mutation in PS-1 gene may be specific and one of the genetic risk factor for late-onset sporadic AD.
