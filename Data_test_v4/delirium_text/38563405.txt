38563405|t|Novel photocatalytic carbon dots: efficiently inhibiting amyloid aggregation and quickly disaggregating amyloid aggregates.
38563405|a|Amyloid aggregation is implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). It is critical to develop high-performance drugs to combat amyloid-related diseases. Most identified nanomaterials exhibit limited biocompatibility and therapeutic efficacy. In this work, we used a solvent-free carbonization process to prepare new photo-responsive carbon nanodots (CNDs). The surface of the CNDs is densely packed with chemical groups. CNDs with large, conjugated domains can interact with proteins through pi-pi stacking and hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, CNDs possess the ability to generate singlet oxygen species (1O2) and can be used to oxidize amyloid. The hydrophobic interaction and photo-oxidation can both influence amyloid aggregation and disaggregation. Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence analysis and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy indicate that CNDs can block the transition of amyloid from an alpha-helix structure to a beta-sheet structure. CNDs demonstrate efficacy in alleviating cytotoxicity induced by Abeta42 and exhibit promising blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. CNDs have small size, low biotoxicity, good fluorescence and photocatalytic properties, and provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of amyloid-related diseases.
