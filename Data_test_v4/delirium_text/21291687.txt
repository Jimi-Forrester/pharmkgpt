21291687|a|According to recent evidence, our aging society is in the early phases of an epidemic of cognitive decline. Accordingly, efforts directed at reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia will be an important goal of health care efforts. While there are a paucity of successful treatment options currently available, diet and other lifestyle changes can play an important role in such an approach. Epidemiologic data have been conflicting in relation to the benefit of vitamins C and E, and some individual foods. This review will examine the role of the Mediterranean diet, as well as individual dietary components, including fruits, vegetables, antioxidants, fish, docosahexaenoic acid, and fat intake. The role of exercise in maintaining normal weight and reducing risk factors may provide additional protection. There is a need for well-designed prospective, randomized controlled trials in the future to improve the currently available database and to document the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of specific interventions, providing for development of preventive guidelines in this area.
