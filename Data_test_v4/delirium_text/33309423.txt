33309423|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to describe the prevalence of Delirium and the factors associated with its presentation and complications identified in a geriatric unit in Colombia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study that included all patients admitted consecutively for two years in a geriatric unit of a hospital in Bogota, Colombia. We assessed delirium prevalence with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). The independent variables were age, sex, functional impairment (Barthel<90), malnutrition (MNA<12), pressure ulcers at admission, state of the social support network, number of comorbidities, polypharmacy (5 or more drugs), complications such as ICU requirement, hospital stay, in-hospital functional impairment and mortality were also evaluated. As an exclusion criterion: not having CAM registered in the medical record, all the patients had this information. RESULTS: We studied 1599 subjects with a mean age of 86 years (IQR 9). Delirium prevalence was 51.03%. Delirium was associated with a higher rate of: pressure ulcers on admission [OR 3.76 (CI 2.60-5.43 p<0.001)], functional impairment [OR 2.38 (CI 1.79-3.16 p<0.001)], malnutrition [OR 2.06 (CI 1.56-2.73 p<0.001)], and infection [OR 1.46 (CI 1.17-1.82 p<0.001)]. Moreover delirium has a higher association with mortality [OR 2.80 (1.03-7.54 p=0.042)], in-hospital functional decline [OR 1.82 (1.41-2.36 p<0.001)], and longer hospital stay [OR 1.04 (1.04-1.09 p=0.006)]; independently of age, sex, pressure ulcers on admission, functional impairment, malnutrition, dementia, infection and limited social network. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that infectious diseases and geriatric syndromes such as, functional dependence, pressure ulcers, malnutrition or major cognitive impairment are independently associated with the presence of delirium on admission. Additionally, the presence of delirium is independently associated during hospitalization with complications, longer hospital stay, functional impairment and mortality.
