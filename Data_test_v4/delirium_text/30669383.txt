30669383|t|Hwangryunhaedok-Tang Exerts Neuropreventive Effect on Memory Impairment by Reducing Cholinergic System Dysfunction and Inflammatory Response in a Vascular Dementia Rat Model.
30669383|a|Hwangryunhaedok-tang (HRT) is a traditional oriental herbal formula used in Asian countries for treating inflammatory diseases and controlling fever. Our present study aimed to determine whether HRT has therapeutic effects for patients with vascular dementia (VaD) using a bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) rat model and assessing spatial memory impairment and activation of neuroinflammation. BCCAO was performed in male Sprague Dawley rats to induce VaD, and oral HRT was administered daily for 30 d. Our data showed that HRT ameliorated BCCAO-induced memory and cognitive impairment in behavioral tests. In addition, HRT reversed cholinergic dysfunction and neuronal damage in the hippocampus of BCCAO rats. Furthermore, HRT attenuated microglial activation and reduced the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) induced by BCCAO. Simultaneous high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of HRT using index compounds from the herbal composition revealed that both HRT ethanol extract and commercial HRT granules primarily comprise geniposide, baicalin, and berberine. Our study showed that HRT administration resulted in the prevention of neuronal injury induced by BCCAO through improvement of cholinergic dysfunction and inhibition of neuroinflammatory responses, suggesting that HRT may have potential as a treatment for VaD.
