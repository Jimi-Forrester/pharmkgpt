35547628|t|Association Between Tea Drinking and Cognitive Disorders in Older Adults: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies.
35547628|a|Introduction: Previous research has shown that tea drinking has a bearing on Cognitive Disorders, but the conclusions are inconsistent. The purpose of this research was to systematically assess the published evidence pertaining to tea drinking and the risk of cognitive disorders in older adults using a meta-analysis, and to concurrently evaluate the dose-response association. Design: A meta-analysis. Setting and Participants: We used the PubMed and Web of Science databases for a literature search until 30 May 2021. We initially retrieved 20,908 studies (14,884 from PubMed and 6,024 from the Web of Science), Thirty-six studies met the inclusion criteria (7 case-control, 16 cohort, and 13 cross-sectional studies), involved 224,980 participants. Methods: Pooled odd ratios (ORs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the strength of the association under a fixed- or random-effect model according to heterogeneity test results. Results: The results showed that drinking tea was negatively associated with cognitive disorders (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.70-0.82). Moreover, dose-response associations were found between tea drinking and cognitive disorders (1 time/day: OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.95; 1 cup/day: OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78-0.94). In addition, subgroup analyses were performed according to study designs, study population, types of tea drinking, outcomes and methods used to assess outcomes. Most of the results in the subgroup analyses were consistent with the main results. Conclusion: The results of the present study provided abundant evidence that tea drinking is inversely proportional with the occurrence of cognitive disorders in older adults. A linear dose-response association between tea drinking and decreased prevalence of cognitive disorders was found.
