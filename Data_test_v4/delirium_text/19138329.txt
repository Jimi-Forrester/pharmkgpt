19138329|a|BACKGROUND: Grey matter (GM) atrophy has been demonstrated in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the role of white matter (WM) atrophy has not been well characterized. Despite these findings, the validity of aMCI concept as prodromal AD has been questioned. METHODS: We performed brain MRI with voxel-based morphometry analysis in 48 subjects, aiming to evaluate the patterns of GM and WM atrophy amongst mild AD, aMCI and age-matched normal controls. RESULTS: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment GM atrophy was similarly distributed but less intense than that of mild AD group, mainly in thalami and parahippocampal gyri. There were no difference between aMCI and controls concerning WM atrophy. In the mild AD group, we found WM atrophy in periventricular areas, corpus callosum and WM adjacent to associative cortices. DISCUSSION: We demonstrated that aMCI might be considered a valid concept to detect very early AD pathology, since we found a close proximity in the pattern of atrophy. Also, we showed the involvement of WM in mild AD, but not in aMCI, suggesting a combination of Wallerian degeneration and microvascular ischaemic disease as a plausible additional pathological mechanism for the discrimination between MCI and AD.
