35291404|t|A Comparative Study on the Effects of Ketofol, Dexmedetomidine, and Isofol in Anesthesia of Candidates for Dilatation and Curettage.
35291404|a|Background: Dilatation and curettage (D & C) is one of the relatively common surgeries among women. Familiarity with the analgesics, along with their different uses and specific characteristics, can help to determine the best and most appropriate drug to control pain in the patients. Objectives: This study aimed to compare the effects of ketofol, dexmedetomidine, and isofol in anesthesia of candidates for D & C. Methods: In this double-blind clinical trial, 150 candidates for D & C surgeries with ASA class 1 and 2 were included. Patients were randomly divided into three groups. The first group received ketamine + propofol, the second group received dexmedetomidine, and the third group received isofol (isoflurane + propofol). Any hemodynamic changes or respiratory disorders, including apnea or hypoventilation, drop in the level of blood oxygen saturation, and the need for respiratory support, were recorded and compared. Results: Hypoventilation was observed in 47 patients in isofol group, 18 in the dexmedetomidine group, and 42 in ketofol group. Also, 48 patients in the isofol group, eight in the dexmedetomidine group, and 33 in the ketofol group experienced apnea. Moreover, 17 patients in the dexmedetomidine group, 35 in the ketofol group, and eight in the isofol group experienced bradycardia. The rate of bradycardia was significantly higher in the dexmedetomidine group (70%) compared to the other two groups, and the rate of hypotension was significantly higher in the isofol group (P = 0.001). Conclusions: According to the results, dexmedetomidine was associated with fewer complications during general anesthesia in D & C surgery.
