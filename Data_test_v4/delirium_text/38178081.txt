38178081|a|BACKGROUND: Standardized training for pain, agitation-sedation, and delirium (PAD) management is urgently needed for Chinese intensivists' continuing education. Since 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese Analgesia and Sedation Education and Research (CASER) group has used an online blended teaching mode based on a small private online course (SPOC) and case-based learning (CBL). This study evaluated whether an online blended teaching mode has similar effects on PAD management training when an offline mode cannot be used. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since 2020, the CASER group has provided offline training and online SPOC&CBL training three times each, targeting intensivists and ICU nurses in China. All participants were divided into an offline group and SPOC&CBL group. A final examination was offered in each training session to assess the students' mastery of professional knowledge. Teachers' and students' perceptions regarding the online SPOC&CBL mode were evaluated through questionnaires. RESULTS: Of all participants (n = 117), 106 completed all examinations and questionnaires. Most participants were aged 31-40 years (53, 50.0%), had an academic degree (60, 56.6%), and worked in a tertiary hospital (100, 94.34%). We assessed the learning effect on participants from two aspects: theory and clinical practice. There was no significant difference between the SPOC&CBL and offline groups in terms of theoretical, case analysis, and total scores (p > 0.05). In terms of the participants' perceptions regarding the SPOC&CBL mode, 91.5% considered the online mode to be a useful and accessible alternative to improve knowledge and skills. A total of 95.7% of the participants believed that they could interact well with group members, and 87.2% believed that they had a good degree of participation. Of these participants, 76.6% believed that they had received valuable learning resources. All instructors believed that the SPOC&CBL mode was more flexible than the offline mode in terms of teaching time and location, and they were all willing to carry out training with the SPOC&CBL mode. CONCLUSION: Compared to the offline mode, the SPOC&CBL mode can also enhance participants' knowledge and skills and meets their expectations. Therefore, an online mode can be considered a potential method in PAD management education in China.
