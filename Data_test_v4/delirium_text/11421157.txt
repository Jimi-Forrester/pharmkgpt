11421157|a|In the future, physical activities should be more frequent in the elderly population, because of free time and better quality of life. Muscular exercise is very useful; muscular strength and effort ability are preserved in conditioned aged people. It reduces loss of muscle mass, so called sarcopenia; it improves deconditioning and quality of life. In healthy elderly, exercise improves postural status, bone mass and broken risk, cognitive function. However, the impact on falls and immunosenescence is not well known. In ill elderly, quality of life seems better in cardiac and Alzheimer disease, if a control physical activity is performed. Exercise should be adapted and rehabilitation should be done every time it's possible. Social contact and relationships also have good effects, which must be encouraged.
