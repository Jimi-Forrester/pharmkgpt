36257924|a|AIM: This descriptive study was conducted to determine the awareness of nurses working in intensive care units about the daily patient checklist. BACKGROUND: Checklists are used in the daily follow-up and evaluation of patients admitted to the intensive care unit. METHOD: The research was carried out with 180 nurses through the social media account of the Turkish Intensive Care Specialists Association Nurse Commission between July 2021 and March 2022. Data were collected with a descriptive information form and intensive care unit daily patient checklist. Necessary permissions were obtained before the study. RESULTS: Among nurses, 45.0% of them got 15 full points from the Checklist. Moreover, 81.1% of the nurses stated that they knew that a checklist should be used to help eliminate the deficiencies of daily care and treatment in the intensive care unit, while 66.7% stated that they used a checklist. It was determined that nurses knew the most about parameters 'Check the daily infection parameters', 'Glycaemic control', 'Therapy', and the least about parameters 'Thromboprophylaxis', 'Ulcer prevention', 'Hypo-hyper delirium' and 'Use a daily checklist'. CONCLUSION: It was determined that the level of awareness of intensive care unit nurses about some parameters that should be followed daily for patient care was low. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Checklists can be used as a guide for health care professionals in the routine daily evaluation of intensive care unit patients. It is thought that these reminder abbreviations will provide efficiency in preventing the disruption of applications, reducing medical errors, reducing mortality and morbidity, and cost.
