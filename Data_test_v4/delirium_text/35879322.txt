35879322|t|Novel role of COX6c in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and diseases.
35879322|a|Cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIc (COX6c) is one of the most important subunits of the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain in mitochondria. Numerous studies have demonstrated that COX6c plays a critical role in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and energy production. The release of COX6c from the mitochondria may be a hallmark of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Moreover, The changes in COX6c expression are widespread in a variety of diseases and can be chosen as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and treatment. In light of its exclusive effects, we present the elaborate roles that COX6c plays in various diseases. In this review, we first introduced basic knowledge regarding COX6c and its functions in the OXPHOS and apoptosis pathways. Subsequently, we described the regulation of COX6c expression and activity in both positive and negative ways. Furthermore, we summarized the elaborate roles that COX6c plays in various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, brain injury, skeletal muscle injury, and tumors. This review highlights recent advances and provides a comprehensive summary of COX6c in the regulation of OXPHOS in multiple diseases and may be helpful for drug design and the prediction, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of diseases.
