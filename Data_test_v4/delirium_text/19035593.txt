19035593|t|Cognitive-performance recovery of Alzheimer's disease model mice by modulation of early soluble amyloidal assemblies.
19035593|a|A rationally designed oligomerization inhibitor interacts with early intermediate assemblies of amyloid-beta polypeptide (Abeta) through the aromatic elements and inhibits their assembly into the toxic oligomers that cause Alzheimer's disease by a unique C(alpha)-methylation beta-breakage strategy. The electrostatic potential of the low-energy conformation of the dipeptide inhibitor bound to Abeta is shown.
