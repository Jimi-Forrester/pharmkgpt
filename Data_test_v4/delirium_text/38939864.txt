38939864|t|The dissolution, reassembly and further clearance of amyloid-beta fibrils by tailor-designed dissociable nanosystem for Alzheimer's disease therapy.
38939864|a|The fibrillation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is the critical causal factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the dissolution and clearance of which are promising for AD therapy. Although many Abeta inhibitors are developed, their low Abeta-binding affinity results in unsatisfactory effect. To solve this challenge, the Abeta sequence-matching strategy is proposed to tail-design dissociable nanosystem (B6-PNi NPs). Herein, B6-PNi NPs aim to improve Abeta-binding affinity for effective dissolution of amyloid fibrils, as well as to interfere with the in vivo fate of amyloid for Abeta clearance. Results show that B6-PNi NPs decompose into small nanostructures and expose Abeta-binding sites in response to AD microenvironment, and then capture Abeta via multiple interactions, including covalent linkage formed by nucleophilic substitution reaction. Such high Abeta-binding affinity disassembles Abeta fibrils into Abeta monomers, and induces the reassembly of Abeta&nanostructure composite, thereby promoting microglial Abeta phogocytosis/clearance via Abeta receptor-mediated endocytosis. After B6-PNi NPs treatment, the Abeta burden, neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments are relieved in AD transgenic mice. This work provides the Abeta sequence-matching strategy for Abeta inhibitor design in AD treatment, showing meaningful insight in biomedicine.
