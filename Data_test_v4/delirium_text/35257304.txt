35257304|a|Neuroinflammation is associated with the development of hypoactive delirium, which results in poor clinical outcomes. Drugs effective against hypoactive sur have not yet been established. Yokukansan has an anti-neuroinflammatory effect, making it potentially effective against hypoactive delirium. This study aimed to examine the effect of Yokukansan on the pentobarbital-induced loss of righting reflex duration extended with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation and diazepam-induced gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor stimulation in a mouse model. The active ingredients in Yokukansan and its anti-neuroinflammatory effect on the hippocampus were also investigated. Furthermore, we examined the in vitro anti-inflammatory effects of Yokukansan on LPS-stimulated BV2 cells, a murine microglial cell line. Findings revealed that treatment with Yokukansan significantly decreased the duration of pentobarbital-induced loss of righting reflex by attenuating the LPS-induced increase in interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in the hippocampus. Moreover, treatment with Yokukansan significantly decreased the number of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus after 24 h of LPS administration. In addition, glycyrrhizic acid, an active ingredient in Yokukansan, partially decreased the duration of pentobarbital-induced loss of righting reflex. Treatment with Yokukansan also suppressed the expression of inducible nitric oxide, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor mRNA in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. Thus, these findings suggest that Yokukansan and glycyrrhizic acid may be effective therapeutic agents for treating neuroinflammation-induced hypoactive delirium.
