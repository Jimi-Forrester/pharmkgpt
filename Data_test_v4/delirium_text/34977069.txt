34977069|a|Objective: The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ECMO-supported sedative, analgesic, and muscle relaxants have changed, but there are insufficient data to determine the optimal dosing strategies for these agents. Sedation, analgesia and muscle relaxation therapy for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receiving ECMO support are more specific and have not been fully reported. This study observed and evaluated the use of sedative and analgesic drugs and muscle relaxants in SARS-CoV-2 patients treated with VV-ECMO. Methods: This study was a single-center, retrospective and observational study. Our study includes 8 SARS-CoV-2 patients treated with VV-ECMO in an intensive care unit at Shanghai Public Health Center from February to June 2020. We collected the demographic data from these patients and the dose and course of sedation, analgesia, and muscle relaxants administered during ECMO treatment. Results: The doses of sedative, analgesic and muscle relaxant drugs used in patients with VV-ECMO were significant. Over time, the doses of drugs that were used were increased, and the course of muscle relaxant treatment was extended. Conclusion: Sedation, analgesia, and muscle relaxant use require individualized titration in patients with SARS-CoV-2 who have respiratory failure and who are receiving VV-ECMO.
