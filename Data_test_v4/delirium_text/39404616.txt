39404616|t|Classics in Chemical Neuroscience: Deliriant Antihistaminic Drugs.
39404616|a|Antihistaminic drugs are widely used clinically and have long been primarily known for their use to treat severe allergic conditions caused by histamine release. Antihistaminic drugs also exert central nervous system (CNS) effects, acting as anxiolytics, hypnotics, and neuroleptics. However, these drugs also have multiple serious neuropharmacological side-effects, inducing delirium, hyperarousal, disorganized behavior, and hallucinations. Due to their robust CNS effects, antihistamines are also increasingly abused, with occasional overdoses and life-threatening toxicity. Here, we discuss chemical and neuropharmacological aspects of antihistaminic drugs in both human and animal (experimental) models and outline their current societal and mental health importance as neuroactive substances.
