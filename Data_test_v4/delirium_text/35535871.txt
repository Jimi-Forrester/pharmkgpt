35535871|t|The relationship between amyloid-beta and brain capillary endothelial cells in Alzheimer's disease.
35535871|a|Neurovascular dysfunction, as an integral part of Alzheimer's disease, may have an important influence on the onset and progression of chronic neurodegenerative processes. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) pathway is one of the main pathways that mediates the clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain parenchyma. A large number of studies have shown that receptors and ATP-binding cassette transporters expressed on endothelial cells play an important role in Abeta transport across the BBB, but the specific mechanism is not clear. In this review, we summarize the possible mechanisms of Abeta production and clearance, and in particular the relationship between Abeta and brain capillary endothelial cells. Abeta is produced by abnormal cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein via amyloidogenic processing under pathological conditions. Dysregulation of Abeta clearance is considered to be the main reason for the massive accumulation of Abeta in the brain parenchyma. Several pathways mediating Abeta clearance from the brain into the periphery have been identified, including the BBB pathway, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and arachnoid granule pathway, and the lymphoid-related pathway. Brain capillary endothelial cells are the key components of Abeta clearance mediated by BBB. Receptors (such as LRP1, RAGE, and FcRn) and ATP-binding cassette transporters (such as P-gp, ABCA1, and ABCC1) expressed on endothelial cells play a critical role in Abeta transcytosis across the BBB. The toxic effects of Abeta can induce dysregulation of receptor and transporter expression on endothelial cells. Excessive Abeta exerts potent detrimental cerebrovascular effects by promoting oxidative stress, inducing chronic inflammation, and impairing endothelial structure and functions. All of these are main causes for the reduction in Abeta clearance across the BBB and the accumulation of Abeta in the brain parenchyma. Therefore, studies on the interactions between Abeta and brain capillary endothelial cells, including their receptors and transporters, studies on inhibition of the toxic effects of Abeta on endothelial cells, and studies on promoting the ability of endothelial cells to mediate Abeta clearance may provide new therapeutic strategies for Abeta clearance in Alzheimer's disease.
