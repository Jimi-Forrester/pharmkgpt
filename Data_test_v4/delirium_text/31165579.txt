31165579|a|Cerebral amyloid beta (Abeta) deposits are the main early pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, abundant Abeta deposits also occur spontaneously in the brains of many healthy people who are free of AD with advancing aging. A crucial unanswered question in AD prevention is why AD does not develop in some elderly people, despite the presence of Abeta deposits. The answer may lie in the composition of Abeta oligomer isoforms in the Abeta deposits of healthy brains, which are different from AD brains. However, which Abeta oligomer triggers the transformation from aging to AD pathogenesis is still under debate. Some researchers insist that the Abeta 12-mer causes AD pathology, while others suggest that the Abeta dimer is the crucial molecule in AD pathology. Aged rhesus monkeys spontaneously develop Abeta deposits in the brain with striking similarities to those of aged humans. Thus, rhesus monkeys are an ideal natural model to study the composition of Abeta oligomer isoforms and their downstream effects on AD pathology. In this study, we found that Abeta deposits in aged monkey brains included 3-mer, 5-mer, 9-mer, 10-mer, and 12-mer oligomers, but not 2-mer oligomers. The Abeta deposits, which were devoid of Abeta dimers, induced glial pathology (microgliosis, abnormal microglia morphology, and astrocytosis), but not the subsequent downstream pathologies of AD, including Tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and synapse loss. Our results indicate that the Abeta dimer plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. Thus, targeting the Abeta dimer is a promising strategy for preventing AD.
