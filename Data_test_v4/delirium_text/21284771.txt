21284771|t|Auditory hallucinosis in brainstem lesions and musical hallucination in deafness. Analogies and differences.
21284771|a|Auditory hallucinations are found at the cross-roads of otological, neurological and psychiatric practice. They are generally considered to be the manifestation of psychosis, delirium tremens and chronic alcoholism, toxic states, hemispheric (predominantly temporal lobe) involvement, brainstem disorders or acquired peripheral (acoustic nerve, cochlea or middle-ear) deafness. Auditory hallucinosis in one case of brainstem lesion and musical hallucinations in two cases associated with acquired peripheral deafness are presented. Analogies and differences, pathophysiology and review of the literature are discussed.
