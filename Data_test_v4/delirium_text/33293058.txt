33293058|a|Chemical investigation of the twigs and leaves of Rhodomyrtus tomentosa led to the isolation and structural identification of a novel polymethylated phloroglucinol meroterpenoid (PPM) featuring a 6/6/6/6 tetracyclic system, rhotomentodione F (1), five new polymethylated polycyclic phloroglucinols (PPPs) with a rare bis-furan framework, rhotomentosones A-E (2-6), and one new adduct composed of an acylphloroglucinol and two beta-triketone units, rhotomentosone F (7), as well as five known analogues (8-12). Their structures and absolute configurations were unambiguously determined by comprehensive spectroscopic data and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. All isolates were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities. Compound 6 displayed significant AChE inhibitory effect with an IC50 value of 8.68 muM. Further molecular docking studies of 6 revealed that the interactions with AChE residues Ser125, Glu202, and Tyr133 are crucial for AChE inhibitory activity. The current study not only enriches the chemical diversity of phloroglucinols in Myrtaceae species, but also provides potential lead compounds for the further design and development of new AChE inhibitors to treat Alzheimer's disease.
