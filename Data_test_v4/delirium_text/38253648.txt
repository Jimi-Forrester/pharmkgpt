38253648|a|In recent years, there have been an attempt to develop safe and environmental friendly solvents to replace conventional solvents, and use for extraction bioactive compounds from natural sources. A current investigation involved the preparation of green, methanolic, and ultrasonic extracts of S. sclarea, and compared their phenolic profiling using HPLC-DAD, antibacterial, antioxidant, and enzyme inhibition activities. The HPLC-DAD analysis revealed that Rosmarinic acid was the main content in all extracts, with Ellagic acid only present in the green extract. The green extract exhibited superior anti-biofilm activity against S. Aureus and E. Faecalis compared to the other extracts at MIC concentration. Furthermore, the green extract also displayed the highest inhibition of swarming motility in P. Aeruginosa with inhibition range 68.0 +- 2.1 (MIC) to 19.5 +- 0.6 (MIC/4). and better enzyme inhibitory activity against BChE (with IC50 = 131.6 +- 0.98 microg/mL) and AChE (with inhibition 47.00 +- 1.50%) compared to the other extracts; while, the ultrasonic extract showed strong inhibition of violacein production by C. Violaceum with a inhibition range 05.5 +- 0.1 (MIC/32) to 100 +- 0.00 (MIC), followed by the green extract with a inhibition range 15.0 +- 0.5 (MIC/8) to 100 +- 0.00 (MIC), additionally, the ultrasonic and methanoic extracts showed significant activity against urease enzyme with (IC50 = 171.6 +- 0.95 microg/mL and IC5 0 = 187.5 +- 1.32 microg/mL) respectively. Both the green and methanolic extracts showed considerable antioxidant activities, as beta-carotene-linoleic acid (IC50 = 5.61 +- 0.47 microg/mL and 5.37 +- 0.27 microg/mL), DPPH  (IC50 = 19.20 +- 0.70 microg/mL and 16.31 +- 0.23 microg/mL), ABTS +(IC50 = 8.64 +- 0.63 microg/mL and 6.50 +- 0.45 microg/mL) and CUPRAC (A0.5 = 17.22 +- 0.36 microg/mL and 12.28 +- 0.12 microg/mL) respectively, likewise the green extract performing better in metal chelating compared to the other extracts. The green extraction is reported as a cost effective and solvent free method for extracting natural products that produces compounds free of toxic chemicals. This could be the method to be used in the industries as a renewable method.
