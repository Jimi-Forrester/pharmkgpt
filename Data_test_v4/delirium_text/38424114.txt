38424114|t|RNA as a component of scrapie fibrils.
38424114|a|Recently, electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) maps of fibrils from the brains of mice and hamsters with five infectious scrapie strains have been published and deposited in the electron microscopy data bank (EMDB). As noted by the primary authors, the fibrils contain a second component other than protein. The aim of the present study was to identify the nature of this second component in the published maps using an in silico approach. Extra densities (EDs) containing this component were continuous, straight, axial, at right angles to protein rungs and within hydrogen-bonding distance of protein, consistent with a structural role. EDs co-located with strips of basic residues, notably lysines, and formed a conspicuous cladding over parts of the N-terminal lobe of the protein. A Y-shaped polymer consistent with RNA was found, in places forming a single chain and at one location forming a duplex, comprising two antiparallel chains, and raising the intriguing possibility of replicative behaviour. To reflect the monotonous nature of the protein interface, it is suggested that the RNA may be a short tandem repeat. Fibrils from brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerations also contain EDs and may be of a similar aetiology.
