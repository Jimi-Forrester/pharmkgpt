24898650|t|Modulation of amyloid-beta protein precursor expression by HspB1.
24898650|a|Upregulation of heat shock proteins, such as Hsp70 and HspB1/Hsp27, have been associated with an amelioration of the deficits in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). HspB1 is reported to be increased in AD brains and to accumulate in plaques, but whether this localization is an attempt by HspB1 to ameliorate the detrimental effects of amyloid-beta (Abeta) on cells or part of the disease process is unknown. Here we explore the potential effects of the HspB1 on amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) processing and distribution within HEK293 stable cell lines expressing either AbetaPPwt or AbetaPPsw. We compare AbetaPP production, distribution, and release of proteolytic products (including Abeta40 and Abeta42) to determine possible modifications in the presence of HspB1. We also investigate whether HspB1 interacts with Abeta or its precursor, AbetaPP, and whether, through this interaction, it is able to alter AbetaPP processing or release of Abeta peptide. Coexpression of HspB1 resulted in increased cellular holoAbetaPP as well as C-terminal fragments. Further, expression of HspB1 attenuated the release of Abeta42 from the AbetaPPsw cells. In summary, we have shown that expression of HspB1 alters AbetaPP expression and processing in cell lines expressing AbetaPPwt and AbetaPPsw. Furthermore, the presence of HspB1 decreased the amount of Abeta42 released by the cell lines. Thus in addition to its effects on protecting cells from the potentially toxic effects of Abeta, HspB1 also appears to be involved in modulating cellular levels of AbetaPP, although an understanding of the underlying mechanisms requires further investigation.
