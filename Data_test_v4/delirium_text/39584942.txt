39584942|t|Frailty and Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia: A Single Center Study.
39584942|a|Background: During the time-course of cognitive decline, Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) may arise, negatively impacting the outcomes. Methods: The aim of this single center, longitudinal study was to evaluate the correlation between frailty and BPSD in a population of older patients with dementia. BPSD were classified into three clusters: "mood/apathy" (depression, apathy, sleep disturbances, appetite disturbances), "psychosis" (delusions, hallucinations, and anxiety), and "hyperactivity" (agitation, elation, motor aberrant behavior, irritability, disinhibition). Using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), patients were categorized as "severely frail", "mild/moderately frail" and "robust" (CFS >= 7, 4-6, and <= 3, respectively). Results: In total, 209 patients (mean age 83.24 +- 4.98 years) with a clinical diagnosis of dementia were enrolled. BPSD were prevalent among the severely frail patients. A positive correlation at regression analysis was found between frailty and "hyperactivity" cluster at baseline and follow-up visits (p < 0.001, p = 0.022, p = 0.028, respectively), and was confirmed at the network analysis. Loss of independence in IADL was correlated to hyperactivity and psychosis symptoms (p < 0.001 and p = 0.013, respectively). Conclusions: Scarce literature is available regarding the correlation between frailty and BPSD, which in our study is significant, especially for symptoms in the hyperactivity cluster. Frailty assessment may help identify patients at the highest risk for developing BPDS who might benefit from targeted intervention in the earliest phases of the disease.
