29543752|t|Stress-Activated Protein Kinases in Spinal Cord Injury: Focus on Roles of p38.
29543752|a|Spinal cord injury (SCI) consists of three phases-acute, secondary, and chronic damages-and limiting the development of secondary damage possibly improves functional recovery after SCI. A major component of the secondary phase of SCI is regarded as inflammation-triggered events: induction of cytokines, edema, microglial activation, apoptosis of cells including oligodendrocytes and neurons, demyelination, formation of the astrocytic scar, and so on. Two major stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs)-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)-are activated in various types of cells in response to cellular stresses such as apoptotic stimuli and inflammatory waves. In animal models of SCI, inhibition of either JNK or p38 has been shown to promote neuroprotection-associated functional recovery. Here, we provide an overview on the roles of SAPKs in SCI and, in particular, the pathological role of p38 will be discussed as a promising target for therapeutic intervention in SCI.
