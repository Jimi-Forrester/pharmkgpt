27458694|a|Thrombin initiates proinflammatory signaling responses through activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs) in in vitro and in vivo systems. Proinflammatory signaling function of thrombin increases secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, triggers vascular permeability, promotes leukocyte migration, and induces adhesion molecule expression. Thrombin as a potent signaling molecule is strongly implicated in a number of proinflammatory disorders including severe sepsis, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and of special interest in this review neurodegenerative disorders. This review summarizes the role of thrombin in the pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), promoting greater understanding and clinical management of these diseases.
