33409027|t|Effect of Intramuscular Atropine Sulphate and Glycopyrrolate on Heart Rate and Salivary Secretion in Patients Undergoing Minor Oral Surgical Procedure.
33409027|a|Introduction In most of the oral surgical procedures performed under local anesthesia, we often face a great difficulty while performing surgeries because of reduced accessibility and visibility which is hampered by blood and saliva at the surgical site. Anticholinergic drugs like atropine sulphate and glycopyrrolate are commonly used as antisialogogue for patients undergoing a surgical procedure under general anesthesia with little or no side effects.  Aims and objectives To evaluate and compare the antisialogogue effect of atropine sulphate and glycopyrrolate in patients undergoing minor oral surgical procedures. To compare the efficacy of these drugs when administered intramuscularly and to evaluate their effects on heart rate in patients undergoing minor oral surgical procedures. Materials and methods Thirty patients undergoing minor oral surgical procedure were selected for the study. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either 0.6 mg/ml of Atropine Sulphate or 0.2 mg/ml of Glycopyrrolate intramuscularly. Salivary secretion, heart rate and arterial pressure were noted pre-injection and 30 minutes after the administration of the drug. Results Atropine sulphate and glycopyrrolate were equally potent as an antisialogogue. There was a significant increase in heart rate 30 min after the administration of atropine sulphate, but there was no significant change in heart rate in glycopyrrolate group. Conclusion Intramuscular gycopyrrolate is safer than intramuscular atropine sulphate as an antisialogogue in minor oral surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
