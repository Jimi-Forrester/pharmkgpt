OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the necessary changes prior to introducing these therapies in our setting. METHODS: We conducted a key informant survey among heads of departments of neurology from 16 hospitals in Spain. The questionnaire comprised questions about changes in the organization and functioning of the departments of neurology with the introduction of anti-amyloid drugs, changes in diagnosis and patient care, use of diagnostic techniques, patients, families and public information, resources allocation, and research. RESULTS: Sixteen key informants completed the survey. They strongly agreed that the introduction of anti-amyloid drugs will impact the functioning of neurology services, especially in hospitals with dementia units. Consensus was reached regarding referring all Alzheimer's disease patients eligible for therapy to dementia units. There was also agreement on the need to expand the neurology services, day hospital units, extend visit durations, and hire more professionals, especially neurologists, neuropsychologists, and nuclear medicine physicians. Furthermore, consensus was achieved on increasing the use of MRI, amyloid PET, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, APOE genotyping, and the necessity of advancing blood biomarkers and tau tracers. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the need for extensive changes within Spanish neurological departments to effectively integrate anti-amyloid antibodies. Implementing these changes is essential for the timely and equitable adoption of novel therapies.
