38766813|t|Efficacy and Safety of Orally and Intravenously Administration of Tranexamic Acid in Patients with Elderly Femoral Neck Fracture.
38766813|a|OBJECTIVE: For elderly femoral neck fracture patients, anemia is one of the most common complications, increasing the risk of postoperative adverse events. Tranexamic acid (TXA) has been widely applied to the perioperative blood management. However, the optimal route of TXA administration in elderly femoral neck fracture remains unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral and intravenous (IV) application of TXA in elderly patients with femoral neck fracture undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) and hemiarthroplasty (HA). METHODS: All elderly patients aged over 65 years old diagnosed with femoral neck fracture admitted to the trauma orthopedics from August 1, 2020 to February 28, 2022 were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Participants were divided into three groups: oral group: TXA 2g orally 2 h before incision; IV group: intravenous infusion of TXA 1g 15 min before incision; and control group: usual hemostatic method. The primary outcomes were total blood loss, allogeneic transfusion rate, and postoperative thromboembolic events. SPSS 23.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis, and p <= 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were enrolled, including 32 cases in the oral group, 34 cases in the IV group and 34 cases in the control group. Compared with the control group, the total perioperative blood loss in the oral and IV groups was significantly decreased (763.92 +- 358.64 mL vs 744.62 +- 306.88 mL vs 1250.60 +- 563.37 mL, p = 0.048). No significant difference was identified between the oral and IV groups (p = 0.970). The rate of allogeneic transfusion was lower in the oral and IV groups than in the control group, but the difference had no statistical significant (6 vs 5 vs 12, p = 0.108), However, subgroup analysis showed that the IV and oral groups in patients who underwent THA have significant lower transfusion rate compared with the control group (1 vs 3 vs 7, p = 0.02). During 6 months follow-up, no thromboembolic events were identified. Two patients (one from the oral group and one from the control group) died of respiratory failure. The cost of blood management from the oral group was significantly lower than IV (p < 0.001) and control groups (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with femoral neck fracture undergoing THA can benefit from both IV and oral administration of tranexamic acid. The results of these two administration routes are similar in safety and effectiveness. A similar tendency was observed in patients undergoing HA. Oral TXA is more cost-benefit compared with intravenous applications.
