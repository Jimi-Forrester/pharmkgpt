36773661|t|Spinal Versus General Anesthesia in Contemporary Revision Total Knee Arthroplasties.
36773661|a|BACKGROUND: Interest in spinal anesthesia utilization in revision total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) is rising. This study investigated the pain control, length of stay (LOS), and complications associated with spinal versus general anesthesia in a single institution series of revision TKAs. METHODS: We identified 3,711 revision TKAs (3,495 patients) from 2001 to 2016 using our institutional total joint registry. There were 66% who had general anesthesia and 34% who had spinal anesthesia. Mean age, sex, and BMI were similar between groups at 67 years, 53% women, and 32, respectively. Data were analyzed using inverse probability of treatment weighted models based on propensity scores that accounted for patient and operative factors. Mean follow-up was 6 years (range, 2 to 17). RESULTS: Patients treated with spinal anesthesia required fewer postoperative oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) (P < .0001) and had lower numeric pain rating scale scores (P < .001). Spinal anesthesia was associated with shorter LOS (4.0 versus 4.6 days; P < .0001), less cases of altered mental status (AMS; Odds Ratio (OR) 2.0, P = .004), less intensive care unit (ICU) admissions (OR 1.6, P = .02), fewer re-revisions (OR 1.7, P < .001), and less reoperations (OR 1.4, P < .001). There was no difference in the incidence of VTE (P = .82), 30-day readmissions (P = .06), or 90-day readmissions (P = .18) between anesthetic techniques. CONCLUSION: We found that spinal anesthesia for revision TKAs was associated with significantly lower pain scores, reduced OME requirements, and decreased LOS. Furthermore, spinal anesthesia was associated with fewer cases of AMS, ICU admissions, and re-revisions even after accounting for numerous patient and operative factors. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, Retrospective Comparative Study.
