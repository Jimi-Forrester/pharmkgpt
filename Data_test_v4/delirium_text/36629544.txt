36629544|a|Carnitine is a conditionally necessary vitamin that aids in energy creation and fatty acid metabolism. Its bioavailability is higher in vegetarians than in meat-eaters. Deficits in carnitine transporters occur because of genetic mutations or in conjunction with other illnesses. Carnitine shortage can arise in health issues and diseases-including hypoglycaemia, heart disease, starvation, cirrhosis, and ageing-because of abnormalities in carnitine control. The physiologically active form of L-carnitine supports immunological function in diabetic patients. Carnitine has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, several painful neuropathies, and other conditions. It has been used as a dietary supplement for the treatment of heart disease, and it also aids in the treatment of obesity and reduces blood glucose levels. Therefore, L-carnitine shows the potential to eliminate the influences of fatigue in COVID-19, and its consumption is recommended in future clinical trials to estimate its efficacy and safety. This review focused on carnitine and its effect on tissues, covering the biosynthesis, metabolism, bioavailability, biological actions, and its effects on various body systems and COVID-19.
