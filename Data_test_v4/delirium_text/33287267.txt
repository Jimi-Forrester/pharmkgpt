33287267|t|Constipation and Its Associated Factors among Patients with Dementia.
33287267|a|Constipation is one of the most frequent non-motor problems in older adults. As constipation is commonly ignored by dementia patients, it is not usually reported on time. Constipation has a serious impact on the activity of daily living and quality of life in dementia patients. The relationships between constipation, demographic variables, and the nutritional status of patients with dementia remain unknown. This study aimed to assess the possible factors associated with constipation. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from January to November 2019. This hospital is a medical center and the main referral hospital of southern Taiwan, serving 3 million inhabitants. In total, 119 patients with dementia were evaluated using the Rome III diagnostic criteria for functional constipation. There were 30 patients with dementia included in the constipation group and 89 patients with dementia included in the no constipation group. Mini-Nutritional Assessment and 3-day diet diary records were employed. The clinical dementia rating score was used to evaluate the severity of dementia in patients of the outpatient clinic. Approximately 25.2% of dementia patients had constipation. Patients in the dementia with constipation group were older, had severer dementia, and displayed a lower water intake. After multivariable adjustment, low liquid consumption was the predictor of constipation among patients with dementia. The findings support the clinical recommendations to treat constipation with an increased liquid intake, but not exercise, in dementia patients.
