35038699|a|BACKGROUND: Initial orthostatic hypotension (IOH) is highly prevalent in older adults and may interfere with the ability to regain function after acute hospitalization. IOH assessment requires a non-invasive, beat-to-beat continuous blood pressure device, which is not widely used in geriatric rehabilitation. Our aim was to test the feasibility of diagnosing IOH using a continuous blood pressure device in geriatric rehabilitation inpatients. METHODS: Geriatric rehabilitation inpatients of the REStORing Health of Acutely Unwell AdulTs (RESORT) cohort admitted to a tertiary hospital were randomly selected to undergo continuous blood pressure monitoring (Finapres) for 5 min in the supine position and 3 min of standing or sitting when unable to stand. Interventions to warm hands and adjusting the cuff pressure sizes were attempted if no signal was obtained or an error message occurred. RESULTS: Of 37 randomly selected inpatients, 29 {55.2% female; mean age 82.8 (standard deviation [SD]) 6.6 years} agreed to the continuous blood pressure measurement. Successful measurements were achieved in 20 out of 29 inpatients, two after hand warming. Patients with unsuccessful measurements were likely to be older (mean age 87.2 [SD] 4.4 years, p = 0.03), have cerebrovascular disease (p = 0.006), lower body mass index (p = 0.012), and a lower short physical performance battery score (p = 0.039). Eight out of 20 patients had IOH. CONCLUSION: The number of unsuccessful continuous blood pressure measurements was high in a population with high IOH prevalence despite multiple interventions to establish a signal. Future research should focus on improving the efficiency of continuous blood pressure devices in hospitalized patients with unsuccessful signals.
