39545245|t|Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Rescue Analgesic Needs in Non-intubated Intensive Care Patients.
39545245|a|Background: Dexmedetomidine is a centrally acting alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonist that is usually used in the intensive care unit (ICU) for its sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic properties. Studies have shown that dexmedetomidine can be an effective adjunct analgesic, but they are limited and usually use a population of intubated patients. To better evaluate the role of dexmedetomidine use in the adult ICU, more information needs to be gathered on its analgesic effect and its utility in non-intubated patients. Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis between adult non-intubated ICU patients on dexmedetomidine and non-intubated ICU patients not on dexmedetomidine who were admitted to a 302-bed tertiary academic medical center between October 1, 2022, and August 31, 2023. Inclusion criteria necessitated an as-needed opioid order with a corresponding pain score and at least 1 other pain assessment and no history of symptomatic bradycardia, nor could it be present on admission. The primary study objective was to assess the amount of morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) received during ICU admission with concomitant dexmedetomidine infusion. Secondary outcomes included the time to first dose of rescue opioid analgesia and ICU length of stay. Results: A total of 38 patients were included. Baseline demographics did not differ significantly between groups. There was a significant statistical difference in the total amount of MMEs received, with the dexmedetomidine group having significantly less than the control group (P < 0.001). The dexmedetomidine group also had a significantly longer time to first rescue analgesia dose (P = 0.025) and a significantly increased incidence of delirium (P < 0.001). There was no difference in other adverse events between groups. Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine significantly decreased MME requirements and increased time to first rescue analgesia dose in non-intubated ICU patients without increasing adverse effects but was associated with an increased incidence of delirium.
