32066384|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicated that the behavioral performances of older adults could be enhanced by multisensory integration. This pilot study tested the benefits of an audiovisual integrative (AV) training for improving the cognitive and upper limb motor functions in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Twenty participants, according to their MoCA scores, with ten in each of a MCI (mean age = 63.3 years) and healthy older adult group (mean age = 64.7 years), engaged in AV integrative training. They were recruited from the Institute of Active Ageing at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The screening was conducted from February to March 2018 and the training program which consisted of three sessions (2 h each) was conducted from 14-28th May 2018. Their executive function, attention and upper limb functions were measured by the Stroop Test and Purdue Pegboard Test respectively. RESULTS: The mixed linear model analysis results showed significant Time x Group interaction effects in the time used in the Stroop Test (dots) (p = 0.042) and the Purdue Pegboard scores (non-dominant hand use) (p = 0.025). The MCI group exhibited significantly more improvements in attentional control and non-dominant hand motor functions after the training. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the AV integrative training has the potential for enhancing the cognitive and motor functions of older adults with MCI. Furthermore, AV integrative training can serve as an alternative non-pharmacological intervention for combating neurodegeneration in older adults. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study has been retrospectively registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry which is a World Health Organisation approved registry.
