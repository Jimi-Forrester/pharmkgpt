36694187|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with psychosis frequently use a variety of psychotropic medicines, many of which have anticholinergic effects that can impair cognition. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate whether there is an association between medications used for neuropsychological disorders/symptoms and cognition in patients with schizophrenia, focusing on their anticholinergic load and antipsychotic doses. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study between July 2019 and Mars 2020 at the Psychiatric Hospital of the Cross-Lebanon enrolled 120 inpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia. The total anticholinergic burden was calculated based on the Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS), and the chlorpromazine equivalent dose was calculated using the Andreasen method to assess the relative antipsychotic dose. Also, the objective cognition was assessed using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) tool. STUDY RESULTS: A significantly higher BACS total score (r = -0.33, p < 0.001), higher verbal memory (r = -0.26, p = 0.004), higher working memory (r = -0.20, p = 0.03), higher motor speed (r = -0.36, p < 0.001), and higher attention and speed of information processing (r = -0.27, p = 0.003) were significantly associated with lower chlorpromazine equivalent dose. Higher ADS (Standardized Beta (SB) = -.22; p = .028), higher chlorpromazine equivalent dose (SB = -.30; p = .001), and taking mood stabilizer medications (SB = -.24; p = .004) were significantly associated with lower cognition. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that the cognitive functions of chronic patients with schizophrenia may be affected by medications and their anticholinergic burden. More studies are needed to explain the role of cholinergic neurotransmission and general neurochemical mechanisms in the cognitive impairment of patients with schizophrenia.
