39005357|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, continues to increase in prevalence without any effective treatments to date. In this context, knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a pivotal tool in biomedical research, offering new perspectives on drug repurposing and biomarker discovery by analyzing intricate network structures. Our study seeks to build an AD-specific knowledge graph, highlighting interactions among AD, genes, variants, chemicals, drugs, and other diseases. The goal is to shed light on existing treatments, potential targets, and diagnostic methods for AD, thereby aiding in drug repurposing and the identification of biomarkers. Results: We annotated 800 PubMed abstracts and leveraged GPT-4 for text augmentation to enrich our training data for named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification. A comprehensive data mining model, integrating NER and relationship classification, was trained on the annotated corpus. This model was subsequently applied to extract relation triplets from unannotated abstracts. To enhance entity linking, we utilized a suite of reference biomedical databases and refine the linking accuracy through abbreviation resolution. As a result, we successfully identified 3,199,276 entity mentions and 633,733 triplets, elucidating connections between 5,000 unique entities. These connections were pivotal in constructing a comprehensive Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Graph (ADKG). We also integrated the ADKG constructed after entity linking with other biomedical databases. The ADKG served as a training ground for Knowledge Graph Embedding models with the high-ranking predicted triplets supported by evidence, underscoring the utility of ADKG in generating testable scientific hypotheses. Further application of ADKG in predictive modeling using the UK Biobank data revealed models based on ADKG outperforming others, as evidenced by higher values in the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Conclusion: The ADKG is a valuable resource for generating hypotheses and enhancing predictive models, highlighting its potential to advance AD's disease research and treatment strategies.
