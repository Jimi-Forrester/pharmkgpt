28881697|a|The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the feasibility of laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) for elderly gastric cancer patients by comparing laparoscopic and conventional open gastrectomies (OG). Comprehensive search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases revealed nine non-randomized controlled studies that compared LG and OG in elderly gastric cancer patients We then analyzed dichotomous or continuous parameters using odds ratios (ORs) or weighted mean differences (WMDs). Overall survival was estimated using hazard ratios (HRs) with a fixed effects or random effects model. We observed that the age distribution was similar between the LG and OG patient groups (WMD -0.22 95% CI, -1.26-0.82). LG patients experienced less blood loss (WMD -119.14 95% CI, -204.17--34.11) and had shorter hospital stays (WMD -3.48 95% CI, -5.41--1.56), but endured longer operation times (WMD 10.87 95% CI, 2.50-19.24). Postoperatively, LG patients exhibited lower incidences of postoperative morbidities (OR 0.59 95% CI, 0.43-0.79), surgery related morbidities (OR 0.58 95% CI, 0.41-0.81) and systemic morbidities (OR 0.56 95% CI, 0.38-0.82). We observed no differences between the LG and OG patient groups regarding anastomotic leakage (OR 0.69 95% CI, 0.34-1.41), mental disease (OR 0.72 95% CI, 0.37-1.41) and long term effects (HR 0.98 95% CI, 0.74-1.32). We therefore conclude that laparoscopic gastrectomy might be technically feasible for elderly gastric cancer patients.
