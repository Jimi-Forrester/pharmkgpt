18184373|t|Neurogenesis and cell cycle-reactivated neuronal death during pathogenic tau aggregation.
18184373|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the relation between neurogenesis, cell cycle reactivation and neuronal death during tau pathology in a novel tau transgenic mouse line THY-Tau22 with two frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome-17 mutations in a human tau isoform. This mouse displays all Alzheimer disease features of neurodegeneration and a broad timely resolution of tau pathology with hyperphosphorylation of tau at younger age (up to 6 months) and abnormal tau phosphorylation and tau aggregation in aged mice (by 10 months). Here, we present a follow-up of cell cycle markers with aging in control and transgenic mice from different ages. We show that there is an increased neurogenesis during tau hyperphosphorylation and cell cycle events during abnormal tau phosphorylation and tau aggregation preceding neuronal death and neurodegeneration. However, besides phosphorylation, other mechanisms including tau mutations and changes in tau expression and/or splicing may be also involved in these mechanisms of cell cycle reactivation. Altogether, these data suggest that cell cycle events in THY-Tau22 are resulting from neurogenesis in young animals and cell death in older ones. It suggests that neuronal cell death in such models is much more complex than believed.
