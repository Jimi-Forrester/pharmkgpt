28135060|t|Evidence of Molecular Interactions of Abeta1-42 with N-Terminal Truncated Beta Amyloids by NMR.
28135060|a|Abeta peptides, the main protein components of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plaques, derive from a proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein. Due to heterogeneous cleavage sites, a series of Abeta peptides, including the major and widely studied species Abeta1-40 (Abeta40) and Abeta1-42 (Abeta42), are produced. In addition to the C-terminal heterogeneity of Abeta peptides, significant amounts of N-terminal truncated (Abeta3-42) and pyroglutamate-modified amyloid-beta peptides (AbetapE3-42) have been identified in AD affected brains and shown to be more cytotoxic than unmodified Abeta peptides. Little is known about the properties of their mixtures with Abeta42. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy is here employed to investigate the interaction of N-truncated peptides with Abeta42 at different molar ratios. We highlight the critical concentration of N-truncated forms influencing the aggregation kinetics of Abeta42. We provide evidence, at residue level, that the C-terminal region of Abeta42 is the locus of transient specific interactions with highly aggregation prone N-truncated alloforms.
