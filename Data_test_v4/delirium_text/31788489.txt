31788489|t|Neutrophil to Lymphocyte and Platelet to Lymphocyte Ratios in Normal Tension Glaucoma.
31788489|a|Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) is a subtype of glaucoma that occurs at relatively low intraocular pressure levels and results in progressive optic neuropathy. Previous studies display some abnormal immune activity against the optic nerve. Neutrophil to lymphocyte (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratios (PLR) are novel markers for inflammation. Here we evaluated the NLR, PLR, Creactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels in NTG. NLR and PLR were resulted by dividing neutrophil and platelet counts to lymphocyte count respectively. Patients with a history of diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, rheumatologic disease, anemia, cancer, cigarette smoking, myocardial infarction and a febrile illness within one month of sampling were excluded from the investigation. In total, the blood samples of 28 NTG and 27control patients were analyzed for the study. There were 11 female (40.7%) and 16 male patients (59.3%) in the control group. The NTG group contained 15 (53.6%) female and 13 (46.4%) male patients. All of the NLR, PLR, ESR and CRP, values of NTG patients were not statistically different from the control group (P = 0.07, P = 0.64, P = 0.17, and P = 0.44 respectively). Although previous studies have shown significant differences in NLR and PLR levels in other types of glaucoma, we did not find any significant difference in NTG subjects. Our early report may give insight into the differential diagnosis of NTG.
