38182844|t|Impact of delirium on acute stroke outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
38182844|a|Delirium is a common complication in acute stroke patients. A 2011 meta-analysis showed an increased risk of in-hospital mortality and mortality within 12 months post-stroke, longer hospitalization durations, and increased likelihood of being discharged to a nursing home for patients experiencing post-stroke delirium. There is a need for an updated meta-analysis with several new studies having been since published. The PubMed and Scopus databases were screened for relevant studies. Inclusion criteria were as follows: retrospective or prospective studies reporting on the effects of delirium accompanying acute stroke on mortality, functional outcomes, length of hospital stay and need for re-admission. Strength of association was presented as pooled adjusted relative risk (RR) for categorical outcomes and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes. Statistical analysis was done using STATA version 16.0. The meta-analysis included 22 eligible articles. Eighteen of the 22 studies were prospective follow ups. Included studies were of good quality. Post-stroke delirium was associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality, as well as mortality within 12 months post-stroke. Patients with delirium experienced increased hospital stay durations, were at greater risk for hospital readmission, and showed elevated risk for poor functional outcome. Compared to those who did not have delirium, stroke patients with delirium were 42% less likely to be discharged to home. Acute stroke patients with delirium are at an increased risk for poor short- and long-term outcomes. More research is needed to identify the best set of interventions to manage such patients and improve outcomes.
