21525113|t|Dexmedetomidine and clonidine: from second- to first-line sedative agents in the critical care setting?
21525113|a|In the critical care setting, alpha-2 agonists present a multifaceted profile: sedation combined with arousability, suppression of delirium, preservation of respiratory drive, reduced O(2) consumption, preserved renal function, and reduced protein metabolism. In addition, this review details the reduced arterial impedance, improved left ventricular performance, preserved vascular reactivity to exogenous amines, preserved cardiac baroreflex reactivity, preserved vasomotor baroreflex activity combined with a lowered pressure set point: these features may explain the good tolerance observed when alpha-2 agonists are used as continuous infusion without any loading dose. Reviewing the literature allows one to suggest that a new management appears possible with arousable sedation. However, it remains to be demonstrated whether this arousable sedation can be combined with the preservation of spontaneous ventilation, in the setting of severe respiratory distress, as opposed to conventional controlled mechanical ventilation combined with conventional sedation. Should such a speculative view be confirmed, then alpha-2 agonists will move from second-line sedative agents to first-line sedative agents. However, key studies are lacking to demonstrate the effect of alpha-2 agonists on physiological endpoints and outcome. Presently, the existing body of data suggests a niche for the use of alpha-2 agonists in the critical care setting.
