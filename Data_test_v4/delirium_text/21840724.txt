21840724|t|Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of curcumin analogues as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
21840724|a|A series of novel curcumin analogues were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as potential multifunctional agents for the treatment of AD. The in vitro studies showed that these compounds had better inhibitory properties against Abeta aggregation than curcumin. Superior anti-oxidant properties (better than the reference compound Trolox) of these compounds were observed by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method and a cell-based assay using DCFH-DA as a probe. In addition they were able to chelate metals such as iron and copper and decrease metal-induced Abeta aggregation. The structure-activity relationships were discussed. The results suggested that our curcumin analogues could be selected as multifunctional agents for further investigation of AD treatment.
