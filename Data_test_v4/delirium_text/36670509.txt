36670509|a|BACKGROUND: Peritumoral brain edema (PTBE) is a common complication related to intracranial meningiomas. In several studies, researchers have investigated the pathogenesis of PTBE, and the factors involved in its development in patients with intracranial meningiomas have been reported. However, very little is known about the clinical effect of PTBE on patients with intracranial meningiomas; therefore, a systematic examination of this matter is necessary. METHODS: In this study, we performed a systematic examination of 696 patients with primary intracranial meningiomas to assess the effect of preoperative PTBE on preoperative symptoms, neurological deficits and postoperative complications, and long-term outcomes with a follow-up period of 16.8 years. We performed a univariate analysis and multiple regression for specific outcomes and adjusted for other relevant clinical factors. RESULTS: A total of 627 (90.1%) patients were symptomatic preoperatively. One hundred eighty-eight (90.8%) patients with small to moderate PTBE and 125 (98.4%) patients with severe PTBE presented with symptoms significantly more often than the 314 (86.7%) patients without PTBE (p < 0.001, univariate analysis). Cognitive deficits, palsy and seizure were significantly more present, preoperatively, in patients with PTBE than in patients without PTBE (p < 0.001, univariate analysis). Two hundred fifty-five (36.6%) patients experienced surgical and systemic complications postoperatively. The complication rate was significantly higher in patients with PTBE; 41.5% for patients with small to moderate PTBE and 52.8% for patients with severe PTBE, compared to 28.2% of patients without PTBE (p < 0.001, univariate analysis). Furthermore, pre- and postoperative KPS scores were significantly lower in patients with PTBE (p < 0.001). Patients with PTBE required additional medical support significantly more often (p < 0.001) and had a significantly longer hospital stay (p < 0.001). The mortality rate was higher in patients with PTBE immediately after surgery and in the follow-up period; however, the difference was not significant. The neurological condition of all patients improved in the follow-up and did not show significant differences between patients with and without preoperative PTBE (p = 0.6361). Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed a significant association between PTBE and the presence of preoperative cognitive deficits, the incidences of seizure and postoperative complications, and low pre- and postoperative KPS scores. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative PTBE significantly increased the incidences of specific preoperative symptoms, neurological deficits and postoperative complications in patients with intracranial meningiomas. After surgery, patients with preoperative PTBE required medical support significantly more often than patients without PTBE. However, all patients had favorable outcomes after surgery.
