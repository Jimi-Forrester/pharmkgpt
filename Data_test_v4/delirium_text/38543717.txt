38543717|a|We assessed the association between cirrhosis and severe COVID-19-related outcomes among people with laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 infection in British Columbia, Canada. We used data from the British Columbia (BC) COVID-19 Cohort, a population-based cohort that integrates data on all individuals tested for COVID-19, with data on hospitalizations, medical visits, emergency room visits, prescription drugs, chronic conditions, and deaths in the Canadian province of BC. We included all individuals aged >=18 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of cirrhosis status with COVID-19-related hospitalization and with ICU admission. Of the 162,509 individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were included in the analysis, 768 (0.5%) had cirrhosis. In the multivariable models, cirrhosis was associated with increased odds of hospitalization (aOR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.58-2.47) and ICU admission (aOR = 3.33, 95% CI: 2.56-4.35). In the analyses stratified by age, we found that the increased odds of ICU admission among people with cirrhosis were present in all the assessed age-groups. Cirrhosis is associated with increased odds of hospitalization and ICU admission among COVID-19 patients.
