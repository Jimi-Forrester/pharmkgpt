28552085|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this paper was to examine whether glaucoma could be a non-memory manifestation of Alzheimer's disease in older people. METHODS: We conducted a population-based, retrospective, case-control study to analyze the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. There were 1,351 subjects >=65 years old with newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease as the cases, and 5,329 subjects without any type of dementias as the controls during 2000-2011. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk of Alzheimer's disease associated with glaucoma was estimated by the multivariable unconditional logistic regression model. RESULTS: After controlling for confounders, the multivariable logistic regression model demonstrated that the adjusted OR of Alzheimer's disease was 1.50 in subjects with glaucoma (95% CI 1.19, 1.89), compared to subjects without glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS: Older people with glaucoma are associated with 1.5-fold increased odds of Alzheimer's disease in Taiwan. Glaucoma may be a non-memory manifestation of Alzheimer's disease in older people. Further research is needed to confirm this issue.
