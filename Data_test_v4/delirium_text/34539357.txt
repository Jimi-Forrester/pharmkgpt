34539357|t|Metabolic Disturbances Induced by Sleep Restriction as Potential Triggers for Alzheimer's Disease.
34539357|a|Sleep has a major role in learning, memory consolidation, and metabolic function. Although it is known that sleep restriction increases the accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and the risk to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD), the mechanism behind these effects remains unknown. In this review, we discuss how chronic sleep restriction induces metabolic and cognitive impairments that could result in the development of AD in late life. Here, we integrate evidence regarding mechanisms whereby metabolic signaling becomes disturbed after short or chronic sleep restriction in the context of cognitive impairment, particularly in the accumulation of Abeta in the brain. We also discuss the role of the blood-brain barrier in sleep restriction with an emphasis on the transport of metabolic signals into the brain and Abeta clearance. This review presents the unexplored possibility that the alteration of peripheral metabolic signals induced by sleep restriction, especially insulin resistance, is responsible for cognitive deficit and, subsequently, implicated in AD development.
