37762096|t|The Dual Role of Autophagy in Postischemic Brain Neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's Disease Proteinopathy.
37762096|a|Autophagy is a self-defense and self-degrading intracellular system involved in the recycling and elimination of the payload of cytoplasmic redundant components, aggregated or misfolded proteins and intracellular pathogens to maintain cell homeostasis and physiological function. Autophagy is activated in response to metabolic stress or starvation to maintain homeostasis in cells by updating organelles and dysfunctional proteins. In neurodegenerative diseases, such as cerebral ischemia, autophagy is disturbed, e.g., as a result of the pathological accumulation of proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease and their structural changes. Postischemic brain neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease, is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid and tau protein. After cerebral ischemia, autophagy was found to be activated in neuronal, glial and vascular cells. Some studies have shown the protective properties of autophagy in postischemic brain, while other studies have shown completely opposite properties. Thus, autophagy is now presented as a double-edged sword with possible therapeutic potential in brain ischemia. The exact role and regulatory pathways of autophagy that are involved in cerebral ischemia have not been conclusively elucidated. This review aims to provide a comprehensive look at the advances in the study of autophagy behavior in neuronal, glial and vascular cells for ischemic brain injury. In addition, the importance of autophagy in neurodegeneration after cerebral ischemia has been highlighted. The review also presents the possibility of modulating the autophagy machinery through various compounds on the development of neurodegeneration after cerebral ischemia.
