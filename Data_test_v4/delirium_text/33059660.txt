33059660|t|Clinical pictures mimicking acute hernia complications: are we really daring to violate a traditional abdominal wall surgery dogma?
33059660|a|BACKGROUND: Acute abdominal wall hernia complications usually require a prompt surgical treatment. The aim of this case series is to report our experience with some unusual cases of apparent acute and subacute hernia complications not requiring surgical treatment, changing the classical paradigm of immediate surgical approach into a "wait and see" situation. CASE PRESENTATION: We shortly report here four cases of abdominal wall hernia complications in which surgical treatment could have been unsafe for the patients considering their clinical condition. Two cases were fistulated and two were apparently strangulated. After clinical evaluation and CT-scan, we opted for a conservative treatment weighting the risk-benefit balance in order to give the best quality of life to the patient. CONCLUSIONS: In selected cases and under well-defined situations, an accurate evaluation should convince every surgeon to opt for a conservative approach refraining from a promptly operative treatment of the patient. This may be particularly relevant among very old or high-risk patients affected by long-standing abdominal wall hernias.
