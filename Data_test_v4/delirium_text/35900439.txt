35900439|t|Treatment of radiation-induced brain injury with bisdemethoxycurcumin.
35900439|a|Radiation therapy is considered the most effective non-surgical treatment for brain tumors. However, there are no available treatments for radiation-induced brain injury. Bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) is a demethoxy derivative of curcumin that has anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties. To determine whether BDMC has the potential to treat radiation-induced brain injury, in this study, we established a rat model of radiation-induced brain injury by administering a single 30-Gy vertical dose of irradiation to the whole brain, followed by intraperitoneal injection of 500 muL of a 100 mg/kg BDMC solution every day for 5 successive weeks. Our results showed that BDMC increased the body weight of rats with radiation-induced brain injury, improved learning and memory, attenuated brain edema, inhibited astrocyte activation, and reduced oxidative stress. These findings suggest that BDMC protects against radiation-induced brain injury.
