The aim of our study was to investigate and compare the cognitive performance of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia patients with that of children, adolescents and adults, using a worldwide screening tool, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and considering the age, educational level and mental status of the participants. METHODS: Our sample included 1364 Greek participants and consisted of normal children, adolescents, adults and non-demented, MCI and demented elderly participants. RESULTS: The variables of age, education and mental status influenced the participant's performance in the MMSE, but sex did not. The smallest variance of the MMSE score was found in 16-18-year-old adolescents, a big variance was found in 7-8-year-old children, while the biggest was in 71-90-year-olds. Alzheimer's disease (AD) participants performed poorer than the 7-8 years old children, though MCI participants showed similar cognitive performance to that age-group. The participants with 7-9 years of schooling and those with more than 9 years had no significant difference in their MMSE performance. CONCLUSION: Comparing cognitive performance between subgroups, our results indicated that MCI patients have a similar cognitive performance to that of 7-8-year-old children and AD patients' a poorer one than that group. The significant years of cognitive decline in aging are the 56(th) year, the 66 quinquennium, and the 7(th) and 8(th) decades.
