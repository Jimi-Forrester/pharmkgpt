36233084|t|Mini Review: Molecular Interpretation of the IGF/IGF-1R Axis in Cancer Treatment and Stem Cells-Based Therapy in Regenerative Medicine.
36233084|a|In addition to the fundamental role of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)/IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling dysregulation in cancer initiation and proliferation, the IGF/IGF-1R signaling also plays an important role in the maintenance of stem cell characteristics and enhancement of stem cell-based therapeutic efficacy. This review focused on the role of IGF/IGF-1R signaling in preclinical IGF-targeted therapies, including IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies, IGF-1R tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and neutralizing antibodies of IGFs in multiple tumors and endocrine disorders. On the other hand, the function of IGF/IGF-1R signaling in stem cell self-renewal, pluripotency and therapeutic efficacy in regenerative medicine was outlined. Finally, the review summarized ongoing studies on IGF/IGF-1R signaling blockade in multiple cancers and highlighted the IGF-1R signaling modifications in stem cells as a potential strategy to improve stem cell-based therapeutics in regenerative medicine.
