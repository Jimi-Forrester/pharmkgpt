33225418|a|Apoptosis and clearance of dead cells is highly evolutionarily conserved from nematode to humans, which is crucial to the growth and development of multicellular organism. Fail to remove apoptotic cells often lead to homeostasis imbalance, fatal autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. Small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs) modification is a post-translational modification of ubiquitin proteins mediated by the sentrin-specific proteases (SENPs) family. SUMO modification is widely involved in many cellular biological process, and abnormal SUMO modification is also closely related to many major human diseases. Recent researches have revealed that SUMO modification event occurs during apoptosis and clearance of apoptotic cells, and plays an important role in the regulation of apoptotic signaling pathways. This review summarizes some recent progress in the revelation of regulatory mechanisms of these pathways and provides some potential researching hotpots of the SUMO modification regulation to apoptosis.
