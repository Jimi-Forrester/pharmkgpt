2350688|a|To investigate the role of proteolysis in amyloid formation, we studied the localization of the proteolytic enzymes, cathepsin D and cathepsin B, in the prefrontal cerebral cortex and hippocampus of human postmortem brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease and from individuals free of neurological disease. In control and Alzheimer brains, cathepsin immunoreactivity within cells was localized to lysosome-related structures, which were particularly abundant in neuronal perikarya. In Alzheimer brain, cathepsin immunoreactivity was also heavily concentrated extracellularly within senile plaques. Cathepsin immunoreactivity associated with plaques was not confined to lysosomes and was distributed throughout the plaque. Isolated amyloid cores, however, were not immunostained. Cathepsin-laden perikarya of degenerating neurons were frequently seen within senile plaques and, in the more advanced stages of degeneration, cathepsin immunoreactivity was present throughout the cytoplasm. Other identified constituents of senile plaques appeared to be less significant sources of cathepsin immunoreactivity, including astrocytes, degenerating neurites, microglia and macrophages. These results demonstrate that lysosomal proteinases are major constituents of the senile plaque and that degenerating neuronal perikarya are a principal source of the cathepsin immunoreactivity. We propose that the unregulated action of extracellular cathepsins liberated from degenerating neurons may lead to abnormal processing of the amyloid precursor protein and to the formation of amyloid locally within senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease.
