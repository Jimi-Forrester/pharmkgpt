36614893|t|The Usefulness of Optical Coherence Tomography in Disease Progression Monitoring in Younger Patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis: A Single-Centre Study.
36614893|a|The purpose of the study was to assess the usefulness of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the detection of the neurodegenerative process in younger patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The study group consisted of 61 patients with a relapsing remitting course of MS (mean age 36.4 +- 6.7 years) divided into two groups: short (<=5 years) and long (>10 years) disease duration. OCT, P300 evoked potential, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and performance subtests (Picture Completion and Digit Symbol) of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale were performed in all patients. Mean values of most parameters assessed in OCT (pRNFL Total, pRNFL Inferior, pRNFL Superior, pRNFL Temporalis, mRNFL, GCIPL, mRNFL+GCIPL) were significantly lower in MS patients in comparison to controls. And in patients with longer disease duration in comparison to those with shorter. Most OCT parameters negatively correlated with the EDSS score (p < 0.05). No significant correlation was found between OCT results and both P300 latency and the results of psychometric tests. OCT, as a simple, non-invasive, quick, and inexpensive method, could be useful for monitoring the progression of disease in MS patients.
