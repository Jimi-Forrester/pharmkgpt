37127287|t|Dual-Acting Small Molecules: Subtype-Selective Cannabinoid Receptor 2 Agonist/Butyrylcholinesterase Inhibitor Hybrids Show Neuroprotection in an Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model.
37127287|a|We present the synthesis and characterization of merged human butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE) inhibitor/cannabinoid receptor 2 (hCB2R) ligands for the treatment of neurodegeneration. In total, 15 benzimidazole carbamates were synthesized and tested for their inhibition of human cholinesterases, also with regard to their pseudoirreversible binding mode and affinity toward both cannabinoid receptors in radioligand binding studies. After evaluation in a calcium mobilization assay as well as a beta-arrestin 2 (betaarr2) recruitment assay, two compounds with balanced activities on both targets were tested for their immunomodulatory effect on microglia activation and regarding their pharmacokinetic properties and blood-brain barrier penetration. Compound 15d, containing a dimethyl carbamate motif, was further evaluated in vivo, showing prevention of Abeta25-35-induced learning impairments in a pharmacological mouse model of Alzheimer's disease for both short- and long-term memory responses. Additional combination studies proved a synergic effect of BChE inhibition and CB2R activation in vivo.
