11915156|t|Acute confusion in terminally ill hospitalized patients.
11915156|a|Knowledge about acute confusion (AC) has grown rapidly during the past decade, but very few studies have focused specifically on AC episodes associated with the end of life. Although experienced oncology clinicians accept that AC is common near the end of life, little is known about the frequency, nature, course, and timing of AC during this critical stage of life in patients with terminal cancer. Data suggest patients with advanced cancer have reversible causes of delirium, where appropriate treatment can result in improved outcomes. The data for this article are drawn from a larger study investigating the incidence, prevalence, behaviors, and outcomes of AC in acutely ill medical patients. The diagnosis of AC was ascertained using the NEECHAM Confusion Scale. Of the 117 participants included in the larger study, 16 developed delirium (cumulative incidence estimate, 14%) and 10 died within 1 year of the index hospitalization. These 10 cases were categorized in two groups: those with a cancer-related diagnosis (n = 6) and those without cancer (n = 4). To further describe the nature of AC near the end of life, two case studies are presented. Because all previous studies were conducted using samples consisting of patients with cancer, it is unknown whether the findings reported in previous studies hold for other terminal illnesses, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or heart failure. The data presented in this article suggest there are differences in baseline vulnerability (e.g., cognitive status) and the timing of AC in relation to death. These differences need to be explored in a larger sample of individuals both with and without a diagnosis of cancer. The severity and course of AC in the terminally ill population needs to be described to gain a better understanding of end-of-life AC phenomenology (e.g., signs, patterns, subtypes). Armed with this information, health care providers will then be able to develop and test AC-specific treatments of patients, as well as counsel and support family members of patients experiencing AC.
