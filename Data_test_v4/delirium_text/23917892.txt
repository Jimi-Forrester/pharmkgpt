23917892|t|[Dexmedetomidine].
23917892|a|Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha2-receptor agonist with sedative, analgetic and anxiolytic effects. It is chemically related to clonidine and has been an authorized drug in Europe since September 2011. Dexmedetomidine enables a level of sedation in which mechanically ventilated patients may be woken by verbal stimulation (Richmond agitation sedation scale RASS 0--3). In this respect dexmedetomidine achieves the same desired effect as propofol and midazolam; however, in direct comparison to a sedation regime with benzodiazepines, dexmedetomidine reduces the prevalence, duration and severity of delirium in intensive care. Patients sedated by dexmedetomidine can statistically be extubated earlier and an influence on duration of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) has not been shown. Daily therapy costs are approximately 5 times higher than those of propofol but an objective standpoint in relation to clinical cost efficiency is unattainable.
