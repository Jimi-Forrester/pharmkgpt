30695708|a|Resolving conflicts is an important cognitive ability of executive function, and it may decrease with cognitive decline. The flanker task is a practical test used to assess the ability to suppress responses that are inappropriate in a particular context. The aims of the present study were to investigate conflict monitoring of cognitive control in subjects with different levels of cognitive impairment, and clarify the usefulness of the flanker task in screening cognitive decline. We recruited 50 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 34 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 44 mentally healthy elderly subjects as a control group. To evaluate cognitive performance, each participant underwent a neuropsychological assessment using the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument and a modified flanker task. Compared with the normal controls and those with MCI, the patients with AD had a significantly lower accuracy rate and longer reaction time in both congruent and incongruent trials. The diagnosis of AD predicted significantly poorer performances on the flanker tasks. Furthermore, behavioral data of the patients with AD were significantly correlated with the results of neuropsychological tests. Our results indicated that executive cognitive deficits in conflict monitoring as detected by the flanker task were significantly impaired in the patients with AD. The flanker task could be a quick and easier alternative tool for screening AD among elderly people with suspicious cognitive impairment.
