However, little is known about the effect and the mechanisms of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on bone in the treatment of senile osteoporosis. METHODS: Aged female rats were randomly divided into the FMT group and the control group. 3-month-old female rats were used as fecal donors. The rats were sacrificed at 12 and 24 weeks following transplantation and the serum, intestine, bone, and feces were collected for subsequent analyses. RESULTS: The bone turnover markers of osteocalcin, procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), and carboxy-terminal peptide (CTX) decreased significantly at 12 and 24 weeks following FMT (P < 0.05). At 12 weeks following transplantation, histomorphometric parameters including the bone volume (BV), trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) of the FMT group were comparable to the control group. However, at 24 weeks following transplantation, these parameters of the FMT group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05). Besides, the GM aggregated at 12 and 24 weeks following FMT, and the ecological distance was close between the rats in the FMT group and the donor rats. Alpha diversity, shown by the Shannon index and Simpson index, and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio decreased significantly after FMT at 24 weeks. Furthermore, FMT restored the GM composition in aged rats at the phylum and family level, and the intestinal microbiota of the aged rats was similar to that of the donor rats. Correlation network analysis indirectly suggested the causality of FMT on alleviating osteoporosis. FMT improved the intestinal structure and up-regulated the expression of tight junction proteins of occludin, claudin, and ZO-1, which might be associated with the protective effects of FMT on bone. CONCLUSIONS: GM transplanted from young rats alleviated bone loss in aged rats with senile osteoporosis by improving gut microbiome composition and intestinal barrier function. These data might provide a scientific basis for future clinical treatment of osteoporosis through FMT.
