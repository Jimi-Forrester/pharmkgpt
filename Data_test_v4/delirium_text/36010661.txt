36010661|a|There is currently no effective treatment against Alzheimer's disease (AD), although many strategies have been applied to reduce beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels. Here, we investigated 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) effects on Abeta levels and mechanisms of action. DAPG was the most effective phloroglucinol derivative for reducing Abeta levels, without being toxic, in various models including HEK293 cells overexpressing Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) (293sw), primary astrocytes isolated from APPsw/PS1dE9 transgenic mice, and after intrahippocampal injection of DAPG in APPsw/PS1dE9 transgenic mice. DAPG-mediated Abeta reduction was associated with increased soluble APPalpha (sAPPalpha) levels mediated by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10) but not ADAM17. ADAM10 inhibition in DAPG-treated cells prevented the effects on sAPPalpha but only partly on intracellular and secreted Abeta. To identify regulators of sAPPalpha and Abeta secretion, various inhibitors of intracellular trafficking were administered with DAPG. Brefeldin A (BFA) reversed DAPG-mediated changes in Abeta secretion in 293sw cells, whereas golgicide A (GCA) and BFA were effective in primary astrocytes, indicating a cell type-specific regulation of the trafficking. Moreover, GCA or BFA effects on sAPPalpha, but not Abeta, levels in primary astrocytes resembled those of ADAM10 inhibition, indicating at least partly independent trafficking pathways for sAPPalpha and Abeta. In conclusion, DAPG might be a promising drug candidate against AD regulating ADAM10 and intracellular trafficking, but optimizing DAPG ability to cross the BBB will be needed.
