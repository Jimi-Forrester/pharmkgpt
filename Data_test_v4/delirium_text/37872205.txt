37872205|a|This study determined the occurrence of cognitive impairment and mood disorders in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors with good neurologic outcomes. We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional, single-center study with a total of 97 patients. We evaluated cognitive dysfunction via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Alzheimer's disease-8 mood disorders via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. We measured quality of life with the European Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Levels questionnaire. Cognitive impairment and mood disorders were common among patients with good neurologic recovery. There were 23 patients who experienced cognitive impairments (23.7%) and 28 who suffered from mood disorders (28.9%). Age (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12), mood disorders (adjusted OR 22.80, 95% CI 4.84-107.49) and hospital length of stay (adjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.09) were independent risk factors for cognitive impairment. The occurrence of cognitive impairments (adjusted OR 9.94, 95% CI 2.83-35.97) and non-cardiac causes of cardiac arrest (adjusted OR 11.51, 95% CI 3.15-42.15) were risk factors for mood disorders. Quality of life was significantly lower in the OHCA survivors with each disorder than the healthy individuals. Routine screening and intervention are needed for OHCA survivors.
