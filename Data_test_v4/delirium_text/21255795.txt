21255795|t|The -1082G/A polymorphism in IL-10 gene is associated with risk of Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.
21255795|a|BACKGROUND: The -1082G/A polymorphism in IL-10 gene has been extensively investigated for association to Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, results of different studies have been inconsistent. The objective of this study is to assess the relationship of IL-10 -1082G/A polymorphism and AD risk by using meta-analysis. METHODS: All eligible case-control studies were searched in Pubmed and Embase. Odds ratios (OR) with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the association. RESULTS: A total of 2158 cases and 2088 controls in 12 case-control studies were included. The results indicated that the A allele carriers (AA+AG) had a 27% increased risk of AD, when compared with the homozygote GG (OR=1.27, 95%CI=1.02-1.58 for AA+AG vs. GG). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant elevated risks were associated with A allele carriers in Europeans (OR=1.27 and 95%CI=1.01-1.59 for AA+AG vs. GG), but not in Asians (OR=1.37 and 95%CI=0.32-5.88 for AA+AG vs. GG). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggested that the -1082G/A polymorphism of IL-10 gene would be a risk factor for AD. To further evaluate gene-to-gene and gene-to-environmental interactions between polymorphisms of IL-10 gene and AD risk, more studies with large groups of patients are required.
