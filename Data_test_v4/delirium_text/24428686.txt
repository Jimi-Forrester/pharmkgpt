24428686|t|Synthesis, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor binding, and antinociceptive properties of 2'-fluoro-3'-(substituted pyridinyl)-7-deschloroepibatidine analogues.
24428686|a|2'-Fluoro-3-(substituted pyridine)epibatidine analogues 7a-e and 8a-e were synthesized, and their in vitro and in vivo nAChR properties were determined. 2'-Fluoro-3'-(4''-pyridinyl)deschloroepibatidine (7a) and 2'-fluoro-3'-(3''-pyridinyl)deschloroepibatidine (8a) were synthesized as bioisosteres of the 4'-nitrophenyl lead compounds 5a and 5g. Comparison of the in vitro nAChR properties of 7a and 8a to those of 5a and 5g showed that 7a and 8a had in vitro nAChR properties similar to those of 5a and 5g but both were more selective for the alpha4beta2-nAChR relative to the alpha3beta4- and alpha7-nAChRs than 5a and 5g. The in vivo nAChR properties in mice of 7a were similar to those of 5a. In contrast, 8a was an agonist in all four mouse acute tests, whereas 5g was active only in a spontaneous activity test. In addition, 5g was a nicotine antagonist in both the tail-flick and hot-plate tests, whereas 8a was an antagonist only in the tail-flick test.
