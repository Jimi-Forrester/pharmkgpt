37948398|a|INTRODUCTION: To examine electroencephalogram (EEG) as a diagnostic tool for late-onset efavirenz (EFV) neurotoxicity syndrome (LENS), an uncommon but severe and potentially fatal complication of EFV therapy. METHODS: We conducted a Retrospective case-control study. EEGs from confirmed cases of LENS (clinical syndrome and plasma EFV >4ug/mL) recorded from June 2016 to May 2021 were compared with control EEGs from the same time-period. Controls were adults (18-70 years) with a similar indication for EEG (eg. encephalopathy or confusion), dysrhythmia generalised grade II, and LENS excluded. EEGs were reviewed by two blinded interpreters given a description of the characteristic EEG changes, ie. persistent, diffuse, high voltage, bisynchronous, monomorphic 4-7 Hz theta frequency waveforms with transient attenuation on eye opening. Interpreters were asked to determine whether EEGs showed definite, probable or no changes. RESULTS: Thirteen LENS cases were compared with 50 control EEGs. Interpreter 1 labelled 11/13 LENS cases as having define or probable changes, and interpreter 2 labelled 10/13. Interpreter 1 labelled probable changes in 1/50 controls and interpreter 2 in 3/50. Neither interpreter labelled any controls as having definite changes. Interrater reliability was good with 95% agreement and a Cohen's kappa of 0.83. Sensitivity of EEG under these conditions for the diagnosis of LENS was 85% and 77% for interpreters 1 and 2 respectively, and specificity was 98% and 94%. CONCLUSIONS: EEG is a useful tool in the diagnosis of LENS which can be used to aid clinical decisions while awaiting EFV levels, or in low-resource settings where EFV levels are not available.
