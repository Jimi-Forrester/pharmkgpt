38585830|t|Altered empathy processing in frontotemporal dementia A task-based fMRI study.
38585830|a|A lack of empathy, and particularly its affective components, is a core symptom of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Visual exposure to images of a needle pricking a hand (pain condition) and Q-tips touching a hand (control condition) is an established functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm used to investigate empathy for pain (EFP; pain condition minus control condition). EFP has been associated with increased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in regions known to become atrophic in the early stages in bvFTD, including the anterior insula and the anterior cingulate. We therefore hypothesized that patients with bvFTD would display altered empathy processing in the EFP paradigm. Here we examined empathy processing using the EFP paradigm in 28 patients with bvFTD and 28 sex and age matched controls. Participants underwent structural MRI, task-based and resting-state fMRI. The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) was used as a measure of different facets of empathic function outside the scanner. The EFP paradigm was analysed at a whole brain level and using two regions-of-interest approaches, one based on a metanalysis of affective perceptual empathy versus cognitive evaluative empathy and one based on the control's activation pattern. In controls, EFP was linked to an expected increase of BOLD signal that displayed an overlap with the pattern of atrophy in the bvFTD patients (insula and anterior cingulate). Additional regions with increased signal were the supramarginal gyrus and the occipital cortex. These latter regions were the only ones that displayed increased BOLD signal in bvFTD patients. BOLD signal increase under the affective perceptual empathy but not the cognitive evaluative empathy region of interest was significantly greater in controls than in bvFTD patients. The control's rating on their empathic concern subscale of the IRI was significantly correlated with the BOLD signal in the EFP paradigm, as were an informant's ratings of the patient's empathic concern subscale. This correlation was not observed on other subscales of the IRI or when using the patient's self- ratings. Finally, controls and patients showed different connectivity patterns in empathy related networks during resting-state fMRI, mainly in nodes overlapping the ventral attention network. Our results indicate that reduced neural activity in regions typically affected by pathology in bvFTD is associated with reduced empathy processing, and a predictor of patient's capacity to experience affective empathy.
