34463064|t|Effect of Sedatives on In-hospital and Long-term Mortality of Critically Ill Patients Requiring Extended Mechanical Ventilation for >= 48 Hours.
34463064|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the correlation between sedatives and mortality in critically ill patients who required mechanical ventilation (MV) for >= 48 hours from 2008 to 2016. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study using population-based healthcare reimbursement claims database. Data from adult patients (aged >= 18) who underwent MV for >= 48 hours between 2008 and 2016 were identified and extracted from the National Health Insurance Service database. The benzodiazepine group consisted of patients who were administered benzodiazepines for sedation during MV. All other patients were assigned to the non-benzodiazepine group. RESULTS: A total of 158,712 patients requiring MV for >= 48 hours were admitted in 55 centers in Korea from 2008 to 2016. The benzodiazepine group had significantly higher in-hospital and one-year mortality compared to the non-benzodiazepine group (37.0% vs. 34.3%, 55.0% vs. 54.4%, respectively). Benzodiazepine use decreased from 2008 to 2016, after adjusting for age, sex, and mean Elixhauser comorbidity index in the Poisson regression analysis (incidence rate ratio, 0.968; 95% confident interval, 0.954-0.983; P < 0.001). Benzodiazepine use, older age, lower case volume (<= 500 cases/year), chronic kidney disease, and higher Elixhauser comorbidity index were common significant risk factors for in-hospital and one-year mortality. CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients undergoing MV for >= 48 hour, the use of benzodiazepines for sedation, older age, and chronic kidney disease were associated with higher in-hospital mortality and one-year mortality. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of benzodiazepines on the mortality in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease requiring MV for >= 48 hours.
