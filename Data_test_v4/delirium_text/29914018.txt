29914018|a|BACKGROUND: Endogenous antibodies to signaling molecules and receptors (Abs) are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of 33 Abs to dopaminergic, serotoninergic, muscarinic, adrenergic, vascular, and immune receptors with cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and mortality outcomes. METHODS: Ninety-one patients with mild AD were followed annually for 5 years with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI; composite outcomes: "psychosis" (item 1 + 2), "mood" (item 4 + 5 + 7), and "agitation" (item 3 + 8 + 9)). Abs were quantified in sera obtained at baseline by ELISA and reduced to principal components (PCs). Associations between Abs and outcomes were assessed by a mixed model (MMSE decline), zero-inflated fixed effects count models (composite NPI scores), and Cox regression (mortality). The resulting p-values were adjusted for multiple testing according to a false discovery rate of 0.05 (Benjamini-Hochberg). RESULTS: The measured levels of the 33 Abs formed four PCs. PC1 (dopaminergic and serotonergic Abs) was associated with increased mortality (Hazard ratio 2.57, p < 0.001), PC2 (serotonergic, immune, and vascular Abs) with decreased agitation symptoms (beta - 0.19, p < 0.001), and PC3 (cholinergic receptor Abs) with increased mood symptoms (beta 0.04, p = 0.002), over time. There were no associations between Abs and MMSE decline. CONCLUSION: The associations between Abs, mortality, and neuropsychiatric symptoms reported in this cohort are intriguing. They cannot, however, be generalized. Validation in independent sample sets is required.
