31140991|t|Optical coherence tomography findings in chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia.
31140991|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) is a mitochondrial encephalomyopathy caused by multiple mtDNA abnormalities. There is little information about the changes of ocular fundus with CPEO. The aim of this work was to measure and evaluate changes in the macular retinal thickness and optic nerve head in patients with CPEO using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and to compare the findings with those of healthy individuals. METHODS: Totally, 18 CPEO patients were enrolled in this study. Healthy volunteers matched for gender, age, and diopter settings were included as a control group. The retinal thickness of macular central fovea, inner and outer retinal layer thickness of perifoveal macular, optic nerve head parameters, and peripapillay retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (pRNFLT) for all included cases were measured using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. A paired t test was used to compare the differences in the studied parameters between the two groups. The correlations between macular retinal thickness, pRNFLT, disease duration, and age of onset were also analyzed. RESULTS: Among the macular parameters, retinal thickness of macular central fovea (t = -2.135, P < 0.05) and outer retinal layer thickness (t = -1.994, P < 0.05) of patients in the CPEO group were statistically significant lower than those of patients in the normal control group. For the optic nerve head parameters, the patients in the CPEO group showed a larger rim volume (t = -2.499, P < 0.05) and nerve head volume (t = -2.103, P < 0.05). The overall pRNFLT of patients in the CPEO group was statistically significant lower than that of patients in the control group (t = -4.125, P < 0.05). The comparison of pRNFLT in eight sectors showed that the pRNFLT of patients in the CPEO group was statistically significant lower than that of the control group mainly in the inferior and temporal sectors. The degree of pRNFL defect negatively correlated with the disease duration (r = -0.583, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The retinal thickness of patients with CPEO was significantly thinner, which was mostly the outer retina. The patients' optic discs had a low volume and the loss of the retinal nerve fiber layer was obvious. With the extension of the disease duration, the retinal nerve fiber layer defect was even more significant.
