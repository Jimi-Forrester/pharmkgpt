36892329|t|Pteris laeta Wall. and Its New Phytochemical, Pterosinsade A, Promote Hippocampal Neurogenesis via Activating the Wnt Signaling Pathway.
36892329|a|Pteris laeta Wall., as a traditional tea, is popular in Southwest China, but its role in preventing cognitive impairment is unclear. In this study, Pteris laeta Wall. extracts (PW) and its active compounds were evaluated for preventive effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD) in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that PW diminished oxidative stress damage and apoptosis of Abeta-induced HT22 cells and also rescued cognitive deficits, and ameliorated pathological injury and inflammatory response in APP/PS1 mice. Besides, a new pterosin sesquiterpene, named pterosinsade A (PA), and nine known compounds were discovered from the EtOAc extract that possessed the best neuroprotective activity. PA reduced apoptosis of APP-overexpressing neural stem cells and promoted their proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Meanwhile, PW and PA promoted hippocampal neurogenesis, which proved to be associated with activating the Wnt signaling pathway. These findings suggest that PW and PA are candidates for AD prevention.
