35865544|a|Hypersplenism (HS) is a concomitant symptom of liver or blood disease. Not only does the treatment of HS face challenges, but the transcriptome of individual cells is also unknown. Here, the transcriptional profiles of 43,037 cells from four HS tissues and one control tissue were generated by the single-cell RNA sequencing and nine major cell types, including T-cells, B-cells, NK cells, hematopoietic stem cells, neutrophil cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, erythrocytes, and dendritic cells were identified. Strikingly, the main features were the lack of CCL5+ B-cells in HS and the presence of SESN1+ B cells in HS with hepatocellular carcinoma (HS-HCC). In cell-cell interaction analysis, CD74-COPA and CD94-HLA-E in HS were found to be up-regulated. We further explored HS-specifically enriched genes (such as FKBP5, ADAR, and RPS4Y1) and found that FKBP5 was highly expressed in HCC-HS, leading to immunosuppression. Taken together, this research provides new insights into the genetic characteristics of HS via comprehensive single-cell transcriptome analysis.
