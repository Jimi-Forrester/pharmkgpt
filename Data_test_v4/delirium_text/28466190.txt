28466190|t|Microglia Endocytose Amyloid beta Through the Binding of Transglutaminase 2 and Milk Fat Globule EGF Factor 8 Protein.
28466190|a|Activation of glial cells has been observed in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) is profusely observed as characteristic pathology in AD brain. In our previous study using microglial cell line BV-2, tissue-type transglutaminase (TG2) was found to be involved in phagocytosis (Kawabe et al., in Neuroimmunomodulation 22(4):243-249, 2015; Kawabe et al., Neurochem Res 2017). In the present study, we examined whether TG2 and milk fat globule EGF factor 8 protein (MFG-E8), an adaptor protein promotes macrophage to engulf apoptotic cells, were involved in Abeta endocytosis. When the neuronal/glial mixed culture was stimulated freshly prepared Abeta1-42 for 3 days, the incorporation of Abeta was observed by immunofluorescence staining technique in Iba-1-positive microglia. Cystamine, a broad competitive inhibitor of TGs, suppressed it. When aggregated Abeta was added to the mixed culture, the immunoreactivity of MFG-E8 surrounding Abeta was observed, and then followed by microglial endocytosis. Using western blotting technique, MFG-E8 was detected in cell lysate of astrocyte culture, and was also detected in the medium. When microglia culture was incubated with astrocyte conditioned medium, MFG-E8 levels in microglia tended to increase. It is likely that microglia might utilize MFG-E8 released from astrocytes as well as that expressed in themselves in order to endocytose Abeta aggregation. Furthermore, we confirmed that MFG-E8 could bind with TG2 in microglia culture by immunoprecipitate technique. These results suggest that microglia might uptake Abeta as a complex of aggregated Abeta/MFG-E8/TG2.
