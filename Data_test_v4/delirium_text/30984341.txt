30984341|a|Secondary metabolites of the roots of Eleutherococcus spp. cultivated in Poland, or the bioactivity, are not fully known. The 75% methanol extracts of five Eleutherococcus spp. (E. senticosus, E. divaricatus, E. sessiliflorus, E. gracilistylus, and E. henryi) were examined for the content of polyphenols and phenolic acids as well as for antiacetylcholinesterase, antihyaluronidase, anti-DPPH*, and cytotoxic activities. The richest in polyphenols were the roots of E. henryi (10.4 mg/g DW), while in flavonoids the roots of E. divaricatus (6.5 mg/g DW). The richest in phenolic acids occurred the roots of E. henryi [protocatechuic acid (1865 mug/g DE), caffeic acid (244 mug/g DE), and p-coumaric and ferulic acids (55 mug/g DE)]. The highest inhibition of AChE was observed for E. gracilistylus and E. sessiliflorus (32%), at the concentration of 100 mug/0.19 mL of the reaction mixture, while that of Hyal for the roots of E. henryi (40.7%), at the concentration of 100 mug/0.16 mL of the reaction mixture. Among five species tested, the E. henryi extract exhibited the strongest HL-60 cell line growth's inhibition (IC50 270 mug/mL). The extracts reduced DPPH* in a time-dependent mode, at the concentration of 0.8 mg/mL. After 90 min from 14.7 to 26.2%, DPPH*was reduced. A phytochemical composition and activity of the Eleutherococcus species, cultivated in Poland, are still under research; however, on the basis of the results obtained, it may be concluded that they may become a source of phytochemicals and be useful for Europe's citizens.
