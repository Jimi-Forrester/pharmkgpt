33540171|a|The accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregates in the brain occurs early in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and non-fibrillar soluble Abeta oligomers are particularly neurotoxic. During binding to Abeta fibrils, curcumin, which can exist in an equilibrium state between its keto and enol tautomers, exists predominantly in the enol form, and binding activity of the keto form to Abeta fibrils is much weaker. Here we described the strong binding activity the keto form of curcumin derivative Shiga-Y51 shows for Abeta oligomers and its scant affinity for Abeta fibrils. Furthermore, with imaging mass spectrometry we revealed the blood-brain barrier permeability of Shiga-Y51 and its accumulation in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, where Abeta oligomers were mainly localized, in a mouse model of AD. The keto form of curcumin derivatives like Shiga-Y51 could be promising seed compounds to develop imaging probes and therapeutic agents targeting Abeta oligomers in the brain.
