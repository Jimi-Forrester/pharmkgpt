37959423|t|Activated Screen-Printed Boron-Doped Diamond Electrode for Rapid and Highly Sensitive Determination of Curcumin in Food Products.
37959423|a|Due to a great interest in the beneficial properties of polyphenolic antioxidant curcumin (CCM), sensitive and accurate methods for determining CCM are needed. The purpose of our research was to develop a very simple, fast, and sensitive differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetric (DPAdSV) procedure using an electrochemically activated screen-printed boron-doped diamond electrode (aSPBDDE) for the determination of CCM. The activation of the SPBDDE was accomplished in a solution of 0.1 mol/L NaOH by performing five cyclic voltammetric scans in the range of 0-2 V, at nu of 100 mV/s. The changes in surface morphology and the reduction of the charge transfer resistance due to the activation of the electrode resulted in the amplification of the CCM analytical signal on the aSPBDDE. As a result, an extremely sensitive measurement tool was formed, which under optimized conditions (0.025 mol/L PBS of pH = 2.6, Eacc of 0.3 V, tacc of 90 s, DeltaEA of 100 mV, nu of 150 mV/s, and tm of 10 ms) allowed us to obtain a limit of detection (LOD) of 5.0 x 10-13 mol/L. The aSPBDDE has proven to be a highly effective tool for the direct determination of CCM in food samples with high accuracy and precision. The results are in agreement with those obtained using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization (UHPLC-ESI/MS).
