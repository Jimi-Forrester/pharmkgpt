38133440|t|Powassan Virus Infections: A Systematic Review of Published Cases.
38133440|a|BACKGROUND: Powassan virus is an emerging neurotropic arbovirus transmitted by the tick Ixodes scapularis. This systematic review was conducted to aggregate data on its clinical manifestations, diagnostic findings, and complications. METHODS: PubMed was searched until August 2023 using the term "Powassan", to identify all published cases of Powassan virus infections, as per PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Among the 380 abstracts identified, 45 studies describing 84 cases (70 adult, 14 pediatric) were included. Cases were reported from the USA and Canada. Complications included paralysis in 44.1% of adult and 42.6% of pediatric cases, cognitive deficits in 33.3% of adult and 25% of pediatric cases, while the mortality rate was 19.1% and 7.1% in the adult and pediatric populations, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed an association between mortality and age (r = 0.264, p = 0.029), development of paralysis (r = 0.252, p = 0.041), or respiratory distress or failure (r = 0.328, p = 0.006). Factors associated with persistent neurological deficits were development of ataxia (r = 0.383, p = 0.006), paralysis (r = 0.278, p = 0.048), speech disorder (r = 0.319, p = 0.022), and cranial nerve involvement (r = 0.322, p = 0.017). Other significant correlations included those between speech disorders and ataxia (r = 0.526, p < 0.001), and between paralysis and respiratory distress or failure (r = 0.349, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Powassan virus infections have significant morbidity and mortality and should be suspected in cases of encephalitis and possible tick exposure.
