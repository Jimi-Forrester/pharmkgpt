34348698|a|BACKGROUND: Several fatal medical complications have been associated with alcohol withdrawal, such as seizure, cardiac arrhythmia, and takotsubo cardiomyopathy. However, there have been no reports on hypovolemic shock during alcohol withdrawal, although two physical signs of alcohol withdrawal, i.e., diaphoresis and fever, can lead to hypovolemia and its medical consequences. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a patient with alcohol use disorder who exhibited hypovolemic shock and its associated acute renal failure during alcohol withdrawal with severe diaphoresis and fever even though he had consumed almost the full amount of food he was offered. Given his excessive diaphoresis and fever that were related to alcohol withdrawal, his water intake was insufficient. Infusion with extracellular fluid resolved all these medical issues. CONCLUSIONS: The increased adrenergic activity associated with alcohol withdrawal might substantially increase a patient's water-intake requirement through diaphoresis and fever and may cause severe hypovolemia and its associated medical complications.
