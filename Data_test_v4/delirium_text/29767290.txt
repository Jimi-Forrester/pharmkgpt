29767290|t|Stem Cells in Alzheimer's Disease: Current Standing and Future Challenges.
29767290|a|To date, there is no definitive treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The realm of stem cells is very promising in regenerative medicine, particularly for neurodegenerative diseases. Various types of stem cells have been used in preclinical/clinical trials for AD aiming the development of an elusive disease modifying therapy. Over the last decade, much knowledge has been gained in this field regarding types of cells, routes and timing of administration, and outcomes of stem cells-based strategies for AD. In this chapter, we will trace the state of art and the challenges facing the use of stem cells in AD.
