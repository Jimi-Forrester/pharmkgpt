38596507|t|Postfracture survival in a population-based study of adults aged >=66 yr: a call to action at hospital discharge.
38596507|a|Postfracture survival rates provide prognostic information but are rarely reported along with other mortality outcomes in adults aged >=50 yr. The timing of survival change following a fracture also needs to be further elucidated. This population-based, matched-cohort, retrospective database study examined 98 474 patients (73% women) aged >=66 yr with an index fracture occurring at an osteoporotic site (hip, clinical vertebral, proximal non-hip non-vertebral [pNHNV], and distal non-hip non-vertebral [dNHNV]) from 2011 to 2015, who were matched (1:1) to nonfracture individuals based on sex, age, and comorbidities. All-cause 1- and 5-yr overall survival and relative survival ratios (RSRs) were assessed, and time trends in survival changes were characterized starting immediately after a fracture. In both sexes, overall survival was markedly decreased over 6 yr of follow-up after hip, vertebral, and pNHNV fractures, and as expected, worse survival rates were observed in older patients and males. The lowest 5-yr RSRs were observed after hip fractures in males (66-85 yr, 51.9%-63.9%; >=86 yr, 34.5%), followed by vertebral fractures in males (66-85 yr, 53.2%-69.4%; >=86 yr, 35.5%), and hip fractures in females (66-85 yr, 69.8%-79.0%; >=86 yr, 52.8%). Although RSRs did not decrease as markedly after dNHNV fractures in younger patients, relatively low 5-yr RSRs were observed in females (75.9%) and males (69.5%) aged >=86 yr. The greatest reduction in survival occurred within the initial month after hip, vertebral, and pNHNV fractures, indicating a high relative impact of short-term factors, with survival-reduction effects persisting over time. Therefore, the most critical period for implementing interventions aimed at improving post-fracture prognosis appears to be immediately after a fracture; however, considering the immediate need for introducing such interventions, primary fracture prevention is also crucial to prevent the occurrence of the initial fracture in high-risk patients.
