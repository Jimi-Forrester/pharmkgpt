39429436|t|Association of preoperative to postoperative change in cerebrospinal fluid fibrinogen with postoperative delirium.
39429436|a|Background: We aimed to assess perioperative changes in fibrinogen in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), their association with markers of blood-brain barrier breakdown and neuroinflammation, and their association with postoperative delirium severity. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of the Interventions for Postoperative Delirium-Biomarker 2 (IPOD-B2, NCT02926417) study, a prospective observational cohort study. We included 24 patients aged >21 yr undergoing aortic aneurysm repair. CSF samples were obtained before (n=24) and after surgery (n=13), with some participants having multiple postoperative samples. Our primary outcome was the perioperative change in CSF fibrinogen. Delirium was assessed using the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98. Results: CSF fibrinogen increased after surgery (P<0.001), and this was associated with an increase in CSF/plasma albumin ratio (beta=1.09, 95% CI 0.47-1.71, P=0.004). The peak change in CSF fibrinogen was associated with the change in CSF interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12p70. The peak change in CSF fibrinogen was associated with the change in CSF total tau (beta=0.47, 95% CI 0.24-0.71, P=0.002); however, we did not observe an association with postoperative delirium severity (incidence rate ratio = 1.20, 95% CI 0.66-2.17, P=0.540). Conclusions: Our preliminary findings support the hypothesis that fibrinogen enters the brain via blood-brain barrier disruption, promoting neuroinflammation and neuronal injury. However, we did not observe an association between cerebrospinal fluid fibrinogen and peak delirium severity in this limited cohort.
