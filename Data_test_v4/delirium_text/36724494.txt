36724494|a|The aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a major cause of dementia and an unmet challenge in modern medicine. In this study, we constructed a biocompatible metal-phenolic network (MPN) comprising a polyphenol epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) scaffold coordinated by physiological Zn(II). Upon adsorption onto gold nanoparticles, the MPN@AuNP nanoconstruct elicited a remarkable potency against the amyloid aggregation and toxicity of Abeta in vitro. The superior performance of MPN@AuNP over EGCG@AuNP was attributed to the porosity and hence larger surface area of the MPN in comparison with that of EGCG alone. The atomic detail of Zn(II)-EGCG coordination was unraveled by density functional theory calculations and the structure and dynamics of Abeta aggregation modulated by the MPN were further examined by discrete molecular dynamics simulations. As MPN@AuNP also displayed a robust capacity to cross a blood-brain barrier model through the paracellular pathway, and given the EGCG's function as an anti-amyloidosis and antioxidation agent, this MPN-based strategy may find application in regulating the broad AD pathology beyond protein aggregation inhibition.
