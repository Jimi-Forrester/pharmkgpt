32243908|t|A centrality based multi-objective approach to disease gene association.
32243908|a|Disease Gene Association finds genes that are involved in the presentation of a given genetic disease. We present a hybrid approach which implements a multi-objective genetic algorithm, where input consists of centrality measures based on various relational biological evidence types merged into a complex network. Multiple objective settings and parameters are studied including the development of a new exchange methodology, safe dealer-based crossover. Successful results with respect to breast cancer and Parkinson's disease compared to previous techniques and popular known databases are shown. In addition, the newly developed methodology is also successfully applied to Alzheimer's disease, further demonstrating its flexibility. Across all three case studies the strongest results were produced by the shortest path-based measures stress and betweenness, either in a single objective parameter setting or when used in conjunction in a multi-objective environment. The new crossover technique achieved the best results when applied to Alzheimer's disease.
