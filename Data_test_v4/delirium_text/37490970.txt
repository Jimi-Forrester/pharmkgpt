37490970|t|The Role Gut Microbiota in Glaucoma Progression and Other Retinal Diseases.
37490970|a|As a rapidly growing field, microbiota research offers novel approaches to promoting ocular health and treating major retinal diseases, such as glaucoma. Gut microbiota change throughout life; however certain patterns of population changes have been increasingly associated with specific diseases. It has been well established that disrupted microbiome contributes to central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and glioma, suggesting that they could play a prominent role in neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes the progress in identifying significant microbes changes in glaucoma patients by compiling studies completed in insolation that underscores the association between the microbiota and disease progression. Among pathways of interest, the finding of increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio in patients with primary open-angled glaucoma links the increased taurocholic acid and decreased glutathione to a negative impact on retinal ganglion cell survival. Connecting these microbes to specific metabolites shed light on the pathogenic mechanism and novel treatment strategies. In summary, the current review is intended to synthesize the findings of several studies investigating the effects of shifting bacterial population in retinal diseases, particularly glaucoma, to identify the current direction of treatment development and help direct future endeavors.
