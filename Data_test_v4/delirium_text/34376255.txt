34376255|t|Clinical value and role of microRNA-29c-3p in sepsis-induced inflammation and cardiac dysfunction.
34376255|a|BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of miR-29c-3p in sepsis and its role in sepsis-induced inflammatory response and cardiac dysfunction. METHODS: Serum level of miR-29c-3p was detected by qRT-PCR. The ROC curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of miR-29c-3p for Sepsis. The cecal ligation and puncture method (CLP) was used to establish a rat sepsis model. To assess cardiac function, left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and maximum rate of rise/fall of left ventricle pressure (+- dp/dtmax) in different experimental groups were detected, and the serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creative kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB) were measured by ELISA. Meanwhile, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were detected by ELISA to assess the level of inflammatory response in animals. RESULTS: miR-29c-3p level was upregulated in sepsis patients. ROC curve revealed that miR-29c-3p had the ability to distinguish sepsis patients from healthy controls. Cardiac dysfunction and inflammation were observed in sepsis rat, which were characterized by the decrease of LVSP and + dp/dtmax, the increase of LVEDP, - dp/dtmax, cTnI, CK-MB, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6. All effects were reversed by the injection of miR-29c-3p antagomir. Logistics regression analysis manifested miR-29c-3p is an independent factor in the occurrence of cardiac dysfunction in sepsis patients. CONCLUSIONS: miR-29c-3p has potential as a biomarker for the diagnosis of sepsis, and inhibition of miR-29c-3p expression in animal models reduced sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction and inflammatory response.
