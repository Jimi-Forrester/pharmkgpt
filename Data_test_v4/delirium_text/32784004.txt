32784004|a|Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) is the most common type of dementia and progressive neurodegenerative disease. To establish the sAD model, intracerebroventricular (ICV) streptozotocin (STZ) at a dose of 3 mg/kg was administered bilaterally in rats on a stereotaxic apparatus. Behavioral tests such as Morris water maze (MWM), novel object recognition (NOR) and open field test were performed to evaluate cognitive and locomotor functions. Two treatment doses (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) of sodium orthovanadate (SOV) and rivastigmine (2 mg/kg) were given orally to ICV-STZ induced rats for 21 days. Cortical and hippocampal tissues were dissected. Estimation of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction as complex I, II, III, IV activity, cholinergic function as acetylcholinesterase activity, ELISA for phosphorylated tau protein and insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), neuroinflammation as NF-kappaB gene expression and insulin signaling functioning as Q-RT-PCR for IR, IRS-1, PI3K, AKT, GSK-3beta gene expression were performed. Behavioral results with SOV and rivastigmine treatment revealed decreased escape latency and increased discrimination index in MWM and NOR respectively. Treatment results with SOV also demonstrated attenuation of oxidative imbalance, improved mitochondrial activity, and reversed IDE and tau pathology. SOV treatment upregulated gene expression of IR, IRS-1, PI3K, and AKT, and downregulated that of GSK-3beta. SOV results were compared with standard drug rivastigmine. Conclusively, the memory enhancement by SOV was mediated through oxidative balance, mitochondrial enzyme complex activation, and improved insulin signaling regulation. However, the primary mechanism of SOV remained attenuation of tau pathology by the upregulation of IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta pathway and reversal of insulin resistance in terms of IDE. Hence, in sAD paradigm, SOV contributed to memory improvement evident with the findings of behavioral studies, which can further potentially have clinical significance in AD.
