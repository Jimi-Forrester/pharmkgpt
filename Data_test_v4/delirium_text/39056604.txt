39056604|t|Au24Cd Nanoenzyme Coating for Enhancing Electrochemical Sensing Performance of Metal Wire Microelectrodes.
39056604|a|Dopamine (DA), ascorbic acid (AA), and uric acid (UA) are crucial neurochemicals, and their abnormal levels are involved in various neurological disorders. While electrodes for their detection have been developed, achieving the sensitivity required for in vivo applications remains a challenge. In this study, we proposed a synthetic Au24Cd nanoenzyme (ACNE) that significantly enhanced the electrochemical performance of metal electrodes. ACNE-modified electrodes demonstrated a remarkable 10-fold reduction in impedance compared to silver microelectrodes. Furthermore, we validated their excellent electrocatalytic activity and sensitivity using five electrochemical detection methods, including cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, square-wave pulse voltammetry, normal pulse voltammetry, and linear scanning voltammetry. Importantly, the stability of gold microelectrodes (Au MEs) modified with ACNEs was significantly improved, exhibiting a 30-fold enhancement compared to Au MEs. This improved performance suggests that ACNE functionalization holds great promise for developing micro-biosensors with enhanced sensitivity and stability for detecting small molecules.
