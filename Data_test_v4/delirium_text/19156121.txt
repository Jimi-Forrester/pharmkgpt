19156121|a|Memantine (M) was used in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with dementia. The drug was prescribed to 15 patients at first in a single dosage of 5 mg daily for one week, then the dosage was increased to 10 mg daily (one week), after to 15 mg daily (one week) and from the 4th week - to 20mg daily. Patients of the control group did not receive the drug. Efficacy and safety of M were assessed clinically and with a battery of widespread scales (UPDRS, MMSE, CGI etc), neuropsychological tests and the quality of life scale (PDQ-8). The study showed the ability of M to cause a stable improvement of mental state and its good tolerability. The efficacy of M in the cases studied was comparable with that in Alzheimer's disease.
