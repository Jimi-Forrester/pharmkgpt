34718886|a|INTRODUCTION: New treatments have improved the overall survival of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). At diagnosis and during the course of the disease, patients often report pain and other symptoms. Given the long disease trajectory, psychological and social issues are also frequent. Recently, the potential usefulness of early palliative care (EPC) was hypothesized in the area of hematology. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with MM referred to our institute for a palliative care (PC) consultation between January 2017 and June 2020. Our aim was to evaluate the main reasons (pain or other clinical symptoms) for the referral for a first PC consultation. METHODS: We examined the main reasons for the first PC consultation, the number of PC consultations carried out, and the period of time between diagnosis, first and subsequent PC visits, and death. We also recorded information on the type of pain experienced and the treatments administered. RESULTS: Of the 325 patients with MM followed at our hematology unit during the study period, 43 were referred for a PC consultation (39 for pain management and 4 to determine the most appropriate care setting (hospice or palliative homecare service)). Nineteen (44.2%) of the 43 patients reported other symptoms in addition to pain. The median time between MM diagnosis and the first PC consultation was 473 days. Fifteen patients died, with a median 332 days between the first PC visit and death. CONCLUSION: Randomized studies on MM involving larger patient populations with access to EPC are needed to identify an effective clinical model to improve the management of patients with MM.
