9634730|a|The paper presents the results of examination of 110 alcoholic patients who have committed criminal actions and were recognized as irresponsible at forensic examination. It was established that wide spectrum of mental disorders were present in such cases--from superacute psychotic states (15 patients) and acute disorders (49) to chronic psychoses (33) and encephalopathy (13). According to clinical manifestations mental disorders correspond in such cases to reactions of exogenic type. In contrast to general medical departments where patients with alcoholic delirium prevail, the studied sample of patients had primarily psychoses with hallucinative-delirious and delirious disorders. Disorders of personality manifested as typical alcoholic, asthenoneurotic, psychopathic-like, residual-psychotic, psychoorganic changes and partial dementia (19 cases).
