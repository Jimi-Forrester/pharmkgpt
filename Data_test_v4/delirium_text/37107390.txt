37107390|t|Can Glyphosate and Temperature Affect the Nutritional Lipid Quality in the Mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis?
37107390|a|Mussels are an important source of the essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), which play a critical role in human health, preventing a variety of diseases. This study aimed to evaluate, for the first time, the combined effect of glyphosate (Gly) and culturing temperature on the lipid content and fatty acid (FA) profile of the Mediterranean mussel M. galloprovincialis. In addition, a number of lipid nutritional quality indices (LNQIs) were applied as important tools to assess the nutritional value of food. Mussels were exposed for 4 days to two Gly concentrations (1 mg/L, 10 mg/L) and two temperatures (T : 20-26  C). Statistical analysis showed significant effects of T C, Gly, and T C x Gly interaction (p < 0.05) on the lipid and FA profiles of M. galloprovincialis. Mussels exposed to 10 mg/L Gly at 20  C showed a decrease in eicosapentaenoic (EPA, from 14.6% to 12% of total FAs) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA, from 10% to 6.4% of total FAs), compared to the control mussels. Both stressors caused a considerable decrease in n-3 PUFAs, which resulted in a less favorable n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio. Overall, this study demonstrated a decline in the nutritive values of mussels, most prominently in groups exposed to 10 mg/L Gly at a temperature of 20  C and in those exposed to a temperature of 26  C. This was confirmed by such LNQIs as EPA + DHA, PUFA/Saturated FAs, atherogenic and thrombogenic indices (AI and TI), the health promoting index (HPI), and the unsaturation index (UI). Further investigations into chronic exposure to both stressors are desirable to predict the impacts on aquatic ecosystems and food quality.
