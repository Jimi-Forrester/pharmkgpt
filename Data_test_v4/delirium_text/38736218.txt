38736218|t|A Review of the Current Status of Disease-Modifying Therapies and Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease.
38736218|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and includes cognitive, personality, and behavioral changes. The 2024 report from the Alzheimer's Association estimated that 6.9 million adults >65 years in the US are currently living with Alzheimer's disease. Modeling studies predict that this number will double by 2050, and associated healthcare costs will reach $1 trillion. In June 2021, regulatory approval of aducanumab, a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody to amyloid ss, initially raised expectations for improved disease-modifying therapy. However, in February 2024, production of aducanumab and a post-marketing clinical trial ceased in the US due to the costs and limitations of aducanumab therapy. In March 2024, biobank data identified significant modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, including diabetes mellitus, exposure to nitrogen dioxide (a proxy for air pollution), and the frequency of alcohol intake. Therefore, modification of identifiable risk factors, combined with testing for disease-susceptibility genes, could be the most effective approach to reduce the incidence. This article aims to review the current status of disease-modifying therapies and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.
