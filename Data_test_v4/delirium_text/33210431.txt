33210431|a|Tau protein aggregates are a recognized neuropathological feature in Alzheimer's disease as well as many other neurodegenerative disorders, known as tauopathies. The development of tau-targeting therapies is therefore extremely important but efficient strategies or protein targets are still unclear. Here, we performed a cell-based phenotypic screening under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions and identified a small molecule, SB1617, capable of suppressing abnormal tau protein aggregation. By applying label-free target identification technology, we revealed that the transient enhancement of protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) signaling pathway through the inhibition of stress-responsive SB1617 targets, PDIA3 and DNAJC3, is an effective strategy for regulating proteostasis in tauopathies. The molecular mechanism and the promising efficacy of SB1617 were demonstrated in neuronal cells and a mouse model with traumatic brain injury, a tauopathy known to involve ER stress.
