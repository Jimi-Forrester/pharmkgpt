31386153|t|Frailty and hospital outcomes within a low socioeconomic population.
31386153|a|BACKGROUND: Clinical frailty scales (CFS) predict hospital-related outcomes. Frailty is more common in areas of higher socioeconomic disadvantage, but no studies exclusively report on the impact of CFS on hospital-related outcomes in areas of known socioeconomic disadvantage. AIMS: To evaluate the association of the CFS with hospital-related outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study in a community hospital within a disadvantaged area in Australia (Social Economic Index for Areas = 0.1%). METHODS: The CFS was used in the emergency department (ED) for people aged >= 75 years. Frailty was defined as a score of >=4. Associations between the CFS and mortality, admission rates, ED presentations and length of stay (LOS) were analysed using regression analyses. RESULTS: Between 11 July 2017 and 31 March 2018, there were 5151 ED presentations involving 3258 patients aged >= 75 years. Frail persons were significantly more likely to be older, represent to the ED and have delirium compared with non-frail persons. CFS was independently associated with 28-day mortality, with odds of mortality increasing by 1.5 times per unit increase in CFS (95% CI: 1.3-1.7). Frail persons with CFS 4-6 were more likely to be admitted (OR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.0-1.5), have higher geometric mean LOS (1.43; 95% CI 1.15-1.77 days) and higher rates of ED presentations (IRR: 1.12; 95% CI 1.04-1.21) compared with non-frail persons. CONCLUSIONS: The CFS predicts community hospital-related outcomes in frail persons within a socioeconomic disadvantage area. Future intervention and allocation of resources could consider focusing on CFS 4-6 as a priority for frail persons within a community hospital setting.
