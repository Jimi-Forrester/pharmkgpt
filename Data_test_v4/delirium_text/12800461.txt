12800461|a|Psychosis is one of the most disabling complications associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) and occurs in up to 30% of PD patients treated chronically with antiparkinsonian drugs. Visual hallucinations, with or without delirium and paranoid delusions, are the most frequent symptoms. Psychosis complicating PD can be more disabling than the motor symptoms of PD; it frequently poses a serious threat to the patient's ability to maintain independence and is the single greatest risk factor for nursing home placement. Choosing an antipsychotic drug for a PD patient is a common clinical dilemma. The conventional antipsychotic drugs are poorly tolerated in PD because of their predictable and at times profound worsening in parkinsonian motor symptoms. The recent availability of atypical antipsychotic drugs that can control psychotic symptoms without compromising motor function has led to significant advances in therapeutic strategies in the management of PD psychosis in the community. This article reviews data on the use of atypical antipsychotics in patients with PD and the current recommendations on their use in the management of PD psychosis.
