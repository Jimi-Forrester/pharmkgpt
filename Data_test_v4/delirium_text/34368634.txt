OBJECTIVE: This patient involvement survey aims to explore human factors, needs and requirements of PwD, their caregivers, and Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) with respect to supportive and interactive mHealth apps, such as brain games, medication reminders, and geolocation trackers through a constructive questionnaire. METHODS: Following the principles of user-centered design to involve end-users in design we constructed a questionnaire, containing both open-ended and closed-ended questions as well as multiple choice and Likert scale, in order to investigate the specific requirements and preferences for mHealth apps. We recruited 48 participants including people with cognitive impairment (n = 15), caregivers (n = 16), and HCPs (n = 17) and administered the questionnaire. RESULTS: All participants are likely to use mHealth apps, with the primary desired features being the improvement of memory and cognition, assistance on medication treatment, and perceived ease to use. HCPs, caregivers, and PwD consider brain games as an important technology-based, non-pharmaceutical intervention. Both caregivers and patients are willing to use a medication reminder app frequently. Finally, caregivers are worried about the patient wandering. Therefore, global positioning system tracking would be particularly important to them. On the other hand, patients are concerned about their privacy, but are still willing to use a geolocation app for cases of emergency. CONCLUSION: This research contributes to mHealth app design and potential adoption. All three groups agree that mHealth services could facilitate care and ameliorate behavioral and cognitive disturbances of patients.
