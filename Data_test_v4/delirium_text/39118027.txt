39118027|t|Incidence and related risk factors for postoperative delirium following revision total knee arthroplasty: a retrospective nationwide inpatient sample database study.
39118027|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common surgical complication. However, the incidence and risk factors associated with postoperative delirium after revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) have not been comprehensively explored through extensive national databases. METHODS: Utilizing the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), the largest comprehensive U.S. hospital healthcare database, we undertook a retrospective investigation involving 127,400 patients who underwent rTKA between 2010 and 2019. We assessed various aspects, including patient demographics, hospital characteristics, pre-existing medical conditions, and perioperative complications. RESULTS: The overall incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) in patients undergoing rTKA between 2010 and 2019 was 0.97%. The highest incidence rate of 1.31% was recorded in 2013. Notably, this patient cohort demonstrated advanced age, increased burden of co-morbidities, prolonged hospital stays, increased hospitalization costs, and elevated in-hospital mortality rates (P < 0.001). Moreover, non-elective admissions, non-private insurance payments, and a preference for teaching hospitals were commonly observed among these patients. During their hospitalization, individuals who developed delirium subsequent to rTKA were more prone to experiencing certain perioperative complications. These complications encompassed medical issues like acute myocardial infarction, continuous invasive mechanical ventilation, postoperative shock, sepsis, stroke and other medical problems. Additionally, surgical complications including hemorrhage / seroma / hematoma, irrigation and debridement, prosthetic joint infection, periprosthetic fracture, and wound dehiscence / nonunion were noted. Several risk factors were found to be linked with the development of POD. These included advanced age (>= 75 years), alcohol abuse, coagulation disorders, congestive heart failure, depression, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and more. Conversely, female sex, having private insurance, and undergoing elective hospitalization emerged as protective factors against POD. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the general prevalence of POD in rTKA is relatively low according to NIS. There was a significant connection between the POD of rTKA and advanced age, prolonged length of stay (LOS), more in-patients' costs, higher in-hospital mortality rate, increased comorbidities, postoperative medical complications and postoperative surgical complications. This study helps to understand the risk factors associated with POD to improve poor outcomes.
