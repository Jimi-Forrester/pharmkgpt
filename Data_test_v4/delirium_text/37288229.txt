37288229|t|Assessment of Serum Electrolytes and Glycated Hemoglobin Level in Non-diabetic Iron-Deficient Anaemic Patients.
37288229|a|INTRODUCTION: The WHO has recognised iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) as the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, with 30% of the population being affected by this condition. The patient's glycemic status during the past three months is shown by the glycated haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) test. According to several studies, iron deficiency can increase HbA1C levels without affecting blood sugar levels. HbA1C levels of >= 6.5% have been approved by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) as a diagnostic indicator for diabetes mellitus (DM). An imbalance in serum electrolyte levels and anaemia have been linked by several studies.  Aim: To analyze the effect of iron deficiency anaemia on HbA1c levels and serum electrolytes in an adult non-diabetic population. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in Shri BM Patil Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, Vijayapura, Karnataka, India from January 2021 to June 2022. A total of 65 moderate to severe normoglycemic iron deficiency anemia patients between 18 to 75 years were enrolled in the study after fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria. A detailed history, clinical and biochemical examination was performed including HbA1c levels. The results were pooled and statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). RESULTS: We found elevated HbA1c levels (5.67+-1.1%) in non-diabetic iron-deficient anaemia individuals, and elevation was more in women of reproductive age group (30.8%). There was a statistically significant Spearman negative correlation between hemoglobin and HbA1C levels. Also, 16 patients had hyponatremia with a mean haemoglobin (Hb) of 4.8 g/dL and one patient had hyperkalemia with a mean Hb of 3.2 g/dL which was statistically non-significant. CONCLUSION: In this study haemoglobin and HbA1c had a statistically significant positive correlation with serum sodium and a negative correlation with serum potassium in moderate to severely iron-deficient anaemic patients, especially females of the reproductive age group.
