39467211|t|Assessing the therapeutic potential of KK14 peptide derived from Cyprinus Carpio in reducing intercellular ROS levels in oxidative Stress-Induced In vivo zebrafish larvae model: An integrated bioinformatics, antioxidant, and neuroprotective analysis.
39467211|a|H2O2 is a significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) that hinders redox-mediated processes and contributes to oxidative stress and neurodegenerative disorders. Oxidative stress causes impairment of cell macromolecules, which results in cell dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases are serious conditions linked to oxidative stress. Antioxidant treatment approaches are a novel and successful strategy for decreasing neurodegeneration and reducing oxidative stress. This study explored the antioxidant and neuroprotective characteristics of KK14 peptide synthesized from LEAP 2B (liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide-2B) derived from Cyprinus carpio L. Molecular docking studies were used to assess the antioxidant properties of KK14. The peptide at concentrations 5-45 muM was examined by using in vitro and in vivo assessment. Analysis was done on the developmental and neuroprotective potential of KK14 peptide treatment in H2O2-exposed zebrafish larvae which showed Nonlethal deformities. KK14 improves antioxidant enzyme activity like catalase and superoxide dismutase. Furthermore, it reduces neuronal damage by lowering lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide generation while increasing acetylcholinesterase activity. It improved the changes in swimming behavior and the cognitive damage produced by exposure to H2O2. To further substantiate the neuroprotective potential of KK14, intracellular ROS levels in zebrafish larvae were assessed. This led to a reduction in ROS levels and diminished lipid peroxidation. The KK14 has upregulated the antioxidant genes against oxidative stress. Overall, this study proved the strong antioxidant activity of KK14, suggesting its potential as a strong therapeutic option for neurological disorders caused by oxidative stress.
