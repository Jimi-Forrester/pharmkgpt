34095441|a|INTRODUCTION: Cilostazol may be a novel therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease. Its metabolite, OPC-13015, has a stronger inhibitory effect on type 3 phosphodiesterase than cilostazol. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with mild cognitive impairment to whom cilostazol was newly prescribed. Patients underwent the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) twice, at a 6-month interval. Plasma cilostazol, OPC-13015, OPC-13213, and OPC-13217 concentrations were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: MoCA score changes from baseline to the 6-month visit were positively correlated with ratios of OPC-13015 to cilostazol and total metabolites (n = 19, P = .005). Patients with higher ratios of OPC-13015 (>=0.18, median value; n = 10) had significantly higher MoCA scores (P = .036) than patients with lower ratios (the ratio <0.18, n = 9). The absolute value of OPC-13015 concentration in blood was also higher in patients with preserved cognitive function (P = .033). DISCUSSION: Blood OPC-13015 levels may be a predictive biomarker of cilostazol treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
