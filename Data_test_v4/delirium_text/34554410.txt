34554410|t|Sodium Butyrate Protects Against Ethanol-Induced Toxicity in SH-SY5Y Cell Line.
34554410|a|Alcohol use disorder (AUD), brought about by excessive alcohol use, is associated with damages to several organs including the brain. Chronic excessive use of alcohol can compromise intestinal integrity, leading to changes in gut microbiota (GM) composition known as dysbiosis. Dysbiosis, by disruption of the gut-brain axis (GBA), further exacerbates the deleterious effects of alcohol. One of the fermentation by-products of GM is butyrate (BUT), a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) that plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis of the GBA. Alcohol metabolism results in formation of acetaldehyde, a highly reactive compound that reacts with dopamine in the brain to form toxic adducts such as salsolinol. Recent studies indicate potential neuro-protective effects of BUT against various toxicants including salsolinol. Here, we sought to investigate whether BUT can also protect against alcohol toxicity. Pretreatment of neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cells with 500 mM ethanol (ETOH) for 24 h resulted in approximately 40% reduction in cell viability, which was totally blocked by 10 microM of either BUT or AR 420,626 (AR), a selective fatty acid 3 receptor (FA3R) agonist. The neuro-protective effects of both BUT and AR were significantly (80%) attenuated by beta-hydroxy butyrate (BHB), a selective FA3R antagonist. Interestingly, combination of BUT and AR resulted in synergistic protection against ETOH, which was totally blocked by BHB. These findings suggest potential utility of butyrate and/or FA3R agonists against ETOH-induced toxicity.
