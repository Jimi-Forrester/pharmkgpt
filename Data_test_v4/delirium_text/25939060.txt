25939060|a|Ever since the discovery of its neurite growth promoting activity in sympathetic and sensory ganglia, nerve growth factor (NGF) became the prototype of the large family of neurotrophins. The use of primary cultures and clonal cell lines has revealed several distinct actions of NGF and other neurotrophins. Among several models of NGF activity, the clonal cell line PC12 is the most widely employed. Thus, in the presence of NGF, through the activation of the transmembrane protein TrkA, these cells undergo a progressive mitotic arrest and start to grow electrically excitable neuritis. A vast number of studies opened intriguing aspects of NGF mechanisms of action, its biological properties, and potential use as therapeutic agents. In this context, identifying and utilizing small portions of NGF is of great interest and involves several human diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Here we report the specific action of the peptide encompassing the 1-14 sequence of the human NGF (NGF(1-14)), identified on the basis of scattered indications present in literature. The biological activity of NGF(1-14) was tested on PC12 cells, and its binding with TrkA was predicted by means of a computational approach. NGF(1-14) does not elicit the neurite outgrowth promoting activity, typical of the whole protein, and it only has a moderate action on PC12 proliferation. However, this peptide exerts, in a dose and time dependent fashion, an effective and specific NGF-like action on some highly conserved and biologically crucial intermediates of its intracellular targets such as Akt and CREB. These findings indicate that not all TrkA pathways must be at all times operative, and open the possibility of testing each of them in relation with specific NGF needs, biological actions, and potential therapeutic use.
