18091670|a|A wide spectrum of cognitive ability is seen in older persons, ranging from intact cognitive function to clinically manifested dementia. The term mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is increasingly used to refer to individuals who have some cognitive impairment but do not meet the criteria for dementia. Despite a lack of consensus about precisely how to define MCI, researchers agree that the condition is relatively common in older people, and data suggest that MCI may be associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, parkinsonian signs and disability. Presently, the clinical assessment of MCI should include a detailed evaluation of cognitive functioning and the use of structural MRI can provide important diagnostic and prognostic information. Although therapeutic trials in MCI using the Choline acetylcholinesterase's have been disappointing with short term affects noted, pharmacologic prevention studies for MCI, are underway and may provide valuable data to prevent the development of this condition.
