37691679|a|Background: Although numerous studies have documented the improved clinical outcomes of patients undergoing cardiac surgery following introduction of attending intensivist, most of these studies included heterogeneous patient populations. We aimed to investigate the impact of an attending intensivist on the clinical outcomes of patients admitted to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit (CSICU) following valvular heart surgery. Methods: Patients who underwent valvular heart surgery between January 2007 and December 2012 (control group, n=337) were propensity matched (1:1) between January 2013 and June 2017 (intensivist group, n=407). Results: During the propensity score matching analysis, 285 patients were extracted from each group. Patients in the intensivist group underwent mechanical ventilation for a significantly shorter time than those in the control group (21.8+-69.8 vs. 39.2+-115.3 hours, P=0.021). More patients were extubated within 6 hours in the intensivist group than in the control group (53.7% vs. 42.8%, P=0.015). The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (1.4% vs. 4.9%, P=0.031), cardiac arrest due to cardiac tamponade associated with post-cardiotomy bleeding (0.4% vs. 3.9%, P=0.002), and acute kidney injury (2.8% vs. 7.7%, P=0.011) in the intensivist group was significantly lower than that in the control group. The 30-day mortality rate of the intensivist group was significantly lower than that of the control group (2.1% vs. 6.7%, P=0.015). Conclusions: Critical care provided in the CSICU staffed by an attending intensivist is associated with a lower 30-day mortality rate and reduced incidence of postoperative complications.
