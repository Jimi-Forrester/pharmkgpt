35330384|t|Clinical Approaches to Late-Onset Psychosis.
35330384|a|Psychosis can include schizophrenia, mood disorders with psychotic features, delusional disorder, active delirium, and neurodegenerative disorders accompanied by various psychotic symptoms. Late-onset psychosis requires careful intervention due to the greater associated risks of secondary psychosis; higher morbidity and mortality rates than early-onset psychosis; and complicated treatment considerations due to the higher incidence of adverse effects, even with the black box warning against antipsychotics. Pharmacological treatment, including antipsychotics, should be carefully initiated with the lowest dosage for short-term efficacy and monitoring of adverse side effects. Further research involving larger samples, more trials with different countries working in consortia, and unified operational definitions for diagnosis will help elaborate the clinical characteristics of late-onset psychosis and lead to the development of treatment approaches.
