37137453|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Danggui Buxue decoction (DBD) is a classic herbal decoction consisting of Astragali Radix (AR) and Angelica Sinensis Radix (ASR) with a 5:1 wt ratio, which can supplement 'blood' and 'qi' (vital energy) for the treatment of clinical diseases. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory, dementia is induced by Blood deficiency and Qi weakness, which causes a decline in cognition. However, the underlying mechanisms of DBD improving cognition deficits in neurodegenerative disease are no clear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims at revealing the underlying mechanisms of DBD plays a protective role in the cognitive deficits and pathology process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The APP/PS1 (Mo/HuAPP695swe/PS1-dE9) double transgenic mice were adopted as an experimental model of AD. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of 3 compounds in DBT was analyzed by HPLC. Morris water maze test, Golgi staining and electrophysiology assays were used to evaluate the effects of DBD on cognitive function and synaptic plasticity in APP/PS1 mice. Western blot, immunofluorescence and Thioflavin S staining were used for the pathological evaluation of AD. Monitoring the level of ATP, mitochondrial membrane potential, SOD and MDA to evaluate the mitochondrial function, and with the usage of qPCR and CHIP for the changes of histone post-translational modification. RESULTS: In the current study, we found that DBD could effectively attenuate memory impairments and enhance long-term potentiation (LTP) with concurrent increased expression of memory-associated proteins. DBD markedly decreased Abeta accumulation in APP/PS1 mice by decreasing the phosphorylation of APP at the Thr668 level but not APP, PS1 or BACE1. Further studies demonstrated that DBD restored mitochondrial biogenesis deficits and mitochondrial dysfunction. Finally, the restored mitochondrial biogenesis and cognitive deficits are under HADC2-mediated histone H4 lysine 12 (H4K12) acetylation at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor type 2B (GluN2B) promoters. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that DBD could ameliorate mitochondrial biogenesis and cognitive deficits by improving H4K12 acetylation. DBD might be a promising complementary drug candidate for AD treatment.
