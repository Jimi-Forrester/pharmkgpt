29740311|a|Sophora flavescens Aiton (SF) has been used to treat various diseases including fever and inflammation in China, South Korea and Japan. Several recent reports have shown that SF has anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, indicating that it is a promising candidate for treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). We evaluated the protective effect of SF against neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, an in vitro PD model. SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with SF for 24 h, after which they were treated with MPP+. MPP+-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis were confirmed by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling assay. MitoSOX red mitochondrial superoxide indicator, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester perchlorate and Parkin, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), and DJ-1 immunofluorescent staining were conducted to confirm the mitochondrial function. In addition, western blot was performed to evaluate apoptosis factors (Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3 and cytochrome c) and mitochondrial function-related factors (Parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1). SF suppressed MPP+-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential by inhibiting the increase of reactive oxidative species (ROS) and DNA fragmentation, and controlling Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3 and cytochrome c expression. Moreover, it attenuated Parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1 expression from MPP+-induced decrease. SF effectively suppressed MPP+-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction by regulating generation of ROS, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and loss or mutation of mitochondria-related PD markers including Parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1.
