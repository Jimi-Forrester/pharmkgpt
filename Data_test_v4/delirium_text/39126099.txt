39126099|a|Dynamic climate changes pose a significant challenge for plants to cope with numerous abiotic and biotic stressors of increasing intensity. Plants have evolved a variety of biochemical and molecular defense mechanisms involved in overcoming stressful conditions. Under environmental stress, plants generate elevated amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, subsequently, modulate the activity of the antioxidative enzymes. In addition, an increase in the biosynthesis of important plant compounds such as anthocyanins, lignin, isoflavonoids, as well as a wide range of low molecular weight stress-related proteins (e.g., dehydrins, cyclotides, heat shock proteins and pathogenesis-related proteins), was evidenced. The induced expression of these proteins improves the survival rate of plants under unfavorable environmental stimuli and enhances their adaptation to sequentially interacting stressors. Importantly, the plant defense proteins may also have potential for use in medical applications and agriculture (e.g., biopesticides). Therefore, it is important to gain a more thorough understanding of the complex biological functions of the plant defense proteins. It will help to devise new cultivation strategies, including the development of genotypes characterized by better adaptations to adverse environmental conditions. The review presents the latest research findings on selected plant defense proteins.
