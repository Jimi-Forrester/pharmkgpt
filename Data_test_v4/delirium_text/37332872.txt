The candidate circulating biomarkers and primary metabolic pathway alteration of plasma in OCD remain poorly understood. Methods: We recruited 32 drug-naive patients with severe OCD and 32 compared healthy controls and applied the untargeted metabolomics approach by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) to assess their circulating metabolic profiles. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were then utilized to filtrate differential metabolites between patients and healthy controls, and weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) was utilized to screen out hub metabolites. Results: A total of 929 metabolites were identified, including 34 differential metabolites and 51 hub metabolites, with an overlap of 13 metabolites. Notably, the following enrichment analyses underlined the importance of unsaturated fatty acids and tryptophan metabolism alterations in OCD. Metabolites of these pathways in plasma appeared to be promising biomarkers, such as Docosapentaenoic acid and 5-Hydroxytryptophan, which may be biomarkers for OCD identification and prediction of sertraline treatment outcome, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings revealed alterations in the circulating metabolome and the potential utility of plasma metabolites as promising biomarkers in OCD.
