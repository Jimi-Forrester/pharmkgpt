35903587|t|Ketodex for MRI sedation in syndromic children with congenital cardiac anomalies - A case series.
35903587|a|Safe paediatric sedation in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suite can be challenging. The challenges intensify in uncooperative syndromic children compounded by an accentuated risk of periprocedural cardio-respiratory complications with anaesthetic sedation in this peculiarly predisposed subset. Amidst ardent debates on the ideal sedative agent for paediatric MRI, we report an encouraging application of ketamine-dexmedetomidine combination (ketodex) sedation for MRI in our case-series including syndromic children with coexistent congenital cardiac anomalies.
