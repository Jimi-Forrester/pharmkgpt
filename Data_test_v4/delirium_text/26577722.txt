26577722|t|Post-Hospital Syndrome: A New Challenge in Cardiovascular Practice.
26577722|a|The image of the hospital representing the modern medicine and its diagnostic and therapeutic advances becomes more evident in the face of an aging population and patients with multiple comorbidities requiring highly complex care. However, recent studies have shown a growing number of hospital readmissions within 30 days after discharge. The post-hospital syndrome is a new clinical entity associated with multiple vulnerabilities that contribute to hospital readmissions. During hospitalization, the patient is exposed to different stressors of physical, environmental, and psychosocial natures that trigger pathophysiological and multisystemic responses and increase the risk of complications after hospital discharge. Patients with a cardiac disease have high rates of readmission within 30 days. Therefore, it is important for cardiologists to recognize the post-hospital syndrome since it may impact their daily practice. This review aims at discussing the current scientific evidence regarding predictors and stressors involved in the post-hospital syndrome and the measures that are currently being taken to minimize their effects.
