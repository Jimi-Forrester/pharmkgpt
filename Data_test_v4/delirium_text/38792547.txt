38792547|a|Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic condition associated with multiple complications and comorbidities. Some of these comorbidities are anxiety and depression, with a negative impact on the quality of life, non-adherence to treatment, and poor prognosis. The main aim of this study was to evaluate depression and anxiety in a group of patients with DM and their impact on quality of life and identify factors that improve the prognosis and increase the life expectancy and quality of life of patients with DM. Methods: A total of 209 patients with type 2 DM (T2DM) were enrolled cross-sectionally. Patients were screened for psychiatric disorders, cognitive impairment, and metabolic parameters. Results: Included patients had a median age of 66.0 (58; 70) years, a median DM duration of 9 (6; 15) years, and a suboptimal glycemic control reflected by a median HbA1c of 7.8 (7; 9.2) mg/dL. Patients presented anxiety at different stages in 51.5% of cases, and similarly, depression in 37.5% of cases. Age, duration of DM, HbA1c, and postprandial hyperglycemia (PPG) were predictive factors for anxiety and depression in patients with T2DM. An age > 57 years (sensitivity 84.3, specificity 33.7, AUROC 0.621, p = 0.002) and an HbA1c > 8.5% (sensitivity 45.8, specificity 83.1, AUROC = 0.635, p < 0.0001) predict a higher rate of anxiety, respectively, of depression in these patients. Conclusions: Patients with T2DM have an increased rate of anxiety and depression due to persistent hyperglycemia and aging, which is expressed in a lower quality of life.
