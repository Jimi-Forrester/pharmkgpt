1961371|t|Can activity modulate the susceptibility of neurons to degeneration?
1961371|a|The provocative suggestion that maintaining an appropriate level of continuous neuronal activation, either by training or pharmacological intervention, might make neurons more robust and able to withstand degenerative insults during aging is fascinating and clearly warrants further investigation. Two cautionary points: 1) it is far from certain that Alzheimer's disease represents accelerated aging, and 2) excessive activation could be harmful to neurons in a context other than that of normally occurring "wear and tear."
