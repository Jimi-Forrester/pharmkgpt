32244766|t|Characteristics of Potential Protein Nutraceuticals of Plant Origin with Antioxidant Activity.
32244766|a|This study used selected plant proteins and the tools available in the BIOPEP-UWM database to profile proteins and release antioxidant nutraceuticals from their primary structures. The frequency of the occurrence of fragments with antioxidant activity in a protein sequence (the A parameter) was determined. A simulated monocatalytic proteolysis was carried out using ficin or stem bromelain or pepsin (pH > 2), and the theoretical degree of hydrolysis (DHt) and the frequency (including relative frequency) of the release of fragments with a particular antioxidant activity by a selected enzyme (the AE and W parameters, respectively). Both barley hordoindolines and the protein group of "actins and other rice proteins" were characterised by the best antioxidant potential. On the other hand, among the main analysed cereal protein groups or species, the best nutraceutical sources included kafirins, rice glutelins and alpha-gliadins. Potentially the most nutraceutical molecules were released by pepsin (HL, VY, PHQ and PWQ biopeptides) from gliadins, but the most analysed proteins were hydrolysed (66% on average) and the DHt for ficin and bromelain amounted to 27% and 31%, respectively. However, based on the calculated AE mean values, it can be concluded that nutraceuticals were more frequently released from rice protein structures (IY and VY biopeptides), and less frequently released from barley and other cereal protein species, which may be of significance in the context of designing nutraceutical food.
