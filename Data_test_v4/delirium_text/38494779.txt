38494779|t|Unusual Urothelial Tumors and Refractory Uremia Due to Balkan Endemic Nephropathy: A Case Report.
38494779|a|Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) is a rare progressive chronic renal disease found in residents living along the Balkan peninsula. We present a 92-year-old female who complained initially of cardio-respiratory symptoms and was found to have an acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with hypervolemia. The patient underwent computed tomography imaging and was found to have bilateral pleural effusions and moderate left-sided renal atrophy with left-sided hydronephrosis. The patient underwent diuresis for fluid overload and was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Further urological work-up revealed masses in the posterior bladder wall and left ureteropelvic junction. A biopsy of the posterior bladder wall mass confirmed high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma. A review of the epidemiological history revealed the patient lived in Kosovo/former Yugoslavia for several decades following birth. A review of old records revealed the patient had chronic kidney disease (CKD) that was not fully explained by other causes, such as hypertension or diabetes. Given the epidemiological history, accelerated CKD, and unusual locations of urothelial carcinoma, the patient was diagnosed with BEN. Despite medical management and hemodialysis, the patient's renal function and mental status continued to deteriorate, and the decision was made to proceed with palliative care measures.
