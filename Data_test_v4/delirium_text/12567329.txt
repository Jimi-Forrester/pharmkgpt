12567329|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prevalent condition among older adults that carries a high risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. Given the potential for delaying or preventing the onset of dementia, efforts aimed at early detection and early intervention are important. The current paper reviews the conceptualization and diagnosis of MCI, assessment of memory complaints and deficits in the elderly, as well as recent research on the neurobiological basis of the disorder, including neurochemical, structural, and functional neuroimaging findings.
