35755421|t|An insight into polyscopoletin electrosynthesis by a quality-by-design approach.
35755421|a|Scopoletin (SP) as a functional monomer for electropolymerization has recently been investigated in the context of molecularly imprinted polymers for biosensing applications. Herein we describe an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms involved in the electropolymerization of SP toward the optimization of the experimental conditions for applications in sensor studies. PolySP films have been in situ synthesized on a standard glassy carbon electrodes by varying three independent experimental parameters, and the output of the analysis has been evaluated in terms of the resulting electroactive area and surface coverage. A quality-by-design approach including design-of-experiments principles and response surface methodology produced unbiased observations on the most relevant parameters to be controlled during the electropolymerization of SP. By combining the output of electroactive area and surface overage, we highlighted a strong dependence on the monomer concentration and scan rate. Thus, an appropriate selection of these two parameters should be sought to have an optimal electropolymerization process, leading to uniform films and homogeneous surface behavior. This study shows that the application of multi-factorial analysis in a comprehensive design of experiments allows the systematic study of polymer electrosynthesis. Therefore, this research is expected to guide further efforts in the electropolymerization of several functional monomers.
