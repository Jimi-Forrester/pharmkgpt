35676997|t|Atypical Presentation of Acute Mitral Regurgitation Secondary to Papillary Muscle Rupture.
35676997|a|Acute mitral regurgitation (MR) is a life-threatening condition presenting with severe decompensated heart failure due to sudden retrograde blood flow into the left atrium. The causes are broadly classified into ischemic and non-ischemic. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of acute MR and its potential causes is essential. This case uniquely highlights an atypical presentation of severe MR secondary to papillary muscle rupture without a known, identifiable cause. Therefore, suspicion of acute MR should be high if clinical symptoms are present, even without known risk factors, due to the high morbidity and mortality associated with delayed management.
