37760965|t|SARS-CoV-2 and Parkinson's Disease: A Review of Where We Are Now.
37760965|a|Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been discussed in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD) over the last three years. Now that we are entering the long-term phase of this pandemic, we are intrigued to look back and see how and why the community of patients with PD was impacted and what knowledge we have collected so far. The relationship between COVID-19 and PD is likely multifactorial in nature. Similar to other systemic infections, a probable worsening of PD symptoms secondary to COVID-19, either transient or persistent (long COVID), has been demonstrated, while the COVID-19-related mortality of PD patients may be increased compared to the general population. These observations could be attributed to direct or indirect damage from SARS-CoV-2 in the central nervous system (CNS) or could result from general infection-related parameters (e.g., hospitalization or drugs) and the sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., quarantine). A growing number of cases of new-onset parkinsonism or PD following SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, either closely (post-infectious) or remotely (para-infectious) after a COVID-19 diagnosis, although such a link remains hypothetical. The pathophysiological substrate of these phenomena remains elusive; however, research studies, particularly pathology studies, have suggested various COVID-19-induced degenerative changes with potential associations with PD/parkinsonism. We review the literature to date for answers considering the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and PD/parkinsonism, examining pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, vaccination, and future directions.
