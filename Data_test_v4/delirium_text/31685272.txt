31685272|t|Reducing delirium and cognitive dysfunction after off-pump coronary bypass: A randomized trial.
31685272|a|BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric complications of surgical coronary revascularization are inconspicuous but frequent and clinically relevant. So far, attempts to reduce their occurrence, such as the introduction of off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) grafting method, have not brought the desired results. The aim of this trial was to determine whether using any of the 2 selected modifications of OPCAB could decrease the incidence of these undesired sequelae. METHODS: In this single-center, assessor- and patient-blinded, superiority, randomized controlled trial, 192 patients scheduled for elective isolated OPCAB were randomized to 3 parallel arms. The control arm underwent "conventional" OPCAB with vein grafts. The first study arm underwent anaortic OPCAB (ANA) with total arterial revascularization. The second study arm underwent OPCAB with vein grafts using carbon dioxide surgical field flooding (CO2FF). Outcomes included the incidence of postoperative delirium (PD) and early postoperative cognitive dysfunction (ePOCD). RESULTS: The incidence of PD was 35.9% in the control (OPCAB) arm, 32.8% in the CO2FF arm, and 12.5% in the ANA arm (chi2 [2, N = 191] = 10.17; P = .006). Post hoc tests revealed that the incidence of PD in the ANA arm differed from that in the OPCAB arm (odds ratio [OR], 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.68; P = .002). The incidence of ePOCD was 34.4% in the OPCAB arm, 28.1% in the CO2FF arm, and 9.5% in the ANA arm (chi2 [2, N = 191] = 11.58; P = .003). Post hoc tests revealed that the incidence of ePOCD differed between the ANA and OPCAB arms (OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.06-0.58; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Performing ANA significantly decreases the incidence of PD and ePOCD compared with "conventional" OPCAB with vein grafts, whereas CO2FF is inconsequential in this regard. These results, which probably reflect decreased delivery of embolic load to the brain in ANA, may have practical applicability in daily practice to improve clinical outcomes.
