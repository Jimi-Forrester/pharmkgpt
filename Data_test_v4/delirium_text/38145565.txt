38145565|t|Memory impairment induced by aluminum nanoparticles is associated with hippocampal IL-1 and IBA-1 upregulation in mice.
38145565|a|OBJECTIVES: Increasing evidence indicates a link between aluminum (Al) intake and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main entry of Al into the human body is through oral route, and in the digestive tract, under the influence of the pH change, Al can be transformed into Al nanoparticles (Al-NP). However, studies related to the effect of Al-NP on the brain are limited and need further investigation. Neuro-inflammation is considered as one of the principal features of AD. Microglial activation and expression of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta (interleukin-1beta) in the brain have been used as hallmarks of brain inflammation. Therefore, in the present study, the hippocampal levels of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA-1), as the marker of microglia activation, and IL-1beta were assessed. METHODS: Adult male NMRI mice were treated with Al-NP (5 or 10 mg/kg) for 5 days. A novel object recognition (NOR) test was used to assess memory. Following cognitive assessments, the hippocampal tissues were isolated to analyze the levels of IL-1beta and IBA-1 as well as beta actin proteins using western blot technique. RESULTS: Al-NP in both doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg impaired NOR memory in mice. In addition, Al-NP increased IL-1beta and IBA-1 in the hippocampus. DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that the memory impairing effect of Al-NP coincides with hippocampal inflammation. According to the proposed relationship between AD and Al toxicity, this study can increase the knowledge about the toxic effects of Al-NP and highlight the need to limit the use of this nanoparticle.
