38417712|t|Mechanisms of pain in aging and age-related conditions: Focus on caregivers.
38417712|a|Pain is a complex, subjective experience that can significantly impact quality of life, particularly in aging individuals, by adversely affecting physical and emotional well-being. Whereas acute pain usually serves a protective function, chronic pain is a persistent pathological condition that contributes to functional deficits, cognitive decline, and emotional disturbances in the elderly. Despite substantial progress that has been made in characterizing age-related changes in pain, complete mechanistic details of pain processing mechanisms in the aging patient remain unknown. Pain is particularly under-recognized and under-managed in the elderly, especially among patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD), and other age-related conditions. Furthermore, difficulties in assessing pain in patients with AD/ADRD and other age-related conditions may contribute to the familial caregiver burden. The purpose of this article is to discuss the mechanisms and risk factors for chronic pain development and persistence, with a particular focus on age-related changes. Our article also highlights the importance of caregivers working with aging chronic pain patients, and emphasizes the urgent need for increased legislative awareness and improved pain management in these populations to substantially alleviate caregiver burden.
