36154386|a|Reperfusion therapy administration timing in acute ischaemic stroke is the main determinant of patients' mortality and long-term disability. Indeed, the first hour from the stroke onset is defined the "golden hour", in which the treatment has the highest efficacy and lowest side effects. Delayed ambulance transport, inappropriate triage and difficulty in accessing CT scans lead to delayed onset to treatment time (OTT) in clinical practice. To date brain CT scan is needed to rule out intracranial haemorrhage, which is a major contraindication to thrombolytic therapy. The availability, dimension and portability make CT suitable mainly for intrahospital use, determining further delays in the therapies administration. This review aims at evaluating portable neurophysiology technologies developed with the scope of speeding up the diagnostic phase of acute stroke and, therefore, the initiation of intravenous thrombolysis. Medline databases were explored for studies concerning near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) and Microwave imaging (MWI) as methods for stroke diagnosis. A total of 1368 articles were found, and 12 of these fit with our criteria and were included in the review. For each technology, the following parameters were evaluated: diagnostic accuracy, ability to differentiate ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, diagnosis time from stroke onset, portability and technology readiness level (TRL). All the described methods seem to be able to identify acute stroke even though the number of studies is very limited. Low cost and portability make them potentially usable during ambulance transport, possibly leading to a reduction of stroke OTT along with the related huge benefits in terms of patients outcome and health care costs. In addition, unlike standard imaging techniques, neurophysiological techniques could allow continuous monitoring of patients for timely intrahospital stroke diagnosis.KEY MESSAGESFirst hour from the stroke onset is defined the "golden hour", in which the treatment has the highest efficacy and lowest side effects.The delay for stroke onset to brain imaging time is one of the major reasons why only a minority of patients with acute ischaemic stroke are eligible to reperfusion therapies.Neurophysiology techniques (NIRS, BIS and MWI) could have a potential high impact in reducing the time to treatment in stroke patients.
