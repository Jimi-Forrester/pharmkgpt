33172595|a|Endogenous toxicity caused by systemic inflammation as well as by acute liver failure triggers a wide range of dysfunctional disorders in the brain ranging from delirium and acute psychosis to coma. Astrocytes, the main homeostatic cells of the central nervous system (CNS), play a key role in pathophysiology of neurotoxic insults. We examined the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and acetaminophen-induced liver failure (AILF) of Wistar rats, and analysed ultrastructure of astrocytes in the brain cortex and subcortical white matter of sensorimotor zone with transmission electron microscopy. Both models showed significant similarities in reactive changes of astroglial endosomal machinery. In survived animals (with relative prevalence in the CLP-model), at 24 h after intervention we found an increase in number of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) in astroglial perikarya and astroglial processes. In particular, the number of MVBs substantially (3 times of control values) increased in the perivascular astroglial endfeet. Increased number of MVBs in astrocytes was associated with the lesser degree of intracellular oedema and with signs of compensated oedematous tissue changes. In deceased animals, up to 24 h after intervention, single MVBs were localised mainly in astroglial perikarya, and their number was not significantly changed compared to control. Activation of astroglial endosomal-exosomal machinery in both models reflects the uniform pattern of reactive changes of astroglia in these two systemic conditions and may represent activation of astroglial defence in sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) and acute hepatic encephalopathy (AHE). Our data highlight the special role of astroglial adaptive activity in the counterbalancing of an impaired brain homeostasis under action of endogenous toxins. Accumulation of MVBs in astrocytic processes indicates the activation of their intercellular and gliovascular interactions through endo- and exocytosis in SAE and AHE.
