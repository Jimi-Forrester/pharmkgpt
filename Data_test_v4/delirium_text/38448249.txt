38448249|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium after organ transplantation can lead to increased length of hospital stay and mortality. Because pain is an important risk factor for delirium, perioperative analgesia with intrathecal morphine (ITM) may mitigate postoperative delirium development. We evaluated if ITM reduces postoperative delirium incidence in living donor kidney transplant (LDKT) recipients. METHODS: Two hundred ninety-six patients who received LDKT between 2014 and 2018 at our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Recipients who received preoperative ITM (ITM group) were compared with those who did not (control group). The primary outcome was postoperative delirium based on the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit results during the first 4 postoperative days. RESULTS: Delirium occurred in 2.6% (4/154) and 7.0% (10/142) of the ITM and control groups, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01-1.14; P = .031), recent smoking (OR: 7.87, 95% CI: 1.43-43.31; P = .018), preoperative psychotropics (OR: 23.01, 95% CI: 3.22-164.66; P = .002) were risk factors, whereas ITM was a protective factor (OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.06-0.89; P = .033). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative ITM showed an independent association with reduced post-LDKT delirium. Further studies and the development of regional analgesia for delirium prevention may enhance the postoperative recovery of transplant recipients.
