29941042|a|The mutation of the Parkin gene is a cause of familial Parkinson's disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that Parkin also functions as a tumor suppressor. Parkin is an ubiquitin E3 ligase, and plays important roles in a variety of cellular processes implicated in tumorigenesis, including cell cycle, cell proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, mitophagy and metabolic reprogramming. Here we review the role and mechanism of Parkin in cancer.
