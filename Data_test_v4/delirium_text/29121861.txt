29121861|a|BACKGROUND: Global trend of the introduction of high levels of relatively cheap carbohydrates to reduce the amount of costly protein in the aquatic animal feed production has affected the aquaculture of an economically important cyprinid fish, blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala). This dietary shift has resulted in increased prevalence of metabolic disorders, often causing economic losses. High dietary intake of carbohydrates, associated with obesity, is one of the major causes of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans. RESULTS: We have conducted an eight-week feeding trial to better understand how a high-carbohydrate diet (HCBD) affects the liver health in this fish. Hepatosomatic index and lipid content were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the HCBD group. Histology results also suggested pathological changes in the livers of HCBD group, with excessive lipid accumulation and indication of liver damage. Metabolomics and serum biochemistry analyses showed that a number of metabolites indicative of liver damage were increased in the HCBD group. This group also exhibited low levels of betaine, which is a metabolite crucial for maintaining the healthy liver functions. Transcriptomic and qPCR analyses indicated that HCBD had a strong impact on the expression of a large number of genes associated with the NAFLD and insulin signalling pathways, which may lead to the development of insulin resistance in hepatocytes, pathological liver changes, and eventually the NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptomics, metabolomics and histology results all indicate early symptoms of liver damage. However whether these would actually lead to the development of NAFLD after a longer period of time, remains inconclusive. Additionally, a very high number of upregulated genes in the HCBD group associated with several neurodegenerative diseases is a strong indication of neurodegenerative changes caused by the high-carbohydrate diet in blunt snout bream. This suggests that fish might present a good model to study neurodegenerative changes associated with high-carbohydrate diet in humans.
