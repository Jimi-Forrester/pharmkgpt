38089125|t|Percutaneous repair of a sinotubular junction aortic pseudoaneurysm with an atrial septal defect occluder: a case report.
38089125|a|Background: Aortic pseudoaneurysms are complications that arise following cardiac surgery, thoracic trauma, infections, or inflammatory conditions. The mainstay treatment for aortic pseudoaneurysm is surgical management. Given significant morbidity and mortality related to thoracotomy, high-risk patients are not considered for cardiac surgery. Novel percutaneous repair using a variety of devices are being explored, especially in those with prohibitive risk for cardiac surgery. Case summary: This case describes the use of an Amplatzer atrial septal defect (ASD) occluder device to manage an aortic pseudoaneurysm in a 69-year-old male who had previously undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery and pericardial drainage for purulent pericarditis. Following successful implant, there were no complications seen after 2 years of follow-up. Discussion: Percutaneous closure of a mycotic pseudoaneurysm with an Amplatzer ASD occluder device can be a safe and efficacious treatment option, especially in patients with prohibitive surgical risk.
