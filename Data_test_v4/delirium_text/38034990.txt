38034990|a|Background: As a non-pharmacologic treatment, bright light therapy (BLT) is often used to improve affective disorders and memory function. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of BLT on depression and electrophysiological features of the brain in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their caregivers using a light-emitting diode device of 14000 lux. Methods: A 4-week case-control trial was conducted. Neuropsychiatric and electroencephalogram (EEG) examination were evaluated at baseline and after 4 weeks. EEG power in delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and beta (12-30 Hz) bands was calculated for our main analysis. Demographic and clinical variables were analyzed using Student's t test and the chi-square test. Pearson's correlation was used to determine the correlation between electrophysiological features, blood biochemical indicators, and cognitive assessment scale scores. Results: In this study, 22 in-patients with AD and 23 caregivers were recruited. After BLT, the Hamilton depression scale score decreased in the fourth week. Compared with the age-matched controls of their caregivers, a higher spectral power at the lower delta and theta frequencies was observed in the AD group. After BLT, the EEG power of the delta and theta frequencies in the AD group decreased. No change was observed in blood amyloid concentrations before and after BLT. Conclusion: In conclusion, a 4-week course of BLT significantly suppressed depression in patients with AD and their caregivers. Moreover, changes in EEG power were also significant in both groups.
