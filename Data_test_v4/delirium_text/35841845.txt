35841845|t|Delirium prevalence in geriatric emergency department patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
35841845|a|BACKGROUND: In the emergency department, delirium associated with serious adverse outcomes is common in geriatric patients. We performed a meta-analysis and estimated the prevalence of delirium and its related factors among geriatric emergency department patients. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and CBM databases were searched before November 7, 2021. The random-effects model was used to estimate the prevalence of delirium. In addition, subgroup analyses were performed based on continent or region, publication year, age, sample size, and diagnostic criteria or assessment methods. RESULTS: 30 studies involving 19,534 geriatric patients in the emergency department were included. The overall pooled crude prevalence estimate of delirium was 15.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.5-18.0%]. Subgroup analyses revealed that the region, publication year, age, sample size, and delirium assessment methods were significantly correlated with the prevalence of delirium. Meta-regression analysis showed that the publication year was positively, while the sample size was negatively associated with the pooled prevalence of delirium. CONCLUSION: In the emergency department, delirium is common in geriatric patients. We should pay specific attention to delirium screening, prevention, and treatment in geriatric patients. Overall appropriate interventions should be utilized to reduce the occurrence of delirium and the adverse outcomes.
