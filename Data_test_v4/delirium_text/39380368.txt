39380368|a|Aging-related decline in memory and synaptic function are associated with the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, attributed to the overexpression of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC). The membrane insertion of AMPAR governed by the AMPAR auxiliary proteins is essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity (LTP). In this study, we demonstrated the hippocampal expression of the transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins gamma-8 (TARPgamma8) was reduced in aged mice along with the reduced CaMKIIalpha activity and memory impairment. We further showed that TARPgamma8 expression was dependent on CaMKIIalpha activity. Inhibition of CaMKIIalpha activity significantly reduced the hippocampal TARPgamma8 expression and CA3-CA1 LTP in young mice to a similar level to that of the aged mice. Furthermore, the knockdown of hippocampal TARPgamma8 impaired LTP and memory in young mice, which mimicked the aging-related changes. We confirmed the enhanced hippocampal VGCC (Cav-1.3) expression in aged mice and found that inhibition of VGCC activity largely increased both p-CaMKIIalpha and TARPgamma8 expression in aged mice, whereas inhibition of NMDAR or Calpains had no effect. In addition, we found that the exogenous expression of human TARPgamma8 in the hippocampus in aged mice restored LTP and memory function. Collectively, these results indicate that the synaptic and cognitive impairment in aging is associated with the downregulation of CaMKIIalpha-TARPgamma8 signaling caused by VGCC activation. Our results suggest that TARPgamma8 may be a key molecular biomarker for brain aging and that boosting CaMKIIalpha-TARPgamma8 signaling may be critical for the restoration of synaptic plasticity of aging and aging-related diseases.
