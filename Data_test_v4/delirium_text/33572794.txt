33572794|t|Laccase-Catalyzed 1,4-Dioxane-Mediated Synthesis of Belladine N-Oxides with Anti-Influenza A Virus Activity.
33572794|a|Belladine N-oxides active against influenza A virus have been synthetized by a novel laccase-catalyzed 1,4-dioxane-mediated oxidation of aromatic and side-chain modified belladine derivatives. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis confirmed the role of 1,4-dioxane as a co-oxidant. The reaction was chemo-selective, showing a high functional-group compatibility. The novel belladine N-oxides were active against influenza A virus, involving the early stage of the virus replication life cycle.
