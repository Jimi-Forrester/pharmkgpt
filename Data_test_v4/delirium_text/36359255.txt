36359255|t|A Strategy for Magnetic and Electric Stimulation to Enhance Proliferation and Differentiation of NPCs Seeded over PLA Electrospun Membranes.
36359255|a|Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) have been shown to serve as an efficient therapeutic strategy in different cell therapy approaches, including spinal cord injury treatment. Despite the reported beneficial effects of NPC transplantation, the low survival and differentiation rates constrain important limitations. Herein, a new methodology has been developed to overcome both limitations by applying a combination of wireless electrical and magnetic stimulation to NPCs seeded on aligned poly(lactic acid) nanofibrous scaffolds for in vitro cell conditioning prior transplantation. Two stimulation patterns were tested and compared, continuous (long stimulus applied once a day) and intermittent (short stimulus applied three times a day). The results show that applied continuous stimulation promotes NPC proliferation and preferential differentiation into oligodendrocytic and neuronal lineages. A neural-like phenotypic induction was observed when compared to unstimulated NPCs. In contrast, intermittent stimulation patterns did not affect NPC proliferation and differentiation to oligodendrocytes or astrocytes morphology with a detrimental effect on neuronal differentiation. This study provides a new approach of using a combination of electric and magnetic stimulation to induce proliferation and further neuronal differentiation, which would improve therapy outcomes in disorders such as spinal cord injury.
