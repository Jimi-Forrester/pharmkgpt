38295165|t|N-glycosylation as a eukaryotic protective mechanism against protein aggregation.
38295165|a|The tendency for proteins to form aggregates is an inherent part of every proteome and arises from the self-assembly of short protein segments called aggregation-prone regions (APRs). While posttranslational modifications (PTMs) have been implicated in modulating protein aggregation, their direct role in APRs remains poorly understood. In this study, we used a combination of proteome-wide computational analyses and biophysical techniques to investigate the potential involvement of PTMs in aggregation regulation. Our findings reveal that while most PTM types are disfavored near APRs, N-glycosylation is enriched and evolutionarily selected, especially in proteins prone to misfolding. Experimentally, we show that N-glycosylation inhibits the aggregation of peptides in vitro through steric hindrance. Moreover, mining existing proteomics data, we find that the loss of N-glycans at the flanks of APRs leads to specific protein aggregation in Neuro2a cells. Our findings indicate that, among its many molecular functions, N-glycosylation directly prevents protein aggregation in higher eukaryotes.
