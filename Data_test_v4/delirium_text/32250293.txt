32250293|t|Is Alzheimer's Disease a Liver Disease of the Brain?
32250293|a|Clinical specialization is not only a force for progress, but it has also led to the fragmentation of medical knowledge. The focus of research in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neurobiology, while hepatologists focus on liver diseases and lipid specialists on atherosclerosis. This article on AD focuses on the role of the liver and lipid homeostasis in the development of AD. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits accumulate as plaques in the brain of an AD patient long before cognitive decline is evident. Abeta generation is a normal physiological process; the steady-state level of Abeta in the brain is determined by balance between Abeta production and its clearance. We present evidence suggesting that the liver is the origin of brain Abeta deposits and that it is involved in peripheral clearance of circulating Abeta in the blood. Hence the liver could be targeted to decrease Abeta production or increase peripheral clearance.
