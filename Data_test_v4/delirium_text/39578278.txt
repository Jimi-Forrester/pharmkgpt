39578278|t|The Effect of Transplantation of Ensheathing Cells of the Olfactory Mucosa into the Hippocampal Area on the Restoration of Cognitive Abilities in Rats with Experimental Alzheimer's Disease.
39578278|a|Alzheimer's disease was induced in female Wistar rats by bilateral injection of beta-amyloid fragment 1-42 into the hippocampal region. After 8 weeks, ensheathing cells of the olfactory mucosa were transplanted into the hippocampus at the same stereotactic coordinates. These cells survived for 8 weeks; large clusters of cells were observed on week 4. On weeks 3-5 after transplantation of ensheathing cells, experimental animals demonstrated a significant cognitive improvement (memory and spatial orientation). The obtained results create prerequisites for further studies of ensheathing cells as a potential cell product for personalized therapy of Alzheimer's disease.
