38888453|t|Aggregation Mechanisms and Molecular Structures of Amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's Disease.
38888453|a|Amyloid plaques are a major pathological hallmark involved in Alzheimer's disease and consist of deposits of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). The aggregation process of Abeta is highly complex, which leads to polymorphous aggregates with different structures. In addition to aberrant aggregation, Abeta oligomers can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form dynamic condensates. It has been hypothesized that these amyloid liquid droplets affect and modulate amyloid fibril formation. In this review, we briefly introduce the relationship between stress granules and amyloid protein aggregation that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Then we highlight the regulatory role of LLPS in Abeta aggregation and discuss the potential relationship between Abeta phase transition and aggregation. Furthermore, we summarize the current structures of Abeta oligomers and amyloid fibrils, which have been determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The structural variations of Abeta aggregates provide an explanation for the different levels of toxicity, shed light on the aggregation mechanism and may pave the way towards structure-based drug design for both clinical diagnosis and treatment.
