36131074|t|Recipe for primary prevention of delirium in hospitalized older patients.
36131074|a|Delirium is an acute fluctuating syndrome characterized by a change in consciousness, perception, orientation, cognition, sleep-wake rhythm, psychomotor skills, and the mood and feelings of a patient. Delirium and delirium prevention remain a challenge for healthcare professionals, especially nurses who form the basis of patient care. It also causes distress for patients, their caregivers and healthcare professionals. However, delirium is preventable in 30-40% of cases. The aim of this article is to summarize the delirium risk models, delirium screening tools, and (non-pharmacological) delirium prevention strategies. A literature search of review articles supplemented by original articles published in PubMed, Cinahl, and Cochrane between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2020 was carried out. Among the older patients, delirium is a common condition with major consequences in terms of mortality and morbidity, but prevention is possible. Despite the fact that delirium risk models, delirium screening scales and non-pharmacological prevention are available for the development of a hospital delirium prevention programme, such a programme is still not commonly used on a daily basis.
