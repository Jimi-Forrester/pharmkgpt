33282257|a|The micronutrient adequacy of common fad diets is rarely assessed. We compared a high-fiber diet [HF] with a low-carbohydrate diet [LC] to assess their effects on body weight and micronutrient adequacy. One hundred and seventy-three adult males and females with or without diabetes with a mean body mass index of 36 kg/m2 were randomized to either a HF or LC diet. Differences in anthropometrics, blood lipids, glucose, blood pressure, and micronutrient consumption between groups were assessed after 52 weeks. Differences between groups a priori were assessed using independent t tests and chi-squared tests. Post hoc differences in nutrient consumption between groups while controlling for gender were assessed using factorial analysis of variance. After 52 weeks, LC dieters (n = 24) retained weight loss better than their HF counterparts (n = 30) (p = .06). LC dieters consumed more vitamin K (mcg) [HF = 124.0 +- 15.0; LC = 220.0 +- 39.1; p = .025] and vitamin B12 (mcg) [HF = 3.1 +- 0.3; LC = 4.1 +- 0.4; p = .026]. The HF group consumed more folate (mcg) [HF = 479.9 +- 34.0); LC = 333.8 +- 22.1; p < .001], magnesium (mg) [HF = 353.1 +- 17.4; LC = 281.1 +- 18.0; p < .001], and iron (mg) [HF = 14.6 +- 0.8; LC = 10.7 +- 0.6; p < .001. Both groups consumed less than the respective EAR for vitamins D and E and less than the AI for potassium. While a LC diet may be more effective for long-term weight loss, both diets were deficient in micronutrients.
