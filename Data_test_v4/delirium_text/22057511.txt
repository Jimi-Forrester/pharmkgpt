22057511|a|Dietary factors may play a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. In an effort to recapitulate some of the synaptic protein changes observed in the disease, AD transgenic and wild-type mice were fed either a normal or pro-oxidant diet for 3 months from three months of age. Pro-oxidant diet treatment resulted in altered expression of vesicular glutamate transporter-1 and glutamine synthetase, suggesting changes in glutamatergic synaptic function, and increased expression of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, possibly reflecting oxidative stress.
