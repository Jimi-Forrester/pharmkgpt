29152336|t|Structural characterization of two solvates of a luminescent copper(II) bis-(pyridine)-substituted benzimidazole complex.
29152336|a|Copper(II) complexes of benzimidazole are known to exhibit biological activity that makes them of inter-est for chemotherapeutic and other pharmaceutical uses. The complex bis-(acetato-kappaO){5,6-dimethyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1-[(pyridin-2-yl)meth-yl]-1H-benzimidazole-kappa2N2,N3}copper(II), has been prepared. The absorption spectrum has features attributed to intra-ligand and ligand-field transitions and the complex exhibits ligand-centered room-temperature luminescence in solution. The aceto-nitrile monosolvate, [Cu(C2H3O2)2(C20H18N4)] C2H3N (1), and the ethanol hemisolvate, [Cu(C2H3O2)2(C20H18N4)] 0.5C2H6O (2), have been structurally characterized. Compound 2 has two copper(II) complexes in the asymmetric unit. In both 1 and 2, distorted square-planar N2O2 coordination geometries are observed and the Cu-N(Im) bond distance is slightly shorter than the Cu-N(py) bond distance. Inter-molecular pi-pi inter-actions are found in 1 and 2. A weak C-H pi inter-action is observed in 1.
