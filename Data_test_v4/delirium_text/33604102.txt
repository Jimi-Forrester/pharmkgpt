33604102|t|Larotrectinib and Entrectinib: TRK Inhibitors for the Treatment of Pediatric and Adult Patients With NTRK Gene Fusion.
33604102|a|Two new targeted agents have been approved for pediatric and adult patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusion without an acquired resistance mutation. Larotrectinib and entrectinib are the second and third agents to be approved as tissue agnostic treatments, respectively. NTRK gene fusion is now a targetable biomarker for patients who may otherwise be devoid of satisfactory alternative treatment options. In this article, the safety and efficacy trials of each medication, and the initial and ongoing monitoring required for patients on these treatments will be discussed.
