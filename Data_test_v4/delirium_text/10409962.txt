10409962|t|The DIAL-log study 1: Profiling the experience of people with dementia.
10409962|a|Between July 1996 and December 1997 telephone helpline staff from the Alzheimer's Disease Society (ADS) in London, and six participating ADS regions in England and one in Northern Ireland, documented calls from people with dementia who contacted the service. Each call was recorded as soon as practicable after its completion on a Dementia Information and Advice Line (DIAL) log form (DIAL-log). Sixty-four calls were recorded in this way and 62 completed DIAL-logs were included in the study findings. Analysis of the data was undertaken via SPSS 6.1 for Windows. This article, the first of two, introduces the background to the study and notes that callers reported memory loss and forgetfulness as the most frequently noticed first signs of dementia. The study aims and limitations are also outlined in this first article. The second article will detail the main findings and the challenges that the DIAL-log study may provide for future dementia care practice and research.
