38948219|t|beta-asarone induces viability and angiogenesis and suppresses apoptosis of human vascular endothelial cells after ischemic stroke by upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor A.
38948219|a|Ischemic stroke (IS) is a disease with a high mortality and disability rate worldwide, and its incidence is increasing per year. Angiogenesis after IS improves blood supply to ischemic areas, accelerating neurological recovery. beta-asarone has been reported to exhibit a significant protective effect against hypoxia injury. The ability of beta-asarone to improve IS injury by inducing angiogenesis has not been distinctly clarified. The experimental rats were induced with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model cells were constructed using human microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC-1) cells. Cerebral infarction and pathological damage were first determined via triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Then, cell viability, apoptosis, and angiogenesis were assessed by utilizing cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry, spheroid-based angiogenesis, and tube formation assays in OGD HMEC-1 cells. Besides, angiogenesis and other related proteins were identified with western blot. The study confirms that beta-asarone, like nimodipine, can ameliorate cerebral infarction and pathological damage. beta-asarone can also upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and induce phosphorylation of p38. Besides, the study proves that beta-asarone can protect against IS injury by increasing the expression of VEGFA. In vitro experiments affirmed that beta-asarone can induce viability and suppress apoptosis in OGD-mediated HMEC-1 cells and promote angiogenesis of OGD HMEC-1 cells by upregulating VEGFA. This establishes the potential for beta-asarone to be a latent drug for IS therapy.
