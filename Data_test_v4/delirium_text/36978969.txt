36978969|t|Ability of a Polyphenol-Rich Nutraceutical to Reduce Central Nervous System Lipid Peroxidation by Analysis of Oxylipins in Urine: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.
36978969|a|Isoprostanes (IsoPs) are lipid peroxidation biomarkers that reveal the oxidative status of the organism without specifying which organs or tissues it occurs in. Similar compounds have recently been identified that can assess central nervous system (CNS) lipid peroxidation status, usually oxidated by reactive oxygen species. These compounds are the neuroprostanes (NeuroPs) derived from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the F2t-dihomo-isoprotanes derived from adrenic acid (AdA). The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate whether the long-term nutraceutical consumption of high polyphenolic contents (600 mg) from fruits (such as berries) and vegetables shows efficacy against CNS lipid peroxidation in urine biomarkers. A total of 92 subjects (47 females, 45 males, age 34 +- 11 years old, weight 73.10 +- 14.29 kg, height 1.72 +- 9 cm, body mass index (BMI) 24.40 +- 3.43 kg/m2) completed a randomized, cross-over, double-blind study after an intervention of two periods of 16 weeks consuming either extract (EXT) or placebo (PLA) separated by a 4-week washout period. The results showed significant reductions in three AdA-derived metabolites, namely, 17-epi-17-F2t-dihomo-IsoPs (Delta -1.65 ng/mL; p < 0.001), 17-F2t-dihomo-IsoPs (Delta -0.17 ng/mL; p < 0.015), and ent-7(RS)-7-F2t-dihomo-IsoPs (Delta -1.97 ng/mL; p < 0.001), and one DHA-derived metabolite, namely, 4-F4t-NeuroP (Delta -7.94 ng/mL; p < 0.001), after EXT consumption, which was not observed after PLA consumption. These data seem to show the effectiveness of the extract for preventing CNS lipid peroxidation, as determined by measurements of oxylipins in urine through Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ-ESI-MS/MS).
