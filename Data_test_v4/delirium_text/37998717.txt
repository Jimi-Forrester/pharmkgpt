37998717|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation are implicated in the pathogenesis of most neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In fact, although a growing number of studies show crosstalk between these two processes, there remain numerous gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms involved, which requires further clarification. On the one hand, mitochondrial dysfunction may lead to the release of mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs) which are recognized by microglial immune receptors and contribute to neuroinflammation progression. On the other hand, inflammatory molecules released by glial cells can influence and regulate mitochondrial function. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms may help identify biomarkers and molecular targets useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. This review of works published in recent years is focused on the description of the mitochondrial contribution to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, with particular attention to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and AD.
