39240640|a|Background: Post-diagnostic care for people with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) typically involves multiple professions and disjointed care pathways not specifically designed to aid VCI needs. Objective: Exploring perspectives of healthcare professionals on post-diagnostic care for people with VCI. Methods: We conducted a qualitative focus group study. We used purposive sampling to include healthcare professionals in different compositions of primary and secondary care professionals per focus group. Thematic saturation was reached after seven focus groups. Transcripts were iteratively coded and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Forty participants were included in seven focus groups (4-8 participants). Results showed knowledge and awareness of VCI as prerequisites for adequate post-diagnostic care, and for pre-diagnostic detection of people with VCI (theme 1). In light of perceived lack of differentiation between cognitive disorders, participants shared specific advice regarding post-diagnostic care for people with VCI and informal caregivers (theme 2). Participants thought current care for VCI was fragmented and recommended further integration of care and collaboration across settings (theme 3). Conclusions: People with VCI and their caregivers risk getting stuck in a "no man's land" between post-diagnostic care pathways; challenges lie in acknowledgement of VCI and associated symptoms, and alignment between healthcare professionals. Education about the symptoms and consequences of VCI, to healthcare professionals, people with VCI and caregivers, may increase awareness of VCI and thereby better target care. Specific attention for symptoms common in VCI could further tailor care and reduce caregiver burden. Integration could be enhanced by combining expertise of dementia and stroke/rehabilitation pathways.
