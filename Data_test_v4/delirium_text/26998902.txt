26998902|t|Enhanced Diabetes Susceptibility in Community Dwelling Han Elders Carrying the Apolipoprotein E 3/3 Genotype.

Such research is also lacking in the Han population. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between APOE genotype, diabetes, and plasma glucose and lipid levels. We included 243 community-dwelling elderly residents in this study. Participant APOE genotypes were assessed and were simultaneously tested for weight, height, blood glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, and high- and low-density lipoprotein. In addition, gender, age, years of education, cognitive function, and medical history was recorded. Subjects were divided into 3 groups based on APOE genotype: APOE epsilon2 group (epsilon2/epsilon2 and epsilon2/epsilon3), APOE epsilon3 group (epsilon3/epsilon3), and APOE epsilon4 group (epsilon2/epsilon4, epsilon3/epsilon4 and epsilon4/epsilon4). Comparisons between groups were conducted for the incidence of diabetes, high blood pressure, and dementia, as well as for differences in body-mass index, fasting plasma glucose, and blood lipids. The APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype exhibited the highest frequency (70.4%) among the subjects. Participants in the APOE epsilon3 group demonstrated significantly higher levels of fasting plasma glucose than those in the APOE epsilon2 and APOE epsilon4 groups (P<0.05). The APOE epsilon3 group had slightly higher abnormal fasting plasma glucose values than did the APOE epsilon2 group (P = 0.065). Furthermore, the APOE3 genotype was significantly correlated with both fasting plasma glucose level and glucose abnormality (P< 0.05) and trended toward statistically significant correlation with diabetes (P = 0.082). The correlation between APOE2 and low low-density lipoprotein levels also approached statistical significance (P = 0.052). Thus, elderly community dwelling residents of Han ethnicity carrying the APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype might have higher plasma glucose levels and a higher occurrence of diabetes.
