34867367|t|Intranasal Delivery of Nerve Growth Factor in Neurodegenerative Diseases and Neurotrauma.
34867367|a|Since the 1980s, the development of a pharmacology based on nerve growth factor (NGF) has been postulated for the therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This hypothesis was based on the rescuing effect of the neurotrophin on the cholinergic phenotype of the basal forebrain neurons, primarily compromised during the development of AD. Subsequently, the use of NGF was put forward to treat a broader spectrum of neurological conditions affecting the central nervous system, such as Parkinson's disease, degenerative retinopathies, severe brain traumas and neurodevelopmental dysfunctions. While supported by solid rational assumptions, the progress of a pharmacology founded on these hypotheses has been hampered by the difficulty of conveying NGF towards the brain parenchyma without resorting to invasive and risky delivery methods. At the end of the last century, it was shown that NGF administered intranasally to the olfactory epithelium was able to spread into the brain parenchyma. Notably, after such delivery, pharmacologically relevant concentration of exogenous NGF was found in brain areas located at considerable distances from the injection site along the rostral-caudal axis. These observations paved the way for preclinical characterization and clinical trials on the efficacy of intranasal NGF for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and of the consequences of brain trauma. In this review, a summary of the preclinical and clinical studies published to date will be attempted, as well as a discussion about the mechanisms underlying the efficacy and the possible development of the pharmacology based on intranasal conveyance of NGF to the brain.
