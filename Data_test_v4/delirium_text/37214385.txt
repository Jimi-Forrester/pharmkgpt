37214385|a|Lots of studies have been carried out on characteristic of epileptic Electroencephalograph (EEG). However, traditional EEG characteristic research methods lack exploration of spatial information. To study the characteristics of epileptic EEG signals from the perspective of the whole brain,this paper proposed combination methods of multi-channel characteristics from time-frequency and spatial domains. This paper was from two aspects: Firstly, signals were converted into 2D Hilbert Spectrum (HS) images which reflected the time-frequency characteristics by Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). These images were identified by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model whose sensitivity was 99.8%, accuracy was 98.7%, specificity was 97.4%, F1-score was 98.7%, and AUC-ROC was 99.9%. Secondly, the multi-channel signals were converted into brain networks which reflected the spatial characteristics by Symbolic Transfer Entropy (STE) among different channels EEG. And the results show that there are different network properties between ictal and interictal phase and the signals during the ictal enter the synchronization state more quickly, which was verified by Kuramoto model. To summarize, our results show that there was different characteristics among channels for the ictal and interictal phase, which can provide effective physical non-invasive indicators for the identification and prediction of epileptic seizures.
