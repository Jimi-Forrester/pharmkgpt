37932838|a|In recent years, the role of nobiletin in neuronal disorders has received extensive attention. However, the study of nobiletin in the peripheral nervous system is limited. Nobiletin, as a compound with high fat solubility, high bioavailability and low toxicity, has been extensively studied. Accumulating scientific evidence has shown that nobiletin has a variety of biological functions in the nervous system, such as inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors, reducing the neurotoxic response, improving the antioxidant capacity, promoting the survival of nerve cells, promoting axon growth, reducing blood-brain barrier permeability, reducing brain oedema, promoting cAMP response element binding protein expression, improving memory, and promoting mild depolarization of nerve cell mitochondria to improve antioxidative stress capacity. Accumulating studies have shown that nobiletin also protects enteric nervous system, spinal cord and sciatic nerve. To explore the new therapeutic potential of nobiletin in the nervous system, recent and relevant research progress is reviewed in this article. This will provide a new research idea for nobiletin in the nervous system.
