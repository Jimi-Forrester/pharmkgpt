33096730|t|Studying the Relationship of Intermittent Fasting and beta-Amyloid in Animal Model of Alzheimer's Disease: A Scoping Review.
33096730|a|We examined the evidence for intermittent fasting (IF) as a preventative tool to influence beta-amyloid in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A Scopus, Ovid, PubMed, and Web of Science (WoS), search yielded 29 results using the keywords "amyloid beta", "intermittent fasting", "intermittent caloric restriction", "alternate day fasting", "modified alternate-day fasting", "time-restricted feeding", "Ramadan fast", "intermittent calori* restriction", "intermittent restrictive diet", and "Alzheimer*". Five research articles addressed directly the effects of intermittent fasting on beta-amyloid levels in animal models of AD: alternate day fasting (ADF) and time-restricted feeding (TRF) methods were incorporated in these studies. The study designs were found to be heterogeneous. Variations in the levels of beta-amyloid peptides or plaque in either the hippocampus, cortical areas, or both in animals following dietary intervention were observed as compared to the ad libitum group. Non-significant changes were observed in three studies, while two studies interestingly demonstrated amelioration and reduction in beta-amyloid levels. Given the conflicting results obtained from this study, significant care has to be taken into consideration before the protocol can be applied as a preventative approach to treat Alzheimer's disease. Longitudinal research is warranted to fully grasp how dietary habits can help alleviate the disease either through upstream or downstream of AD pathology.
