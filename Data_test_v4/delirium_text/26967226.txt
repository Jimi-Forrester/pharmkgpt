26967226|a|The evidence of strong pathological associations between type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has increased in recent years. Contrary to suggestions that anti-diabetes drugs may have potential for treating AD, we demonstrate here that the insulin sensitizing anti-diabetes drug metformin (Glucophage ) increased the generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta), one of the major pathological hallmarks of AD, by promoting beta- and gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, we show that metformin caused autophagosome accumulation in Tg6799 AD model mice. Extremely high gamma-secretase activity was also detected in autophagic vacuoles, apparently a novel site of Abeta peptide generation. Together, these data suggest that metformin-induced accumulation of autophagosomes resulted in increased gamma-secretase activity and Abeta generation. Additional experiments indicated that metformin increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which activates autophagy by suppressing mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The suppression of mTOR then induces the abnormal accumulation of autophagosomes. We conclude that metformin, an anti-diabetes drug, may exacerbate AD pathogenesis by promoting amyloidogenic AbetaPP processing in autophagosomes.
