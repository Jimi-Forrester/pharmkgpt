33754109|t|IgLON 5 Antibody Syndrome: Isolated Case of a Patient With Indolent Disease Progression and Unusual MRI Findings.
33754109|a|IgLON-5 antibody syndrome has a myriad of clinical presentations, including gait instability, movement disorders, abnormal eye movements, bulbar symptoms, sleep disorders, neuropsychiatric symptoms, dysautonomia, and peripheral neuropathy. Abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings have also been reported such as leukoariotic changes and cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. We present a case of IgLON-5 antibody syndrome with a unique MRI finding of persistent leptomeningeal enhancement. A close follow-up would be warranted as the progression of the disease may be indolent.
