39369728|a|People with intellectual disability are a vulnerable cohort who face challenges accessing health care. Compared with the general population, people with intellectual disability have an elevated risk of developing dementia, which often presents at a younger age and with atypical symptoms. The lifelong cognitive and functional difficulties faced by people with intellectual disability further complicate the diagnostic process. Specialised intellectual disability memory services and evaluation using reliable biomarkers of neurodegeneration are needed to improve diagnostic and prognostic certainty in this group. Inadequate specialist services and paucity of research on biomarkers in this population hinders progress and impedes the delivery of adequate health care. Although cerebrospinal fluid-based biomarkers and radiological biomarkers are used routinely in the evaluation of Alzheimer's disease in the general population, biological variation within the clinically heterogenous group of people with intellectual disability could affect the clinical utility of existing biomarkers. As disease-modifying therapies become available for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease, and hopefully other neurodegenerative conditions in the future, biomarkers will serve as gatekeepers to establish the eligibility for such therapies. Inadequate representation of adults with intellectual disability in biomarker research will result in their exclusion from treatment with disease-modifying therapies, thus perpetuating the inequity in health care that is already faced by this group. The aim of this Series paper is to summarise current evidence on the application of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in a population with intellectual disability (that is not attributable to Down syndrome) and suspected cognitive decline.
