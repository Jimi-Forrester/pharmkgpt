25108625|t|Molecular mechanism of intramembrane proteolysis by gamma-secretase.
25108625|a|Presenilin is a membrane-embedded intramembrane-cleaving protease with a conserved catalytic GxGD motif. It is the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase, which plays critical roles in developmental biology and the molecular etiology of Alzheimer disease, together with three membrane protein cofactors, nicastrin, Aph-1 and Pen-2. Biochemical and enzymatic analyses have revealed that gamma-secretase executes two types of proteolytic activities on a single substrate; an endopeptidase-like cleavage followed by carboxypeptidase-like processive cleavage. Utilizing small molecule inhibitors/modulators together with the substituted cysteine accessibility method, we identified certain residues and regions of presenilin that contribute to the formation of a catalytic pore structure within the lipid bilayer required for its intramembrane-cleaving activity. Recently, determination of the crystal structure of the archaeal presenilin homologue has confirmed the intramembranous location of the two conserved and essential aspartates. In this review, I will introduce the recent progresses in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of this atypical protease.
