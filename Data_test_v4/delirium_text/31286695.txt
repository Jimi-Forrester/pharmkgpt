31286695|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the novel model-based hemodynamic physiomarker of Dynamic Vasomotor Reactivity (DVR) with biomarkers based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and some widely used neurocognitive scores in terms of their ability to delineate patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) from age-matched cognitively normal controls. MATERIALS & METHODS: The model-based DVR and MRI-based DTI markers were obtained from 36 patients with amnestic MCI and 16 age-matched controls without cognitive impairment, for whom widely used neurocognitive scores were available. These markers and scores were subsequently compared in terms of statistical delineation between patients and controls. RESULTS: It was found that statistically significant delineation between MCI patients and controls was comparable for DVR or DTI markers (p < 0.01). The performance of both types of markers was consistent with the scores of some (but not all) widely used neurocognitive tests. CONCLUSION: Since DTI offers a measure of cerebral white matter integrity, the results suggest that the model-based hemodynamic marker of DVR may correlate with cognitive impairment due to white matter lesions. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that dysregulation of cerebral microcirculation may be an early cause of cognitive impairment, which has been recently corroborated by several studies.
