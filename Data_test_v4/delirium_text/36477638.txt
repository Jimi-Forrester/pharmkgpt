36477638|a|Vaccines are one of the most effective medical interventions to combat newly emerging and re-emerging diseases. Prophylactic vaccines against rabies, measles, etc., have excellent effectiveness in preventing viral infection and associated diseases. However, the host immune response is unable to inhibit virus replication or eradicate established diseases in most infected people. Therapeutic vaccines, expressing specific endogenous or exogenous antigens, mainly induce or boost cell-mediated immunity via provoking cytotoxic T cells or elicit humoral immunity via activating B cells to produce specific antibodies. The ultimate aim of a therapeutic vaccine is to reshape the host immunity for eradicating a disease and establishing lasting memory. Therefore, therapeutic vaccines have been developed for the treatment of some infectious diseases and chronic noncommunicable diseases. Various technological strategies have been implemented for the development of therapeutic vaccines, including molecular-based vaccines (peptide/protein, DNA and mRNA vaccines), vector-based vaccines (bacterial vector vaccines, viral vector vaccines and yeast-based vaccines) and cell-based vaccines (dendritic cell vaccines and genetically modified cell vaccines) as well as combinatorial approaches. This review mainly summarizes therapeutic vaccine-induced immunity and describes the development and status of multiple types of therapeutic vaccines against infectious diseases, such as those caused by HPV, HBV, HIV, HCV, and SARS-CoV-2, and chronic noncommunicable diseases, including cancer, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, that have been evaluated in recent preclinical and clinical studies.
