39544867|t|Evaluation of Mortality Statistics in Turkey from 2017 to 2022: An Analysis of the Impact of COVID-19.
39544867|a|Background: Examining death statistics at regular intervals is highly useful for assessing public health. This study aimed to analyze cause-specific mortality statistics, to ascertain their distribution over the years, and to offer remedial solutions to enhance public health outcomes. Methods: In this retrospective descriptive study, an analysis was conducted on data sourced from the "Death and Cause of Death Statistics" provided by the Turkish Statistical Institute between 2017 and 2022. Results: While the crude mortality rate remained stable from 2017 to 2019, a discernible increase in mortality rates has been observed since 2020, attributed to the impact of the pandemic. The crude death rate was the highest in the <5 yr and >=65 yr age groups. Approximately 70% of the total mortality cases in Turkey were attributed to cardiovascular diseases, cancers, respiratory diseases, and diabetes. Conclusion: Given the world's rapidly aging population, an increase in deaths related to the four major noncommunicable diseases is foreseen. Therefore, there is an imperative need to enhance efforts aimed at preventing and controlling these diseases.
