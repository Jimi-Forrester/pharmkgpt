24072068|a|BACKGROUND: A promising approach for treating Alzheimer's disease relies on the net efflux of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide from the brain to peripheral plasma, as a result of plasma Abeta clearance promoted by plasma removal and therapeutic albumin replacement. OBJECTIVE: To assess the binding of therapeutic albumin (Albutein, Grifols) to monomeric and aggregated Abeta according to methods previously tested on the interactions between Abeta and research-grade albumin. METHODS: Albumin integrity and the interactions with albumin stabilizers (octanoic acid and N-Ac-Trp) were assessed through one-dimensional (1D) 1H-NMR and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectra. The interactions between monomeric Abeta1-40 and albumin were probed by 2D 1H-15 N HSQC spectra of labeled Abeta1-40. The formation of cross-beta structured Abeta1-42 assemblies was monitored by ThT fluorescence. The interactions between self-assembled Abeta1-42 and albumin were probed by Trp fluorescence. RESULTS: NMR spectra indicated that both therapeutic and research-grade albumin are similarly well-folded proteins. No significant changes in either HSQC peak position or intensity were observed upon addition of albumin to 15N-labeled Abeta1-40, which rules out binding of albumin to monomeric Abeta with dissociation constant in the muM or lower range. When aggregated Abeta1-42 was added to albumin, quenching of Trp fluorescence was observed, which indicates albumin binding to Abeta1-42 aggregates. The relative potency of therapeutic albumin as an Abeta self-association inhibitor was in the same order of magnitude as research-grade albumin. CONCLUSIONS: Albutein inhibited Abeta self-association by selectively binding Abeta aggregates rather than monomers and by preventing further growth of the Abeta assemblies.
