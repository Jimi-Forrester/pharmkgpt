38611869|t|Recent Advances in the Synthesis of the Marine-Derived Alkaloid Fascaplysin and Its Metabolites Homofascaplysins A-C.
38611869|a|The fascaplysin and homofascaplysin class of marine natural products has a characteristic 12H-pyrido[1,2-a:3,4-b']diindole pentacyclic structure. Fascaplysin was isolated in 1988 from the marine sponge Fascaplysinopsis bergquist sp. The analogs of fascaplysin, such as homofascaplysins A, B, and C, were discovered late in the Fijian sponge F. reticulate, and also have potent antimicrobial activity and strong cytotoxicity against L-1210 mouse leukemia. In this review, the total synthesis of fascaplysin and its analogs, such as homofascaplysins A, B, and C, will be reviewed, which will offer useful information for medicinal chemistry researchers who are interested in the exploration of marine alkaloids.
