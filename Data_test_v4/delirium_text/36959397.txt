36959397|t|Phase angle and COVID-19: A systematic review with meta-analysis.
36959397|a|Phase angle (PhA) has been identified as a poor prognostic factor in patients with COVID-19. This study aimed to achieve a systematic review, where we discussed the potential role of PhA value as a prognostic marker of adverse clinical outcomes such as mortality and complication in hospitalized with SARS-CoV2 infection and established the strength of recommendations for use. A systematic literature review with meta-analysis was done in the main electronic databases from 2020 to January 2023. The selected articles had to investigate adverse consequences of the COVID-19 population and raw bioimpedance parameters such as PhA and published in peer-reviewed journals. GRADE tools regarded the quality of the methodology. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO. Only eight studies, 483 studies, were eligible for the analysis. In general, differences in PhA were seen between the comparative study groups. Patients with a low PhA experienced poor outcomes. A low PhA was associated with a significantly increased mortality risk [RR: 2.44; 95% CI (1.20-4.99), p = 0.01; I2 = 79% (p = 0.0008)] and higher complications risk [OR: 3.47, 95% CI (1.16 - 10.37), p = 0.03; I2 = 82% (p = 0.004)] in COVID-19 patients. Our analysis showed four evidence-based recommendations on the prognostic value of PhA with two strong recommendations, one of moderate and another of low-moderate quality, for predicting mortality and complications, respectively. We recommend using PhA as a prognostic marker for mortality and complications in this population. Although the results are promising, future studies must identify the PhA cut-off to guide therapeutic decisions more precisely.Registration code in PROSPERO: CRD42023391044.
