37822517|a|After spinal cord injury (SCI), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been reported to be an integral part of the secondary injury process that causes apoptosis of glial cells, leading to remyelination failure. This report focuses on exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist widely used to treat diabetes, as a potential agent to improve functional outcome after SCI by improving the ER stress response. Exenatide administered subcutaneously immediately after injury and 7 days later in a rat model of moderate contusive SCI revealed significant improvement in hindlimb function without any hypoglycemia. Changes in the expression of glucose regulatory protein 78 (GRP78), an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone that protects against ER stress, and C/EBP homologous transcription factor protein (CHOP), a pro-apoptotic transcription factor in the apoptosis pathway were examined as indices of ER stress. We found that administration of exenatide after SCI suppressed CHOP while increasing GRP78 in the injured spinal cord, leading to a significant decrease in tissue damage and a significant increase in oligodendrocyte progenitor cell survival. This study suggests that administration of exenatide after SCI decreases ER stress and improves functional recovery without any apparent side-effects.
