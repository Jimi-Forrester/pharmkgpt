37525031|t|Protein Structure Prediction for Disease-Related Insertions/Deletions in Presenilin 1 Gene.
37525031|a|More than 450 mutations, some of which have unknown toxicity, have been reported in the presenilin 1 gene, which is the most common cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with an early onset. PSEN1 mutations are thought to be responsible for approximately 80% of cases of monogenic AD, which are characterized by complete penetrance and an early age of onset. It is still unknown exactly how mutations in the presenilin 1 gene can cause dementia and neurodegeneration; however, both conditions have been linked to these changes. In this chapter, well-known computational analysis servers and accessible databases such as Uniprot, iTASSER, and PDBeFold are examined for their ability to predict the functional domains of mutant proteins and quantify the effect that these mutations have on the three-dimensional structure of the protein.
