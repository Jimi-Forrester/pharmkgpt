15726239|a|Hypoglycemia represents the most frequent endocrinologic emergency situation in prehospital patient care. As the patients are usually unconscious on arrival of emergency medical personnel, often the only way to establish a diagnosis is by determination of the blood glucose concentration. However, even normoglycemic or hyperglycemic levels cannot definitively exclude the diagnosis of a previous hypoglycemia as the cause of the acute cerebral deficiency. Therefore, and especially in the case of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, a differential diagnosis should be considered. We report a case of emergency treatment of a hypoglycemic episode in a female patient with prolonged neuroglycopenia together with cerebrovascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
