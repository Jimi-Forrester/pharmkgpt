33374972|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the deposition of specific protein aggregates, both intracellularly and/or extracellularly, depending on the type of disease. The extracellular occurrence of tridimensional structures formed by amyloidogenic proteins defines Alzheimer's disease, in which plaques are composed of amyloid beta-protein, while in prionoses, the same term "amyloid" refers to the amyloid prion protein. In this review, we focused on providing a detailed didactic description and differentiation of diffuse, neuritic, and burnt-out plaques found in Alzheimer's disease and kuru-like, florid, multicentric, and neuritic plaques in human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, followed by a systematic classification of the morphological similarities and differences between the extracellular amyloid deposits in these disorders. Both conditions are accompanied by the extracellular deposits that share certain signs, including neuritic degeneration, suggesting a particular role for amyloid protein toxicity.
