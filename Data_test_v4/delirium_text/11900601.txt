11900601|a|Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) plays a crucial role in central dopaminergic systems. The allelic association of a functional polymorphism of the COMT gene with the onset, course and clinical characteristics of alcoholism in 91 male Japanese alcoholics and 114 male Japanese controls was examined. There were no statistically significant differences in the frequency of the allele between the alcoholics and the controls. Visual disturbances and auditory disturbances among alcoholic withdrawal symptoms were, however, significantly different among the three groups (p < 0.05). The present results suggest that COMT activity could partially effect the phenotype of alcoholism, especially the appearance of delirium tremens, in these subjects.
