8875116|a|A comparative study of the levels of acid-stable proteinase inhibitors (kallikrein and trypsin inhibitors) in the urine of healthy and Alzheimer subjects, of both sexes, has been performed. A preliminary characterization of the purified inhibitors indicates that the urinary antitryptic activity is accounted for by the presence of the well known Urinary Trypsin Inhibitor (UTI) while an apparently new molecule appears to be responsible for the antikallikrein activity. The urinary levels of kallikrein inhibitors are very similar in healthy and sick subjects while the levels of trypsin inhibitors appear significatively increased in Alzheimer subjects of both sexes. The data presented here support the hypothesis that unpaired proteolytic processes could be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and suggest that the levels of urinary acid-stable inhibitors may prove to be useful markers of the disease.
