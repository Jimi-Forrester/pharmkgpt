39249626|a|The present real-world analysis aimed to evaluate and describe the use of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) for alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) in hospitalized patients with diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. An 11-year observational retrospective study on patients affected by liver cirrhosis and alcohol use disorder (AUD) was performed using data from the Medical Toxicology Unit of Careggi University Hospital in Florence (Italy). A multivariate logistic regression was performed to estimate the probability of having a CIWA-Ar Max 3-4 during hospitalization, an AWS length  > 36 h, a hospitalization > 9 days, and the probability of developing drowsiness. A total of 166 AUD patients were included, of these 77 received GHB (70.13% within the first day of hospitalization) and 89 were treated without GHB. The majority were  >= 40 years of age (87.35%) and males (80.12%). GHB patients were more likely to have a CIWA-Ar Max 3-4 during hospitalization (OR 3.76 [CI 95% 1.02-13.85]), and a longer hospitalization (OR 3.08 [95% CI 1.23-7.71]). Early GHB administration decreased the probability of CIWA-Ar Max worsening (OR 0.06 [95% CI 0.01-0.49]). GHB dose  >= 100 mg/kg was not associated with the occurrence of drowsiness. Patients exposed to other sedative agents were more likely to experience drowsiness (OR 7.22 [95% CI 1.46-35.61]). The present real-world analysis underlines that GHB could be a valuable and safe option for the management of AWS in AUD patients affected by liver cirrhosis, also when administered early and even at higher than recommended dosages.
