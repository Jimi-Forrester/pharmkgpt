37753023|t|The Association of Preoperative Trail Making Tests With Postoperative Delirium.
37753023|a|Aims The aim of the present study was to investigate the preoperative Trail Making Test (TMT) and its association with postoperative delirium. Materials and methods This cross-sectional, observational study consisted of 51 patients admitted to the surgical ward for any planned operative procedure. Consenting patients provided their sociodemographic information, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test, and Trail Making Test (TMT) were applied. Results A total of 51 patients (66.7% male and 33.3% female) were categorized as the "normal" group (n=34), completing TMT in time, and the "slow" group (n=17). The mean age was 45.05 +- 13.69 for the normal group and 44.29 +- 10.95 for the slow group. The HADS score mean was 15.02 +- 9.52 and 11.64 +- 5.73, respectively, for these two groups (t = -1.577; degrees of freedom {df} = 47.11; p = 0.121). However, the "normal" group scored significantly higher MoCA scores in comparison to the slow group (26.35 +- 1.06 and 24.29 +- 1.10, respectively) (t = -6.410; df = 49; p = 0.000). Conclusions The study shows that the TMT can indicate effectively the cognitive decline in preoperative patients, which predicts postoperative delirium.
