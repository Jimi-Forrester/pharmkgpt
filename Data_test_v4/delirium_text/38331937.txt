38331937|a|Changes in high-affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are intricately connected to neuropathology in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Protective and cognitive-enhancing roles for the nicotinic alpha5 subunit have been identified, but this gene has not been closely examined in the context of human aging and dementia. Therefore, we investigate the nicotinic alpha5 gene CHRNA5 and the impact of relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in prefrontal cortex from 922 individuals with matched genotypic and post-mortem RNA sequencing in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP). We find that a genotype robustly linked to increased expression of CHRNA5 (rs1979905A2) predicts significantly reduced cortical beta-amyloid load. Intriguingly, co-expression analysis suggests CHRNA5 has a distinct cellular expression profile compared to other nicotinic receptor genes. Consistent with this prediction, single nucleus RNA sequencing from 22 individuals reveals CHRNA5 expression is disproportionately elevated in chandelier neurons, a distinct subtype of inhibitory neuron known for its role in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. We show that chandelier neurons are enriched in amyloid-binding proteins compared to basket cells, the other major subtype of PVALB-positive interneurons. Consistent with the hypothesis that nicotinic receptors in chandelier cells normally protect against beta-amyloid, cell-type proportion analysis from 549 individuals reveals these neurons show amyloid-associated vulnerability only in individuals with impaired function/trafficking of nicotinic alpha5-containing receptors due to homozygosity of the missense CHRNA5 SNP (rs16969968A2). Taken together, these findings suggest that CHRNA5 and its nicotinic alpha5 subunit exert a neuroprotective role in aging and Alzheimer's disease centered on chandelier interneurons.
