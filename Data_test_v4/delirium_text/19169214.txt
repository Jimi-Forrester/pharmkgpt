19169214|t|Ekbom syndrome: a disease between dermatology and psychiatry.
19169214|a|The Ekbom syndrome or parasitosis delirium represents a rare mono-symptomatic psychosis characterized by the delirious firm belief of the patient, against all evidence, of being infested by cutaneous parasites. The syndrome affects in particular middle-aged women, and can be the single manifestation of psychological uneasiness or represent one of the aspects of a more complex psychiatric case, compromising almost totally any normal daily work and/or social activity. The authors present a recently observed clinical case and discuss the clinical-diagnostic and therapeutic aspects.
