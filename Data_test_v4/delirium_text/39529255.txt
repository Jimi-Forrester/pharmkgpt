39529255|a|BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that droplet degeneration (DD) signifies the beginning of neuritic plaque formation during Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. As microglia associated with neuritic plaques exhibited strong ferritin expression and Perl's iron staining showed iron in microglia, droplet spheres and neuritic plaque cores, we hypothesized that DD is a form of ferroptosis. OBJECTIVE: Detection of molecular markers of ferroptosis in AD brains. METHODS: Immunohistochemical detection of transferrin receptor (TfR) and ferritin as ferroptosis markers in prefrontal cortex of AD brains, investigation of spatial correlation of these with histopathological hallmarks of AD, visualization of ferroptotic marker genes by in situ hybridization, comparison of expression of ferroptosis genes with snRNAseq analyses and comparison of TfR and ferritin expression in different neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stages. RESULTS: TfR was found on neurons that appeared to be degenerating and exhibited typical features of droplet degeneration. Co-localization with hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) was a rare event. TfR-positive neurons increased with higher NFT stages as did ferritin expression in microglia. mRNA of genes linked to ferroptosis was detected in pretangles and p-tau negative neurons, less in DD. snRNAseq analyses support a link between AD, ferroptosis and TfR as a ferroptosis marker. CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of TfR and ferritin in high NFT stages, demonstration of ferroptotic marker genes in Alzheimer's lesions, as well as snRNAseq analyses strengthen our hypothesis that DD represents ferroptosis. Because of the morphological similarity between TfR-positive structures and DD, TfR might be an early ferroptosis marker expressed transiently during AD pathogenesis.
