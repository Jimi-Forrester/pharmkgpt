33854931|a|INTRODUCTION: Opium addiction has been recently suggested as a potential risk factor for the occurrence of perioperative complications in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether opium addiction can potentially affect patients' short-term postoperative outcomes after CABG surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a prospective observational cohort study, all consecutive patients who were scheduled for first-time isolated elective on pump CABG surgery were screened during the study period for opium addiction. The study was carried out between September 2015 and November 2016 at Mazandaran Heart Center, Sari, Iran. A total number of 228 patients [110 opium addicted (OA) and 118 non-addicted (NA)] were screened and included. All patients were evaluate, in terms of short-term postoperative outcomes, until hospital discharge or death. RESULTS: In the OA patients, the mean amount of estimated postoperative bleeding was significantly more than NA patients (535 +- 304.75 ml vs. 463.56 +- 209.77; P = 0.04). Mean ventilation time were significantly longer in the OA patients than in the NA (9.9 days vs. 8.66 days, P = 0.02). The mean duration of postoperative hospital stay was two days longer in the OA (10.83 days vs. 8.34 days, P < 0.001). Also, the mean use of packed cell during surgery and incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation were higher in the OA patients than NA (P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: The results of our study provide strong evidence that the opium addiction should be considered as a risk factors for developing perioperative complications, including higher mean postoperative bleeding, need for intraoperative packed red blood cell transfusion, ventilation time and length of hospital stay, in patients undergoing CABG surgery.
