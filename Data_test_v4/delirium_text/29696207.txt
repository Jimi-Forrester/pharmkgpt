OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to compare the effect of Methylcobalamin and Ascorbic Acid on Cognitive Function in post-menopausal women. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind trial was conducted in postmenopausal women with mild to moderate cognitive dysfunction. Eligible 56 subjects were randomized, the effect of ascorbic acid (500 mg OD) and methylcobalamin (50 mcg OD) was compared after 12 weeks of treatment. MMSE Questionnaire was used to assess the cognitive function, and beta-amyloid42 was estimated in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: In MMSE score, delayed verbal recall (P = 0.027), naming (P = 0.042) and repetition (P = 0.031) scores were significantly improved in ascorbic acid group when compared to baseline. The beta-amyloid42 level was decreased significantly in subjects receiving ascorbic acid (P = 0.04) when compared to Methylcobalamin group (P = 0.31). The inverse relationship between beta-amyloid42 levels and the MMSE score was found in ascorbic acid treatment (r = 0.6324, P = 0.0004). CONCLUSION: Based on MMSE and beta-amyloid42 results, ascorbic acid showed improvement in cognitive function among post-menopausal women when compared to methylcobalamin supplement.
