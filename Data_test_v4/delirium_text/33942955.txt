33942955|t|Electrophilic Aminating Agents in Total Synthesis.
33942955|a|Classical amination methods involve the reaction of a nitrogen nucleophile with an electrophilic carbon center; however, in recent years, umpoled strategies have gained traction where the nitrogen source acts as an electrophile. A wide range of electrophilic aminating agents are now available, and these underpin a range of powerful C-N bond-forming processes. In this Review, we highlight the strategic use of electrophilic aminating agents in total synthesis.
