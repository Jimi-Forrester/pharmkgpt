34924935|t|Synthesis and Evaluation of a Fluorine-18 Radioligand for Imaging Huntingtin Aggregates by Positron Emission Tomographic Imaging.
34924935|a|Mutations in the huntingtin gene (HTT) triggers aggregation of huntingtin protein (mHTT), which is the hallmark pathology of neurodegenerative Huntington's disease (HD). Development of a high affinity 18F radiotracer would enable the study of Huntington's disease pathology using a non-invasive imaging modality, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Herein, we report the first synthesis of fluorine-18 imaging agent, 6-(5-((5-(2,2-difluoro-2-(fluoro-18F)ethoxy)pyridin-2-yl)methoxy)benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-2-methylpyridazin-3(2H)-one ([18F]1), a radioligand for HD and its preclinical evaluation in vitro (autoradiography of post-mortem HD brains) and in vivo (rodent and non-human primate brain PET). [18F]1 was synthesized in a 4.1% RCY (decay corrected) and in an average molar activity of 16.5 +- 12.5 GBq/mumol (445 +- 339 Ci/mmol). [18F]1 penetrated the blood-brain barrier of both rodents and primates, and specific saturable binding in post-mortem brain slices was observed that correlated to mHTT aggregates identified by immunohistochemistry.
