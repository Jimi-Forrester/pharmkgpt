34901706|t|The molecular view of mechanical stress of brain cells, local translation, and neurodegenerative diseases.
34901706|a|The assumption that chronic mechanical stress in brain cells stemming from intracranial hypertension, arterial hypertension, or mechanical injury is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases was put forward in the 1990s and has since been supported. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the way from cell exposure to mechanical stress to disturbances in synaptic plasticity followed by changes in behavior, cognition, and memory are still poorly understood. Here we review (1) the current knowledge of molecular mechanisms regulating local translation and the actin cytoskeleton state at an activated synapse, where they play a key role in the formation of various sorts of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory, and (2) possible pathways of mechanical stress intervention. The roles of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway; the RNA-binding FMRP protein; the CYFIP1 protein, interacting with FMRP; the family of small GTPases; and the WAVE regulatory complex in the regulation of translation initiation and actin cytoskeleton rearrangements in dendritic spines of the activated synapse are discussed. Evidence is provided that chronic mechanical stress may result in aberrant activation of mTOR signaling and the WAVE regulatory complex via the YAP/TAZ system, the key sensor of mechanical signals, and influence the associated pathways regulating the formation of F actin filaments and the dendritic spine structure. These consequences may be a risk factor for various neurological conditions, including autistic spectrum disorders and epileptic encephalopathy. In further consideration of the role of the local translation system in the development of neuropsychic and neurodegenerative diseases, an original hypothesis was put forward that one of the possible causes of synaptopathies is impaired proteome stability associated with mTOR hyperactivity and formation of complex dynamic modes of de novo protein synthesis in response to synapse-stimulating factors, including chronic mechanical stress.
