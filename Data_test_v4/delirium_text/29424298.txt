29424298|t|Flavonoids in the Treatment of Alzheimer's and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases.
29424298|a|Flavonoids are phytochemicals present in almost all terrestrial plants and, as a consequence, in plant-based foods, and thus consumed by humans through diet. Recent evidences suggest that several flavonoids have positive effects against dementia and Alzheimer's disease, reversing age-related declines in neurocognitive performances. In this review, we provide a general classification of natural and synthetic flavonoids, a description of their physico-chemical properties, in particular their redox properties and stability, and an extensive overview about their biological activities and structure-activity relationship in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, a section will be dedicated to the synthetic strategies for the preparation of bioactive derivatives. This information will be essential for the design and development of new drugs that can improve brain functions.
