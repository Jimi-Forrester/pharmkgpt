38388884|a|BACKGROUND: Patients' recall of memories from the ICU plays an important role in the occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder. This study aimed to determine the effect of nurse-initiated diary intervention on post-traumatic stress disorder and recall of memories in ICU survivors. METHODS: This RCT study included all patients admitted to two trauma ICUs in Southeast of Iran. Thirty patients considered in control and intervention groups. Data collection tools included the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the ICU Memory Tool (ICU-MT). The researcher wrote daily diaries of the intervention and control groups during the first 72 h of their admissions. SPSS25 was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The total mean PTSD score in the intervention group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p > 0.0001, z = -3.75). The number of those in the intervention group who clearly recalled their admission to hospital, their hospital stay before being admitted to the ICU and all memories from the ICU stay, was more than those in the control group; this difference was statistically significant (p > 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The results showed that the nurse-initiated diary was effective on the PTSD and recall clear memories of patients admitted to the ICU. We suggest medical and educational centers to use this intervention in order to reduce the posttraumatic stress disorder in these patients. As nurse-initiated diary intervention had no significant difference in the recall of different types of memories from the ICU, we require further studies in this field.
