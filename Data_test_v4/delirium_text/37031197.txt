37031197|a|Kruppel-like transcriptional factor is important in maintaining cellular functions. Deletion of Kruppel-like transcriptional factor usually causes abnormal embryonic development and even embryonic death. KLF4 is a prominent member of this family, and embryonic deletion of KLF4 leads to alterations in skin permeability and postnatal death. In addition to its important role in embryo development, it also plays a critical role in inflammation and malignancy. It has been investigated that KLF4 has a regulatory role in a variety of cancers, including lung, breast, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, hepatocellular, ovarian, esophageal, bladder and brain cancer. However, the role of KLF4 in tumorigenesis is complex, which may link to its unique structure with both transcriptional activation and transcriptional repression domains, and to the regulation of its upstream and downstream signaling molecules. In this review, we will summarize the structural and functional aspects of KLF4, with a focus on KLF4 as a clinical biomarker and therapeutic target in different types of tumors.
