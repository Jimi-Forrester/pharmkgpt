35910452|a|Widespread access to emerging information and communication technologies (ICT) allows its use for the screening of diseases in the general population. At the initiative of the Spanish Confederation of Associations of Families of People with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (CEAFA), a website (http://www.problemasmemoria.com) has been created that provides information about Alzheimer's disease and includes questionnaires to be completed by family or friends concerned about memory problems of a relative. A cross-sectional, randomized, multicenter study was performed to evaluate feasibility, validity, and user satisfaction with an electronic method of completion vs. the current method of paper-based questionnaires for clinically dementia screening completed by the informants: the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) and the Alzheimer's disease-8 screening test (AD8). A total of 111 pairs were recruited by seven memory clinics. Informants completed IQCODE and AD8 questionnaires both in their paper and electronic versions. The correlation between paper and electronic versions was significantly positive for IQCODE (r = 0.98; p < 0.001) and AD8 (r = 0.96; p < 0.001). The execution time did not differ significantly, and participants considered their use equally easy. This study shows that an electronic version of the IQCODE and AD8 questionnaires is suitable for its online use via the internet and achieves the same results as the traditional paper versions.
