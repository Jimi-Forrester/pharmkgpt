38082824|t|A Wearable System for Continuous Monitoring and Assessment of Speech, Gait, and Cognitive Decline for Early Diagnosis of ADRD.
38082824|a|Early detection of cognitive decline is essential to study mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease in order to develop targeted interventions and prevent or stop the progression of dementia. This requires continuous and longitudinal assessment and tracking of the related physiological and behavioral changes during daily life. In this paper, we present a low cost and low power wearable system custom designed to track the trends in speech, gait, and cognitive stress while also considering the important human factor needs such as privacy and compliance. In the form factors of a wristband and waist-patch, this multimodal, multi-sensor system measures inertial signals, sound, heart rate, electrodermal activity and pulse transit time. A total power consumption of 2.6 mW without any duty cycling allows for more than 3 weeks of run time between charges when 1500 mAh batteries are used.Clinical Relevance- Much earlier detection of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias may be possible by continuous monitoring of physiological and behavioral state using application specific wearable sensors during the activities of daily life.
