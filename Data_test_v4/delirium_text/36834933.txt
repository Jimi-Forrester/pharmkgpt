36834933|t|microRNAs (miRNAs) in Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)-Recent Literature Review.
36834933|a|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common, malignant, poorly promising primary brain tumor. GBM is characterized by an infiltrating growth nature, abundant vascularization, and a rapid and aggressive clinical course. For many years, the standard treatment of gliomas has invariably been surgical treatment supported by radio- and chemotherapy. Due to the location and significant resistance of gliomas to conventional therapies, the prognosis of glioblastoma patients is very poor and the cure rate is low. The search for new therapy targets and effective therapeutic tools for cancer treatment is a current challenge for medicine and science. microRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in many cellular processes, such as growth, differentiation, cell division, apoptosis, and cell signaling. Their discovery was a breakthrough in the diagnosis and prognosis of many diseases. Understanding the structure of miRNAs may contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of cellular regulation dependent on miRNA and the pathogenesis of diseases underlying these short non-coding RNAs, including glial brain tumors. This paper provides a detailed review of the latest reports on the relationship between changes in the expression of individual microRNAs and the formation and development of gliomas. The use of miRNAs in the treatment of this cancer is also discussed.
