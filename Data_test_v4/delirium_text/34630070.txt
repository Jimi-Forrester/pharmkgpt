34630070|t|Simultaneous PET/fMRI Detects Distinctive Alterations in Functional Connectivity and Glucose Metabolism of Precuneus Subregions in Alzheimer's Disease.
34630070|a|As a central hub in the interconnected brain network, the precuneus has been reported showing disrupted functional connectivity and hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, as a highly heterogeneous cortical structure, little is known whether individual subregion of the precuneus is uniformly or differentially involved in the progression of AD. To this end, using a hybrid PET/fMRI technique, we compared resting-state functional connectivity strength (FCS) and glucose metabolism in dorsal anterior (DA_pcu), dorsal posterior (DP_pcu) and ventral (V_pcu) subregions of the precuneus among 20 AD patients, 23 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 27 matched cognitively normal (CN) subjects. The sub-parcellation of precuneus was performed using a K-means clustering algorithm based on its intra-regional functional connectivity. For the whole precuneus, decreased FCS (p = 0.047) and glucose hypometabolism (p = 0.006) were observed in AD patients compared to CN subjects. For the subregions of the precuneus, decreased FCS was found in DP_pcu of AD patients compared to MCI patients (p = 0.011) and in V_pcu for both MCI (p = 0.006) and AD (p = 0.008) patients compared to CN subjects. Reduced glucose metabolism was found in DP_pcu of AD patients compared to CN subjects (p = 0.038) and in V_pcu of AD patients compared to both MCI patients (p = 0.045) and CN subjects (p < 0.001). For both FCS and glucose metabolism, DA_pcu remained relatively unaffected by AD. Moreover, only in V_pcu, disruptions in FCS (r = 0.498, p = 0.042) and hypometabolism (r = 0.566, p = 0.018) were significantly correlated with the cognitive decline of AD patients. Our results demonstrated a distinctively disrupted functional and metabolic pattern from ventral to dorsal precuneus affected by AD, with V_pcu and DA_pcu being the most vulnerable and conservative subregion, respectively. Findings of this study extend our knowledge on the differential roles of precuneus subregions in AD.
