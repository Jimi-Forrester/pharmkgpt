33778998|a|OBJECTIVES: Agitation and aggression are common in dementia and pre-dementia. The dementia risk syndrome mild behavioral impairment (MBI) includes these symptoms in the impulse dyscontrol domain. However, the neural circuitry associated with impulse dyscontrol in neurodegenerative disease is not well understood. The objective of this work was to investigate if regional micro- and macro-structural brain properties were associated with impulse dyscontrol symptoms in older adults with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Clinical, neuropsychiatric, and T1-weighted and diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) data from 80 individuals with and 123 individuals without impulse dyscontrol were obtained from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. Linear mixed effect models were used to assess if impulse dyscontrol was related to regional DTI and volumetric parameters. RESULTS: Impulse dyscontrol was present in 17% of participants with NC, 43% with MCI, and 66% with AD. Impulse dyscontrol was associated with: (1) lower fractional anisotropy (FA), and greater mean, axial, and radial diffusivity in the fornix; (2) lesser FA and greater radial diffusivity in the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus; (3) greater axial diffusivity in the cingulum; (4) greater axial and radial diffusivity in the uncinate fasciculus; (5) gray matter atrophy, specifically, lower cortical thickness in the parahippocampal gyrus. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence that well-established atrophy patterns of AD are prominent in the presence of impulse dyscontrol, even when disease status is controlled for, and possibly in advance of dementia. Our findings support the growing evidence for impulse dyscontrol symptoms as an early manifestation of AD.
