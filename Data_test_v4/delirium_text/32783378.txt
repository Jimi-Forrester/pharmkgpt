32783378|t|Diagnostic and prognostic value of circular RNA CDR1as/ciRS-7 for solid tumours: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
32783378|a|The circular RNA, CDR1as/ciRS-7, functions as a vital regulator in various cancers; however, the predictive value of CDR1as remains controversial. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis for clarifying the precise diagnostic and prognostic value of CDR1as in solid tumours is needed. A literature review of several databases was conducted for identifying potential studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) were used for evaluating the diagnostic accuracy variables and survival. Overall, 15 studies (1787 patients) and 11 studies (1578 patients) were included for diagnostic and prognostic outcome syntheses, respectively. Up-regulated CDR1as expression was found to be correlated with worse clinicopathological characteristics, including the T status, N status, histological grade, TNM stage and distant metastasis. The synthesized sensitivity was 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.79), and the specificity was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74-0.86). The positive likelihood ratio (LR), negative LR and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were 3.70, 0.34 and 10.80, respectively. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.80-0.87). In the pooled prognostic analysis, patients with high CDR1as expression had worse overall survival (HR = 2.40, P < 0.001) and disease-free survival (HR = 1.74, P < 0.001). These results suggest that CDR1as is a reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarker with high accuracy and efficiency, which may potentially facilitate clinical decisions on solid tumours in the future.
