36213738|a|An increasing number of studies have shown that the functional interactions between the thalamus and cerebral cortices play an important role in cognitive function and are influenced by age. Previous studies have revealed age-related changes in the thalamo-cortical system within individuals, while neglecting differences between individuals. Here, we characterized inter-subject functional correlation (ISFC) between the thalamus and several cortical brain networks in 500 healthy participants aged 18-87 years old from the Cambridge Centre for Aging and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) cohort using movie-watching state fMRI data. General linear models (GLM) were performed to assess age-related changes in ISFC of thalamo-cortical networks and the relationship between ISFC and fluid intelligence. We found significant age-related decreases in ISFC between the posterior thalamus (e.g., ventral posterior nucleus and pulvinar) and the attentional network, sensorimotor network, and visual network (FDR correction with p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the ISFC between the thalamus (mainly the mediodorsal nucleus and ventral thalamic nuclei) and higher-order cortical networks, including the default mode network, salience network and control network, showed complex changes with age. Furthermore, the altered ISFC of thalamo-cortical networks was positively correlated with decreased fluid intelligence (FDR correction with p < 0.05). Overall, our results provide further evidence that alterations in the functional integrity of the thalamo-cortical system might play an important role in cognitive decline during aging.
