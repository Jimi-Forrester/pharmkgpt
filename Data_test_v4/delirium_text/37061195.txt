37061195|a|Intranasal administration is becoming increasingly more attractive as a fast delivery route to the brain for therapeutics circumventing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Gold nanorods (AuNRs) demonstrate unique optical and biological properties compared to other gold nanostructures due to their high aspect ratio. In this study, we investigated for the first time the brain region-specific distribution of AuNRs and their potential as a drug delivery platform for central nervous system (CNS) therapy following intranasal administration to mice using a battery of analytical and imaging techniques. AuNRs were functionalized with a fluorescent dye (Cyanine5, Cy5) or a metal chelator (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic dianhydride, DTPA anhydride) to complex with Indium-111 via a PEG spacer for optical and nuclear imaging, respectively. Direct quantification of gold was achieved by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Rapid AuNRs uptake in mice brains was observed within 10 min following intranasal administration which gradually reduced over time. This was confirmed by the 3 imaging/analytical techniques. Autoradiography of sagittal brain sections suggested entry to the brain via the olfactory bulb followed by diffusion to other brain regions within 1 h of administration. The presence of AuNR in glioblastoma (GBM) tumors following intranasal administration was also proven which opens doors for AuNRs applications, as nose-to-brain drug delivery carriers, for treatment of a range of CNS diseases.
