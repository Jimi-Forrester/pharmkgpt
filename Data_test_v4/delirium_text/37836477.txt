37836477|t|Serum Vitamin D3 Concentration, Sleep, and Cognitive Impairment among Older Adults in China.
37836477|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline in older adults has become one of the critical challenges to global health. This study aims to examine both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) (briefed as VD3) concentration and sleep quality/duration, especially their interactions, with risk of cognitive impairment among older adults in China. METHODS: We utilized a special subsample of adults aged 65-105 years (individuals = 3412, observations = 4816) from eight provinces in China derived from the 2011/2012 and 2014 waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Cognitive impairment was measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination scale. Sleep quality was classified as good versus fair/poor, and sleep duration was classified into short (<7 h), normal (>=7 but <9 h), and long (>=9 h). The VD3 concentration was divided into three levels: deficiency (VD3 < 25 nmol/L), insufficiency (25 nmol/L <= VD3 < 50 nmol/L), and sufficiency (VD3 >= 50 nmol/L). A wide set of covariates that include demographics, socioeconomic status, family support, health practice, and health conditions was adjusted for robust findings. Multilevel random intercept logit regression models were used to examine the cross-sectional associations between VD3, sleep, and cognitive impairment, whereas logit regression models were applied to investigate the longitudinal associations. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional analyses, when all covariates were adjusted, VD3 sufficiency was significantly associated with a 33% lower risk of cognitive impairment compared with VD3 deficiency; good sleep quality was associated with 34% lower odds of cognitive impairment compared with fair/poor sleep quality; sleep hours were not associated with cognitive impairment, although a long sleep duration (>=9 h) was associated with 30% higher odds of being cognitively impaired when baseline health was not controlled. Interaction analyses reveal that VD3 sufficiency could help to additionally reduce the risk of cognitive impairment for good sleep quality and normal sleep hours. In the longitudinal analyses, the association of VD3 sufficiency remains significant, whereas sleep quality and sleep duration were not significant associates. CONCLUSIONS: Good sleep quality, normal sleep hours, and VD3 sufficiency are positively associated with good cognitive function. VD3 sufficiency could enhance the associations between sleep and cognitive impairment.
