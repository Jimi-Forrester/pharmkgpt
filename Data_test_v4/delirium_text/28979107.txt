28979107|a|In our worldwide aging society, elderly people should maintain cognitive and physical function to help avoid health problems. Dementia is a major brain disease among elderly people, and is caused by cognitive impairment. The locomotive syndrome (LS) refers to a condition in which people require healthcare services because of problems associated with locomotion. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between cognitive impairment and LS. Study participants were 142 healthy elderly female volunteers living in a rural area in Japan. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). A score of <=26 points on the MMSE was used to indicate categorically defined poor cognitive performance (cognitive impairment). The LS was defined by a score >=16 points, and non-LS as <16 points, on the 25-question Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale (GLFS-25). Twenty-one participants (14.8%) had an MMSE score <=26, and 19.0% were found to have LS. Compared with the MMSE >26 group, the <=26 group was significantly older, had a higher percentage of body fat, and a higher GLFS-25 score. Those with LS were significantly older, had a higher body mass index, a higher percentage of body fat, and a lower MMSE score. Participants in the LS group had higher odds of cognitive impairment than those without LS [odds ratio (OR) =3.08] by logistic regression analysis adjusted for age. Furthermore, participants with GLFS-25 scores >=6 had higher odds of cognitive impairment than those with a GLFS-25 score <6 by logistic regression analysis adjusted for both age (OR =4.44), and age and percent body fat (OR =4.12). These findings suggest that a strong relationship exists between the early stage of decreased motor function and cognitive impairment.
