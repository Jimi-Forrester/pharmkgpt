38238636|a|Poor postoperative outcomes may be associated with cerebral ischaemia or hyperaemia, caused by episodes of arterial blood pressure (ABP) being outside the range of cerebral autoregulation (CA). Monitoring CA using COx (correlation between slow changes in mean ABP and regional cerebral O2 saturation-rSO2) could allow to individualise the management of ABP to preserve CA. We aimed to explore a continuous automated assessment of ABPOPT (ABP where CA is best preserved) and ABP at the lower limit of autoregulation (LLA) in elective neurosurgery patients. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of 85 patients [median age 60 (IQR 51-68)] undergoing elective neurosurgery. ABPBASELINE was the mean of 3 pre-operative non-invasive measurements. ABP and rSO2 waveforms were processed to estimate COx-derived ABPOPT and LLA trend-lines. We assessed: availability (number of patients where ABPOPT/LLA were available); time required to achieve first values; differences between ABPOPT/LLA and ABP. ABPOPT and LLA availability was 86 and 89%. Median (IQR) time to achieve the first value was 97 (80-155) and 93 (78-122) min for ABPOPT and LLA respectively. Median ABPOPT [75 (69-84)] was lower than ABPBASELINE [90 (84-95)] (p < 0.001, Mann-U test). Patients spent 72 (56-86) % of recorded time with ABP above or below ABPOPT +- 5 mmHg. ABPOPT and ABP time trends and variability were not related to each other within patients. 37.6% of patients had at least 1 hypotensive insult (ABP < LLA) during the monitoring time. It seems possible to assess individualised automated ABP targets during elective neurosurgery.
