38556480|a|PURPOSE: Cancer survivors commonly report cognitive declines after cancer therapy. Due to the complex etiology of cancer-related cognitive decline (CRCD), predicting who will be at risk of CRCD remains a clinical challenge. We developed a model to predict breast cancer survivors who would experience CRCD after systematic treatment. METHODS: We used the Thinking and Living with Cancer study, a large ongoing multisite prospective study of older breast cancer survivors with complete assessments pre-systemic therapy, 12 months and 24 months after initiation of systemic therapy. Cognition was measured using neuropsychological testing of attention, processing speed, and executive function (APE). CRCD was defined as a 0.25 SD (of observed changes from baseline to 12 months in matched controls) decline or greater in APE score from baseline to 12 months (transient) or persistent as a decline 0.25 SD or greater sustained to 24 months. We used machine learning approaches to predict CRCD using baseline demographics, tumor characteristics and treatment, genotypes, comorbidity, and self-reported physical, psychosocial, and cognitive function. RESULTS: Thirty-two percent of survivors had transient cognitive decline, and 41% of these women experienced persistent decline. Prediction of CRCD was good: yielding an area under the curve of 0.75 and 0.79 for transient and persistent decline, respectively. Variables most informative in predicting CRCD included apolipoprotein E4 positivity, tumor HER2 positivity, obesity, cardiovascular comorbidities, more prescription medications, and higher baseline APE score. CONCLUSIONS: Our proof-of-concept tool demonstrates our prediction models are potentially useful to predict risk of CRCD. Future research is needed to validate this approach for predicting CRCD in routine practice settings.
