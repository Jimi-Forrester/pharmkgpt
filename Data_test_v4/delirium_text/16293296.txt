16293296|t|Proteome studies of CSF in AD patients.
16293296|a|Proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may often serve as indicators of neurodegenerative diseases, and are a rich source for biomarker discovery. However, a large dynamic range of proteins in CSF makes the analysis very challenging because high abundant proteins tend to mask those of lower abundance. Therefore, advances in the proteomic analysis had to be applied in the screen for new specific biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we have summarised the studies regarding two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), and surface enhanced laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (SELDI) technology that have been used in CSF of AD patients. Many proteins have shown to be altered in CSF of AD patients compared to controls, by using a protein pattern, from 2-D gel analysis or from SELDI analysis. Several studies show that the use of a panel of biomarkers derived from proteomic analysis is an advantageous way to distinguish AD from normal, and other dementia subjects.
