35851316|t|Differential associations of lipoprotein(a) level with cerebral large artery and small vessel diseases.
35851316|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral large artery and small vessel diseases are related to different pathogenetic mechanisms and have different risk factor profile. Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) was shown to promote atherosclerosis but data was limited on its association with cerebral small vessel diseases (cSVD). The objective of this study was to assess the associations of Lp(a) level with the two types of cerebrovascular diseases. METHODS: Community-dwelling subjects aged 50-75 years from the baseline survey of The PolyvasculaR Evaluation for Cognitive Impairment and vaScular Events study were included. Lp(a) concentrations was measured and categorised into three groups according to the tertiles. Eligible participants were scanned by a 3.0T MRI scanner and assessed for intracranial atherosclerosis and cSVD burden based on four imaging markers. RESULTS: This study included 3059 subjects. The average age of the participants was 61.2+-6.7 years, and 53.5% (1636) were female. Compared with the first tertile, subjects with the second and third tertiles of Lp(a) concentrations were associated with an increased odds of presence of intracranial plaque (18.7% vs 15.4%, adj.OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.75; 18.9% vs 15.4%, adj.OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.72). Similar associations were observed for intracranial atherosclerotic burden. Whereas, subjects with the third tertile of Lp(a) level had a decreased odds of presence of cSVD (25.9% vs 31.7%, adj.OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92) and lower cSVD burden (adj.cOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, Lp(a) concentrations were positively associated with presence and burden of intracranial atherosclerosis, but was inversely associated with cSVD.
