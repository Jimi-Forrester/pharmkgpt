33804511|t|Notch Signaling Regulation in HCC: From Hepatitis Virus to Non-Coding RNAs.
33804511|a|The Notch family includes evolutionary conserved genes that encode for single-pass transmembrane receptors involved in stem cell maintenance, development and cell fate determination of many cell lineages. Upon activation by different ligands, and depending on the cell type, Notch signaling plays pleomorphic roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) affecting neoplastic growth, invasion capability and stem like properties. A specific knowledge of the deregulated expression of each Notch receptor and ligand, coupled with resultant phenotypic changes, is still lacking in HCC. Therefore, while interfering with Notch signaling might represent a promising therapeutic approach, the complexity of Notch/ligands interactions and the variable consequences of their modulations raises concerns when performed in undefined molecular background. The gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), representing the most utilized approach for Notch inhibition in clinical trials, are characterized by important adverse effects due to the non-specific nature of GSIs themselves and to the lack of molecular criteria guiding patient selection. In this review, we briefly summarize the mechanisms involved in Notch pathway activation in HCC supporting the development of alternatives to the gamma-secretase pan-inhibitor for HCC therapy.
