31066049|a|AIM: To develop an education and training programme to enhance bedside nurses' knowledge, competency and compliance in accurately performing delirium screening in intensive care units. BACKGROUND: Delirium in intensive care units is associated with several poor patient outcomes. Delirium detection can be improved by enhancing nurses' knowledge, competency and compliance in accurately performing delirium screening. METHODS: A descriptive quantitative study with pretest-post-test design was adopted. There were 245 nurses from five intensive care units who participated in the study. Multiple-choice questions were used to assess nurses' knowledge change before and after the education programme. Competency was assessed before and 2 months after the programme by simulation with a standardized patient, followed by real patients at the bedside. Compliance data on screening were collected from the documentation of the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU before and 3 and 10 months after the programme. Data collection took 1 year, from June 2014 to May 2015. RESULTS: Despite nurses' improved knowledge and good competency, delirium screening documentations after 3 months were poor. However, screening documentations subsequently improved when measured at 10 months, following further emphasis by the senior nursing staff. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE AND POLICY: Nursing administrators and bedside nurses need to be involved in the policy-making process and plan a training programme for the new nursing staff in the high-risk areas. A short refreshment course should be offered to the nursing staff 3 months after the initial training programme. CONCLUSIONS: Improved knowledge and competency in assessment did not improve compliance and documentation of delirium screening. Therefore, it is important to reinforce nurses' compliance of delirium screening over time.
