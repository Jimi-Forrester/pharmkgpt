35204275|t|Grapevine Wastes: A Rich Source of Antioxidants and Other Biologically Active Compounds.
35204275|a|Wine production is one of the most critical agro-industrial sectors worldwide, generating large amounts of waste with negative environmental impacts, but also with high economic value and several potential applications. From wine shoots to grape pomace or seeds, all of the wastes are rich sources of bioactive compounds with beneficial effects for human health, with these compounds being raw materials for other industries such as the pharmaceutical, cosmetic or food industries. Furthermore, these compounds present health benefits such as being antioxidants, supporting the immune system, anti-tumoral, or preventing cardiovascular and neural diseases. The present work aims to be a critical discussion of the extraction methods used for bioactive compounds from grapevine waste and their beneficial effects on human health.
