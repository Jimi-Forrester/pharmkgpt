38096401|t|Proteomic Changes in the Hippocampus after Repeated Explosive-Driven Blasts.
38096401|a|Repeated blast-traumatic brain injury (blast-TBI) has been hypothesized to cause persistent and unusual neurological and psychiatric symptoms in service members returning from war zones. Blast-wave primary effects have been supposed to induce damage and molecular alterations in the brain. However, the mechanisms through which the primary effect of an explosive-driven blast wave generate brain lesions and induce brain consequences are incompletely known. Prior findings from rat brains exposed to two consecutive explosive-driven blasts showed molecular changes (hyperphosphorylated-Tau, AQP4, S100beta, PDGF, and DNA-polymerase-beta) that varied in magnitude and direction across different brain regions. We aimed to compare, in an unbiased manner, the proteomic profile in the hippocampus of double blast vs sham rats using mass spectrometry (MS). Data showed differences in up- and down-regulation for protein abundances in the hippocampus of double blast vs sham rats. Tandem mass tag (TMT)-MS results showed 136 up-regulated and 94 down-regulated proteins between the two groups (10.25345/C52B8VP0X). These TMT-MS findings revealed changes never described before in blast studies, such as increases in MAGI3, a scaffolding protein at cell-cell junctions, which were confirmed by Western blotting analyses. Due to the absence of behavioral and obvious histopathological changes as described in our previous publications, these proteomic data further support the existence of an asymptomatic blast-induced molecular altered status (ABIMAS) associated with specific protein changes in the hippocampus of rats repeatedly expsosed to blast waves generated by explosive-driven detonations.
