34339805|t|Immune environment of the brain in schizophrenia and during the psychotic episode: A human post-mortem study.
34339805|a|A causal relationship between immune dysregulation and schizophrenia has been supported by genome-wide association studies and epidemiological evidence. It remains unclear to what extent the brain immune environment is implicated in this hypothesis. We investigated the immunophenotype of microglia and the presence of perivascular macrophages and T lymphocytes in post-mortem brain tissue. Dorsal prefrontal cortex of 40 controls (22F:18M) and 37 (10F:27M) schizophrenia cases, of whom 16 had active psychotic symptoms at the time of death, was immunostained for seven markers of microglia (CD16, CD32a, CD64, CD68, HLA-DR, Iba1 and P2RY12), two markers for perivascular macrophages (CD163 and CD206) and T-lymphocytes (CD3). Automated quantification was blinded to the case designation and performed separately on the grey and white matter. 3D reconstruction of Iba1-positive microglia was performed in selected cases. An increased cortical expression of microglial Fcgamma receptors (CD64 F = 7.92, p = 0.007; CD64/HLA-DR ratio F = 5.02, p = 0.029) highlights the importance of communication between the central and peripheral immune systems in schizophrenia. Patients in whom psychotic symptoms were present at death demonstrated an age-dependent increase of Iba1 and increased CD64/HLA-DR ratios relative to patients without psychotic symptoms. Microglia in schizophrenia demonstrated a primed/reactive morphology. A potential role for T-lymphocytes was observed, but we did not confirm the presence of recruited macrophages in the brains of schizophrenia patients. Taking in account the limitations of a post-mortem study, our findings support the hypothesis of an alteration of the brain immune environment in schizophrenia, with symptomatic state- and age-dependent effects.
