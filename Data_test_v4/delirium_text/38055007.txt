38055007|a|OBJECTIVES: To examine neurocognitive and psychological outcomes associated with post-PICU admissions in children treated for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). DESIGN: Observational study from October 2007 to March 2017. SETTING: Pediatric onco-critical care unit. PATIENTS: All patients in this study (n = 296; ages 3-21) were treated for ALL on the St. Jude Total Therapy 16 clinical trial (NCT00549848) from 2007 to 2017. Of these, 104 patients were admitted to the PICU during protocol-directed therapy. All patients completed protocol-directed neurocognitive monitoring prospectively, at the end of cancer-directed therapy. Data on PICU stays were abstracted retrospectively from the medical record. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographic and critical illness variables were abstracted from institutional databases and medical records. Neurocognitive and psychosocial outcomes were prospectively obtained at the end of treatment. Children who had a PICU admission experienced significantly lower functioning compared to normative samples in several areas of cognitive functioning (working memory, processing speed, executive functions, inattention, math achievement, fine motor dexterity, and speed), daily living skills, and internalizing problems (all ps < 0.05). Compared with those without PICU admissions, patients with PICU admissions had worse performance on a measure of sustained attention (p = 0.017). The frequency of patients at risk for problems with learning and memory was significantly higher in the PICU group compared with the non-PICU group (25% vs 12%, p = 0.006). Critical illness symptom severity was not associated with neurocognitive or psychological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ALL, with or without a PICU admission, experienced lower cognitive and psychological outcomes following treatment. Future research is needed to continue identifying risk factors for post-intensive care syndrome (PICS-p) and post-PICU cognitive and psychological impairments in pediatric patients.
