31337482|a|Postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) occur commonly in older adults after surgery and are frequently underrecognized. Delirium has been associated with worse outcomes, and both delirium and cognitive dysfunction increase the risk of long-term cognitive decline. Although the pathophysiology of delirium and POCD have not been clearly defined, risk factors for both include increasing age, lower levels of education, and baseline cognitive impairment. In addition, developing delirium increases the risk of POCD. This article examines interventions that may reduce the risk of developing delirium and POCD and improve long-term recovery and outcomes in the vulnerable older population.
