36430332|t|Brca1 Is Regulated by the Transcription Factor Gata3, and Its Silencing Promotes Neural Differentiation in Retinal Neurons.
36430332|a|Previous studies have indicated that Brca1 (Breast cancer suppressor gene 1) plays an important role in neural development and degenerative diseases. However, the bioactivity and regulatory mechanism of Brca1 expression in retinal neurocytes remain unclear. In the present study, our data indicated that Brca1 maintains the state of neuronal precursor cells. Brca1 silencing induces differentiation in 661W cells. Nestin, a marker of precursor cells, was significantly decreased in parallel with Brca1 silencing in 661W cells, whereas Map2 (Microtubule associated protein 2), a marker of differentiated neurons, was significantly increased. Neurite outgrowth was increased by ~4.0-fold in Brca1-silenced cells. Moreover, DNA affinity purification assays and ChIP assays demonstrated that Gata3 (GATA binding protein 3) regulates Brca1 transcription in 661W cells. Silencing or overexpressing Gata3 could significantly regulate the expression of Brca1 and affect its promoter inducibility. Furthermore, the expression of Gata3 generally occurred in parallel with that of Brca1 in developing mouse retinas. Both Gata3 and Brca1 are expressed in the neonatal mouse retina but are developmentally silenced with age. Exogenous Gata3 significantly inhibited neural activity by decreasing synaptophysin and neurite outgrowth. Thus, this study demonstrated that Brca1 is transcriptionally regulated by Gata3. Brca1/Gata3 silencing is involved in neuronal differentiation and maturation.
