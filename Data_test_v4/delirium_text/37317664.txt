37317664|t|Biology and function of pericytes in the vascular microcirculation.
37317664|a|Pericytes are the main cellular components of tiny arteries and capillaries. Studies have found that pericytes can undergo morphological contraction or relaxation under stimulation by cytokines, thus affecting the contraction and relaxation of microvessels and playing an essential role in regulating vascular microcirculation. Moreover, due to the characteristics of stem cells, pericytes can differentiate into a variety of inflammatory cell phenotypes, which then affect the immune function. Additionally, pericytes can also participate in angiogenesis and wound healing by interacting with endothelial cells in vascular microcirculation disorders. Here we review the origin, biological phenotype and function of pericytes, and discuss the potential mechanisms of pericytes in vascular microcirculation disorders, especially in pulmonary hypertension, so as to provide a sound basis and direction for the prevention and treatment of vascular microcirculation diseases.
