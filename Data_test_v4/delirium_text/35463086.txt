35463086|t|Integrated Network Pharmacology and UPLC/Q-TOF-MS Screen System to Exploring Anti-Inflammatory Active Components and Mechanism of Shunaoxin Pills.
35463086|a|Background: Chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI) is a pathological condition associated with a variety of cerebrovascular diseases. Shunaoxin pills (SNX) are a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used to improve blood circulation. However, its multicomponent and multitarget features make it difficult to decipher the molecular mechanisms. Objective: Thus, in this study, we aimed to identify the key anti-inflammatory components of SNX as markers for standardization and quality control and the potential pharmacological mechanisms of SNX in the treatment of CCI by network pharmacology to provide scientific evidence of its clinical efficacy. Methods: We evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect of SNX using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) combined with a dual-luciferase reporter assay for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) inhibition to identify the active components in SNX. In addition, key pathways involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of SNX were predicted using a network pharmacology approach, and some crucial proteins and pathways were further validated by Western blotting. Results: Shunaoxin pills inhibited NF-kappaB through tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulation in 293T cells. The therapeutic effect may be related to 10 pathways regulated by ligustilide, ferulic acid, ligustrazine, and senkyunolide I. It was further confirmed that ligustilide could reduce the inflammatory response by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p38 and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). Conclusions: Ligustilide, senkyunolide I, ferulic acid, and ligustrazine could be used as anti-inflammatory Q-markers to control the quality of SNX, and p38 and PDK1 might be potential targets of SNX in the treatment of CCI.
