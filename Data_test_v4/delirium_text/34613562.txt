34613562|t|Pupil responses in patients with COVID-19.
34613562|a|AIM: To compare pupillary responses in patients with Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) during active infection and at 3rd months post-infection. METHODS: This study included 58 COVID-19 cases (mean age 47.23 +- 1.1 years). The scotopic, mesopic and photopic diameters were noted. Pupil diameters were noted at the 0, 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th seconds in reflex pupil dilation after the termination of a light. The average dilation speed was calculated at the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th seconds. Pupil responses measured during COVID-19 infection and 3 months later were compared. RESULTS: The mean scotopic and mesopic pupil diameter value of during COVID-19 infection was found lower than the 3rd month post-infection. (p = 0.001, p = 0.023; respectively). No statistically significant difference was found in the mean photopic pupil diameter and the mean pupil diameter at 0 s between measurements (p > 0.05, p = 0.734; respectively). The mean pupil diameter was significantly lower during COVID-19 infection at the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th seconds (p < 0.01, for each). The average dilation speed measurements at every second measured were lower in during COVID-19 infection than the 3rd months later (p = 0.001; p < 0.01 for each). CONCLUSIONS: Pupil responses were found significantly different in COVID-19 cases when compared with the measurements taken three months later.
