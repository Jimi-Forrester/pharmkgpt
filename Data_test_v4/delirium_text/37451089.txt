37451089|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the safety and efficiency of twist drill craniotomy (TDC) for surgical treatment of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) based on a single-center experience of 219 cases performed over nine years. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of CSDH patients who underwent TDC treatment in our hospital between January 2013 and December 2021. Clinical and radiological characteristics, as well as surgical outcomes of the included patients, were reviewed and analyzed. Factors that may affect hematoma recurrence and outcomes were also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 219 patients (186 males and 33 females) were included. Eighteen (8.2%) patients experienced postoperative complications. The in-hospital mortality and recurrence rates in our series were 0.5% (1/219) and 4.1% (9/217), respectively. 91.7% (199/217) of patients achieved favorable outcomes six months after the operation. Duration of drainage catheter (odds ratio [OR] 0.135, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.017-1.099; P = 0.030) was the only factor significantly related to the recurrence of CSDH. Moreover, brain infarction (OR 5.175, 95% CI 1.417-18.896; P = 0.013), Alzheimer's disease (OR 20.515, 95% CI 1.950-215.840; P = 0.012), and preoperative dysfunction of coagulation (OR 6.509, 95% CI 1.501-28.217; P = 0.012) were markedly associated with unfavorable functional outcomes. CONCLUSION: TDC with irrigation and closed-system drainage is a minimally invasive, simple, safe, and effective surgical technique that can serve as the first-choice for the treatment of CSDH with a low recurrence rate.
