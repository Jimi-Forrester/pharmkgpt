34557614|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to find the significance of different ASA grades in achieving the Best Practice Tariff (BPT) and their outcomes in patients with fracture neck of femur. METHODS: A retrospective study over a five years period. Patient demographics, ASA grading, hospital admission timing, time to theatre and discharge date were recorded. The 30 day mortality rate and length of stay were calculated for each ASA grades for patients who met and failed BPT. RESULTS: 1798 patients were included in the study. 54% was ASA grade 3, grade 4 represented 22% and grade 2, 19%. The mean AMT score was 6.4 who met BPT and 4.4 who failed BPT (p<0.001). 319 patients with ASA<=2 met BPT and 53 patients failed to meet BPT. In ASA >=3, 1200 patients who met BPT and 225 patients failed BPT. The 30-day mortality in patients with ASA<=2 who met BPT was 2.57% and those who failed were 1.92%. In ASA >=3 the 30-day mortality was 12.63% and who failed BPT was 25% which is statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In patients with ASA>=3 the 30-day mortality is significantly higher in those who failed BPT compared to ASA<=2 patients whether they achieved BPT or not.
