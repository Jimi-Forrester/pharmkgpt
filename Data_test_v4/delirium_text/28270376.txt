28270376|a|OBJECTIVE: Hidden blood loss (HBL), commonly seen after total knee or hip arthroplasty, causes postoperative anemia even after reinfusion or blood transfusion based on the visible blood loss volume. Recent studies demonstrated that oxidative stress might be involved in HBL. However, whether the antioxidants proanthocyanidin (PA) or hydrogen water (HW) can ameliorate HBL remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of PA and HW on HBL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A rat HBL model was established through administration of linoleic acid with or without treatment with PA or HW. The levels of hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC) count, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), and ferryl Hb were measured. RESULTS: RBC and Hb values as well as the activity of SOD and GSH-PX were reduced after administration of linoleic acid, which was ameliorated by treatment with PA or HW. In addition, the quantity of MDA was significantly decreased with the administration of PA or HW. CONCLUSION: PA and HW could ameliorate HBL in a rat model by reducing oxidative stress, suggesting that they might be used as a novel therapeutic approach in the prophylaxis or treatment of HBL in clinics.
