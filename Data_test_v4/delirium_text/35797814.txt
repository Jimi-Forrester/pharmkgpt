35797814|a|BACKGROUND: Preliminary data suggest that patients with COVID-19 may experience psychiatric symptoms, including psychosis. We systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate the concurrence of new-onset psychosis or exacerbation of clinically stable psychosis through case reports and case series. METHODS: Six databases were searched, followed by an electronic and manual search of the relevant articles. Studies were identified using predetermined eligibility criteria. We evaluated the demographic characteristics, clinical history, course of illness, management, and prognosis of the patients in these studies. RESULTS: Case reports and case series, altogether consisting of 57 unique cases were included. The mean patient age for onset of psychotic symptoms was 43.4 years for men and 40.3 years for women. About 69% of patients had no prior history of psychiatric disorders. Most patients had mild COVID-19-related symptoms, with only 15 (26.3%) presenting with moderate to severe COVID-19-related disease and complications. The most commonly reported psychotic symptoms were delusions and hallucinations. Patients with psychotic symptoms were treated with antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, valproic acid, and electroconvulsive treatment. In 36 cases, psychotic symptoms resolved completely or improved significantly. Ten cases had partial improvement with residual psychotic symptoms, and one patient died due to cardiac arrest. CONCLUSION: Most patients responded to a low-to-moderate dose of antipsychotics with a quick recovery. However, the residual psychiatric symptoms highlight the need for careful monitoring and longer follow-up. Clinicians should be mindful of the occurrence of psychosis due to COVID-19 infection in a subset of COVID-19 patients that can be misdiagnosed as a psychotic disorder alone.
