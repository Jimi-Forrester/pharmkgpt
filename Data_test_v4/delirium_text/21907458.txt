21907458|t|Medial septal dysfunction by Abeta-induced KCNQ channel-block in glutamatergic neurons.
21907458|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides play a central role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cellular mechanisms underlying Abeta toxicity, however, are poorly understood. Here we show that Abeta(25-35) and Abeta(1-40) acutely and differentially affect the characteristics of 3 classes of medial septum (MS) neurons in mice. In glutamatergic neurons Abeta increases firing frequency and blocks the A- and the M-current (I(A) and I(M), respectively). While the I(A) block is similar in other MS neuron classes, the block of I(M) is specific to glutamatergic neurons. I(M) block and a simulated Abeta block mimic the Abeta-induced increase in spontaneous firing in glutamatergic neurons. Calcium imaging shows that under control conditions glutamatergic neurons rarely fire while nonglutamatergic neurons fire coherently at theta frequencies. Abeta increases the firing rate of glutamatergic neurons while nonglutamatergic neurons lose theta firing coherence. Our results demonstrate that Abeta-induced dysfunction of glutamatergic neurons via I(M) decrease diminishes MS rhythmicity, which may negatively affect hippocampal rhythmogenesis and underlie the memory loss observed in Alzheimer's disease.
