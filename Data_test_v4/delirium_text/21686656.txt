21686656|t|Dementia presenting with visual complaints.
21686656|a|A 78-year-old female developed memory problems after a 2-year history of persistent visual complaints. Ocular pathology did not explain the extent of her perceived visual impairment. Cognitive screening tests found prominent visuo-constructive deficits and a comprehensive dementia assessment revealed the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. This case describes visual complaints as the initial symptom of dementia, pre-dating memory impairment by several years. We discuss clinical signs of cerebral visual impairment and suggest a simple screening measure.
