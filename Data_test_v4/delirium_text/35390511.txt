35390511|a|BACKGROUND: COVID-19, a disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in most cases. Some patients, usually burdened with risk factors develop acute respiratory failure and other organ dysfunction. In such cases, the mortality rate is very high despite the use of intensive therapy. Amantadine has complex activity including antiviral, antiinflammatory and dopaminergic effects. This clinical trial will assess the efficacy and safety of amantadine in the prevention of COVID-19 progression toward acute respiratory failure and neurological complications. METHODS AND RESULTS: The trial will enroll 200 patients who are positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and have one or more risk factors for worsening the disease. These patients will be included as hospitalized or ambulatory subjects for early treatment of illness. The recruitment will take place in 8 centers covering different regions of Poland. For 14 days they will be given either 200 mg of amantadine a day or placebo. Our hypothesis is a considerable reduction in the number of patients with progression toward respiratory insufficiency or neurological complications thanks to the treatment of amantadine. CONCLUSIONS: Demonstrating the efficacy and safety of amantadine treatment in improving the clinical condition of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is of great importance in combating the effects of the pandemic. It has potential to influence on the severity and course of neurological complications, which are very common and persist long after the infection as long-COVID syndrome.
