38694950|a|Introduction: The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal derived from functional neuroimaging is commonly used in brain network analysis and dementia diagnosis. Missing the BOLD signal may lead to bad performance and misinterpretation of findings when analyzing neurological disease. Few studies have focused on the restoration of brain functional time-series data. Methods: In this paper, a novel U-shaped convolutional transformer GAN (UCT-GAN) model is proposed to restore the missing brain functional time-series data. The proposed model leverages the power of generative adversarial networks (GANs) while incorporating a U-shaped architecture to effectively capture hierarchical features in the restoration process. Besides, the multi-level temporal-correlated attention and the convolutional sampling in the transformer-based generator are devised to capture the global and local temporal features for the missing time series and associate their long-range relationship with the other brain regions. Furthermore, by introducing multi-resolution consistency loss, the proposed model can promote the learning of diverse temporal patterns and maintain consistency across different temporal resolutions, thus effectively restoring complex brain functional dynamics. Results: We theoretically tested our model on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. The model's ability to preserve the underlying topological structure of the brain functional networks during restoration is a particularly notable achievement. Conclusion: Overall, the proposed model offers a promising solution for restoring brain functional time-series and contributes to the advancement of neuroscience research by providing enhanced tools for disease analysis and interpretation.
