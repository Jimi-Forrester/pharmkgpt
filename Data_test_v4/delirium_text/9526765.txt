9526765|t|Prevalence of dementia, delirium and psychiatric symptoms in various care settings for the elderly.
9526765|a|A prevalence study of psychiatric symptoms was performed in parts of a hospital catchment area in Mid-Sweden. In total 717 patients, aged 75 years and above, who were receiving care in an emergency hospital, three nursing homes, five old people's homes and two home medical care districts were included. All patients were examined using the OBS-scale (Organic Brain Syndrome Scale). Anxiety (51%), psychomotor slowing (45%), delirium (44%), depressed mood (41%), irritability (40%) and dementia (33%) were the most prevalent psychiatric symptoms or diagnoses in the sample but there were wide differences between the four care settings. The present study shows that the prevalence of dementia, delirium and psychiatric symptoms is high in all types of care settings for the elderly. It also demonstrates the need for psychiatric medical and nursing competence in all types of care for the elderly.
