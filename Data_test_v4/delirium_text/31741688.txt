31741688|t|Regulating effect of CBF on memory in cognitively normal older adults with different ApoE genotype: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
31741688|a|Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 allele and cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes are related to the increased risk of cognitive impairment independently. However, whether there are interactions between ApoE epsilon4 and CBF on memory performance in older adults with normal cognition remains unknown. This study determined whether the association between CBF and memory performance could be moderated by ApoE epsilon4 within a sample of cognitively normal older adults from the ADNI. 62 participants, including 23 with ApoE epsilon4 (ApoE epsilon4+) and 39 without ApoE epsilon4 (ApoE epsilon4-), underwent resting CBF measurement and memory testing. CBF was measured by arterial spin labeling MRI and memory performance was evaluated by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. By using linear regression models, CBF was negatively associated with memory function in ApoE epsilon4+ group, whereas positively in ApoE epsilon4- group by contrast. This study suggests that different CBF-memory relationships can be detected in cognitively normal ApoE epsilon4 carriers compared to ApoE epsilon4 non-carriers. Associations between hyperperfusion and worse memory performance in ApoE epsilon4 carriers may reflect vascular and/or cellular dysfunction.
