36894941|t|Cooked pork-derived exosome nanovesicles mediate metabolic disorder-microRNA could be the culprit.
36894941|a|In this study, exosomes from cooked meat were extracted by ultra-high-speed centrifugation. Approximately 80% of exosome vesicles were within 20-200 nm. In addition, the surface biomarkers of isolated exosomes were evaluated using flow cytometry. Further studies showed the exosomal microRNA profiles were different among cooked porcine muscle, fat and liver. Cooked pork-derived exosomes were chronically administered to ICR mice by drinking for 80 days. The mice plasma levels of miR-1, miR-133a-3p, miR-206 and miR-99a were increased to varying degrees after drinking exosome enriched water. Furthermore, GTT and ITT results confirmed an abnormal glucose metabolism and insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, the lipid droplets were significantly increased in the mice liver. A transcriptome analysis performed with mice liver samples identified 446 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional enrichment analysis found that DEGs were enriched in metabolic pathways. Overall, the results suggest that microRNAs derived form cooked pork may function as a critical regulator of metabolic disorder in mice.
