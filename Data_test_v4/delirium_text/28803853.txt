28803853|t|Developmental suppression of forebrain trkA receptors and attentional capacities in aging rats: A longitudinal study.
28803853|a|Basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic neurons innervating the cortex regulate cognitive, specifically attentional, processes. Cholinergic atrophy and cognitive decline occur at an accelerated pace in age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease; however, the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon remains unknown. Here we hypothesized that developmental suppression of nerve growth factor signaling, mediated via tropomyosin-related kinase A (trkA) receptors, would escalate age-related attentional vulnerability. An adeno-associated viral vector expressing trkA shRNA (AAV-trkA) was utilized to knockdown trkA receptors in postnatal rats at an ontogenetic time point when cortical cholinergic inputs mature, and the impact of this manipulation on performance was assessed in animals maintained on an operant attention task throughout adulthood and until old (24 months) age. A within-subject comparison across different time points illustrated a gradual age-related decline in attentional capacities. However, the performance under baseline and distracted conditions did not differ between the AAV-trkA-infused and animals infused with a vector expressing shRNA against the control protein luciferase at any time point. Additional analysis of cholinergic measures conducted at 24 months showed that the capacity of cholinergic terminals to release acetylcholine following a depolarizing stimulus, cortical cholinergic fiber density and BF cholinergic cell size remained comparable between the two groups. Contrary to our predictions, these data indicate that developmental BF trkA disruption does not impact age-related changes in attentional functions. It is possible that life-long engagement in cognitive activity might have potentially rescued the developmental insults on the cholinergic system, thus preserving attentional capacities in advanced age.
