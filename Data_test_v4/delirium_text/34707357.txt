34707357|t|Herbal Medicine for Patients with Cognitive Impairment: An Observational Study.
34707357|a|PURPOSE: The potential effects of herbal medicine for patients with cognitive disorders have been reported in various human and animal studies. This study aimed to explore the effect of herbal medicine treatment according to the Korean Medicine (KM) pattern identification for patients with mild cognitive impairment and early dementia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia who planned to receive herbal medicine treatment were enrolled. Herbal formulae were prescribed based on the KM pattern for 12-24 weeks. Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery II (SNSB-II) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were assessed at the baseline, after 12 weeks, and after 24 weeks (Trial registration: cris.nih.go.kr, KCT0004799). RESULTS: Herbal medicine products, including Yukmijihwang-tang, Samhwangsasim-tang, Palmul-tang, Banhasasim-tang, and Yukgunja-tang, were prescribed to the patients. Among the SNSB-II five cognitive function domains, the T scores for language, visuospatial function, memory, and frontal/executive function increased over time. The MoCA score also improved following the treatment (mean difference 4.23 [95% CI: 2.60, 5.86], p < 0.0001 at 12-week follow-up compared to the baseline). Considering the KM pattern scores, phlegm-dampness and fire-heat scores tended to improve after the treatment. No serious adverse events related to the intervention were reported. CONCLUSION: The potential effect of herbal medicine formulae products on improving cognitive functions in patients with cognitive impairment was observed. Further research is needed to objectify the KM pattern identification process and evaluate the KM pattern-related signs and symptoms.
