35429682|t|Mitochondrial localization of calpain-13 in mouse brain.
35429682|a|Calpains are Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases involved in various intercellular physiological functions. Although most calpains exist in the cytosol, four isoforms of calpain (calpains-1, -2, -5, -10) are also localized in the mitochondria. In the present study, we examined the mitochondrial localization of calpain-13, as a novel mitochondrial calpain, in C57BL/6J mice. The tissue distribution and mitochondrial subfractionation of calpain-13 were investigated using western blotting. Calpain-13 was present in both the mitochondrial membrane (outer membrane and inner membrane) and soluble (intermembrane space and matrix) fractions. Through immunohistochemistry, calpain-13 was found to be expressed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the mouse brain. We further confirmed the localization of calpain-13 in the mitochondria of the mouse brain using immunoelectron microscopy. Our present study thus revealed that calpain-13 is localized in the mitochondria, in addition to the cytosol, in the mouse brain. Future studies investigating the enzymatic properties and physiological functions of both cytosolic and mitochondrial calpain-13 will shed light on the potential involvement of calpain-13 in neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.
