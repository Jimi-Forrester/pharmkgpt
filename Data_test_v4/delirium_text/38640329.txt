38640329|a|COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious disease known for its significant lung damage. Although the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our daily lives has been limited, the virus has not vanished entirely and continues to undergo mutations. This calls for a concentrated focus on the matter of SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion. Drawing on observations of immune escape mechanisms in other viruses, some scholars have proposed that liquid-liquid phase separation might play a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2's ability to evade the immune system. Within the structure of SARS-CoV-2, the nucleocapsid protein plays a pivotal role in RNA replication and transcription. Concurrently, this protein can engage in phase separation with RNA. A thorough examination of the phase separation related to the nucleocapsid protein may unveil the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 accomplishes immune evasion. Moreover, this analysis may provide valuable insights for future development of innovative antiviral drugs or vaccines.
