34180261|t|Quantum dots as a theranostic approach in Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.
34180261|a|Aim: Quantum dots (QDs) are nanoparticles that have an emerging application as theranostic agents in several neurodegenerative diseases. The advantage of QDs as nanomedicine is due to their unique optical properties that provide high sensitivity, stability and selectivity at a nanoscale range. Objective: To offer renewed insight into current QD research and elucidate its promising application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and therapy. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar databases that included the following search terms: 'quantum dots', 'blood-brain barrier', 'cytotoxicity', 'toxicity' and 'Alzheimer's disease'; PRISMA guidelines were adhered to. Results: Thirty-four publications were selected to evaluate the ability of QDs to cross the blood-brain barrier, potential toxicity and current AD diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Conclusion: QD's unique optical properties and versatility to conjugate to various biomolecules, while maintaining a nanoscale size, render them a promising theranostic tool in AD.
