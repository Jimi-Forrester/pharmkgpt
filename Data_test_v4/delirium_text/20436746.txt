20436746|t|Post-stroke cognitive impairment at 3 months.
20436746|a|BACKGROUND: Vascular cognitive impairment, being the only treatable cause of dementia in the early stages, and having a diverse etiology, requires sensitive criteria for definition. AIM: This study aimed to study cognitive functions at 3 months post-stroke, utilising the Mini mental scale examination (MMSE) and the Frontal assessment battery (FAB), and to correlate the same with subgroups of ischemic stroke. RESULTS: 164 patients were studied, 108 of these having multiple infarcts. Pure cortical infarcts were seen in 41 patients. At 3 months, 112/164 patients had MMSE more than 24, with no frontal executive dysfunction. MMSE score less than 24 was seen in 24 patients, all of them having FAB score below 10. Normal MMSE with impaired FAB was seen in 28 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Impairment on either the MMSE or the FAB was thus seen in 31.7% patients (52/164), at 3 months after stroke. FAB impairment alone, with MMSE in normal range, was seen in 28/52 (53.8%) patients. Memory was significantly more commonly affected in muti-infarct strokes as compared to single infarcts. Frontal executive dysfunction was not significantly different when single and multiple infarcts, or cortical and subcortical infarcts, were compared.
