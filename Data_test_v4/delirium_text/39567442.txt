39567442|t|Determining the frequency of pressure ulcers incidence and associated risk factors in critical care patients: A 3-year retrospective study.
39567442|a|One of the key measures to prevent pressure ulcer is to identify the factors that influence them. This study aimed to assess the occurrence of pressure ulcers and their related risk factors in patients admitted to specialized care units. This research is a retrospective cohort study that was conducted in the critical care units of hospitals affiliated to Ardabil University of Medical Sciences. A total of 1158 patient records who were hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) between 2021 and 2022 were selected from the research population using the available sampling method and based on the inclusion criteria. Data was collected using a researcher-made checklist between April 2021 and December 2022. Data were analysed using analytical tests (chi-squared test, regression test) and descriptive statistics (prevalence, mean, standard deviation, and median) tests. All 1158 patient files were examined without any sample loss. The average age of the patients was 58.59 +- 19.73 years. The study found a significant association between the occurrence of pressure ulcers and age, duration of hospitalization, weight, body temperature, and male gender (p-value <0.001). Additionally, there was a significant association between the occurrence of pressure ulcers and the use of pain relievers, vasopressors, alpha-blockers, calcium blockers, and angiotensin (p-value 0.001). The study also investigated the association between nursing care practices and the development of pressure ulcers. The findings revealed that changing the angle of the bed, using a wavy mattress, repositioning the patient every 2 h, using a CPR bed for mobility, providing protective equipment, and applying physical restraint to the patient were all significantly associated with the likelihood of pressure ulcers (p < 0.001). The study showed that pressure ulcers in ICU patients are influenced by the type of disease and clinical factors in individuals. However, considering the conflicting results of this study with some other studies, more research is needed on this subject. It is suggested that appropriate measures be taken based on the patient's condition to prevent pressure ulcers in those admitted to the ICU.
