37521682|t|Abnormal spontaneous brain activity in females with autism spectrum disorders.
37521682|a|Objectives: To date, most studies on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have focused on sample sets that were primarily or entirely composed of males; brain spontaneous activity changes in females remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore changes in the brain spontaneous neural activity in females with ASD. Methods: In this study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance images (rs-fMRI) of 41 females with ASD and 41 typically developing (TD) controls were obtained from the ABDIE database. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF), and regional homogeneity (ReHo) of the two groups were calculated to detect the regional brain activity. A two independent sample t-test was used to analyze differences between the ASD and TD groups and a p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted between social responsiveness scale (SRS) scores and the local activity of significantly different brain regions. Results: Compared with the typically developing (TD) group, the values of ALFF and ReHo were significantly increased in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG), while the values of ReHo were significantly decreased in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG), left middle occipital gyrus (MOG), bilateral superior parietal lobule (SPL), and bilateral precuneus in the females with ASD group. Correlation analysis showed that the ReHo of the right precuneus was positively correlated to the total SRS, social communication, and autistic mannerisms. Conclusion: Spontaneous activity changes in females with ASD involved multiple brain regions and were related to clinical characteristics. Our results may provide some help for further exploring the neurobiological mechanism of females with ASD.
