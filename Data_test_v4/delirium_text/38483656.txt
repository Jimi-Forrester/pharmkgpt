38483656|t|Mechanistic Insights and Potential Therapeutic Implications of NRF2 in Diabetic Encephalopathy.
38483656|a|Diabetic encephalopathy (DE) is a complication of diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes (T2D), characterized by damage in the central nervous system and cognitive impairment, which has gained global attention. Despite the extensive research aimed at enhancing our understanding of DE, the underlying mechanism of occurrence and development of DE has not been established. Mounting evidence has demonstrated a close correlation between DE and various factors, such as Alzheimer's disease-like pathological changes, insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Of interest, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a transcription factor with antioxidant properties that is crucial in maintaining redox homeostasis and regulating inflammatory responses. The activation and regulatory mechanisms of NRF2 are a relatively complex process. NRF2 is involved in the regulation of multiple metabolic pathways and confers neuroprotective functions. Multiple studies have provided evidence demonstrating the significant involvement of NRF2 as a critical transcription factor in the progression of DE. Additionally, various molecules capable of activating NRF2 expression have shown potential in ameliorating DE. Therefore, it is intriguing to consider NRF2 as a potential target for the treatment of DE. In this review, we aim to shed light on the role and the possible underlying mechanism of NRF2 in DE. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the current research landscape and address the challenges associated with using NRF2 activators as potential treatment options for DE.
