37474737|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are explained by progressive defects of cognitive function and memory. These defects of cognition and memory dysfunction can be induced by the loss of brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) signaling. Paeonia lactiflora is a traditionally used medicinal herb in Asian countries and some beneficial effects have been reported, including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer activity, and potential neuroprotective effects recently. In this study, we found that suffruticosol A is a major compound in seeds of Paeonia lactiflora. When treated in a SH-SY5 cell line for measuring cell viability and cell survival, suffruticosol A increased cell viability (at 20 microM) and recovered scopolamine-induced neurodegenerative characteristics in the cells. To further confirm its neural amelioration effects in the animals, suffruticosol A (4 or 15 ng, twice a week) was administered into the third ventricle beside the brain of C57BL/6 mice for one month then the scopolamine was intraperitoneally injected into these mice to induce impairments of cognition and memory before conducting behavioral experiments. Central administration of suffruticosol A into the brain restored the memory and cognition behaviors in mice that received the scopolamine. Consistently, the central treatments of suffruticosol A showed rescued cholinergic deficits and BDNF signaling in the hippocampus of mice. Finally, we measured the long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapse to figure out the restoration of the synaptic mechanism of learning and memory. Bath application of suffruticosol A (40 microM) improved LTP impairment induced by scopolamine in hippocampal slices. In conclusion, the central administration of suffruticosol A ameliorated neuronal effects partly through elevated BDNF signaling.
