37736862|t|The Thalamus in Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders.
37736862|a|Thalamus function and structure are known predictors of individual differences in the risk of age-related neurocognitive disorders (NCD), such as dementia. However, to date, little is known about their role in the perioperative setting. Here, we provide a narrative review of brain-imaging studies of preoperative and postoperative thalamus scanning parameters associated with risks of developing perioperative NCD, such as postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) during the postoperative phase. These findings are discussed in light of the concept of reserve capacity.
