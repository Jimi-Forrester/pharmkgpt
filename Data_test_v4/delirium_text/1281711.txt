1281711|a|It has been shown that there is a decrease in the content and activity of three neurospecific proteins (neurospecific enolase--NSE, glial fibrillar acid protein--GFAP and creatine kinase CK BB) in various structures of the postmortal brain of schizophrenic patients and those with senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The differences in the intensity and localization of these disorders in the above patients' groups have been detected. A previously unknown component of a pathological process in the brain, indicated by the decrease of the CK content and activity has been discovered. It is suggested that the decrease of the content of CK BB results in the development of energy deficit in the brain in patients with mental disorders.
