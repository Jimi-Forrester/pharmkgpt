32613076|a|INTRODUCTION: We aimed to define prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD dementia using normative neuropsychological data in a large population-based cohort of adults with Down syndrome (DS). METHODS: Cross-sectional study. DS participants were classified into asymptomatic, prodromal AD and AD dementia, based on neurologist's judgment blinded to neuropsychological data (Cambridge Cognitive Examination for Older Adults with Down's syndrome [CAMCOG-DS] and modified Cued Recall Test [mCRT]). We compared the cutoffs derived from the normative data in young adults with DS to those from receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Diagnostic performance of the CAMCOG-DS and modified Cued Recall Test (mCRT) in subjects with mild and moderate levels of intellectual disability (ID) was high, both for diagnosing prodromal AD and AD dementia (area under the curve [AUC] 0.73-0.83 and 0.90-1, respectively). The cutoffs derived from the normative data were similar to those derived from the ROC analyses. DISCUSSION: Diagnosing prodromal AD and AD dementia in DS with mild and moderate ID using population norms for neuropsychological tests is possible with high diagnostic accuracy.
