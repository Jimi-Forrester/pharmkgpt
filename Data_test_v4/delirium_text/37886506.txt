37886506|t|Advancing Tau-PET quantification in Alzheimer's disease with machine learning: introducing THETA, a novel tau summary measure.
37886506|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits spatially heterogeneous 3R/4R tau pathology distributions across participants, making it a challenge to quantify extent of tau deposition. Utilizing Tau-PET from three independent cohorts, we trained and validated a machine learning model to identify visually positive Tau-PET scans from regional SUVR values and developed a novel summary measure, THETA, that accounts for heterogeneity in tau deposition. The model for identification of tau positivity achieved a balanced test accuracy of 95% and accuracy of >=87% on the validation datasets. THETA captured heterogeneity of tau deposition, had better association with clinical measures, and corresponded better with visual assessments in comparison with the temporal meta-region-of-interest Tau-PET quantification methods. Our novel approach aids in identification of positive Tau-PET scans and provides a quantitative summary measure, THETA, that effectively captures the heterogeneous tau deposition seen in AD. The application of THETA for quantifying Tau-PET in AD exhibits great potential.
