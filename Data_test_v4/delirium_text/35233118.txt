35233118|a|Various coronaviruses, which cause a wide range of human and animal diseases, have emerged in the past 50 years. This may be due to their abilities to recombine, mutate, and infect multiple species and cell types. A novel coronavirus, which is a family of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), has been termed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 is the strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The early identification and diagnosis of the virus is crucial for effective pandemic prevention. In this study, we review shortly various diagnostic methods for virus assay and focus on recent advances in electrochemical biosensors for COVID-19 detection.
