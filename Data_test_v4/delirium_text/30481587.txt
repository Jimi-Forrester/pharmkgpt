30481587|a|The roles of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the onset and progression of disease have been extensively studied for decades. More specifically, various PTMs have been the focus of research in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The two most discussed hallmarks of the disease, senile plaques and tau tangles, are the result of PTMs of the amyloidbeta protein precursor (AbetaPP) and the microtubule stabilizing protein: tau. While these modifications have been characterized indirectly by biochemical-based methods, the primary shortcoming to this research can be linked to a lack of a thorough molecular-based means of qualitative and quantitative analysis of many of these modifications within transgenic animal, and human samples. In this review, we discuss the important proteins and their associated PTMs linked to AD and the ways in which mass spectrometry has and will be utilized to analyze them. We also comment on novel ways in which molecular-based mass spectrometry methods should be employed going forward to resolve the interconnections of the PTMs involvement in various stages of AD pathology (preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, advanced-stage AD).
