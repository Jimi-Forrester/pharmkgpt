35351867|t|APOE-epsilon4 modulates the association among plasma Abeta42/Abeta40, vascular diseases, neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in non-demented elderly adults.
35351867|a|Including apolipoprotein E-epsilon4 (APOE-epsilon4) status and older age into consideration may increase the accuracy of plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 detecting Abeta+ individuals, but the rationale behind this remains to be fully understood. Besides, both Abeta pathology and vascular diseases are related to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, but it is still not fully understood how APOE-epsilon4 modulates these relationships. In this study, we examined 241 non-demented Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants to investigate the associations among age, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, body mass index (BMI), plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and 18F-florbetapir Abeta PET as well as their prediction of longitudinal adjusted hippocampal volume (aHCV) and cognition in APOE-epsilon4 carriers and non-carriers. We found older age predicted faster WMH increase (p = 0.024) and cortical Abeta accumulation (p = 0.043) in APOE-epsilon4 non-carriers only, whereas lower plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 predicted faster cortical Abeta accumulation (p < 0.018) regardless of APOE-epsilon4 status. While larger WMH and underweight predicted (p < 0.05) faster decreases in aHCV and cognition in APOE-epsilon4 non-carriers, lower plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 predicted (p < 0.031) faster decreases in aHCV and cognition in APOE-epsilon4 carriers. Higher Abeta PET also predicted faster rates of aHCV (p = 0.010) in APOE-epsilon4 carriers only, but was related to faster rates of cognitive decline (p < 0.022) regardless of APOE-epsilon4 status. These findings may provide novel insights into understanding different mechanisms underlie neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in non-demented elderly adults with and without APOE-epsilon4 allele, which may help the design of anti-Alzheimer's clinical trials.
