33463089|t|Functional nanoassemblies for the diagnosis and therapy of Alzheimer's diseases.
33463089|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects populations around the world. Many therapeutics have been investigated for AD diagnosis and/or therapy, but the efficacy is largely limited by the poor bioavailability of drugs and by the presence of the blood-brain barrier. Recently, the development of nanomedicines enables efficient drug delivery to the brain, but the complex pathological mechanism of AD prevents them from successful treatment. As a type of advanced nanomedicine, multifunctional nanoassemblies self-assembled from nanoscale imaging or therapeutic agents can simultaneously target multiple pathological factors, showing great potential in the diagnosis and therapy of AD. To help readers better understand this emerging field, in this review, we first introduce the pathological mechanisms and the potential drug candidates of AD, as well as the design strategies of nanoassemblies for improving AD targeting efficiency. Moreover, the progress of dynamic nanoassemblies that can diagnose and/or treat AD in response to the endogenous or exogenous stimuli will be described. Finally, we conclude with our perspectives on the future development in this field. The objective of this review is to outline the latest progress of using nanoassemblies to overcome the complex pathological environment of AD for improved diagnosis and therapy, in hopes of accelerating the future development of intelligent AD nanomedicines.
