37587822|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) are important causes of dementia with challenging differential diagnoses in many cases. Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) is a cognitive battery that may be useful to differentiate the two disorders. OBJECTIVE: The objectibe of this study is to investigate the value of the ACE-R combined with sociodemographic factors in the differential diagnosis between AD and bvFTD. METHODS: The ACE-R was administered to 102 patients with mild dementia due to probable AD, 37 with mild bvFTD, and 135 controls. Performances of patients and controls were analyzed by logistic regression and by ROC curves to refine the diagnostic accuracy of the ACE-R in AD and bvFTD. RESULTS: The ACE-R subscores Attention and Orientation, Fluency, and Memory, in combination with schooling differentiated AD from controls with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.936 (86% sensitivity and 87% specificity). The ACE-R subscores Attention and Orientation, Fluency, and Language, in combination with sex (male), age, and schooling, discriminated bvFTD from controls with an AUC of 0.908 (81% sensitivity and 95% specificity). In the differentiation between AD and bvFTD, the ACE-R subscores Attention and Orientation, Fluency, and Language, together with age, displayed an AUC of 0.865 (78% sensitivity and 85% specificity). CONCLUSION: The combination of ACE-R scores with sociodemographic data allowed good differentiation between AD and bvFTD in the study sample.
