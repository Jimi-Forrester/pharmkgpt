36847752|t|Waiting more than 24 hours for hip fracture surgery is associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes for sicker patients: a nationwide cohort study of 63,998 patients using the Swedish Hip Fracture Register.
36847752|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Waiting time to surgery is a modifiable risk factor in hip fracture surgery. However, there is no consensus regarding the acceptable duration of waiting time. We used the Swedish Hip Fracture Register RIKSHOFT and 3 administrative registers to explore the association between time to surgery and adverse outcomes after discharge. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 63,998 patients >= 65 years, admitted to a hospital between January 1, 2012, and August 31, 2017 were included. Time to surgery was divided into < 12, 12-24, and > 24 hours. Diagnoses investigated were atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), pneumonia, and "acute ischemia" (a combination of stroke/intracranial bleeding, myocardial infarction, and acute kidney injury). Crude and adjusted survival analyses were performed. Time spent in hospital following the initial hospitalization was described for the 3 groups. RESULTS: Waiting > 24 hours was associated with an increased risk of AF (HR 1.4, 95%CI 1.2-1.6), CHF (HR 1.3, CI 1.1-1.4) and "acute ischemia" (HR 1.2, CI 1.01-1.3). However, stratifying for ASA grade revealed that these associations were present only in patients with ASA 3-4. There was no association between waiting time and pneumonia after the initial hospitalization (HR 1.1, CI 0.97-1.2), but one was found with pneumonia during hospital stay OR 1.2 (CI 1.1-1.4). Time in hospital after the initial hospitalization was similar over the waiting time groups. CONCLUSION: The associations between waiting > 24 hours for hip fracture surgery and AF, CHF, and acute ischemia suggest that shorter waiting time may reduce adverse outcomes for the sicker patients.
