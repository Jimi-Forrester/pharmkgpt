37447178|a|The COVID-19 restrictions, such as social isolation and disruption of daily routines, can have detrimental effects, including increased stress, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and physical and cognitive decline among older adults. This study aimed to examine the association between nutritional status, depression, sleep quality, falling asleep at night, and cognitive frailty (CF) among older Thai adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study included 408 older adults with an average age of 70.54 (5.49) years. CF was determined using Fried's frailty phenotype and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Basic. The Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and geriatric depression assessment were used for assessment. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that participants who were malnourished (OR 3.786; 95%CI 1.719-8.335), depressed (OR 5.003; 95%CI 2.399-10.434), had poor sleep quality (OR 1.613; 95%CI 1.041-2.500), and engaged in difficulty falling asleep (OR 1.809; 95%CI 1.022-3.203) had a higher risk of CF compared to those who did not exhibit these factors. Therefore, malnutrition, depression, poor sleep quality, and difficulty falling asleep were identified as risk factors for CF among older adults in Thailand linked to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is crucial to develop interventions to prevent CF resulting from the mentioned variables.
