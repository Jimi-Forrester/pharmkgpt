36900852|t|Association between Dementia Severity and Oral Hygiene Management Issues in Older Adults with Alzheimer's Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study.
36900852|a|Oral hygiene management issues vary across types and clinical stages of dementia. We aimed to clarify the issues related to oral hygiene management in older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) according to stages defined by the Functional Assessment Staging of Alzheimer's Disease (FAST). In all, 397 records (45 men and 352 women; average age, 86.8 years; age range, 65-106) from older adults with AD were used for the cross-sectional study. We used data from a cohort of older adults (>=65 years old) who required long-term care and lived in the Omorimachi area of Yokote City, Akita Prefecture, Japan. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the associations of the FAST stage, set as the exposure variable, with oral hygiene management parameters set as outcome variables. Compared to the reference category (combined FAST stage 1-3), FAST stages 6 and 7 had significantly higher odds ratios for refusal of oral health care, dependence in performing oral health care, and rinsing and gargling disability. FAST stages 4 and 7 were associated with dental plaque accumulation. Oral health care for older adults with AD should be planned appropriately according to dementia severity.
