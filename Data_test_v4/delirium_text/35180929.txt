35180929|a|Cyclic Guanosine-Monophosphate (cGMP) is implicated as second messenger in a plethora of pathways and its effects are executed mainly by cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKG). It is involved in both peripheral (cardiovascular regulation, intestinal secretion, phototransduction, etc.) and brain (hippocampal synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, cognitive function, etc.) processes. Stimulation of hippocampal cGMP signaling have been proved to be beneficial in animal models of aging, Alzheimer's disease or hepatic encephalopathy, restoring different cognitive functions such as passive avoidance, object recognition or spatial memory. However, even when some inhibitors of cGMP-degrading enzymes (PDEs) are already used against peripheral pathologies, their utility as neurological treatments is still under clinical investigation. Additionally, it has been demonstrated a list of cGMP roles as not second but first messenger. The role of extracellular cGMP has been specially studied in hippocampal function and cognitive impairment in animal models and it has emerged as an important modulator of neuroinflammation-mediated cognitive alterations and hippocampal synaptic plasticity malfunction. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that extracellular cGMP decreases hippocampal IL-1beta levels restoring membrane expression of glutamate receptors in the hippocampus and cognitive function in hyperammonemic rats. The mechanisms implicated are still unclear and might involve complex interactions between hippocampal neurons, astrocytes and microglia. Membrane targets for extracellular cGMP are still poorly understood and must be addressed in future studies.
