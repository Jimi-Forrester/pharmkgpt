36736782|t|Delirium and Healthcare Utilization in Patients Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.
36736782|a|Delirium, a common neuropsychiatric syndrome among hospitalized patients, has been associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Although delirium is often reversible with prompt diagnosis and appropriate management, timely screening of hospitalized patients, including HSCT recipients at risk for delirium, is lacking. The association between delirium symptoms and healthcare utilization among HSCT recipients is also limited. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 502 hospitalized patients admitted for allogeneic or autologous HSCT at 2 tertiary care hospitals between April 2016 and April 2021. We used Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify patients with delirium symptoms, as defined by an NLP-assisted chart review of the electronic health record (EHR). We used multivariable regression models to examine the associations between delirium symptoms, clinical outcomes, and healthcare utilization, adjusting for patient-, disease-, and transplantation-related factors. Overall, 44.4% (124 of 279) of patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT and 39.0% (87 of 223) of those undergoing autologous HSCT were identified as having delirium symptoms during their index hospitalization. Two-thirds (139 of 211) of the patients with delirium symptoms were prescribed treatment with antipsychotic medications. Among allogeneic HSCT recipients, delirium symptoms were associated with longer hospital length of stay (beta = 7.960; P < .001), fewer days alive and out of the hospital (beta = -23.669; P < .001), and more intensive care unit admissions (odds ratio, 2.854; P = .002). In autologous HSCT recipients, delirium symptoms were associated with longer hospital length of stay (beta = 2.204; P < .001). NLP-assisted EHR review is a feasible approach to identifying hospitalized patients, including HSCT recipients at risk for delirium. Because delirium symptoms are negatively associated with health care utilization during and after HSCT, our findings underscore the need to efficiently identify patients hospitalized for HSCT who are at risk of delirium to improve their outcomes.   2023 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.
