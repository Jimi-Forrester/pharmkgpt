34440675|t|Role of NF-kappaB in Ageing and Age-Related Diseases: Lessons from Genetically Modified Mouse Models.
34440675|a|Ageing is a complex process, induced by multifaceted interaction of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. It is manifested by a decline in the physiological functions of organisms and associated to the development of age-related chronic diseases and cancer development. It is considered that ageing follows a strictly-regulated program, in which some signaling pathways critically contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the aged state. Chronic inflammation is a major mechanism that promotes the biological ageing process and comorbidity, with the transcription factor NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) as a crucial mediator of inflammatory responses. This, together with the finding that the activation or inhibition of NF-kappaB can induce or reverse respectively the main features of aged organisms, has brought it under consideration as a key transcription factor that acts as a driver of ageing. In this review, we focused on the data obtained entirely through the generation of knockout and transgenic mouse models of either protein involved in the NF-kappaB signaling pathway that have provided relevant information about the intricate processes or molecular mechanisms that control ageing. We have reviewed the relationship of NF-kappaB and premature ageing; the development of cancer associated with ageing and the implication of NF-kappaB activation in the development of age-related diseases, some of which greatly increase the risk of developing cancer.
