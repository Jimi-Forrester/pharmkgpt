11115209|t|Clues to early Alzheimer dementia in the outpatient setting.
11115209|a|BACKGROUND: As the elderly population booms and the prevalence of dementia soars, it becomes imperative that primary care physicians recognize early dementia within their own practices. Early recognition and diagnosis of dementia will allow appropriate intervention and treatment to improve morbidity. OBJECTIVE: To examine the most common symptoms associated with early Alzheimer disease (AD), as presented by patients and their families, and to compare these with the recommendations of the "7-Minute Screen" by Solomon et al for the identification of AD and the recommendations of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) for the early recognition of dementia. METHODS: A retrospective medical record review was conducted in an outpatient referral population within 2 geriatric evaluation centers. Patient medical record selection was based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for AD, a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 23 or higher, a Geriatric Depression Scale score of less than 5, age above 60 years, and at least an eighth-grade level of education. RESULTS: From 1025 medical records reviewed, 50 patients were chosen who fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Forty patients (80%) missed at least 2, if not all 3, recall items on the MMSE. Thirty patients (60%) had difficulty managing finances and/or balancing a checkbook; 16 (32%) frequently repeated stories and statements; 15 (30%) became lost while driving; 10 (20%) frequently forgot the names of relatives; and 10 (20%) had poor judgment. These results demonstrated a high correlation with recall as a diagnostic factor in diagnosing early AD as found in the 7-Minute Screen. Moreover, these "clues" correlated well with the AHCPR's symptoms that indicate dementia. The symptoms specifically overlapped in the areas of learning and retaining new information (repetition), handling complex tasks (calculation), reasoning ability (judgment), and spatial ability and orientation (driving). CONCLUSIONS: There may be a constellation of symptoms associated with early AD. This constellation includes missing recall items on the MMSE, difficulty in calculation, repetition, getting lost while driving, forgetting the names of relatives, and having poor judgment. Recall is the symptom most consistent with the findings of the 7-Minute Screen in diagnosing AD. However, repetition, calculation, judgment, and driving highly correlate with the AHCPR's dementia symptom checklist. Therefore, if primary care physicians keep this constellation of symptoms in mind while evaluating their geriatric population, they will have greater ability to suspect, diagnose, and treat AD at an early stage.
