38257864|t|Gut Microbiota Ecological and Functional Modulation in Post-Stroke Recovery Patients: An Italian Study.
38257864|a|Ischemic stroke (IS) can be caused by perturbations of the gut-brain axis. An imbalance in the gut microbiota (GM), or dysbiosis, may be linked to several IS risk factors and can influence the brain through the production of different metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), indole and derivatives. This study examines ecological changes in the GM and its metabolic activities after stroke. Fecal samples of 10 IS patients were compared to 21 healthy controls (CTRLs). GM ecological profiles were generated via 16S rRNA taxonomy as functional profiles using metabolomics analysis performed with a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Additionally fecal zonulin, a marker of gut permeability, was measured using an enzyme-linked immuno assay (ELISA). Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses and correlated with clinical features and biochemical variables using correlation and nonparametric tests. Metabolomic analyses, carried out on a subject subgroup, revealed a high concentration of fecal metabolites, such as SCFAs, in the GM of IS patients, which was corroborated by the enrichment of SCFA-producing bacterial genera such as Bacteroides, Christensellaceae, Alistipes and Akkermansia. Conversely, indole and 3-methyl indole (skatole) decreased compared to a subset of six CTRLs. This study illustrates how IS might affect the gut microbial milieu and may suggest potential microbial and metabolic biomarkers of IS. Expanded populations of Akkermansia and enrichment of acetic acid could be considered potential disease phenotype signatures.
