30510749|a|Resveratrol (3, 5, 4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a nonflavonoid polyphenol that naturally occurs as phytoalexin. It is produced by plant sources such as grapes, apples, blueberries, plums, and peanut. This compound has critical roles in human health and is well known for its diverse biological activities such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Nowadays, due to rising incidence of different diseases such as cancer and diabetes, efforts to find novel and effective disease-protective agents have led to the identification of plant-derived compounds such as resveratrol. Furthermore, several in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed the effectiveness of resveratrol in various diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, and age-related diseases. This review presents an overview of currently available studies on preventive properties and essential molecular mechanisms involved in various diseases.
