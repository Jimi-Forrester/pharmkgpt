33260917|t|Sustainable Access to Acridin-9-(10H)ones with an Embedded m-Terphenyl Moiety Based on a Three-Component Reaction.
33260917|a|A Ce(IV)-catalyzed three-component reaction between chalcones, anilines and beta-ketoesters followed by a microwave-assisted thermal cyclization afforded 1,3-diaryl-1,2-dihydroacridin-9(10H)-ones. Their microwave irradiation in nitrobenzene, acting both as solvent and oxidant, afforded fully unsaturated 1,3-diarylacridin-9(10H)-ones, which combine acridin-9-(10H)one and m-terphenyl moieties. Overall, the route generates three C-C and one C-N bond and has the advantage of requiring a single chromatographic separation.
