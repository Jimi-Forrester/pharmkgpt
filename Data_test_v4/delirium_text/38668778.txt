38668778|t|[Fragility Fractures: Preoperative assessment and optimisation].
38668778|a|Fragility fractures are associated with high morbidity and mortality. An interdisciplinary collaboration and an individualized, patient-centered approach are essential to ensure an optimized preoperative period and to improve perioperative safety. Preoperative responsibilities of trauma surgery include in the first step the identification of fragility fractures and the necessity for geriatric involvement. Orthogeriatric co-management (OCM) focuses on the identification of the medical, functional and social needs of the patient. In the preoperative period attention is focussed on acute diseases in need of treatment that have a negative impact on the course of further treatment and the prevention of delirium.
