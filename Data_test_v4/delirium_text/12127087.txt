12127087|t|Seladin-1 transcription is linked to neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
12127087|a|Seladin-1 is a gene recently shown to be down-regulated in brain regions selectively degenerated in Alzheimer's disease. The sequence of seladin-1 shares similarities with flavin-adenine-dinucleotide-dependent oxidoreductases and it has been found to protect cells from apoptotic cell death. In this work, we show that the transcription of seladin-1 is selectively down-regulated in the brain areas affected in Alzheimer's disease. The down-regulation in seladin-1 transcription was associated with hyperphosphorylated tau seen as linkage to immunohistochemically detected paired helical filament tau, neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In contrast, no association was found between seladin-1 transcription and beta-amyloid deposition when analyzing human samples or tissue from transgenic animals. Furthermore, the relative transcription of seladin-1 was found to fluctuate during aging in the transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The fluctuation was enhanced by Alzheimer's disease causing mutations in presenilin-1 and amyloid precursor protein genes. Finally, seladin-1 transcription was found to be up-regulated in mouse N2a cells induced to undergo apoptosis with okadaic acid. The results presented here indicate that seladin-1 transcription is selectively down-regulated in brain regions vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease and this down-regulation is associated with the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein.
