30841450|a|Abnormal inflammatory response in the central nervous system plays a critical role in various neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Therefore, modulation of abnormal neuroinflammation is thought to be a promising therapeutic strategy for these diseases. Based on this idea, we focused on finding a potential candidate material that would regulate excessive neuroinflammation. Iresine celosia has long been used as a traditional Mexican medicine to treat fever and oral disorders. In the present study, we evaluated the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of Iresine celosia extract (ICE) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia cells and mice models. In BV2 microglia cells, ICE markedly inhibited production of nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-6 without causing cytotoxicity. ICE also ameliorated translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB from cytosol to nucleus by LPS. Moreover, ICE attenuated behavioral disturbances by inhibiting activation of microglia and astrocytes in LPS-treated mice. Collectively, these data indicate that ICE is a potential therapeutic agent for treating inflammation-related diseases.
