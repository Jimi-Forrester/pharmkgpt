38676671|a|Modern research raises the question of the potentially significant role of glymphatic dysfunction in the development of neurodegeneration and pathological aging. The exact molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood, but there is ample evidence of a link between sleep deprivation and decreased clearance of beta-amyloid and other neurotoxin proteins that are associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease. The review analyzes current scientific information in this area of research, describes the latest scientific discoveries of the features of the glymphatic system, and also illustrates studies of markers that presumably indicate a deterioration in the glymphatic system. The relationship between sleep deprivation and pathophysiological mechanisms associated with neurodegenerative diseases is considered, and potential targets that can be used to treat or delay the development of these disorders are noted.
