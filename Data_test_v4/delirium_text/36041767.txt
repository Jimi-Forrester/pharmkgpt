36041767|t|Prospective comparison of acupuncture with sham acupuncture to determine impact on sedation and analgesia in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients (PASSION study): protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
36041767|a|INTRODUCTION: Sedation and analgesia are recommended to be employed in the intensive care unit (ICU) to enhance patient comfort and safety, facilitate mechanical ventilation and reduce oxygen demands. However, the increasing evidence demonstrates that excessive sedation and analgesia might prolong mechanical ventilation and increase costs and mortality. Acupuncture is known to be able to attenuate pain, anxiety and agitation symptoms while avoiding excessive sedation and analgesia caused by drugs. Therefore, we present a protocol to investigate whether acupuncture, used for sedation and analgesia, can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation, save medical resources and reduce the mortality of critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Prospective, randomised controlled trial is conducted on 180 adult medical/surgical ICU patients with mechanical ventilation needing sedation at 3 ICUs between 03 November 2021 and 16 August 2023. Patients will be treated with analgesia and sedation to achieve desired target sedation levels (Richmond Agitation Sedation Score of -2 to 1). Enrolled patients will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive deep needle insertion with combined manual and alternating-mode electrical stimulation on acupoints (AC group), superficial needle insertion without manual stimulation and electrical stimulation on non-acupoints (SAC group), or no acupuncture intervention (NAC group). The primary outcome is the duration of mechanical ventilation from randomisation until patients are free of mechanical ventilation (including non-invasive) without reinstitution for the following 48 hours. Secondary endpoints include the dose of administered sedatives and analgesic at comparable sedation levels throughout the study, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay. Additional outcomes include the prevalence and days of delirium in ICU, mortality in ICU and within 28 days after randomisation, and the number of ventilator free days in 28 days. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by the ethics committee at Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine. We will publish the study results.
