37587922|t|Multi-stage management of a right hip gunshot injury; Case report.
37587922|a|A 42-year-old hunter with no previous medical history suffered an accidental gunshot injury while hunting. Upon arrival at our Hospital, the following musculosceletal laesions were diagnosed during the primary survey: comminuted right trochanteric and femur neck fracture, femoral and sciatic nerve palsy. The immediate damage control surgery consisted of debridement, jet-lavage, PMMA-chain insertion and extrafocal fixation. Structural neural damage was disclosed. Primarily the skin wound was treated by delayed closure and later the healing was supported by Negative Pressure Wound Therapy. Six weeks after, the extrafocal fixation was removed and antibiotic spacer was inserted. Primary wound healing occurred without any sign of infection. Neurological recovery of the extremity took almost a year. Low grade infection were excluded by serial labs and culture samples. Finally the patient underwent total hip arthroplasty with excellent result.
