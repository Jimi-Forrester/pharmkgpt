38374739|t|Validation, Deployment, and Real-World Implementation of a Modular Toolbox for Alzheimer's Disease Detection and Dementia Risk Reduction: The AD-RIDDLE Project.
38374739|a|The Real-World Implementation, Deployment, and Validation of Early Detection Tools and Lifestyle Enhancement (AD-RIDDLE) project, recently launched with the support of the EU Innovative Health Initiative (IHI) public-private partnership and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), aims to develop, test, and deploy a modular toolbox platform that can reduce existing barriers to the timely detection, and therapeutic approaches in Alzheimer's disease (AD), thus accelerating AD innovation. By focusing on health system and health worker practices, AD-RIDDLE seeks to improve and smooth AD management at and between each key step of the clinical pathway and across the disease continuum, from at-risk asymptomatic stages to early symptomatic ones. This includes innovation and improvement in AD awareness, risk reduction and prevention, detection, diagnosis, and intervention. The 24 partners in the AD-RIDDLE interdisciplinary consortium will develop and test the AD-RIDDLE toolbox platform and its components individually and in combination in six European countries. Expected results from this cross-sectoral research collaboration include tools for earlier detection and accurate diagnosis; validated, novel digital cognitive and blood-based biomarkers; and improved access to individualized preventative interventions (including multimodal interventions and symptomatic/disease-modifying therapies) across diverse populations, within the framework of precision medicine. Overall, AD-RIDDLE toolbox platform will advance management of AD, improving outcomes for patients and their families, and reducing costs.
