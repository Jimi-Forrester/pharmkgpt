However, few studies to date have investigated the neuropsychological factors underlying pareidolia errors on the NPT across the clinical spectrum of LBD. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no research has examined the relationship between cortical thickness using MRI data and NPT subscores. As such, this study sought to explore the neuropsychological and neuroanatomical factors influencing performance on the NPT utilizing the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Lewy Body Dementia Module. METHODS: Our sample included participants with normal cognition (NC; n = 56), LBD with mild cognitive impairment (LBD-MCI; n = 97), and LBD with dementia (LBD-Dementia; n = 94). Archival data from NACC were retrospectively analyzed for group differences in neuropsychological test scores and cognitive and psychiatric predictors of NPT scores. Clinicoradiological correlates between NPT subscores and a small subsample of the above LBD participants were also examined. RESULTS: Analyses revealed significant differences in NPT scores among groups. Regression analysis demonstrated that dementia severity, attention, and visuospatial processing contributed approximately 24% of NPT performance in LBD groups. Clinicoradiological analysis suggests a potential contribution of the right fusiform gyrus, but not the inferior occipital gyrus, to NPT pareidolia error scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the interplay of attention and visuoperceptual functions in complex pareidolia in LBD. Further investigation is needed to refine the utility of NPT scores in clinical settings, including identifying patients at risk for visual illusions and hallucinations.
