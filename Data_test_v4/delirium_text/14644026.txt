14644026|t|Amyloid-beta peptide-specific single chain Fv antibodies isolated from an immune phage display library.
14644026|a|A single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibody library displayed on phage was constructed using spleen cells from mice immunized with human amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta42). This first anti-Abeta42 scFv immune antibody library was selected against human Abeta42. A number of positive clones were obtained, and sequences of VH and Vkappa genes were analyzed using ExPASy and BLAST computer tools. This analysis revealed that only two unique clones with identical VH and Vkappa complementarity determining region (CDR) (except HCDR2) and identical germline genes were selected, indicating that oligoclonal immune response was occurring in Abeta42-immunized mice. Abeta42-specific scFv antibodies selected from this first immune anti-Abeta42 phage antibody library may be an important tool for the development of therapeutic molecules for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
