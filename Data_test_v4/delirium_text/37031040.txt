37031040|t|Outcomes for patients with dementia undergoing emergency and elective colorectal surgery: A large multi-institutional comparative cohort study.
37031040|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) may result in poor surgical outcomes. The current study aims to characterize the risk of ADRD on outcomes for patients undergoing colorectal surgery. METHODS: Colorectal surgery patients with and without ADRD from 2007 to 2017 were identified using electronic health record-linked Medicare claims data from two large health systems. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed to evaluate postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: 5926 patients (median age 74) underwent colorectal surgery of whom 4.8% (n = 285) had ADRD. ADRD patients were more likely to undergo emergent operations (27.7% vs. 13.6%, p < 0.001) and be discharged to a facility (49.8% vs 28.9%, p < 0.001). After multi-variable adjustment, ADRD patients were more likely to have complications (61.1% vs 48.3%, p < 0.001) and required longer hospitalization (7.1 vs 6.1 days, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of ADRD is an independent risk factor for prolonged hospitalization and postoperative complications after colorectal surgery.
