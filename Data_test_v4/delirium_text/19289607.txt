19289607|a|Aggregated fibrillary microtubule-associated protein tau is the major component of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. The exact molecular mechanism of tau aggregation is unknown. Microglial cell activation and migration toward amyloid-beta plaques precede the appearance of dysmorphic neurites and formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Here, we analyzed the accumulation of tau at a distance range of expected spontaneous aggregation by fluorescence lifetime-based Forster resonance energy transfer in cultured primary murine neurons cotransfected with the human tau gene tagged to the green fluorescent protein variants Citrine (tau-Citrine) and Cerulean (tau-Cerulean). No spontaneous accumulation of cotransfected tau-Citrine and tau-Cerulean was detected in untreated neurons. Coculture of neurons with activated microglia induced aggregation of tau in neurites. Treatment of neurons with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulated reactive oxygen species generation and resulted in the accumulation of tau-Citrine and tau-Cerulean in neurites, which was inhibited by neutralization of TNF and the free radical inhibitor 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox). These data demonstrate that activated microglia and the microglial-derived proinflammatory cytokine TNF can induce accumulation of the aggregation-prone tau molecules in neurites via reactive oxygen species.
