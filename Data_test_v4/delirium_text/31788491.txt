31788491|a|Treatment strategy for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) includes anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) and/or laser therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical effects of topical Coqun  eye drop (CoQ10 and Vitamin-E) on the progression and treatment of ROP. One hundred and ten infants with type 1 ROP who received Coqun  (Coqun group) and 131 infants with type 1 ROP who did not receive Coqun  (control group) were included in this retrospective analysis. All patients were follow-up until retinal vascular maturation was complete. Intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) injection or laser photocoagulation (LPC) were apply if needed. Treatment frequency, treatment response and mean follow-up time were compare. The number of IVB was similar between the groups, but infants in the Coqun group underwent significantly fewer LPC procedure than those in the control group (P = 0.022). The mean follow-up time was significantly shorter in infants receiving Coqun  in stage 1 ROP (P = 0.017) and similar in stages 2-4 ROP and aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity (APROP). The number of LPC procedure was fewer in the Coqun group in APROP (P = 0.043). These results indicate that faster retinal vascular maturation in infants with low-grade ROP and lower number of treatments with APROP could be achieve with Coqun  therapy.
