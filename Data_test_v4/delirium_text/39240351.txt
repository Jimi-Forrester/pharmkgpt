39240351|t|Implicating type 2 diabetes effector genes in relevant metabolic cellular models using promoter-focused Capture-C.
39240351|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of type 2 diabetes loci, with the vast majority of signals located in non-coding regions; as a consequence, it remains largely unclear which 'effector' genes these variants influence. Determining these effector genes has been hampered by the relatively challenging cellular settings in which they are hypothesised to confer their effects. METHODS: To implicate such effector genes, we elected to generate and integrate high-resolution promoter-focused Capture-C, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq datasets to characterise chromatin and expression profiles in multiple cell lines relevant to type 2 diabetes for subsequent functional follow-up analyses: EndoC-BH1 (pancreatic beta cell), HepG2 (hepatocyte) and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS; adipocyte). RESULTS: The subsequent variant-to-gene analysis implicated 810 candidate effector genes at 370 type 2 diabetes risk loci. Using partitioned linkage disequilibrium score regression, we observed enrichment for type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose GWAS loci in promoter-connected putative cis-regulatory elements in EndoC-BH1 cells as well as fasting insulin GWAS loci in SGBS cells. Moreover, as a proof of principle, when we knocked down expression of the SMCO4 gene in EndoC-BH1 cells, we observed a statistically significant increase in insulin secretion. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results provide a resource for comparing tissue-specific data in tractable cellular models as opposed to relatively challenging primary cell settings.
