38977712|t|A prospective multi-center study quantifying visual inattention in delirium using generative models of the visual processing stream.
38977712|a|The visual attentional deficits in delirium are poorly characterized. Studies have highlighted neuro-anatomical abnormalities in the visual processing stream but fail at quantifying these abnormalities at a functional level. To identify these deficits, we undertook a multi-center eye-tracking study where we recorded 210 sessions from 42 patients using a novel eye-tracking system that was made specifically for free-viewing in the (ICU); each session lasted 10 min and was labeled with the delirium status of the patient using the Confusion Assessment Method in ICU (CAM-ICU). To analyze this data, we formulate the task of visual attention as a hierarchical generative process that yields a probabilistic distribution of the location of the next fixation. This distribution can then be compared to the measured patient fixation producing a correctness score which is tallied compared across delirium status. This analysis demonstrated that the visual processing system of patients suffering from delirium is functionally restricted to a statistically significant degree. This is the first study to explore the potential mechanisms underpinning visual inattention in delirium and suggests a new target of future research into a disease process that affects one in four hospitalized patients with severe short and long-term consequences.
