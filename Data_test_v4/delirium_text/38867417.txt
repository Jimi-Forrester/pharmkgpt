38867417|a|INTRODUCTION: Remote unsupervised cognitive assessments have the potential to complement and facilitate cognitive assessment in clinical and research settings. METHODS: Here, we evaluate the usability, validity, and reliability of unsupervised remote memory assessments via mobile devices in individuals without dementia from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study and explore their prognostic utility regarding future cognitive decline. RESULTS: Usability was rated positively; remote memory assessments showed good construct validity with traditional neuropsychological assessments and were significantly associated with tau-positron emission tomography and downstream magnetic resonance imaging measures. Memory performance at baseline was associated with future cognitive decline and prediction of future cognitive decline was further improved by combining remote digital memory assessments with plasma p-tau217. Finally, retest reliability was moderate for a single assessment and good for an aggregate of two sessions. DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrate that unsupervised digital memory assessments might be used for diagnosis and prognosis in Alzheimer's disease, potentially in combination with plasma biomarkers. HIGHLIGHTS: Remote and unsupervised digital memory assessments are feasible in older adults and individuals in early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Digital memory assessments are associated with neuropsychological in-clinic assessments, tau-positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging measures. Combination of digital memory assessments with plasma p-tau217 holds promise for prognosis of future cognitive decline. Future validation in further independent, larger, and more diverse cohorts is needed to inform clinical implementation.
