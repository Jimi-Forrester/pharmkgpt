18392211|t|[Behavioural and psychological signs in dementia. Clinical features. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies].
18392211|a|In first term, we define the current concepts in regard to psychosis (delirium and hallucinations) and abnormal behaviours (aggression, depression and mood changes such as mania, apathy, anxiety, agitation and desinhibition) in dementia. We also review the most used drugs in order to control these symptoms (typical and atypical antipsychotics, anti-epileptic drugs, benzodiazepines, SSRI, memantine and AcheI). As well, we take in consideration pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, relationship to aging and interactions of these medications. Finally, we briefly describe the management of non-pharmacological of the most common behavioural symptoms: disruptive conducts such as exaggerated responses to minimal stimuli, catastrophic reaction, violence, anger and hostility, wandering and sundowning. As well, we discuss how to manage sleep disturbances, sexual aggression, incontinence and dressing apraxia. Management of these conditions involves, in first term, a comprehensive understanding of the whole situation and identification of underlying possible causes will make possible to evaluate results. This approach will lead to a more rationale proposal of psychotherapeutic and behavioural techniques, and milieu modifications. Finaly, we consider safety patient's in the community as well as the risk of abuse originated in a non-healthy patient-caregiver relationship.
