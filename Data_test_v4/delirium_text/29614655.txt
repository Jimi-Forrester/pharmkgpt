29614655|a|BACKGROUND: Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Abeta42 may be the earliest manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Knowledge on how CSF Abeta interacts with different brain pathologies early in the disease process is limited. We examined how CSF Abeta markers relate to brain atrophy and white matter lesions (WMLs) in octogenarians with and without dementia to explore the earliest pathogenetic pathways of AD in the oldest old. OBJECTIVE: To study CSF amyloid biomarkers in relation to brain atrophy and WMLs in 85-year-olds with and without dementia. METHODS: 53 octogenarians took part in neuropsychiatric examinations and underwent both a lumbar puncture and a brain CT scan. CSF levels of Abeta42 and Abeta40 were examined in relation to cerebral atrophy and WMLs. Dementia was diagnosed. RESULTS: In 85-year-olds without dementia, lower levels of both CSF Abeta42 and CSF Abeta40 were associated with WMLs. CSF Abeta42 also correlated with measures of central atrophy, but not with cortical atrophy. In participants with dementia, lower CSF levels of Abeta42 were related to frontal, temporal, and parietal cortical atrophy but not to WMLs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may suggest that there is an interrelationship between Abeta and subcortical WMLs in older persons without dementia. After onset of dementia, low CSF Abeta42, probably representing amyloid deposition in plaques, is associated with cortical atrophy. WMLs may be an earlier manifestation of Abeta deposition than cortical degeneration.
