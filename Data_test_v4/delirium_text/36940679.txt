36940679|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment (CI) in patients with chronic kidney disease, including those treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a growing problem worldwide. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of CI and associated factors in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 18 consecutive patients with PD therapy and 15 controls were evaluated for CI using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE III) test. RESULTS: The prevalence of CI was 33% in patients and 27% in the control group and was not statistically significant. A higher prevalence of CI was found in subjects aged >=65 years old than in those <65years old (p = 0.02), but only in the control group. The prevalence of CI in PD patients over and under 65 years of age did not differ statistically significantly (p = 0.12). Memory and verbal fluency were the most affected cognitive domain in PD patients with CI (p = 0.00, p = 0.04, respectively). There was a significant correlation between higher-educated PD patients and the ACE III test results. The duration of dialysis did not affect the results of the cognitive screening test. CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairment is a growing problem in the course of chronic kidney disease and dialysis therapy. It seems that cognitive problems may occur in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis at a younger age than in the general population with particularly affected memory and verbal fluency. Higher-educated patients score better on the cognitive screening test.
