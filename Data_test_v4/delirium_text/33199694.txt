33199694|t|Critical roles of FAM134B in ER-phagy and diseases.
33199694|a|FAM134B (also called JK-1, RETREG1), a member of the family with sequence similarity 134, was originally discovered as an oncogene in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, its most famous function is that of an ER-phagy-regulating receptor. Over the decades, the powerful biological functions of FAM134B were gradually revealed. Overwhelming evidence indicates that its dysfunction is related to pathophysiological processes such as neuropathy, viral replication, inflammation, and cancer. This review describes the biological functions of FAM134B, focusing on its role in ER-phagy. In addition, we summarize the diseases in which it is involved and review the underlying mechanisms.
