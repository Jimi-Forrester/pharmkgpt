39394908|t|Toward Understanding the Mechanism of Client-Selective Small Molecule Inhibitors of the Sec61 Translocon.
39394908|a|The Sec61 translocon mediates the translocation of numerous, newly synthesized precursor proteins into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum or their integration into its membrane. Recently, structural biology revealed conformations of idle or substrate-engaged Sec61, and likewise its interactions with the accessory membrane proteins Sec62, Sec63, and TRAP, respectively. Several natural and synthetic small molecules have been shown to block Sec61-mediated protein translocation. Since this is a key step in protein biogenesis, broad inhibition is generally cytotoxic, which may be problematic for a putative drug target. Interestingly, several compounds exhibit client-selective modes of action, such that only translocation of certain precursor proteins was affected. Here, we discuss recent advances of structural biology, molecular modelling, and molecular screening that aim to use Sec61 as feasible drug target.
