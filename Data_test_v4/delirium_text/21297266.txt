21297266|t|Implication of a genetic variant at PICALM in Alzheimer's disease patients and centenarians.
21297266|a|A common polymorphism (rs3851179) in the PICALM (phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein) gene has been recently associated with reduced risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). We analyzed the genotype and allele distributions of the PICALM polymorphism in 813 Italian subjects, including LOAD patients and centenarians. The segregation of the PICALM rs3851179 showed no statistically significant difference between LOAD cases and controls. The implication of a genetic variant at PICALM is confirmed for the first time, in centenarians, thus suggesting a possible role in longevity.
