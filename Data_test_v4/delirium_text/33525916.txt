33525916|t|A Discussion on the Criteria for Surgical Decision-Making in Elderly Patients With Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression.
33525916|a|STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. OBJECTIVES: Although the role of surgery in the management of metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) has been well established, elderly patients may still be denied surgery because of higher risk of complications and shorter life expectancy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether elderly patients with MSCC could benefit from surgery and discuss the criteria for surgical decision-making in such patients. METHODS: Enrolled in this study were 55 consecutive patients aged 75 years or older who were surgically treated for MSCC in our center. Prognostic factors predicting overall survival (OS) were explored by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. The quality of life (QoL) of the patients was evaluated by the SOSGOQ and compared using Student's t test. Risk factors for postoperative complications were identified by Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Surgical treatment for MSCC substantially improved the neurological function in 55.8% patients and QoL in 88.5% patients with acceptable rates of postoperative complications (16.4%), reoperation (9.1%), and 30-day mortality (1.8%). Postoperative ECOG-PS of 1-2, total en-bloc spondylectomy (TES), and postoperative chemotherapy were favorable prognostic factors for OS, while a high Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and a long operation time were risk factors for postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery should be encouraged for elderly patients with MSCC 1) who are compromised by the current or potential neurological dysfunction; 2) with radioresistant tumors; 3) with spinal instability; and 4) with no comorbidity, ECOG-PS of 0-2, and systemic treatment adherence. In addition, surgery should be performed by a skilled and experienced surgical team.
