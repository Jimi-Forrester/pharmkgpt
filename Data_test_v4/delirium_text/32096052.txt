32096052|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau and phosphorylated tau (ptau) are definite biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). After discovery of presence and increased levels tau in CSF from AD patients using specific ELISA, numerous reports revealed that CSF levels of tau are increased in AD and brain injury, phosphorylated tau are specifically increased in AD. Many large cohort studies also confirmed that natural course of CSF tau and ptau levels initiated from cognitively unimpaired AD stage after longstanding progress of brain Ass amyloidosis. Close correlation with neuroimaging findings of Tau PET and with deterioration of cognitive function domains have been elucidated. CSF tau also increase in neurodegeneration and acute brain injury. Global standardization, assay technology inventions, and research of tau kinetics from brain synthesis and clearance into CSF are developing. Trace amount of plasma p-tau assay are also validated. Development of these studies provide that CSF tau is the biomarker of CNS neurodegeneration and CSF ptau is the specific biomarker of CNS tauopathy. Assays of CSF and plasma tau and ptau are essential tools not only for prediction and diagnosis of AD and but for newly developing disease modified therapies of AD.
