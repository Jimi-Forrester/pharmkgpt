37986337|t|Homocysteine and Lp-PLA2 levels: Diagnostic value in coronary heart disease.
37986337|a|Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Identifying effective diagnostic markers and understanding risk factors is crucial for prevention and management. This study aimed to investigate the levels of homocysteine (Hcy) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) in human plasma and their roles in the diagnosis and prognosis of CHD. A retrospective study was conducted on 232 patients with CHD, divided into Acute Myocardial Infarction, unstable angina pectoris, and stable angina pectoris groups, and a control group of 75 healthy adults. Blood samples were analyzed for serum Hcy and Lp-PLA2 levels using the cycling enzyme method and ELISA method, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the risk factors, and diagnostic efficacy was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. No significant differences in age and sex were observed between the study and control groups, whereas marked disparities in risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia were noted. Significant differences in serum Hcy and Lp-PLA2 levels were identified among the CHD subgroups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that Hcy, Lp-PLA2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were significant risk factors for CHD. The combined diagnostic Area Under the Curve (AUC) for Hcy and Lp-PLA2 was found to be higher than that when using them individually. This study identified the elevation of Hcy and Lp-PLA2 levels as independent risk factors for CHD, and their conjoint analysis significantly enhanced clinical diagnostic efficacy. These findings provide valuable insights for CHD diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, highlighting the importance of these markers in CHD management.
