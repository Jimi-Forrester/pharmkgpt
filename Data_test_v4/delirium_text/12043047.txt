12043047|t|[PAX-6 gene promoter polymorphism and other factors involved in brain atrophy in alcohol dependent patients].
12043047|a|PAX-6 gene promoter polymorphism, alcohol dependence history and CT were determined in the group of 68 alcoholics. We found negative correlation between numbers of PAX-6 gene promoter B (AC)m (AG)n repeats and atrophy of the brain and the cerebellum. Occurrence of these lesions was correlated with a decrease of alcohol tolerance, withdrawal symptoms--especially delirium tremens.
