30186401|a|The present study aims to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (Dex) on hemodynamics, postoperative analgesia and cognition in cesarean section. One hundred and two pregnant women who underwent cesarean section were selected from August 2016 to July 2017 in People's Hospital of Zhangqiu District and randomly divided into control group and observation group. Control group was anesthetized with bupivacaine hydrochloride, and morphine + ropivacaine hydrochloride were given postoperatively. Observation group received intraoperative anesthesia with bupivacaine hydrochloride and Dex, and Dex + ropivacaine hydrochloride were given for postoperative analgesia. Hemodynamic factors were compared between the two groups. Postoperative Ramsay sedation score, the incidence of adverse reactions and the incidence of transient neurological syndrome (TNS) were compared between the two groups. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scoring were performed to evaluate the cognitive function of the two groups. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of the observation group after anesthesia were significantly lower than those of control group (P<0.05). The Ramsay sedation score of the observation group was significantly better than that of control group at different time-points after surgery (P<0.05). Incidence of postoperative agitation in observation group was significantly lower than that in control group (P<0.05). Incidence of TNS in observation group was significantly lower than that in control group during 1 week after surgery (P<0.05). MoCA and MMSE scores of the observation group were better than that of control group at 1 day after operation (P<0.05). The use of Dex anesthesia in cesarean section can achieve more stable hemodynamic conditions during perioperative period and more obvious analgesic effect after operation. It also reduced the incidence of postoperative TNS and cognitive dysfunction, and had important clinical significance.
