26920926|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors associated with postoperative delirium (PD) in elderly patients following total hip arthroplasty (THA) for hip fracture. METHODS: This prospective study enrolled elderly patients (>= 65 years) with hip fractures who underwent THA under general anaesthesia, and who had a complete set of postoperative observations. Detailed medical history and perioperative characteristics were recorded. During the postoperative period, patients were assessed twice daily for PD using the Confusion Assessment Method. RESULTS: A total of 572 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study. Of these, 120 patients (21.0%) were diagnosed with PD and 452 patients (79.0%) did not experience PD. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analyses showed that older age, a history of stroke, lower albumin, higher blood glucose, higher total bilirubin, higher C-reactive protein, longer surgery duration and higher volume of red blood cell transfusions were independent risk factors for PD. CONCLUSIONS: Correcting the modifiable risk factors might help prevent PD. Strategies might include nutritional support, tight blood glucose control, improvement of liver function, preoperative infection control and minimizing surgical injury or blood loss.
