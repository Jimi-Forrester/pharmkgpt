39452683|t|Validity and Reliability of the Japanese Version of the Frontal Assessment Battery in Patients with Stroke.
39452683|a|BACKGROUND: The Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), which is used to assess executive function, has been translated into several languages and shown to be valid and reliable. However, the validity and reliability of the Japanese version in patients with stroke are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the validity and reliability of the Japanese version of the FAB in patients with stroke. METHODS: The Japanese version of the FAB for dementia was modified and evaluated in 52 patients with stroke. FAB measurements were obtained twice over a 10-day period. Convergent validity was assessed using the Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT) and the Trail Making Test (TMT) part B. Internal consistency was measured using Cronbach's alpha (Calpha). Test-retest evaluations were performed using intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC (2.1)] measurements, and limits of agreement (LOA) were calculated using the total FAB score. RESULTS: The mean total FAB score was 13.4 +- 2.8 points, the ICC (2.1) was 0.856, and Calpha was 0.92. The total FAB score was correlated with SCWT scores for parts I through IV (r = 0.70 to 0.77) and the TMT score for part B (rho = -0.53). The LOA were -1.7 to 2.9 points. CONCLUSIONS: The Japanese version of the FAB had higher validity and reliability in patients with stroke.
