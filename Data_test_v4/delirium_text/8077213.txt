8077213|t|Thrombin receptor activation induces secretion and nonamyloidogenic processing of amyloid beta-protein precursor.
8077213|a|The amyloid beta-protein (A beta) and protease nexin-2/amyloid beta-protein precursor (PN-2/A beta PP) are major constituents of senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits in individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. It has been suggested that the coagulation protease thrombin may process A beta PP in a manner leading to the formation of A beta. Here we investigated the effects of thrombin on the secretion and processing of PN-2/A beta PP and the production of A beta in a cellular system. Incubation of glioblastoma cells with thrombin (1-5 nM) resulted in the accumulation of abnormally processed, carboxyl-terminal-truncated forms of secreted PN-2/A beta PP (approximately 85 kDa) in the culture medium. Higher concentrations of thrombin (> 10 nM) also increased the levels of secreted PN-2/A beta PP in cultured untransfected glioblastoma cells and glioblastoma cells that were stably transfected to overproduce the 695 isoform of A beta PP. Increased secretion of PN-2/A beta PP required the proteolytic activity of thrombin, was induced by activation of the thrombin receptor by agonist peptides, and required activation of protein kinase C. Incubation of the untransfected and transfected glioblastoma cells with thrombin led to decreased levels of soluble A beta in the culture medium consistent with previously suggested mechanisms regarding the secretion of PN-2/A beta PP. Although the present studies suggest that thrombin does not directly contribute to A beta formation, its proteolysis of secreted PN-2/A beta PP may disrupt regions near the carboxyl terminus of the secreted proteins that account for their neuroprotective and cell adhesive properties.
