38239533|t|The Intertwined Relationship Between an Overactive Thyroid and an Overactive Mind: A Case Report and Review of Literature.
38239533|a|This case report presents the clinical scenario of a 45-year-old male patient who exhibited acute psychiatric symptoms as the initial manifestation of Graves' disease, a common etiology of hyperthyroidism. The patient presented with severe agitation, persecutory delusions, and auditory hallucinations, raising concerns about his mental health. Detailed diagnostic evaluations revealed thyroid dysfunction characterized by markedly low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, elevated free T4 levels, and increased total T3 levels, indicative of thyrotoxicosis. Elevated thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) levels further confirmed the diagnosis of Graves' disease. The patient received treatment with methimazole and propranolol to manage the hyperthyroidism, leading to the resolution of psychiatric symptoms. This case emphasizes the importance of considering thyroid function in patients presenting with acute psychiatric disturbances. This literature review explores the intricate relationship between hyperthyroidism, a condition characterized by the excessive production of thyroid hormones, and its impact on psychological and cognitive processes. Understanding the connection between an overactive thyroid and an overactive mind is crucial for clinicians and researchers to provide comprehensive care and treatment for affected individuals.
