38833506|t|A systematic screen identifies Saf5 as a link between splicing and transcription in fission yeast.
38833506|a|Splicing is an important step of gene expression regulation in eukaryotes, as there are many mRNA precursors that can be alternatively spliced in different tissues, at different cell cycle phases or under different external stimuli. We have developed several integrated fluorescence-based in vivo splicing reporter constructs that allow the quantification of fission yeast splicing in vivo on intact cells, and we have compared their splicing efficiency in a wild type strain and in a prp2-1 (U2AF65) genetic background, showing a clear dependency between Prp2 and a consensus signal at 5' splicing site (5'SS). To isolate novel genes involved in regulated splicing, we have crossed the reporter showing more intron retention with the Schizosaccharomyces pombe knock out collection. Among the candidate genes involved in the regulation of splicing, we have detected strong splicing defects in two of the mutants -Deltacwf12, a member of the NineTeen Complex (NTC) and Deltasaf5, a methylosome subunit that acts together with the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex in small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) biogenesis. We have identified that strains with mutations in cwf12 have inefficient splicing, mainly when the 5'SS differs from the consensus. However, although Deltasaf5 cells also have some dependency on 5'SS sequence, we noticed that when one intron of a given pre-mRNA was affected, the rest of the introns of the same pre-mRNA had high probabilities of being also affected. This observation points Saf5 as a link between transcription rate and splicing.
