26832806|a|BACKGROUND: Risk factors for embolism and recurrence of primary cardiac myxoma are not well established. This study aimed to assess the risk factors for embolism and recurrence of cardiac myxoma, as well as the survival of the patients. METHODS: The medical records of 207 consecutive patients treated for primary cardiac myxoma between September 1988 and October 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. All diagnoses were pathologically confirmed. Data were collected to identify the risk factors influencing the prognosis. RESULTS: Mean age at surgery was 44.2 +- 15.8 years. Operative mortality (within 30 days of the surgery) occurred in seven patients. Mean follow-up was 9.35 +- 6.55 years. Embolism occurred in 32 (15.5 %) patients before surgery. Multivariate analysis indicated that small (<= 4.5 cm) myxoma (OR = 5.14; 95 % CI, 2.30-11.94; P < 0.0001) and soft, gelatinous myxoma (OR = 5.84; 95 % CI, 1.91-25.61; P = 0.001) were independently associated with the occurrence of embolism. Ten patients experienced recurrences. After excluding the patients who died within 30 days of surgery, survival was 92.7 % at 10 years. Age, sex, tumor size, cardiopulmonary bypass duration, aortic cross clamp duration, tumor appearance, and pre-operative embolism were not associated with early mortality. Multivariate analysis showed that multicentric myxomas were independently associated with recurrence (OR = 9.45, 95 % CI, 2.15-41.3, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The surgical resection of primary cardiac myxoma is associated with excellent long-term survival. Tumors <= 4.5 cm and soft tumors were independent risk factors for embolism. Multicentric cardiac myxoma was an independent risk factors for recurrence of myxoma.
