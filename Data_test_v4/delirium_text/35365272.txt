35365272|t|The Impact of COVID-19 on the Oral Health of Patients with Special Needs.
35365272|a|In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global public health emergency due to the spread of COVID-19, and medical and dental elective care was suspended, disproportionally affecting persons with special needs. As many of the special needs population live in a communal environment, they were at higher risk of being infected with and dying of COVID-19. Consequently, their access to medical and dental services was limited to emergency care. A method of reaching these populations evolved by the expansion of telehealth, including dentistry, to provide diagnosis, management, prevention, and provision of psychosocial support for patients.
