There is increasing evidence that sepsis may result in an impaired health related quality of life. The aim of this study was to investigate whether health related quality of life is impaired in sepsis survivors and which clinical parameters are associated with the affected health related quality of life. METHODS: We analyzed 880 Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaires that were sent to sepsis survivors who participated in the Prehospital Antibiotics Against Sepsis (PHANTASi) trial. These questionnaires were sent by email, 28 days after discharge. Data entry and statistical analyses were performed in SPSS. The data from the general Dutch population, was obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI-AVL) and served as a control group. Subsequently, 567 sepsis survivors were matched to 567 controls. Non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to compare these two groups. Within the group, we sought to explain the diminished health related quality of life by factor analysis. RESULTS: We found that sepsis survivors have a worse health related quality of life compared to the general Dutch population. This negative effect was more evident for the physical component than the mental component of health related quality of life. We found that health related quality of life was significantly altered by advancing age and female sex. We also found that the total length of stay (in the hospital) and (previous) comorbidity negatively affect the physical component of health related quality of life. CONCLUSION: In our study we found that health related quality of life in sepsis survivors, 28 days after discharge, is severely diminished in comparison with the general Dutch population. The physical domain is severely affected, whereas the mental domain is less influenced. The length of stay, comorbidity, advancing age and female sex all have a negative effect on the Physical Component Scale of the health related quality of life.
