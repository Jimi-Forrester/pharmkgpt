28801605|t|Luteolin, a natural flavonoid, inhibits methylglyoxal induced apoptosis via the mTOR/4E-BP1 signaling pathway.
28801605|a|Methylglyoxal (MG) accumulation has been observed in human cerebrospinal fluid and body tissues under hyperglycaemic conditions. Recent research has demonstrated that MG-induces neuronal cell apoptosis, which promotes the development of diabetic encephalopathy. Our previous animal study has shown that luteolin, a natural flavonoid, attenuates diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction. To further explore the neuroprotective properties of luteolin, we investigated the inhibitive effect of luteolin on MG-induced apoptosis in PC12 neuronal cells. We found that MG inhibited cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and induced apoptosis in PC12 cells. Pretreatment with Luteolin significantly elevated cell viability, reduced MG-induced apoptosis, inhibited the activation of the mTOR/4E-BP1 signaling pathway, and decreased pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax, Cytochrome C as well as caspase-3. Furthermore, we found that pretreatment with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, significantly reduced the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Therefore, these observations unambiguously suggest that the inhibitive effect of Luteolin against MG-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells is associated with inhibition of the mTOR/4E-BP1 signaling pathway.
