30393754|t|Hypothesis: Fever control, a niche for alpha-2 agonists in the setting of septic shock and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome?
30393754|a|During severe septic shock and/or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients present with a limited cardio-ventilatory reserve (low cardiac output and blood pressure, low mixed venous saturation, increased lactate, low PaO2/FiO2 ratio, etc.), especially when elderly patients or co-morbidities are considered. Rescue therapies (low dose steroids, adding vasopressin to noradrenaline, proning, almitrine, NO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, etc.) are complex. Fever, above 38.5-39.5 C, increases both the ventilatory (high respiratory drive: large tidal volume, high respiratory rate) and the metabolic (increased O2 consumption) demands, further limiting the cardio-ventilatory reserve. Some data (case reports, uncontrolled trial, small randomized prospective trials) suggest that control of elevated body temperature ("fever control") leading to normothermia (35.5-37 C) will lower both the ventilatory and metabolic demands: fever control should simplify critical care management when limited cardio-ventilatory reserve is at stake. Usually fever control is generated by a combination of general anesthesia ("analgo-sedation", light total intravenous anesthesia), antipyretics and cooling. However general anesthesia suppresses spontaneous ventilation, making the management more complex. At variance, alpha-2 agonists (clonidine, dexmedetomidine) administered immediately following tracheal intubation and controlled mandatory ventilation, with prior optimization of volemia and atrio-ventricular conduction, will reduce metabolic demand and facilitate normothermia. Furthermore, after a rigorous control of systemic acidosis, alpha-2 agonists will allow for accelerated emergence without delirium, early spontaneous ventilation, improved cardiac output and micro-circulation, lowered vasopressor requirements and inflammation. Rigorous prospective randomized trials are needed in subsets of patients with a high fever and spiraling toward refractory septic shock and/or presenting with severe ARDS.
