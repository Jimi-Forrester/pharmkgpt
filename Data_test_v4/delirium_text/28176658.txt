28176658|t|A Structural View of alphaB-crystallin Assembly and Amyloid Aggregation.
28176658|a|The major len protein alphaB-crystallin (alphaB) is an intracellular chaperone. It belongs to the family of small heat shock proteins (sHsps) which plays a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing protein aggregation, especially under stress conditions. Dysfunction of alphaB is closely related to cataract, and many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Due to the extremely heterogeneous and polydispersed nature of alphaB, it remains unclear how alphaB self-assemblies and prevents its client proteins from aggregation. In this minireview, we summarize the structural studies of alphaB in self-assembly, chaperoning client proteins and amyloid aggregation. We also mention the recent progress in identification of small molecules preventing alphaB aggregation for potential cataract treatment. This review highlights the polymorphic structures of alphaB under different conditions and its wide-spectrum chaperone activities, and sheds light on understanding the complex relationship among alphaB, client proteins and the related diseases.
