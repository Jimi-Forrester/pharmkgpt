35573572|a|Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a challenging global health problem with increasing prevalence worldwide. Concurrence of CKD and comorbidities results in the use of multiple medications and exposing patients to polypharmacy. Polypharmacy in CKD is common across all the stages of the disease and leads to poor medication adherence, higher healthcare costs, and drug-related problems, such as drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). DDIs and ADRs in CKD patients may lower the quality of life, increase the length of hospital stay, and augment the risks of morbidity and mortality. Methodology This was a hospital-based, prospective, cross-sectional study conducted in a secondary care hospital. The study population comprised 130 adult CKD patients admitted to the nephrology department including those on maintenance hemodialysis. Study-related data were obtained from the electronic patient case records. Medications prescribed to the patients were analyzed for potential DDIs (pDDIs) using Portable Emergency and Primary Care Information Database (PEPID 12.1) drug interaction checker. All observed and reported suspected ADRs related to the prescribed drugs were evaluated for causality, severity, preventability, and predictability. Results Out of the 130 patients, majority were males (n = 71, 54.6%), in the age group of 61-70 years (n = 45, 34.6%), and belonged to CKD stage 5 (n = 105, 80.8%). The mean number of drugs prescribed was 11.1 +- 3.8 per patient. The prevalence of pDDIs was found to be 89.2%. Upon analysis by the PEPID database, 708 pDDIs with 215 different pairs of interacting drugs were identified. Polypharmacy (odds ratio (OR): 62.34, 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.97-487.64, p < 0.001) was identified as an independent predictor of the occurrence of pDDIs. Negative binomial regression analysis revealed that dyslipidemia (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 2.7, 95% CI 2.09-3.48, p < 0.001) and diabetes (IRR: 1.2, 95% CI 1.01-1.54, p = 0.040) increased the probability of occurrence of pDDI by 2.7 and 1.2 folds, respectively. Furthermore, the likelihood of pDDI increased with every one-day increase in the length of hospital stay (IRR: 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.03, p = 0.015) by 1.02 times and polypharmacy (IRR: 6.30, 95% CI 3.04-13.02, p < 0.001) by 6.3 times. The incidence of ADRs was found to be 10.7%. Majority of suspected ADRs were possible (n = 7, 50.0%), of mild and moderate severity (n = 7, 50.0%), and non-preventable (n = 8, 57.1%) type. Conclusions This study investigated two important drug-related problems, pDDIs, and ADRs, in the CKD population. High proportion of CKD patients in the study had pDDIs. Comorbid conditions such as dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus, length of hospital stay, and polypharmacy were significantly associated with increased likelihood of pDDIs. Furthermore, there was a burden of ADRs in the study population, of which most ADRs were possible and of mild to moderate severity. Prevention, identification, and resolution of these problems in CKD patients is important and can be achieved through medication optimization, which requires a proactive interdisciplinary collaboration between clinicians, clinical pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals.
