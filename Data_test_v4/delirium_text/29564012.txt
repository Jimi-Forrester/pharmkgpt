29564012|t|The use of 4,4,4-trifluorothreonine to stabilize extended peptide structures and mimic beta-strands.
29564012|a|Pentapeptides having the sequence R-HN-Ala-Val-X-Val-Leu-OMe, where the central residue X is L-serine, L-threonine, (2S,3R)-L-CF3-threonine and (2S,3S)-L-CF3-threonine were prepared. The capacity of (2S,3S)- and (2S,3R)-CF3-threonine analogues to stabilize an extended structure when introduced in the central position of pentapeptides is demonstrated by NMR conformational studies and molecular dynamics simulations. CF3-threonine containing pentapeptides are more prone to mimic beta-strands than their natural Ser and Thr pentapeptide analogues. The proof of concept that these fluorinated beta-strand mimics are able to disrupt protein-protein interactions involving beta-sheet structures is provided. The CF3-threonine containing pentapeptides interact with the amyloid peptide Abeta1-42 in order to reduce the protein-protein interactions mediating its aggregation process.
