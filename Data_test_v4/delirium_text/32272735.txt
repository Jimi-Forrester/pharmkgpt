32272735|t|Bioactive Polyphenols and Neuromodulation: Molecular Mechanisms in Neurodegeneration.
32272735|a|The interest in dietary polyphenols in recent years has greatly increased due to their antioxidant bioactivity with preventive properties against chronic diseases. Polyphenols, by modulating different cellular functions, play an important role in neuroprotection and are able to neutralize the effects of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Interestingly, all these mechanisms are involved in neurodegeneration. Although polyphenols display differences in their effectiveness due to interindividual variability, recent studies indicated that bioactive polyphenols in food and beverages promote health and prevent age-related cognitive decline. Polyphenols have a poor bioavailability and their digestion by gut microbiota produces active metabolites. In fact, dietary bioactive polyphenols need to be modified by microbiota present in the intestine before being absorbed, and to exert health preventive effects by interacting with cellular signalling pathways. This literature review includes an evaluation of the literature in English up to December 2019 in PubMed and Web of Science databases. A total of 307 studies, consisting of research reports, review articles and articles were examined and 146 were included. The review highlights the role of bioactive polyphenols in neurodegeneration, with a particular emphasis on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are modulated by polyphenols involved in protection from oxidative stress and apoptosis prevention.
