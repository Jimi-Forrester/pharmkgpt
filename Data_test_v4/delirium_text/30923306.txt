30923306|t|Iatrogenic Ventriculitis Due to Mycoplasma Hominis: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.
30923306|a|BACKGROUND Mycoplasma hominis, which rarely causes infection after neurosurgical procedures, is a small free-living organism, belonging to the genus Mycoplasma. M. hominis lacks a rigid cell wall and cannot be clearly visualized by routine light microscopy. Thus, it is challenging to diagnose infections caused by this pathogen. Here, we report a case of Mycoplasma hominis causing iatrogenic ventriculitis secondary to extraventricular drain. CASE REPORT A 25-year-old man who was a victim of a road traffic accident developed M. hominis ventriculitis secondary to extraventricular drain. Despite a delay in the diagnosis due to the difficulty of identifying M. hominis, the patient was successfully treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin 400 mg for 14 days. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this case report, coupled with a thorough review of the literature, demonstrate the pathogenic potential of M. hominis. Particularly in developing countries, in which laboratories may have limited access to advanced technologies, such rare infectious diseases remain major diagnostic challenges.
