34669022|a|PURPOSE: High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX)-associated acute kidney injury with delayed MTX clearance has been linked to an excess in MTX-induced toxicities. Glucarpidase is a recombinant enzyme that rapidly hydrolyzes MTX into non-toxic metabolites. The recommended dose of glucarpidase is 50 U/kg, which has never been formally established in a dose finding study in humans. Few case reports, mostly in children, suggest that lower doses of glucarpidase might be equally effective in lowering MTX levels. METHODS: Seven patients with toxic MTX plasma concentrations following HDMTX therapy were treated with half-dose glucarpidase (mean 25 U/kg, range 17-32 U/kg). MTX levels were measured immunologically as well as by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Toxicities were assessed according to National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. RESULTS: All patients experienced HDMTX-associated kidney injury (median increase in creatinine levels within 48 h after HDMTX initiation compared to baseline of 251%, range 80-455%) and showed toxic MTX plasma concentrations (range 3.1-182.4 micromol/L) before glucarpidase injection. The drug was administered 42-70 h after HDMTX initiation. Within one day after glucarpidase injection, MTX plasma concentrations decreased by >= 97.7% translating into levels of 0.02-2.03 micromol/L. MTX rebound was detected in plasma 42-73 h after glucarpidase initiation, but concentrations remained consistent at < 10 micromol/L. CONCLUSION: Half-dose glucarpidase seems to be effective in lowering MTX levels to concentrations manageable with continued intensified folinic acid rescue.
