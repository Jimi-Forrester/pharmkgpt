16514368|t|Magnetic resonance spectroscopic study of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia/Pick complex.
16514368|a|Disease-specific metabolic changes in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia/Pick complex were examined by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3.0 T. Spectra were acquired from posterior and anterior cingulate cortices and the parieto-occipital and frontal white matter. This study included eight Alzheimer's disease patients, 10 frontotemporal dementia/Pick complex patients and 14 healthy volunteers. N-acetylaspartate/creatine+phosphocreatine ratio was reduced in the posterior cingulate cortex in the Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia/Pick complex patients. The Alzheimer's disease patients, however, showed a posterior dominant decrease, whereas the frontotemporal dementia/Pick complex patients showed a frontal predominant decrease. These different distributions of metabolic changes may represent the underlying pathological processes in each disease. Our standardized protocol of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurement may be helpful in differentiating these dementia subtypes.
