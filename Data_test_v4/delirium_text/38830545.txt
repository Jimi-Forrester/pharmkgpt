38830545|a|The integrity of the endothelial glycocalyx (eGCX), a mixture of carbohydrates attached to proteins expressed on the surface of blood vessel endothelial cells (EC), is critical for the maintenance of homeostasis of the cardiovascular system and all systems of the human body, the endothelium being the critical component of the stroma of all tissues. Consequently, dysfunction of eGCX results in a dysfunctional cardiovascular wall and severe downstream cardiovascular events, which contribute to the onset of cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as other age-related diseases (ARDs). The key role of eGCX dysfunction in the onset of ARDs is examined here, with a focus on the most prevalent neurological diseases: ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the advantages and limitations of some treatment strategies for anti-eGCX dysfunction are described, ranging from experimental drug therapies, which need to be better tested and explored not only in animal models but also in humans, as well as reprogramming, the use of nutraceuticals, which are emerging as regenerative and new approaches. The promotion of these strategies is essential to keep eGCX and endothelium healthy, as is the development of intravital (e.g., intravascular) tools to estimate eGCX health status and treatment efficacy, which could lead to advanced solutions to address ARDs.
