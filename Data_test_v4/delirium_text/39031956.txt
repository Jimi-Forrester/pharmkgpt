39031956|t|Axonal injury, sleep disturbances, and memory following traumatic brain injury.
39031956|a|OBJECTIVES: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with sleep deficits, but it is not clear why some report sleep disturbances and others do not. The objective of this study was to assess the associations between axonal injury, sleep, and memory in chronic and acute TBI. METHODS: Data were acquired from two independent datasets which included 156 older adult veterans (69.8 years) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with prior moderate-to-severe TBIs and 90 (69.2 years) controls and 374 (39.6 years) from Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) with a recent mild TBI (mTBI) and 87 controls (39.6 years), all who completed an MRI, memory assessment, and sleep questionnaire. RESULTS: Older adults with a prior TBI had a significant association between axonal injury and sleep disturbances [beta = 9.52, 95% CI (4.1, 14.9), p = 0.01]. Axonal injury predicted changes in memory over 1-year in TBI [beta = -8.72, 95% CI (-18, -2.7), p = 0.03]. We externally validated those findings in TRACK-TBI where axonal injury within 2 weeks after mTBI was significantly associated with higher sleep disturbances in the TBI group at 2 weeks[beta = -7.2, 95% CI (-14, -0.50), p = 0.04], 6 months [beta = -16, 95% CI (-24, -7.6), p <= 0.01], and 12 months post-injury [beta = -11, 95% CI (-19, -0.85), p = 0.03]. These associations were not significant in controls. INTERPRETATIONS: Axonal injury, specifically to the left anterior internal capsule is robustly associated with sleep disturbances in multiple TBI populations. Early assessment of axonal injury following mTBI could identify those at risk for persistent sleep disturbances following injury.
