38992599|a|BACKGROUND: Namaste Care offers practical skills for healthcare providers, volunteers, and families to meaningfully engage individuals with dementia in activities (e.g., music, massage, reminiscing, socialization, aromatherapy, snacks). A hospital-based specialized dementia care unit for patients with mid- to late-stage dementia offered an adapted version of the Namaste Care program, which was called Meaningful Moments. The aim of this study was to assess the acceptability and preliminary effects of this novel approach using trained volunteers for older adults with mid- to late-stage dementia. METHODS: A mixed methods multiphase design was used. Qualitative description was used to explore acceptability of the Meaningful Moments program delivered over 6 months through focus groups (e.g., charge nurses, therapeutic recreationists, nurses, social workers) and individual interviews with one volunteer and two family members. A prospective pre-post-test study design was used to evaluate the preliminary effects of the program for patients with dementia and family members. Outcomes included quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and pain for patients with dementia and family carer role stress and the quality of visits for families. Data were collected from June 2018 to April 2019. Descriptive analyses of participants' characteristics were expressed as a mean (standard deviation [SD]) for continuous variables and count (percent) for categorical variables. Focus group and individual interview data were analyzed using thematic analysis. The generalized estimating equations (GEE) method was used to assess change in the repeated measures outcome data. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients received the Meaningful Moments interventions. Families, staff, and volunteers perceived that patients experienced benefits from Meaningful Moments. Staff, volunteers, and families felt fulfilled in their role of engaging patients in the Meaningful Moments program. Individualized activities provided by volunteers were perceived as necessary for the patient population. There were no statistically significant improvements in patient outcomes. There was a statistically significant decline in family carer role stress. CONCLUSIONS: Using a one-on-one approach by volunteers, patients experienced perceived benefits such as improved mood and opportunities for social interactions. There is a need for tailored activities for older adults with advanced dementia through practical strategies that can offer benefit to patients.
