34013613|a|Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases are characterized by selective degeneration of specific brain areas. Although increasing number of studies report alteration of the extracellular matrix on these diseases, an exhaustive characterization at the brain's matrix level might contribute to the development of more efficient cell restoration therapies. In that regard, proteomics-based studies are a powerful approach to uncover matrix changes. However, to date, the majority of proteomics studies report no or only a few brain matrix proteins with altered expression. This study aims to reveal the changes in the brain extracellular matrix by integrating several proteomics-based studies performed with postmortem tissue. In total, 67 matrix proteins with altered expression were collected. By applying a bioinformatic approach, we were able to reveal the dysregulated biological processes. Among them are processes related to the organization of the extracellular matrix, glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans' metabolism, blood coagulation, and response to injury and oxidative stress. In addition, a protein was found altered in all three diseases-collagen type I alpha 2-and its binding partners further identified. A ClueGO network was created, depicting the GO groups associated with these binding partners, uncovering the processes that may consequently be affected. These include cellular adhesion, cell signaling through membrane receptors, inflammatory processes, and apoptotic cell death in response to oxidative stress. Overall, we were able to associate the contribution of the modification of extracellular matrix components to essential biological processes, highlighting the investment needed on proteomics studies with specific focus on the extracellular matrix in neurodegeneration.
