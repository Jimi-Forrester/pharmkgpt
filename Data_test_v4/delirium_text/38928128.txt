38928128|t|A Systematic Review of Genetics- and Molecular-Pathway-Based Machine Learning Models for Neurological Disorder Diagnosis.
38928128|a|The process of identification and management of neurological disorder conditions faces challenges, prompting the investigation of novel methods in order to improve diagnostic accuracy. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify the significance of genetics- and molecular-pathway-based machine learning (ML) models in treating neurological disorder conditions. According to the study's objectives, search strategies were developed to extract the research studies using digital libraries. We followed rigorous study selection criteria. A total of 24 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. We classified the studies based on neurological disorders. The included studies highlighted multiple methodologies and exceptional results in treating neurological disorders. The study findings underscore the potential of the existing models, presenting personalized interventions based on the individual's conditions. The findings offer better-performing approaches that handle genetics and molecular data to generate effective outcomes. Moreover, we discuss the future research directions and challenges, emphasizing the demand for generalizing existing models in real-world clinical settings. This study contributes to advancing knowledge in the field of diagnosis and management of neurological disorders.
