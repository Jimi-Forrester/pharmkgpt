37485386|t|Prebiotics for depression: how does the gut microbiota play a role?
37485386|a|Depression, a mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and aversion to activity that can interfere with daily life, is a condition of great concern. Prebiotics, which are non-digestible substances selectively utilized by host microorganisms for health benefits, have gained attention for their potential to improve overall wellness and alleviate various disorders including depression. This study aims to review clinical trials utilizing carbohydrate-type prebiotics such as inulin-type fructans, galactooligosaccharides (GOS), human milk oligosaccharides, resistant starch, prebiotic phytochemicals including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), chlorogenic acids, resveratrol, and prebiotic lipids (n-3 polysaturated fatty acids) to determine their effects on depression. Our findings suggest that GOS at a daily dosage of 5 g and eicosapentaenoic acid at or less than 1 g can effectively mitigate depressive symptoms. While EGCG exhibits potential antidepressant properties, a higher dosage of 3 g/d may be necessary to elicit significant effects. The plausible mechanisms underlying the impact of prebiotics on depression include the synthesis of neurotransmitters, production of short-chain fatty acids, and regulation of inflammation.
