30308744|a|OBJECTIVES: Psychological services to patients with cancer are very limited in Ireland. A dedicated psycho-oncology service was established at our Institution 18 months ago. The aim of this study was to examine referral rates, psychiatric diagnoses and treatment interventions in this patient group. METHODS: The clinical and psychiatric characteristics of consecutive patients (n = 63) referred to a recently established specialist psycho-oncology service in an Irish university teaching hospital over a one-year period were examined prospectively. International diagnostic criteria were applied. Forms of treatment instituted and clinical response to same were also audited. RESULTS: Over half (54%) of patients presented with affective disorder spectrum illnesses. The remaining referrals represented a diverse group of psychiatric diagnoses, but included a large proportion of patients with delirium. Approximately 20% of patients did not meet criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis. There was an over-representation of breast cancer and lymphoma. Thirty-eight per cent of patients were on prescribed corticosteroids at the time of referral. Eighty-two per cent of patients required some form of psychiatric intervention, and 86% of these benefited clinically from our intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that even in oncology services with good existing support networks, such as this one, the role of an additional input from liaison psychiatry is considerable.
