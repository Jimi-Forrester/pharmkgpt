35987974|a|Finding an effective cure for Alzheimer's disease has eluded scientists despite intense research. The disease is a cause of suffering for millions of people worldwide and is characterized by dementia accompanied by cognitive and motor deficits, ultimately culminating in the death of the patient. The course of the disease progression has various underlying contributing pathways, with the first and foremost factor being the development and accumulation of aberrant and misfolded proteins exhibiting neurotoxic functions. The impairment of cellular clearance mechanisms adds to their accumulation, resulting in neuronal death. This is where the PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology comes into play, bringing the UPS degradation machinery in the proximity of the target protein for initiating its degradation and clearing abnormal protein debris with unparalleled precision demonstrating an edge over traditional protein inhibitors in many respects. The technology is widely explored in cancer research and utilized in the treatment of various tumors and malignancies, and is now being applied in treating AD. This review explores the application of PROTAC technology in developing lead compounds for managing this deadly disease along with detailing the pieces of evidence justifying its utility and efficacy.
