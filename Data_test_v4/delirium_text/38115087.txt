38115087|a|BACKGROUND: To summarize the anesthesia management experience for pediatric day-case patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ligation under robot-assisted thoracoscopy and explore the key points of anesthesia management for this procedure. METHODS: The clinical data of 72 pediatric patients who underwent robot-assisted thoracoscopic day-case PDA ligation at the Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine from April 2021 to February 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. 0.3% ropivacaine local infiltration combined with S-ketamine 0.2 mg/kg intravenous injection was used for postoperative analgesia The patient's basic information and intraoperative conditions were analyzed, which included gender, age, weight, surgery time, anesthesia time, extubation time, intraoperative blood loss, MAP before pneumothorax, PaCO2 before pneumothorax, etc. Postoperative conditions were also monitored, such as PACU stay time, agitation during the recovery period, pain, and the incidence of nausea and vomiting. After discharge, the recovery status was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 70 pediatric patients who met the criteria for day-case PDA ligation were included in this study. Before the occurrence of pneumothorax, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) of these 70 patients was 69.58 +- 12.52 mmHg, and during controlled hypotension, the MAP was 54.96 +- 11.23 mmHg. Before the occurrence of pneumothorax, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) was 38.69 +- 3.38 mmHg, and during controlled hypotension, the PaCO2 was 51.42 +- 4.05 mmHg. Three cases experienced agitation during the recovery period, and four cases had mild pain, but there was no moderate or severe pain, nausea, or vomiting. Only 1 case of postoperative respiratory tract infection and 1 case of postoperative pneumothorax occurred. Within 30 days after discharge, the unplanned revisit rate, unplanned readmission rate, and surgical wound infection rate were all 0. The residual shunt rate detected by echocardiography was 0 after 1 month. CONCLUSIONS: The children under the robot-assisted thoracoscopic day case PDA surgeries in this study have limited trauma, little bleeding, and little postoperative pain, though still at a risk of respiratory infection and pneumothorax.
