37727691|a|Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is chronic liver damage caused by long-term heavy drinking with, extremely complicated pathogenesis. The current studies speculated that excessive alcohol and its metabolites are the major causes of liver cell toxicity. Autophagy is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes and aggravates alcoholic liver damage, through various mechanisms, such as cellular oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial damage and lipid metabolism disorders. Therefore, autophagy plays an critical role in the occurrence and development of ALD. Some studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine extracts improve the histological characteristics of ALD, as reflected in the improvement of oxidative stress and lipid droplet clearance, which might be achieved by inducing autophagy. This article reviews the mechanisms of quercetin, baicalin, glycycoumarin, salvianolic acid A, resveratrol, ginsenoside rg1, and dihydromyricetin inducing autophagy and their participation in the inhibition of ALD. The regulation of autophagy in ALD by these traditional Chinese medicine extracts provides novel ideas for the treatment of the disease; however, its molecular mechanism needs to be elucidated further.
