35402013|a|Although reports of neuropsychiatric side effects have been reported with efavirenz, these have been limited in comparison with regard to the now recommended dolutegravir regimens. We present a patient with new onset neuropsychiatric manifestations secondary to dolutegravir that resulted in significant physical injuries. The patient was initiated on risperidone for symptomatic control which was subsequently weaned and discontinued following reverting to an original efavirenz antiretroviral regimen, with resolution of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Neuropsychiatric side effects are increasingly noted with dolutegravir, and these should be monitored for on initiation and switching of treatment regimens.
