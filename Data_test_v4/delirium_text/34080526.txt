34080526|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common, irreversible and progressive form of dementia for which the exact pathology and cause are still not clear. At present, we are only confined to symptomatic treatment, and the lack of disease-modifying therapeutics is worrisome. Alteration of Wnt signaling has been linked to metabolic diseases as well as AD. The crosstalk between Canonical Wnt signaling and insulin signaling pathway has been widely studied and accepted from several clinical and preclinical studies that have proven the beneficial effect of antidiabetic medications in the case of memory and cognition loss. This structure-based in silico study was focused on exploring the link between the currently available FDA approved antidiabetic drugs and the Wnt signaling pathway. The library of antidiabetics was obtained from drug bank and was screened for their binding affinity with protein (PDB ID: 3S2K) LRP6, a coreceptor of the Wnt signaling pathway using GLIDE module of Schrodinger. The top molecules, with higher docking score, binding energy and stable interactions, were subjected to energy-based calculation using MMGBSA, followed by a molecular dynamics-based simulation study. Drugs of class alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) agonists were found to have a strong affinity towards LRP6 proteins, highlighting the possibility of the modulation of Wnt signaling by antidiabetics as one of the possible mechanisms for use in AD. However, further experimental based in vitro and in vivo studies are warranted for verification and support.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
