26852580|t|[THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF DEXMEDETOMIDINE FOR SEDATION OF PATIENTS DURING PROLONGED MECHANICAL VENTILATION IN INTENSIVE CARE UNITS (RUSSIAN MULTICENTER STUDY RESULTS)].
26852580|a|A multicenter prospective study investigated the efficacy and safety dexmedetomidine of sedation in 103 patients during long-term (> 12 h) mechanical ventilation and in cases of delirium. Protocol of sedation included intravenous infusions of dexmedetomidine 1.4/kg/h and administering of analgesic drugs, and if necessary--sedative drugs (propofol, midazolam). Group 1 included 69 patients in whom dexmedetomidine sedation was performed for prolonged mechanical ventilation. Group 2 consisted of 34 patients in whom dexmedetomidine was used due to development of delirious state. Dexmedetomi- dine was used as an infusion of 0.7 mg/kg for 1 hour with further correction of dosage. We recorded a level of sedation by RASS, the need for the appointment of other drugs with sedative effects, the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay. The infusion of dexmedetomidine can provide a target level of sedation for RASS from 0 to -3 at 80-90% of patients with surgical and therapeutic profile who underwent prolonged mechanical ventilation. The frequency of adverse events appeared due to the development of bradycardia, hypotension. In the use of dexmedetomidine bolus injection should be avoided.
