32116643|t|Revealing a Novel Landscape of the Association Between Blood Lipid Levels and Alzheimer's Disease: A Meta-Analysis of a Case-Control Study.
32116643|a|Objectives: Blood lipid profiles have been ambiguously reported as biomarkers of AD in recent years. This study was conducted to evaluate the correlation between blood lipid levels and AD in later-life and to explore the effectiveness and reliability of blood lipid profiles as biomarkers of AD. Methods: Database searching was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Medline. This study was designed following the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) criteria. Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3) software was adopted to perform meta-analysis evaluating the standard mean difference (SMD) with its 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: A total of 5,286 participants were enrolled from 27 case-control studies in this meta-analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that total cholesterol (TC) level was significantly associated with AD in late-life (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI: [0.01, 0.32], P = 0.03), especially in the subgroup under 70 years old (SMD: 0.45, 95% CI: [0.11, 0.79], P = 0.01) and the subgroup of Western population (SMD: 0.29, 95% CI: [0.04, 0.53], P = 0.02). In the subgroup under 70 years old, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level (SMD = -0.50, 95% CI: [-0.76, -0.25], P = 0.0001) and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level (SMD = 0.59, 95% CI: [0.02, 1.16], P = 0.04) in the AD group were significantly lower and higher than in the control group, respectively. In the subgroup with a sample size larger than 100 subjects, the LDL-C level was significantly higher in AD patients than in the control elderly group (SMD = 0.31, 95% CI: [0.05, 0.56], P = 0.02). There was no significant association between triglyceride (TG) levels and AD in later-life (SMD = -0.00, 95% CI: [-0.12, 0.12], P = 1.00). Conclusion: TC can be a new predictive biomarker of AD or cognitive decline in later-life. Increased TC levels are found to be associated with an elevated risk of AD. Decreased HDL-C levels and increased LDL-C levels may relate to an elevated risk of AD in subjects aged 60-70. Further comprehensive researches will be necessary in the future.
