27387455|a|OPINION STATEMENT: A substantial and growing proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are elderly, and these patients require tailored treatment strategies. However, significant challenges exist in the management of this population due to the paucity of data. Establishing the initial diagnosis and assessing the etiology of future symptoms and flares can be challenging as several other prevalent diseases can masquerade as IBD, such as ischemic colitis, diverticular disease, and infectious colitis. Important pharmacologic considerations include reduced glomerular filtration rate and drug-drug interactions in the elderly. No drug therapy is absolutely contraindicated in this population; however, special risk and benefit assessments should be made. Older patients are more susceptible to side effects of steroids such as delirium, fractures, and cataracts. Budesonide can be an appropriate alternative for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) as it has limited systemic absorption. Pill size and quantity, nephrotoxicity, and difficulty of administration of rectal preparations should be considered with 5-aminosalicylic (5-ASA) therapy. Biologics are very effective, but modestly increase the risk of infection in a susceptible group. Based on their mechanisms, integrin receptor antagonists (e.g., vedolizumab) may reduce these risks. Use of antibiotics for anorectal or fistulizing CD or pouchitis in UC increases the risk of Clostridium difficile infection. Pre-existing comorbidities, functional status, and nutrition are important indicators of surgical outcomes. Morbidity and mortality are increased among IBD patients undergoing surgery, often due to postoperative complications or sepsis. Elderly adults with IBD, particularly UC, have very high rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Colonoscopy appears safe, but the optimal surveillance interval has not been well defined. Should the octogenarian, nonagenarian, and centurion undergo colonoscopy? The length of surveillance should likely account for the individual's overall life expectancy. Specific health maintenance should emphasize administering non-live vaccines to patients on thiopurines or biologics and regular skin exams for those on thiopurines. Smoking cessation is crucial to overall health and response to medical therapy, even among UC patients. This article will review management of IBD in the elderly.
