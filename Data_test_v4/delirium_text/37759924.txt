37759924|t|Relation of MRI-Visible Perivascular Spaces and Other MRI Markers of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.
37759924|a|Perivascular spaces (PVS) visible on brain MRI signal cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). The coexistence of PVS with other CSVD manifestations likely increases the risk of adverse neurological outcomes. We related PVS to other CSVD manifestations and brain volumes that are markers of vascular brain injury and neurodegeneration. Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants with CSVD ratings on brain MRI were included. PVS were rated in the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CSO) into grades I-IV and a category reflecting high burden in single or mixed CSO-BG regions. We related PVS to covert brain infarcts (CBI), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cerebral microbleeds (CMB), total brain, hippocampal, and cortical gray matter volumes using adjusted multivariable regression analyses. In 2454 participants (mean age 54 +- 12 years), we observed that higher PVS burden in both BG and CSO was related to CMB in lobar and deep brain regions and increased WMH. Greater CSO PVS burden was associated with decreased total cortical gray volumes. PVS are associated with ischemic markers of CSVD and neurodegeneration markers. Further studies should elucidate the causality between PVS and other CSVD manifestations.
