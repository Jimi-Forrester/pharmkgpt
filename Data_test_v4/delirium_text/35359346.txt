35359346|t|Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 and the mental health implications.
35359346|a|Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or more commonly known as Long COVID-19, is the term given to persistent symptoms 12 weeks from the initial presentation of COVID-19 infection. Several multi-organ symptoms have been reported by patients. Some common symptoms include headaches, fatigue, memory impairment and mental health complications such as anxiety and depression. People with previous psychiatric diagnosis are at greater risk of developing longer mental health implications from persistent COVID-19 symptoms. Additionally, healthcare workers are at increased risk of being long haulers leading to burnout and exhaustion. The objective of this review article is to provide comprehensive evidence from existing literature on various symptoms reported by patients experiencing Long COVID-19 and the rate of occurrence of such symptoms in different populations. A long-term disease surveillance is required to further understand the persistent symptoms or the long-term impact of this infection.
