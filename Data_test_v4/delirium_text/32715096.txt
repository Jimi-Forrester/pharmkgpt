32715096|a|OBJECTIVES: Fragility hip fracture is a common secondary complication of osteoporosis, which leads to significant morbidity and mortality. The incidence and prevalence of hip fractures have increased over recent decades. This study established an objective to determine the mortality rate and potential risk factors in fragility hip fracture patients. METHODS: Electronic medical records were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 1412 patients, aged 50 years and over, who sustained and received treatment for hip fractures between 2014 and 2018 were subsequently identified. Mortality rate data were retrieved from the official statistics registry for the provincial population. The mortality rates and potential risk factors for mortality were examined using Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: The overall 1-year mortality rate of fragility hip fracture patients was 19%. Compared with the age-matched population in Nan province, hip fractures increased the mortality rate by 6.21 times. Additionally, the mortality of hip fracture patients was significantly higher among those with age above 80 years, nonambulatory status before fracture and upon hospital discharge, end-stage renal disease, delirium, and pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who sustained hip fractures had approximately 6 times higher mortality. Effective strategies for hip fracture prevention as well as improvement in the standard of care are crucial steps towards reducing mortality in patients with hip fracture.
