24175079|t|Cerebral microbleeds: a new dilemma in stroke medicine.
24175079|a|Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are an increasingly common neuroimaging finding in the context of ageing, cerebrovascular disease and dementia, with potentially important clinical relevance. Perhaps the most pressing clinical question is whether CMBs are associated with a clinically important increase in the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), the most feared complication in patients treated with thrombolytic or antithrombotic (antiplatelet and anticoagulant) drugs. This review will summarize the evidence available regarding CMBs as an indicator of future ICH risk in stroke medicine clinical practice.
