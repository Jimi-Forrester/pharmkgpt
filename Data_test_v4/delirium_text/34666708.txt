34666708|a|BACKGROUND: Ingested foreign objects frequently require emergency removal. This study aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes of endoscopic removal of foreign bodies from the upper gastrointestinal tract and the risk factors for adverse events. METHODS: Adults (> 18 years) who underwent endoscopic management of ingested foreign bodies at two centers, one inland and one on the coast, between January 2008 and December 2017 were eligible. Clinical characteristics and procedure-related outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups, based on whether the foreign bodies were sharp or blunt in shape. RESULTS: A total of 853 patients aged 19-96 years were analyzed. Ingestion of fish bones was more common in the coastal area, whereas ingestion of food boluses was more common in the inland area. The duration of impaction ranged from 1 h to over 1 month and was significantly longer in patients who ingested blunt than sharp foreign bodies (15 vs. 5 h, p < 0.001). Most (98.9%) foreign bodies were successfully removed. Adverse events occurred in 31.2 % of patients, including ulcers (4.0%) and perforations (3.3 %). Multivariate analysis showed that age (odds ratio [OR] 1.015, p = 0.012), sharp foreign bodies (OR 5.133, p < 0.001), location in the esophagus (OR 2.723, p = 0.018), and duration of impaction (OR 1.431, p < 0.001) were factors associated with adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition and timely endoscopic removal of ingested foreign bodies, particularly in elderly patients and those with sharp foreign bodies, may improve clinical outcomes.
