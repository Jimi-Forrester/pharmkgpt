38325473|a|Environmental bisphenols (BPs) pose a global threat to human health because of their extensive use as additives in plastic products. BP residues are increasing in various environmental media (i.e., water, soil, and indoor dust) and biological and human samples (i.e., serum and brain). Both epidemiological and animal studies have determined an association between exposure to BPs and an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), including cognitive abnormalities and behavioral disturbances. Hence, understanding the biological responses to different BPs is essential for prevention, and treatment. This study provides an overview of the underlying pathogenic molecular mechanisms as a valuable basis for understanding neurodegenerative disease responses to BPs, including accumulation of misfolded proteins, reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine, abnormal hormone signaling, neuronal death, oxidative stress, calcium homeostasis, and inflammation. These findings provide new insights into the neurotoxic potential of BPs and ultimately contribute to a comprehensive health risk evaluation.
