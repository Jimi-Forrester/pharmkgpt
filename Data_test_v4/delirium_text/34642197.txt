34642197|t|Study protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial studying the effect of a music intervention on anxiety in adult critically ill patients (The RELACS trial).
34642197|a|INTRODUCTION: Anxiety is common in critically ill patients and has likely become more prevalent in the recent decade due to the imperative of the recent Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption in Adult Patients (PADIS) to use low levels of sedation and strive for wakefulness. However, management of anxiety has not been included in the PADIS guidelines, and there is lack of evidence to treat it in spite of its growing importance. Administration of sedative and analgesic medication is often chosen to reduce anxiety, especially when associated with agitation. Sedatives are associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, delirium and muscle wasting and are therefore preferably minimised. Previous studies have suggested positive effects of music interventions on anxiety in the critically ill. Therefore, we aim to study the effect of music intervention on anxiety in adult critically ill patients. METHODS AND DESIGN: A multicentre randomised controlled trial was designed to study the effect of a music intervention on the level of anxiety experienced by adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). One hundred and four patients will be included in three centres in the Netherlands. Patient recruitment started on 24-08-2020 and is ongoing in three hospitals. The primary outcome is self-reported anxiety measured on the visual analogue scale. Secondary outcomes include anxiety measured using the six-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, sleep quality, agitation and sedation level, medication requirement, pain, delirium, complications, time spend on mechanical ventilation, physical parameters and ICU memory and experience. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Medical Ethics Review Board of Erasmus MC University Medical Centre Rotterdam, The Netherlands, has approved this protocol. The study is being conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Results of this trial will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and conference presentations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04796389.
