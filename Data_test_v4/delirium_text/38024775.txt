38024775|t|Renoprotective Potency of Sitagliptin versus Pioglitazone in Type 2 Diabetic Patients: Impact on LncMIAT.
38024775|a|Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) represents one of the most important reasons for chronic kidney diseases due to the high level of blood glucose that destructs blood vessels. Objective: The present study focused on investigating the protective impact of sitagliptin on kidney complication in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in comparison to pioglitazone to examine which has the superior effect against the nephritic complication of DM. Methods: Eighty adult subjects were classified into four groups: control group, pioglitazone-treated T2DM patients (P group), sitagliptin-treated T2DM patients for less than one year (SL group), and sitagliptin-treated T2DM patients for more than one year (SM group). Blood samples were withdrawn from all subjects for analysis of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), vanin-1, kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), glyoxalase-1 (Glo-1), methylglyoxal (MG), cystatin-C, and interleukin-18 (IL-18) using competitive ELISA kits. Also, long noncoding myocardial infarction associated transcript (lncMIAT) was measured in whole blood using qRT-PCR. Results: The present study revealed that the lncMIAT expression level was significantly higher in the P group as compared to the SL group, SM group, or healthy control group. Additionally, serum NGAL, vanin-1, KIM-1, Glo-1, MG, and cystatin-C were significantly higher in the P group and SL group as compared to the SM group and healthy control group. Conclusion: Sitagliptin protected the kidney through downregulation of lncMIAT besides amelioration of kidney injury marker levels, which was more preferable than in pioglitazone therapy.
