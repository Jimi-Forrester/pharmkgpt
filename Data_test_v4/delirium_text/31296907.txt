31296907|a|Subthreshold micropulse laser (SMPL) is a tissue-sparing technique whose efficacy is demonstrated for diabetic macular edema (DME) treatment. However, its mechanism of action is poorly known. A prospective observational study was performed on naive DME patients treated with SMPL, to evaluate the changes of aqueous humor (AH) inflammatory and vaso-active biomarkers after treatments. AH samples of eighteen DME eyes were collected before and after SMPL. Ten non-diabetic AH samples served as controls. Full ophthalmic evaluation, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and fluorescein angiography were performed in DME group. Glass chip protein array was used to quantify 58 inflammatory molecules. Central retinal thickness (CRT) and visual acuity were also monitored. Several molecules showed different concentrations in DME eyes versus controls (p value < 0.05). Fas Ligand (FasL), Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins (MIP)-1alpha, Regulated on Activation Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) were increased in DME at baseline versus controls and decreased after SMPL treatments (p < 0.05). CRT reduction and visual acuity improvement were also found. Inflammatory cytokines, mainly produced by the retinal microglia, were significantly reduced after treatments, suggesting that SMPL may act by de-activating microglial cells, and reducing local inflammatory diabetes-related response.
