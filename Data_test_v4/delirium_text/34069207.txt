34069207|a|Human placental extract and animal-derived placental extracts from pigs and horses host a wide range of biological activities. Several placental products are used as medicines, cosmetics, and healthcare substances worldwide. However, the use of placental extracts for neuronal functioning is currently not established because the number of relevant studies is limited. A few previous reports suggested the neuroprotective effect and dendrite genesis effect of placental extract. However, no studies have reported on neurogenesis in placental extracts. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of horse placental extract on neurogenesis, and we examined the protective effect of the extract on the onset of memory disorder. A horse placental extract, JBP-F-02, was used in this study. JBP-F-02 treatment dose-dependently increased the number of neural stem cells and dendrite length under Abeta treatment in primary cultured cortical cells. The oral administration of JBP-F-02 to a 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease at a young age significantly prevented the onset of memory dysfunction. This study suggests that the extract has the potential to prevent dementia.
