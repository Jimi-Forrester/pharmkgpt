36499550|t|Calorie Restriction Provides Kidney Ischemic Tolerance in Senescence-Accelerated OXYS Rats.
36499550|a|Kidney diseases belong to a group of pathologies, which are most common among elderly people. With age, even outwardly healthy organisms start to exhibit some age-related changes in the renal tissue, which reduce the filtration function of kidneys and increase the susceptibility to injury. The therapy of acute kidney injury (AKI) is aggravated by the absence of targeted pharmacotherapies thus yielding high mortality of patients with AKI. In this study, we analyzed the protective effects of calorie restriction (CR) against ischemic AKI in senescence-accelerated OXYS rats. We observed that CR afforded OXYS rats with significant nephroprotection. To uncover molecular mechanisms of CR beneficial effects, we assessed the levels of anti- and proapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, COX IV, GAPDH, and mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT-3, as well as alterations in total protein acetylation and carbonylation, mitochondrial dynamics (OPA1, Fis1, Drp1) and kidney regeneration pathways (PCNA, GDF11). The activation of autophagy and mitophagy was analyzed by LC3 II/LC3 I ratio, beclin-1, PINK-1, and total mitochondrial protein ubiquitination. Among all considered protective pathways, the improvement of mitochondrial functioning may be suggested as one of the possible mechanisms for beneficial effects of CR.
