35386130|t|The Hospital at Home Model vs Routine Hospitalization for Acute Heart Failure: A Survey of Patients' Preferences.
35386130|a|Background: Patients with heart failure (HF) experience recurrent hospitalizations and may prefer a Hospital at Home (HaH) model over routine hospitalization. Methods: We administered a 9-item questionnaire on perceived effectiveness, safety, convenience, and acceptability of a HaH model among patients hospitalized for HF at 2 academic hospitals in Ontario. The primary outcome was HaH care acceptability, defined as a preference for or neutrality to HaH care over routine hospitalization. We used partial Spearman rank correlations (rho) and multivariable logistic regression analyses to explore associations with outcomes. Results: Of 297 eligible patients, 269 (90.6%) completed the questionnaire. The mean age was 76.2 (standard deviation, 12.3) years; 48.3% were female; and 70.5% lived in their own home, commonly with a relative or caregiver (67.9%). As many as 211 patients (78.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 73.0%-83.2%) found HaH care acceptable, with 169 (62.8%; 95% CI, 56.8%-68.6%) preferring HaH care over routine hospitalization. Perceived convenience (rho, 0.57; P < 0.001) and safety (rho, 0.37; p < 0.001) were associated with HaH acceptability, whereas perceived effectiveness was not (rho, 0.14; P = 0.021). A college (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.96; 95% CI, 2.01-17.62; P = 0.001) or university (aOR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.07-12.06; P = 0.039) education was associated with greater odds of HaH acceptability, whereas residing in a caregiver's home was associated with lower odds (aOR, 0.34; 95% CI 0.14-0.84; P = 0.019). Conclusions: A majority of patients with HF perceived HaH care to be an acceptable alternative to routine hospitalization, prioritizing perceived convenience and safety over effectiveness. Postsecondary education and living independently without caregiver support were associated with HaH acceptability.
