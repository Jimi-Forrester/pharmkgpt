38947617|t|A Comprehensive Review of the Role of Biomarkers in the Early Detection of Endocrine Disorders in Critical Illnesses.
38947617|a|Endocrine disorders pose significant challenges in the management of critically ill patients, contributing to morbidity and mortality in intensive care settings. Timely detection of these disorders is essential to optimizing patient outcomes. Biomarkers, as measurable indicators of biological processes or disease states, play a crucial role in the early identification and monitoring of endocrine dysfunction. This comprehensive review examines the role of biomarkers in the early detection of endocrine disorders in critical illnesses. We provide an overview of common endocrine disorders encountered in the intensive care unit (ICU) and discuss the impact of endocrine dysregulation on patient outcomes. Additionally, we classify biomarkers and explore their significance in diagnosing and monitoring endocrine disorders, including thyroid dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, and hypopituitarism. Furthermore, we discuss the clinical applications of biomarkers, including their utility in guiding therapeutic interventions, monitoring disease progression, and predicting outcomes in critical illnesses. Emerging trends and future directions in biomarker research are also highlighted, emphasizing the need for continued investigation into novel biomarkers and technological advancements. Finally, we underscore the potential of biomarkers to revolutionize the early detection and management of endocrine disorders in critical illnesses, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes in the ICU.
