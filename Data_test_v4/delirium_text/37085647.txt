37085647|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a distinct pattern of cortical thinning and resultant changes in cognition and function. These result in prominent deficits in cognitive-motor automaticity. The relationship between AD-related cortical thinning and decreased automaticity is not well-understood. We aimed to investigate the relationship between cortical thickness regions-of-interest (ROI) and automaticity and attention allocation in AD using hypothesis-driven and exploratory approaches. We performed an ROI analysis of 46 patients with AD. Data regarding MR images, demographic characteristics, cognitive-motor dual task performance, and cognition were extracted from medical records. Cortical thickness was calculated from MR T1 images using FreeSurfer. Data from the dual task assessment was used to calculate the combined dual task effect (cDTE), a measure of cognitive-motor automaticity, and the modified attention allocation index (mAAI). Four hierarchical multiple linear regression models were conducted regressing cDTE and mAAI separately on (1) hypothesis-generated ROIs and (2) exploratory ROIs. For cDTE, cortical thicknesses explained 20.5% (p = 0.014) and 25.9% (p = 0.002) variability in automaticity in the hypothesized ROI and exploratory models, respectively. The dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (beta =  - 0.479, p = 0.018) and superior parietal cortex (SPC) (beta = 0.467, p = 0.003), and were predictors of automaticity. For mAAI, cortical thicknesses explained 20.7% (p = 0.025) and 28.3% (p = 0.003) variability in attention allocation in the hypothesized ROI and exploratory models, respectively. Thinning of SPC and fusiform gyrus were associated with motor prioritization (beta =  - 0.405, p = 0.013 and beta =  - 0.632, p = 0.004, respectively), whereas thinning of the DLPFC was associated with cognitive prioritization (beta = 0.523, p = 0.022). Cortical thinning in AD was related to cognitive-motor automaticity and task prioritization, particularly in the DLPFC and SPC. This suggests that these regions may play a primary role in automaticity and attentional strategy during dual-tasking.
