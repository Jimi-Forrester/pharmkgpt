37505851|a|The objective of this study was to investigate how subcutaneous (sc) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration affects the gene expression profiles of insulin signaling as well as innate and adaptive immunity genes in mouse livers and spleens. FVB/N female mice were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups at 5 weeks of age: (1) a six-week subcutaneous injection of saline at 11 muL/h (control-CON), or (2) a six-week subcutaneous injection of LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 at 0.1 mug/g body weight at 11 muL/h. At 106 weeks (i.e., 742 days) after the last treatment, mice were euthanized. Following euthanasia, liver and spleen samples were collected, snap frozen, and stored at -80  C until gene expression profiling. LPS upregulated nine genes in the liver, according to the findings (Pparg, Frs3, Kras, Raf1, Gsk3b, Rras2, Hk2, Pik3r2, and Myd88). With a 4.18-fold increase over the CON group, Pparg was the most up-regulated gene in the liver. Based on the annotation cluster analysis, LPS treatment upregulated liver genes which are involved in pathways associated with hepatic steatosis, B- and T-cell receptor signaling, chemokine signaling, as well as other types of cancers such as endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer. LPS increased the spleen expression of Ccl11, Ccl25, Il6, Cxcl5, Pparg, Tlr4, Nos2, Cxcl11, Il1a, Ccl17, and Fcgr3, all of which are involved in innate and adaptive immune responses and the regulation of cytokine production. Furthermore, functional analysis revealed that cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling pathways were the most enriched in LPS-treated mice spleen tissue. Our findings support the notion that early-life LPS exposure can result in long-term changes in gene expression profiling in the liver and spleen tissues of FVB/N female mice.
