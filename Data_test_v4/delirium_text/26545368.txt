MicroRNAs (miRs) - short, non-coding RNA sequences that alter gene expression by post-transcriptional inhibition or degradation of mRNA sequences - may be involved in the global coordination of such diverse biological processes. To test the hypothesis that miRs related to adult neurogenesis and related cellular processes are functionally regulated in the nuclei of the avian song control circuit, we used microarray analyses to quantify changes in expression of miRs and predicted target mRNAs in the telencephalic nuclei HVC, the robust nucleus of arcopallium (RA), and the basal ganglia homologue Area X in breeding and nonbreeding Gambel's white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelli). RESULTS: We identified 46 different miRs that were differentially expressed across seasons in the song nuclei. miR-132 and miR-210 showed the highest differential expression in HVC and Area X, respectively. Analyzing predicted mRNA targets of miR-132 identified 33 candidate target genes that regulate processes including cell cycle control, calcium signaling, and neuregulin signaling in HVC. Likewise, miR-210 was predicted to target 14 mRNAs differentially expressed across seasons that regulate serotonin, GABA, and dopamine receptor signaling and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify potential miR-mRNA regulatory networks related to adult neurogenesis and provide opportunities to discover novel genetic control of the diverse biological processes and factors related to the functional incorporation of new neurons to the adult brain.
