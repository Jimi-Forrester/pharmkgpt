39379268|a|Mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact sites (MERCS) function as transient signaling platforms that regulate essential cellular functions. MERCS are enriched in specific proteins and lipids that connect mitochondria and the ER together and modulate their activities. Dysregulation of MERCS is associated with several human pathologies including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and cancer. BCL-2 family proteins can locate at MERCS and control essential cellular functions such as calcium signaling and autophagy in addition to their role in mitochondrial apoptosis. Moreover, the BCL-2-mediated apoptotic machinery was recently found to trigger cGAS-STING pathway activation and a proinflammatory response, a recognized hallmark of these diseases that requires mitochondria-ER interplay. This review underscores the pivotal role of MERCS in regulating essential cellular functions, focusing on their crosstalk with BCL-2 family proteins, and discusses how their dysregulation is linked to disease.
