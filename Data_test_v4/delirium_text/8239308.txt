8239308|t|The use of the Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery (CNTB) in an efficacy and safety trial of BMY 21,502 in Alzheimer's disease.
8239308|a|BMY 21,502 is a nootropic which protects memory and enhances long-term potentiation according to preclinical findings. Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients who were diagnosed by DSM-III-R and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria were enrolled in a 12-week double-blind investigation of BMY 21,502 vs. placebo at 300 mg tid. The study design included a 1-week placebo lead-in and a 4-week placebo washout in addition to the 12-week double-blind treatment period. Efficacy was assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) and the Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery (CNTB) at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessments were also performed biweekly. Sixty-nine patients (28M, 41F; mean age 72 years, range 54 to 92 years) were enrolled in the study. Baseline Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores ranged from 16 to 26 (mean 23.5) in patients on active drug (n = 34), and from 15 to 26 (mean 22.5) in placebo patients (n = 35). Baseline efficacy scores were comparable for drug and placebo patients (p > 0.05). Twelve (35%) patients who received BMY 21,502 withdrew from the study, 8 (24%) due to adverse events. Three (9%) patients who received placebo withdrew from the study, all due to adverse events. Patients on active drug who were valid for analysis of efficacy (n = 22) showed a mean decrease in ADAS of -1.5 at week 12, vs. a mean change of -0.5 in patients who received placebo (n = 32), although there was no significant difference between the two (p > 0.05). Correlations between the CNTB summary scores and ADAS cognitive subscores were, nevertheless, highly significant at baseline (r = -0.83, p = 0.0001) and week 12 (r = -0.83, p = 0.0001). Correlations between the word list learning, spatial, and naming subtests of the ADAS and CNTB were also highly significant (p = 0.0001). Although modest, the findings for active drug vs. placebo response in this study suggest that BMY 21,502 should be further investigated, with a larger study population, in order to fully determine the compound's potential efficacy.
