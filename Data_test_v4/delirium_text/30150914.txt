30150914|a|INTRODUCTION: Despite the accumulating evidence suggesting a possible relationship between femur and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) and serum uric acid (UA), it is unclear whether alterations in UA levels reflect any underlying subclinical inflammatory conditions in postmenopausal osteoporosis. In addition, the mechanistic link between osteoporosis and dietary factors including vitamin B12 and folate in postmenopausal women is still obscure. The aim of the present study is to investigate the association between serum vitamin B12, folate, UA, and subclinical inflammatory markers and BMD measurements in postmenopausal women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty-four postmenopausal women were recruited for the present study. Clinical data, as well as serum vitamin B12, folate, UA, conventional inflammatory markers, and other related biochemical markers, were assessed for each subject. Bone mineral density measurements of proximal femur and lumbar spine were taken using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Correlation analysis was performed between serum vitamin B12, folate, UA and other biochemical and metabolic parameters. RESULTS: Although no association was found between serum inflammatory markers, vitamin B12 and folate levels with femur neck and lumbar spine BMD measurements, elevated UA levels were observed in subjects with normal BMD values. Higher BMD values were obtained in higher UA tertiles. UA (p < 0.001) and BMI (p = 0.003) were found to be correlated with femur neck BMD measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The femoral and lumbar BMD measurements were associated with serum UA levels. Higher serum UA levels were found to have a protective effect on postmenopausal osteoporosis irrespective of inflammation and dietary factors.
