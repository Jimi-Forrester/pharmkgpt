37008248|t|Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody-Associated Disease and COVID-19: A Systematic Review.
37008248|a|Background: Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is an uncommon neurological disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS). Numerous neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), acute transverse myelitis (ATM), and MOGAD, have been reported following the COVID-19 infection during the current COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, it has been suggested that patients with MOGAD may be at greater risk for infection (particularly in the current pandemic). Objective: In this systematic review, we gathered separately 1) MOGAD cases following COVID-19 infection as well as 2) clinical course of patients with MOGAD infected with COVID-19 based on case reports/series. Methods: 329 articles were collected from 4 databases. These articles were conducted from inception to March 1st, 2022. Results: Following the screening, exclusion criteria were followed and eventually, 22 studies were included. In 18 studies, a mean +- SD time interval of 18.6 +- 14.9 days was observed between infection with COVID-19 and the onset of MOGAD symptoms. Symptoms were partially or completely recovered in a mean of 67 days of follow-up.Among 4 studies on MOGAD patients, the hospitalization rate was 25%, and 15% of patients were hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU). Conclusion: Our systematic review demonstrated that following COVID-19 infection, there is a rare possibility of contracting MOGAD. Moreover, there is no clear consensus on the susceptibility of MOGAD patients to severe COVID-19. However, obtaining deterministic results requires studies with a larger sample size.
