32485711|t|Comparison of Prodromal Symptoms of Patients with Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia and Alzheimer Disease.
32485711|a|INTRODUCTION: Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is the most common clinical subtype of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. bvFTD is often characterized by changes in behavior and personality, frequently leading to psychiatric misdiagnoses. On the other hand, substantial clinical overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD), further complicates the diagnostics. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to identify the main differences in early symptoms of bvFTD and AD in the prodromal stages of the diseases. In addition, patients with bvFTD were analyzed separately according to whether they carry the C9orf72repeat expansion or not. METHODS: Patient records of bvFTD (n = 75) and AD (n = 83) patients were analyzed retrospectively for memory and neuropsychiatric symptoms, sleeping disorders, and somatic complaints before the setting of the accurate diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 84% of bvFTD patients (n = 63) and 98.8% of AD patients (n = 82) reported subjective memory disturbances in the prodromal phases of the disease. bvFTD patients presented significantly more often with sleeping disorders, headache, inexplicable collapses, transient loss of consciousness, somatization, delusions, and hallucinations, suicidality, changes in oral behaviors, and urinary problems. In addition, poor financial judgement was frequently detected in patients with prodromal bvFTD. Aberrant sensations in the nose and throat without any physical explanation, regarded as somatizations, emerged only in bvFTD patients with the C9orf72 repeat expansion. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective reporting of impaired episodic memory is a poor indicator in differentiating bvFTD from AD. Sleeping disturbances, delusions, hallucinations, and unexplained somatic complaints in a patient with cognitive disturbances should prompt the clinicians to consider bvFTD as a possible diagnostic option behind these symptoms. The spectrum of symptoms in the prodromal stages of bvFTD may be more diverse than the latest criteria suggest.
