37075301|t|Characterizing Early-Onset Alzheimer Disease Using Multiprobe PET/MRI: An AT(N) Framework-Based Study.
37075301|a|PURPOSE: Early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) is rare, highly heterogeneous, and associated with poor prognosis. This AT(N) Framework-based study aimed to compare multiprobe PET/MRI findings between EOAD and late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) patients and explore potential imaging biomarkers for characterizing EOAD. METHODS: Patients with AD who underwent PET/MRI in our PET center were retrospectively reviewed and grouped according to the age at disease onset: EOAD, younger than 60 years; and LOAD, 60 years or older. Clinical characteristics were recorded. All study patients had positive beta-amyloid PET imaging; some patients also underwent 18 F-FDG and 18 F-florzolotau PET. Imaging of the EOAD and LOAD groups was compared using region-of-interest and voxel-based analysis. Correlation of onset age and regional SUV ratios were also evaluated. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-three patients were analyzed (75 EOAD and 58 LOAD patients). Sex ( P = 0.515) and education ( P = 0.412) did not significantly differ between groups. Mini-Mental State Examination score was significantly lower in the EOAD group (14.32 +- 6.74 vs 18.67 +- 7.20, P = 0.004). beta-Amyloid deposition did not significantly differ between groups. Glucose metabolism in the frontal, parietal, precuneus, temporal, occipital lobe, and supramarginal and angular gyri was significantly lower in the EOAD group (n = 49) than in the LOAD group (n = 44). In voxel-based morphometry analysis, right posterior cingulate/precuneus atrophy was more obvious in the EOAD ( P < 0.001), although no voxel survived family-wise error correction. Tau deposition in the precuneus, parietal lobe, and angular, supramarginal, and right middle frontal gyri was significantly higher in the EOAD group (n = 18) than in the LOAD group (n = 13). CONCLUSIONS: Multiprobe PET/MRI showed that tau burden and neuronal damage are more severe in EOAD than in LOAD. Multiprobe PET/MRI may be useful to assess the pathologic characteristics of EOAD.
