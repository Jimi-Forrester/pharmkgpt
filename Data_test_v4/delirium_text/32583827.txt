32583827|t|Ultrasensitive and highly selective detection of dopamine by a NiFeP based flexible electrochemical sensor.
32583827|a|A ultrasensitive NiFeP based electrochemical sensor was developed for the selective electrochemical detection of dopamine to address the issue associated with neurological disorders including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The novel sensor shows superior selectivity and sensitivity with a lowest detection limit of 0.3 nM and a wide detection range of 10 nM-500 muM and is immune to the interference of ascorbic acid at physiological pH (7.4). A novel flexible sensor was developed with NiFeP coated over Whatman filter paper, which exhibits two liner ranges of 10 nM-1muM and 10 muM-500 muM with an ultra high sensitivity of 756 muA muM-1 cm-2 and 4.6 muA muM-1 cm-2 respectively with a wide detection range of 10 nM to 500 muM.
