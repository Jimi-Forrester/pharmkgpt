21847424|t|Delirium in a 74-year-old man: correct imaging revealed the truth.
21847424|a|Delirium is a cognitive disorder. DSM-IV criteria for delirium must include both acute onset and fluctuating symptoms; disturbance of consciousness (including inattention); at least one of the following: disorganised thinking, disorientation, memory impairment or perceptual disturbance; and evidence of a putative causal medical condition. Traditionally, the course has been described as transient in which recovery is likely to be complete if the underlying aetiological factor is promptly corrected or is self-limited. The most common precipitating causes in elderly include sepsis, dehydration and drugs. Work-up for delirium is limited to septic screening, baseline investigations and imaging. Patients with delirium without focal signs and with either evidence for a medical aetiology of delirium or pre-diagnosed dementia are at a very low risk of having focal lesions in their contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. We are presenting an interesting case of delirium with urosepsis whose imaging revealed milliary brain tuberculomas on contrast-enhanced MRI.
