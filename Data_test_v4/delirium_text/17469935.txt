17469935|a|An early clinical symptom of Alzheimer's disease is impaired episodic memory. However, the precise pathological event(s) that underpins this deficit remains unclear. In the present study, the authors examined whether wild-type mice and Tg2576 mice expressing an amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutation are able to form an integrated memory of the spatio-temporal context in which objects are presented. In Experiment 1, wild-type mice, but not Tg2576 mice that were 10-12 months old, explored objects presented in a novel location. In Experiment 2, wild-type mice explored an object that was presented both earlier in a sequence and in a different location relative to other objects that possessed only one of these properties (i.e., memory for "what," "where," and "when" items were presented). In contrast, the behavior of adult Tg2576 mice was influenced only by the temporal order in which objects were presented. These results demonstrate that wild-type, but not APP-mutant, mice are able to form an "episodic-like" memory of the spatio-temporal properties of objects and support the hypothesis that aberrant APP processing contributes to impairments in event memory.
