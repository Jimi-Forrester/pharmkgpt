35092972|a|Objective: To evaluate the effect of reducing-opioids on postoperative delirium (POD) incidence in elderly patients with gastric cancer surgery. Methods: From July 2016 to September 2021, 130 elderly patients undergoing scheduled gastric cancer surgery in Zhejiang Cancer Hospital were selected and divided into conventional opioid general anesthesia group (group A) and reducing-opioids general anesthesia group (group B) according to random number table. Postoperative analgesic pump formula: group A: 0.2% ropivacaine and 1 mug/ml sufentanil solution; Group B: 0.2% ropivacaine solution. POD assessment was performed once daily between 8 am and 8 pm for 3 days after surgery. The primary outcome measures were POD incidence 3 days after surgery, and the secondary outcome measures included anaesthesia related adverse events 3 days after surgery, such as nausea and vomiting, postoperative fever and fatigue. Results: Among the 130 patients, 7 patients were excluded because they did not comply with the POD test after operation. Finally, 123 elderly patients completed the study. There were 59 cases in group A, aged (73+-5) years, including 45 males, and 64 cases in group B, aged (71+-6) years, including 56 males. The incidence of total POD 3 days after surgery in group A and B was 30.5% (18/59) and 18.8% (12/64), respectively, with no statistical significance (P>0.05). However, POD incidence at 48 and 72 h after operation in group A [27.1% (16/59) and 16.9% (10/59)] was higher than that in group B [10.9% (8/64) and 4.7% (3/64), both P<0.05]. The incidence of nausea and vomiting in group A was higher than that in group B [15.3% (9/59) vs 1.6% (1/64), P<0.05]. Conclusion: Reducing-opioids consumption have no effect on the incidence of total POD 3 d after gastric cancer surgery in elderly patients, but can reduce the risk of POD 48-72 h after surgery.
