34984501|a|PURPOSE: Hyposmia is a common feature of COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease (PD). As parkinsonism has been reported after COVID-19, a link has been hypothesized between SARS-CoV2 infection and PD. We aimed to evaluate brain metabolic correlates of isolated persistent hyposmia after mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and to compare them with metabolic signature of hyposmia in drug-naive PD patients. METHODS: Forty-four patients who experienced hyposmia after SARS-COV2 infection underwent brain [18F]-FDG PET in the first 6 months after recovery. Olfaction was assessed by means of the 16-item "Sniffin' Sticks" test and patients were classified as with or without persistent hyposmia (COVID-hyposmia and COVID-no-hyposmia respectively). Brain [18F]-FDG PET of post-COVID subgroups were compared in SPM12. COVID-hyposmia patients were also compared with eighty-two drug-naive PD patients with hyposmia. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify correlations between olfactory test scores and brain metabolism in patients' subgroups. RESULTS: COVID-hyposmia patients (n = 21) exhibited significant hypometabolism in the bilateral gyrus rectus and orbitofrontal cortex with respect to COVID-non-hyposmia (n = 23) (p < 0.002) and in middle and superior temporal gyri, medial/middle frontal gyri, and right insula with respect to PD-hyposmia (p < 0.012). With respect to COVID-hyposmia, PD-hyposmia patients showed hypometabolism in inferior/middle occipital gyri and cuneus bilaterally. Olfactory test scores were directly correlated with metabolism in bilateral rectus and medial frontal gyri and in the right middle temporal and anterior cingulate gyri in COVID-hyposmia patients (p < 0.006) and with bilateral cuneus/precuneus and left lateral occipital cortex in PD-hyposmia patients (p < 0.004). CONCLUSION: Metabolic signature of persistent hyposmia after COVID-19 encompasses cortical regions involved in olfactory perception and does not overlap metabolic correlates of hyposmia in PD.
