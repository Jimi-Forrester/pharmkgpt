36926605|a|Several chemicals have been developed owing to the progression of industrialization, among which endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs; essential for plastic production) are used as plasticizers and flame retardants. Plastics have become an essential element in modern life because they provide convenience, thus increasing EDCs exposure to humans. EDCs cause adverse effects such as deterioration of reproductive function, cancer, and neurological abnormalities by disrupting the endocrine system and hence are classified as "dangerous substances." Additionally, they are toxic to various organs but continue to be used. Therefore, it is necessary to review the contamination status of EDCs, select potentially hazardous substances for management, and monitor the safety standards. In addition, it is necessary to discover substances that can protect against EDC toxicity and conduct active research on the protective effects of these substances. According to recent research, Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) exhibits protective effects against several toxicities caused by EDCs to humans. In this review, the effects of EDCs on the human body and the role of KRG in protection against EDC toxicity are discussed.
