Abnormal cerebral perfusion alterations, influenced by amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulations, have been implicated in cognitive decline along this spectrum. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta1-42 levels and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes across the AD continuum using the Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) technique. METHODS: We analyzed data from 229 participants extracted from the ADNI cohort, comprising of 50 cognitively normal (CN), 13 subjective memory complaints (SMC), 83 early MCI (EMCI), 52 late MCI (LMCI), and 31 AD participants with complete ASL and CSF data. Correlations between Abeta1-42 levels and regional mean CBF values were assessed. Multiple linear regression models accounted for confounders, including age, gender, and education level. RESULTS: Preliminary unadjusted analyses revealed strong positive correlations between Abeta1-42 levels and CBF in multiple regions, predominantly in the AD group. After adjusting for confounders, significant correlations in AD participants emerged in the left pars triangularis and left caudal middle frontal cortex. In the LMCI group, significant associations were identified in the right lateral occipital cortex, right inferior parietal cortex, and left amygdala. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the critical role of Abeta-driven CBF alterations in regions associated with higher cognitive functions and suggest that these patterns may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression.
