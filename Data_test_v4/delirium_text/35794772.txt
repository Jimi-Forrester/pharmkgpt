35794772|t|What happens in TBI? A wide talk on animal models and future perspective.
35794772|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global healthcare concern and a leading cause of death. The most common causes of TBI include road accidents, sports injuries, violence in warzones, and falls. TBI induces neuronal cell death independent of age, gender, and genetic background. TBI survivor patients often experience long-term behavioral changes like cognitive and emotional changes. TBI affects social activity, reduced the quality and duration of life. Over the last 40 years, several rodent models have been developed to mimic different clinical outcomes of human TBI for a better understanding of pathophysiology and to check the efficacy of drugs used for TBI. Although promising neuroprotective approaches that have been used preclinically are found to be less beneficial in clinical trials. So, there is an urgent need to find a suitable animal model for establishing a new therapeutic intervention useful for TBI. In this review, we demonstrated the etiology of TBI, and post-TBI social life alteration; and also discussed various preclinical TBI models of rodents, zebrafish, and drosophila.
