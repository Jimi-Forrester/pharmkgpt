17595859|t|[Postoperative pain management in elderly patient].
17595859|a|Pain is a common occurrence for the hospitalized elderly, and may often be under recognized and inadequately managed. Insufficient pain management can lead to the sequelae of emotional distress and depression, delirium, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and physical disabilities, as well as increased health care costs. Effective pain management of the older adult begins with pain assessment using the proper tools. Morphine is the analgesic of choice for the older adult, and is appropriate for the postoperative period. It is important to maintain a therapeutic serum level of opioids to prevent inadequate management of the acute pain. Side effects of opioids include hypotension, nausea, mood disturbances, ileus, histamine production, and respiratory depression. The adage for pain treatment in the elderly is "start low and go slow". Paracetamol is commonly prescribed and may be the drug of choice for mild to moderate postoperative pain. Older adults may enjoy the benefits of Patient-Controlled Analgesia and Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia in the postoperative period; however, thorough and ongoing teaching must occur to ensure understanding and compliance with the therapy. Treating post-procedure pain in the elderly patient requires an understanding of the normal changes associated with aging and the impact on medications, and multimodal analgesia can be the best approach.
