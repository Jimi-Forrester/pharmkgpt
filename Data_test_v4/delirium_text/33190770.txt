33190770|t|Dementia and the Critically Ill Older Adult.
33190770|a|Dementia is a terminal illness that leads to progressive cognitive and functional decline. As the elderly population grows, the incidence of dementia in hospitalized older adults increases and is associated with poor short-term and long-term outcomes. Delirium is associated with an accelerated cognitive decline in hospitalized patients with dementia. The first step in the management of dementia is accurate and early diagnosis. Evidence-based management guidelines in the setting of critical illness and dementia are lacking. The cornerstone of management is defining goals of care early in the course of hospitalization and using palliative care and hospice when deemed appropriate.
