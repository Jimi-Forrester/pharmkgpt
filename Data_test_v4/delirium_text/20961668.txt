20961668|t|Functional effects of genetic polymorphism in inflammatory genes in subjective memory complainers.
20961668|a|A number of genetic risk factors have been identified for Alzheimer's disease (AD) including genes involved in the inflammatory response (interleukin 1A, [IL-1alpha (-889)], interleukin 1B (IL-1beta [+3953]), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF [-308 and -850]). We investigated the prevalence and functional consequences (baseline cognitive performance, plasma cytokine levels) of possession of these putative genetic risk factors within a group of subjective memory complainers (SMC, n = 226) and age and sex matched noncomplainers (NMC, n = 167). We observed no effect of any of the genetic factors investigated on cognitive performance. Further, there was no difference in the frequency of the disease-associated alleles, or cytokine levels between subjective memory complainers and noncomplainer participants. There was no relationship between TNF polymorphisms and TNF levels. There was a significant increase in plasma IL-1beta levels in those homozygous for the disease-associated allele (i.e., IL-1beta +3953 TT). Follow-up longitudinal assessments on this cohort will provide insight as to how these polymorphisms may affect the risk of cognitive decline over time.
