36786552|t|Phosphorylation at Ser289 Enhances the Oligomerization of Tau Repeat R2.
36786552|a|In tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), aberrant phosphorylation causes the dissociation of tau proteins from microtubules. The dissociated tau then aggregates into sequent forms from soluble oligomers to paired helical filaments and insoluble neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). NFTs is a hallmark of AD, while oligomers are found to be the most toxic form of the tau aggregates. Therefore, understanding tau oligomerization with regard to abnormal phosphorylation is important for the therapeutic development of AD. In this study, we investigated the impact of phosphorylated Ser289, one of the 40 aberrant phosphorylation sites of full-length tau proteins, on monomeric and dimeric structures of tau repeat R2 peptides. We carried out intensive replica exchange molecular dynamics simulation with a total simulation time of up to 0.1 ms. Our result showed that the phosphorylation significantly affected the structures of both the monomer and the dimer. For the monomer, the phosphorylation enhanced ordered-disordered structural transition and intramolecular interaction, leading to more compactness of the phosphorylated R2 compared to the wild-type one. As to the dimer, the phosphorylation increased intermolecular interaction and beta-sheet formation, which can accelerate the oligomerization of R2 peptides. This result suggests that the phosphorylation at Ser289 is likely to promote tau aggregation. We also observed a phosphorylated Ser289-Na+-phosphorylated Ser289 bridge in the phosphorylated R2 dimer, suggesting an important role of cation ions in tau aggregation. Our findings suggest that phosphorylation at Ser289 should be taken into account in the inhibitor screening of tau oligomerization.
