31687161|a|BACKGROUND: Frailty status is recognized as an important parameter in critically ill elderly patients, but nothing is known about outcomes in non-frail patients regarding the development of frailty or frailty and death after intensive care. The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for frailty and death or only frailty 6 months after intensive care unit (ICU) admission in non-frail patients >= 65 years. METHODS: A prospective non-interventional study performed in an academic ICU from February 2015 to February 2016 included non-frail >= 65-year-old patients hospitalized for > 24 h in the ICU. Frailty was assessed by calculating the frailty index (FI) at admission and 6 months later. Patients who remained non-frail (FI < 0.2) were compared to patients who presented frailty (FI >= 0.2) and those who presented frailty and death at 6 months. RESULTS: Among 974 admissions, 136 patients were eligible for the study and 88 patients were analysed at 6 months (non-frail n = 34, frail n = 29, death n = 25). Multivariable analysis showed that mechanical ventilation duration was an independent risk factor for frailty/death at 6 months (per day of mechanical ventilation, odds ratio [OR] = 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.19, p = 0.002). When excluding patients who died, mechanical ventilation duration remained the sole risk factor for frailty at 6 months (OR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.07-1.33, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Mechanical ventilation duration was the sole predictive factor of frailty and death or only frailty 6 months after ICU hospitalization in initially non-frail patients.
