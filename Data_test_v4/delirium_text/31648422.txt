31648422|t|Outcome Differences by Delirium Motor Subtype in Patients with Ischemic Stroke.
31648422|a|OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the outcomes of ischemic stroke patients according to delirium motor subtype. METHODS: This study included patients who were admitted to the stroke unit between August 2017 and March 2019 and met the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for delirium. Patients were assessed twice weekly throughout their delirium episodes using the Korean version of the Delirium Motor Subtype Scale (K-DMSS) and the Korean version of the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (K-DRS-98). The clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of the patients were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 943 stroke patients were included; the rate of incident delirium was 10.18%. Of the 95 delirium patients, 34 were classified as the hyperactive subtype, 30 as the mixed subtype, 25 as the hypoactive and six as no subtype. Among the subtype groups, the hypoactive subtype had the highest initial scores on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS; 6.72+-4.75, p=0.02) and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS; 3.96+-1.24, p<0.01). Additionally, the mixed and hypoactive subtypes had longer durations (p<0.01) and more severe symptoms of delirium (p=0.03) than the other motor subtypes, and the hypoactive subtype group had a significantly longer hospital stay (36.88+-27.71 days, p<0.01) than the other subtype groups. After adjusting for baseline covariates in a multiple linear regression analysis, these differences remained significant. CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that the motor subtype of delirium is associated with different characteristics and outcomes in ischemic stroke patients.
