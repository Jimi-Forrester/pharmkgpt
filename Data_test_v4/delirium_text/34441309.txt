34441309|t|Oral Microbiota: A Major Player in the Diagnosis of Systemic Diseases.
34441309|a|The oral cavity is host to a complex and diverse microbiota community which plays an important role in health and disease. Major oral infections, i.e., caries and periodontal diseases, are both responsible for and induced by oral microbiota dysbiosis. This dysbiosis is known to have an impact on other chronic systemic diseases, whether triggering or aggravating them, making the oral microbiota a novel target in diagnosing, following, and treating systemic diseases. In this review, we summarize the major roles that oral microbiota can play in systemic disease development and aggravation and also how novel tools can help investigate this complex ecosystem. Finally, we describe new therapeutic approaches based on oral bacterial recolonization or host modulation therapies. Collaboration in diagnosis and treatment between oral specialists and general health specialists is of key importance in bridging oral and systemic health and disease and improving patients' wellbeing.
