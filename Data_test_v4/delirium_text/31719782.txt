31719782|a|Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are major defence enzymes of the antioxidant enzymatic system. Cytosolic GSTs are more involved in the detoxification than mitochondrial and microsomal GSTs. GSTs are localized in the cerebellum and hippocampus of the rat brain. Acrylamide (AC) is a well assessed neurotoxin of both animals and humans and it produces skeletal muscle weakness and ataxia. AC is extensively used in several industries such as cosmetic, paper, textile, in ore processing, as soil conditioners, flocculants for waste water treatment and it is present in daily consumed food products, like potato chips, French fries, bread, breakfast cereals and beverages like coffee; it is detected on tobacco smoking. GST acts as a biomarker in response to acrylamide. AC can interact with DNA and therefore generate mutations. In rats, low level expression of glutathione S-trasferase (GST) decreases both memory and life span. The major aim of this review is to provide better information on the antioxidant role of GST against AC induced neurotoxicity and genotoxicity.
