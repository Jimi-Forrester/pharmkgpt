29937713|t|Cognitive Decline, Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease and Presbycusis: Examination of the Possible Molecular Mechanism.
29937713|a|The incidences of presbycusis and dementia are high among geriatric diseases. Presbycusis is the general term applied to age-related hearing loss and can be caused by many risk factors, such as noise exposure, smoking, medication, hypertension, family history, and other factors. Mutation of mitochondrial DNA in hair cells, spiral ganglion cells, and stria vascularis cells of the cochlea is the basic mechanism of presbycusis. Dementia is a clinical syndrome that includes the decline of cognitive and conscious states and is caused by many neurodegenerative diseases, of which Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common. The amyloid cascade hypothesis and tau hypothesis are the two major hypotheses that describe the AD pathogenic mechanism. Recent studies have shown that deposition of Abeta and hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein may cause mitochondrial dysfunction. An increasing number of papers have reported that, on one hand, the auditory system function in AD patients is damaged as their cognitive ability declines and that, on the other hand, hearing loss may be a risk factor for dementia and AD. However, the relationship between presbycusis and AD is still unknown. By reviewing the relevant literature, we found that the SIRT1-PGC1alpha pathway and LKB1 (or CaMKKbeta)-AMPK pathway may play a role in the preservation of cerebral neuron function by taking part in the regulation of mitochondrial function. Then vascular endothelial growth factor signal pathway is activated to promote vascular angiogenesis and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier integrity. Recently, experiments have also shown that their expression levels are altered in both presbycusis and AD mouse models. Therefore, we propose that exploring the specific molecular link between presbycusis and AD may provide new ideas for their prevention and treatment.
