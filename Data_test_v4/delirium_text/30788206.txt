30788206|t|It's Getting Hot in Here: A Rare Case of Heat Stroke in a Young Male.
30788206|a|Heat stroke is a severe acute illness characterized by a core temperature greater than 40 C (104 F) and central nervous system manifestations, such as delirium, convulsions, or coma, resulting from exposure to environmental heat or strenuous physical activity. Early recognition and treatment including aggressive cooling and management of life-threatening systemic complications, such as cardiac arrest, rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. Herein we describe a case of heat stroke in a 23-year-old male who suffered cardiac arrest in which prompt initiation of cooling measures prevented permanent neurological sequelae, provided swift neurological recovery and resolution of impending multi-organ dysfunction syndrome.
