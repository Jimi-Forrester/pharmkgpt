34281063|t|The Role of Frailty in Predicting 3 and 6 Months Functional Decline in Hospitalized Older Adults: Findings from a Secondary Analysis.
34281063|a|Frailty represents one of the most relevant geriatric syndromes in the 21st century and is a predictor of adverse outcomes in hospitalized older adult, such as, functional decline (FD). This study aimed to examine if frailty, evaluated with the Frailty Index (FI), can predict FD during and after hospitalization (3 and 6 months). Secondary data analysis of a prospective cohort study of 101 hospitalized older adults was performed. The primary outcome was FD at discharge, 3 and 6 months. The FI was created from an original database using 40 health deficits. Functional decline models for each time-point were examined using a binary logistic regression. The prevalence of frailty was 57.4% with an average score of 0.25 (+-0.11). Frail patients had significant and higher values for functional decline and social support for all time periods and more hospital readmission in the 3 month period. Multivariable regression analysis showed that FI was a predictor of functional decline at discharge (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02-1.14) and 3-month (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01-1.09) but not 6-month (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.99-1.09) follow-up. Findings suggest that frailty at admission of hospitalized older adults can predict functional decline at discharge and 3 months post-discharge.
