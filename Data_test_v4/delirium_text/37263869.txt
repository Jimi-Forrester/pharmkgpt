37263869|a|INTRODUCTION: Hip fracture in elderly individuals is frequent and is related to a high rate of mortality. Finding the best predictor of death will help to develop better patient care. Aim - To analyze the reliability of the clinical data and assessment scores to predict mortality in acute hip fracture in elderly patients. PATIENT AND METHODS: Prospective data were collected from all patients > 65 years with acute hip fracture from May to October 2020. The clinical data collected were age, sex, comorbidities, medication, type of fracture and presence of delirium. The assessment scores were ASA, Lee, ACP and Charlson. RESULTS: The statistically significant results were age > 80 years (OR 1.121 IC95% [1.028-1.221] p = 0.0101) and number of medications (OR5.991 95% CI [2.422-14.823] p <0.001). Three scores showed a correlation with mortality: ASA score (p = 0.017), Lee score (p = 0.024) and ACP score (p = 0.013). The Charlson Comorbidity Index did not correlate with mortality (p = 0.172). CONCLUSION: To stratify the risk of death, both clinical data and scores should be used. The best clinical indicators are age and number of medications, and the scores are ASA, Lee and ACP.
