39440834|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and cause of dementia. Despite the prevalence of AD, there is a lack of effective disease modifying therapies. Recent evidence indicates that the gut microbiome (GMB) may play a role in AD through its regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. Gut microbes regulate physiology through their production of metabolites and byproducts. Microbial metabolites may be beneficial or detrimental to the pathogenesis and progression of inflammatory diseases. A better understanding of the role GMB-derived metabolites play in AD may lead to the development of therapeutic strategies for AD. In this review, we summarize the function of bioactive GMB-derived metabolites and byproducts and their roles in AD models. We also call for more focus on this area in the gut-brain axis field in order to create effective therapies for AD.
