27308863|t|The Effect of Changes in Selected Age-specific Causes of Death on Non-Hispanic White Life Expectancy Between 2000 and 2014.
27308863|a|KEY FINDINGS: Data from the National Vital Statistics System, Mortality  Between 2000 and 2014, life expectancy increased by 3.6, 2.6, and 1.4 years, respectively, for non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white persons.  The 1.4-year increase in life expectancy for non-Hispanic white persons would have been greater if not for increases in death rates due to unintentional injuries, suicide, Alzheimer's disease, chronic liver disease, and hypertension.  Increases in death rates due to unintentional injuries, suicide, and chronic liver disease were large enough to increase all-cause non-Hispanic white death rates for ages 25-34, 35-44, and 45-54.  Increases in death rates due to unintentional poisonings for ages 25-34, 35-44, and 45-54 had the greatest impact on the change in life expectancy for non-Hispanic white persons.
