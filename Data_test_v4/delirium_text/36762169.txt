36762169|a|Background: Global mortality rates from dementia continue to rise.  Evidence suggests that there is limited provision of palliative care for people with dementia and this is a cause of grave concern. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has further exposed the inequalities of care for this vulnerable population. Proactive palliative care, delivered by multidisciplinary healthcare professionals (HCPs), can offer significant benefits to people with dementia.  However, little is known about the components of effective education and training for HCPs who care for people with advancing dementia at end of life. Objective: The aim of this scoping review is to identify effective education and training interventions for HCPs, who care for people with advanced dementia approaching end of life. Inclusion criteria: Studies that used a palliative care educational intervention for HCPs working with patients with dementia will be included. Studies that explore undergraduate or postgraduate education and training in dementia palliative care for HCPs will be included.  Study designs such as quantitative, qualitative, mixed method studies, and case studies will be included. Methods: The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews will be used for this review. The following databases will be searched: CINAHL, ERIC, Medline, SocIndex, PsycINFO. In addition, grey literature searches will be limited to the first 100 searches using Google Scholar and Open-Grey. Study selection will involve the reviewer screening titles and abstracts. Then, two independent reviewers will further assess the studies in full for those that meet the inclusion criteria. In line with the JBI framework, data will be extracted using a draft data extraction tool. This will facilitate a chronological narrative synthesis of results in line with the study's overall aim to identify effective education and training interventions for HCPs, who care for patients with dementia, nearing end of life.
