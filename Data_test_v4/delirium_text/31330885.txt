31330885|a|Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. (S. chinensis) is a well-known botanical medicine and nutritional supplement that has been shown to have potential effects on neurodegeneration. To investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of S. chinensis fruit extract, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was used to induce behavioral disorders and dopaminergic neuronal damage in mice, and biochemical indicators were examined. Male C57BL/6 mice were used to establish the MPTP-induced parkinsonian syndrome model. Open field and rotarod tests were performed to evaluate the overall manifestation of motor deficits and rodent motor coordination. The mice were divided into 8 groups as follows: normal control; MPTP alone (25 mg/kg, i.p.); S. chinensis extract pretreatment (0.5, 1.5, 5 g/kg, p.o.); and S. chinensis extract treatment (0.5, 1.5, 5 g/kg, p.o.). Liquid chromatography coupled to electrochemical detection was used to monitor neurochemicals in the striatum. Tyrosine hydroxylase content was measured by immunohistochemistry, and biochemical antioxidative indicators were used to evaluate the potential neuroprotective effects of S. chinensis fruit extract. The results demonstrated that treatment with S. chinensis fruit extract ameliorated MPTP-induced deficits in behavior, exercise balance, dopamine level, dopaminergic neurons, and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in the striatum of mice. Among the pretreated and treatment groups, a high dose of S. chinensis fruit extract was the most effective treatment. In conclusion, S. chinensis fruit extract is a potential herbal drug candidate for the amelioration and prevention of Parkinson's disease.
