33481244|t|Fluorogenic XY-69 in Lipid Vesicles for Measuring Activity of Phospholipase C Isozymes.
33481244|a|Mammalian phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes are major signaling nodes that regulate a wide range of cellular processes. Dysregulation of PLC activity has been associated with a growing list of human diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. However, methods to directly and continuously monitor PLC activity at membranes with high sensitivity and throughput are still lacking. We have developed XY-69, a fluorogenic PIP2 analog, which can be efficiently hydrolyzed by PLC isozymes either in solution or at membranes. Here, we describe the optimized assay conditions and protocol to measure the activity of PLC-gamma1 (D1165H) with XY-69 in lipid vesicles. The described protocol also applies to other PLC isozymes.
