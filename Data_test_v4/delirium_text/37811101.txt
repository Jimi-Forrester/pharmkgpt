The goal is to understand the direct and indirect populations affected by mental distress and identify potential interventions. Methodology: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using various databases, including Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ScienceDirect, PubMed, PLoS One, and Web of Science. The search utilized relevant keywords to investigate the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on mental health. The selected articles were critically evaluated and analyzed to identify key findings and insights. Main findings: Mental health, being an intrinsic component of overall well-being, plays a vital role in physiological functioning. The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had a devastating global impact. Beyond the respiratory symptoms, individuals recovering from COVID-19 commonly experience additional ailments, such as arrhythmia, depression, anxiety, and fatigue. Healthcare professionals on the frontlines face an elevated risk of mental illness. However, it is crucial to recognize that the general population also grapples with comparable levels of mental distress. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the significance of addressing mental health concerns. Various strategies can help mitigate the impact, including counselling, fostering open lines of communication, providing mental support, ensuring comprehensive patient care, and administering appropriate medications. In severe cases, treatment may involve the supplementation of essential vitamins and antidepressant therapy. By understanding the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on mental health, healthcare providers and policymakers can develop targeted interventions to support individuals and communities affected by the pandemic. Continued research and collaborative efforts are essential to address this pervasive issue effectively.
