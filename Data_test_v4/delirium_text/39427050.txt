39427050|a|Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) and intracranial aneurysm (IA) were two different types of diseases that occurred in the brain, ruptured IA (RIA) survivors may experience varying degrees of cognitive dysfunction. Neither AD nor IA is easily recognizable by an early onset so that the incidence of adverse clinical outcomes would be on the rise. Therefore, we focused on the exploration of the shared genes and molecular mechanisms between AD and IA, which would be significant for the efficiency of co-screening and co-diagnosis. Two GEO datasets were selected for the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differentially expressed gene screening, obtaining 78 overlapped genes. Next, 9 hub genes were identified by the protein-protein interaction network, including PIK3CA, GAB1, IGF1R, PLCB1, PGR, PDGFRB, PLCE1, FGFR3, and SYNJ1. The interactions among the hub genes, miRNA, and TFs were also explored. Meanwhile, we performed GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses for the results of WGCNA and hub genes, which showed that the Ras signaling and Rap1 signaling were the main shared pathogenesis. In conclusion, the present bioinformatics analysis revealed that AD and IA had the shared genes and molecular mechanisms, and these outcomes were associated with inflammation and calcium homeostasis, which could provide research clues for further studies.
