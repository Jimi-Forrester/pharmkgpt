9536510|t|[Decreased erythropoiesis and biochemical deviations in psychogeriatric patients].
9536510|a|Laboratory investigations were performed in group of 60 psychogeriatric patients on their admission into hospital, in order to elucidate the interdependence of erythropoiesis and the concentrations of albumin and several vitamins in blood or serum. The results of albumin concentration and ETK activity show that 47 out of 60 the patients (= 78%) are in a poor nutritional condition. In 13 of these 47 subjects (= 28%) deficiency with respect to vitamin B12 or folic acid is presumed from decreased serum concentrations. In 6 of the 47 patients in poor nutritional condition (= 13%) decreased reticulocyte concentrations are shown. Further evaluation of differences between the respective subgroups revealed significantly reduced ETK activity and lower reticulocyte concentrations in the group of delirium patients compared to the other patients groups and to the reference group.
