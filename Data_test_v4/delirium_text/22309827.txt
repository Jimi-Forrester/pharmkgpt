22309827|a|Ovarian hormones can influence brain regions crucial to higher cognitive functions, such as learning and memory, acting at structural, cellular and functional levels, and modulating neurotransmitter systems. Among the main effects of estrogens, the protective role that they may play against the deterioration of cognitive functions occurring with normal aging is of essential importance. In fact, during the last century, there has been a 30 years increase in female life expectancy, from 50 to 83 years; however, the mean age of spontaneous menopause remains stable, 50-51 years, with variability related to race and ethnicity. Therefore, women are now spending a greater fraction of their lives in a hypoestrogenic state. Although many cognitive functions seem to be unaffected by normal aging, age-related impairments are particularly evident in tasks involving working memory (WM), whose deficits are a recognized feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many studies conducted over the past two decades showed that the female gonadal hormone estradiol can influence performance of learning and memory tasks, both in animal and humans. There is a great deal of evidence, mostly from animal models, that estrogens can facilitate or enhance performance on WM tasks; therefore, it is very important to clarify their role on this type of memory. To this aim, in this review we briefly describe the most relevant neurobiological bases of estrogens, that can explain their effects on cognitive functioning, and then we summarize the results of works conducted in our laboratory, both on animals and humans, utilizing the menstrual/estrous cycle as a useful noninvasive model. Finally, we review the possible role of estrogens in neuropathological conditions, such as AD and schizophrenia.
