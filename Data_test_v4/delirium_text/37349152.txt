37349152|t|Early and Late Toxicities of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cells.
37349152|a|As chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is increasingly integrated into clinical practice across a range of malignancies, identifying and treating inflammatory toxicities will be vital to success. Early experiences with CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy identified cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity as key acute toxicities and led to unified initiatives to mitigate the influence of these complications. In this section, we provide an update on the current state of CAR T-cell-related toxicities, with an emphasis on emerging acute toxicities affecting additional organ systems and considerations for delayed toxicities and late effects.
