37366533|a|Pneumonia elicits the production of cytotoxic beta amyloid (Ab) that contributes to end-organ dysfunction, yet the mechanism(s) linking infection to activation of the amyloidogenic pathway that produces cytotoxic Ab is unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that g-secretase activating protein (GSAP), which contributes to the amyloidogenic pathway in the brain, promotes end-organ dysfunction following bacterial pneumonia. First-in-kind GSAP knockout rats were generated. Wild type and knockout rats possessed similar body weights, organ weights, circulating blood cell counts, arterial blood gases, and cardiac indices at baseline. Intratracheal Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection caused acute lung injury and a hyperdynamic circulatory state. Whereas infection led to arterial hypoxemia in wild type rats, the alveolar-capillary barrier integrity was preserved in GSAP knockout rats. Infection potentiated myocardial infarction following ischemia-reperfusion injury, and this potentiation was abolished in knockout rats. In the hippocampus, GSAP contributed to both pre- and postsynaptic neurotransmission, increasing the presynaptic action potential recruitment, decreasing neurotransmitter release probability, decreasing the postsynaptic response, and preventing postsynaptic hyperexcitability, resulting in greater early long-term potentiation but reduced late long-term potentiation. Infection abolished early and late long-term potentiation in wild type rats, whereas the late long-term potentiation was partially preserved in GSAP knockout rats. Furthermore, hippocampi from knockout rats, and both the wild type and knockout rats following infection, exhibited a GSAP-dependent increase in neurotransmitter release probability and postsynaptic hyperexcitability. These results elucidate an unappreciated role for GSAP in innate immunity and highlight the contribution of GSAP to end-organ dysfunction during infection.
