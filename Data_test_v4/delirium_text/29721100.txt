29721100|t|Establishing sheep as an experimental species to validate ultrasound-mediated blood-brain barrier opening for potential therapeutic interventions.
29721100|a|Rationale: Treating diseases of the brain such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is challenging as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) effectively restricts access of a large number of potentially useful drugs. A potential solution to this problem is presented by therapeutic ultrasound, a novel treatment modality that can achieve transient BBB opening in species including rodents, facilitated by biologically inert microbubbles that are routinely used in a clinical setting for contrast enhancement. However, in translating rodent studies to the human brain, the presence of a thick cancellous skull that both absorbs and distorts ultrasound presents a challenge. A larger animal model that is more similar to humans is therefore required in order to establish a suitable protocol and to test devices. Here we investigated whether sheep provide such a model. Methods: In a stepwise manner, we used a total of 12 sheep to establish a sonication protocol using a spherically focused transducer. This was assisted by ex vivo simulations based on CT scans to establish suitable sonication parameters. BBB opening was assessed by Evans blue staining and a range of histological tests. Results: Here we demonstrate noninvasive microbubble-mediated BBB opening through the intact sheep skull. Our non-recovery protocol allowed for BBB opening at the base of the brain, and in areas relevant for AD, including the cortex and hippocampus. Linear time-shift invariant analysis and finite element analysis simulations were used to optimize the position of the transducer and to predict the acoustic pressure and location of the focus. Conclusion: Our study establishes sheep as a novel animal model for ultrasound-mediated BBB opening and highlights opportunities and challenges in using this model. Moreover, as sheep develop an AD-like pathology with aging, they represent a large animal model that could potentially complement the use of non-human primates.
