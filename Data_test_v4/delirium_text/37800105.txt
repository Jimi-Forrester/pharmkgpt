37800105|t|Vegetarian Diet for Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction: Cons.
37800105|a|Numerous studies have reported that adopting a plant-based diet can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Not only does a vegetarian diet help mitigate the risk of these diseases, but it also contributes to enhancing environmental sustainability. However, it is not necessary to universally recommend a vegetarian diet as a preventive measure against CVDs. More research is needed to determine whether completely excluding animal products is necessary, or if adhering to a predominantly plant-based diet is sufficient. In this opinion paper, the potential adverse health effects of a vegetarian diet and the barriers associated with adopting it will be discussed, in order to provide a rationale for the disadvantages of using a vegetarian diet for CVD risk reduction.
