32793923|t|A phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of COVID-19 outcomes by race using the electronic health records data in Michigan Medicine.
32793923|a|BACKGROUND: We perform a phenome-wide scan to identify pre-existing conditions related to COVID-19 susceptibility and prognosis across the medical phenome and how they vary by race. METHODS: The study is comprised of 53,853 patients who were tested/positive for COVID-19 between March 10 and September 2, 2020 at a large academic medical center. RESULTS: Pre-existing conditions strongly associated with hospitalization were renal failure, pulmonary heart disease, and respiratory failure. Hematopoietic conditions were associated with ICU admission/mortality and mental disorders were associated with mortality in non-Hispanic Whites. Circulatory system and genitourinary conditions were associated with ICU admission/mortality in non-Hispanic Blacks. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding pre-existing clinical diagnoses related to COVID-19 outcomes informs the need for targeted screening to support specific vulnerable populations to improve disease prevention and healthcare delivery.
