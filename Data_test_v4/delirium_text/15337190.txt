15337190|t|Neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of neurodegenerative disease.
15337190|a|Patients who have neurodegenerative disease frequently present to the ophthalmologist with visual complaints. The causes of the symptoms are varied and include visual sensory and ocular motor dysfunction. This article provides an overview of the neuroophthalmic manifestations of the most common neurodegenerative diseases presenting with visual dysfunction, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and others. Evaluation of visual function in patients who have neurodegenerative disorder can be challenging, but familiarity with the type of visual dysfunction most commonly associated with each disorder will allow for a focused assessment and treatment when possible.
