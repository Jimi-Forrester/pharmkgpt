18405661|a|Members of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors have been reported to be up-regulated in Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides on C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta, previously shown to be induced by inflammatory stimuli in glial cells. Surprisingly, electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that both Abeta(1-42) and Abeta(25-35) blocked C/EBP activation induced by the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mixed primary glial cell cultures from rat. Abeta also blocked IL-1beta- or LPS-induced C/EBP protein levels. The most prominent effects were observed on DNA binding activity and protein levels of C/EBPdelta. Our results demonstrate a dysregulation of C/EBP when glial cells are activated in the presence of Alzheimer Abeta peptides.
