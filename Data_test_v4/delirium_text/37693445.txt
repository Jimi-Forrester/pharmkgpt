37693445|a|We discuss two potential non-invasive MRI methods to cross-sectionally study two distinct facets of the glymphatic system and its association with sleep and aging. We apply diffusion-based intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging to evaluate pseudodiffusion coefficient, D* , or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) movement across large spaces like the subarachnoid space (SAS). We also performed perfusion-based multi-echo, Hadamard encoded multi-delay arterial spin labeling (ASL) to evaluate whole brain cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) and transendothelial exchange (T ex ) of water from the vasculature into the perivascular space and parenchyma. Both methods were used in young adults (N=9, 6F, 23+-3 years old) in the setting of sleep and sleep deprivation. To study aging, 10 older adults, (6F, 67+-3 years old) were imaged after a night of normal sleep only and compared with the young adults. D* in SAS was significantly (p<0.05) lesser after sleep deprivation (0.014+-0.001 mm 2 /s) than after normal sleep (0.016+-0.001 mm 2 /s), but was unchanged with aging. Cortical CBF and T ex on the other hand, were unchanged after sleep deprivation but were significantly lower in older adults (37+-3 ml/100g/min, 476+-66 ms) than young adults (42+-2 ml/100g/min, 624+-66 ms). IVIM was thus, sensitive to sleep physiology and multi-echo, multi-delay ASL was sensitive to aging.
