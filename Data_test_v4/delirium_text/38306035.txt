38306035|t|Current Status and Challenges in Dementia Care in the Philippines: A Scoping Review.
38306035|a|Background: Dementia prevalence is increasing in low- and middle-income countries such as the Philippines. Objective: This study aimed to give an overview of dementia care in the Philippines and to identify gaps in terms of local epidemiology, research, financial coverage, diagnostics, pharmacotherapy, manpower, and caregiver support. Methods: This scoping review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines extension for scoping reviews. Six international and two local databases, and government and non-government websites were searched. Data published in the English or Filipino language on dementia epidemiology, research, diagnostics, management, manpower, and training were extracted from the earliest indexed record until June 2022. Results: The prevalence of dementia in the Philippines is high and research output on all aspects of dementia is low. Cost is a major barrier as health care coverage is limited, with reliance mainly on out-of-pocket payments, leading to challenges in the proper diagnosis and treatment of dementia. There is a low specialist-to-population ratio, with shortages beyond manpower and training. Conclusions: Gaps in dementia care include limited published local data, high healthcare costs, inadequate health financing, and limited manpower.
