29634848|t|Early Readmission Risk Identification for Hospitalized Older Adults With Decompensated Heart Failure.
29634848|a|The current study evaluated risk factors of early hospital readmission in geriatric patients with acute heart failure (HF) and analyzed 2,279 consecutively hospitalized older adults with decompensated HF from November 2013 to October 2014 across 15 U.S. hospitals. The eTracker-HF was designed to make risk factors known to treating clinicians in electronic health records. Multilevel multivariate logistic regression was applied to examine the association between risk factors and all-cause and HF 30-day readmission rates. All-cause and HF 30-day readmission rates were 22.3% and 9.8%, respectively. Old age, non-White ethnicity, delirium, physical impairment, ejection fraction <40%, advanced chronic kidney disease, and previous myocardial infarction were associated with all-cause and HF readmission. Home health care use was inversely associated with early readmission. In addition to demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, geriatric syndromes were associated with early readmission. Discharge to home health care may reduce early readmission in these patients. [Res Gerontol Nurs. 2018; 11(4):190-197.].
