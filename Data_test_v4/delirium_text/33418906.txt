33418906|t|Mechanistic Insight into Royal Protein Inhibiting the Gram-Positive Bacteria.
33418906|a|Royal jelly (RJ), a natural honeybee product, has a wide range of antibacterial activities. N-glycosylated major royal jelly protein 2 (N-MRJP2), purified from RJ, can inhibit the growth of Paenibacillus larvae (P. larvae, Gram-positive), a contagious etiological agent of the American foulbrood disease of honeybees. However, the inhibitory mechanism is largely unknown. Antibacterial assay and membrane proteome were conducted to investigate the inhibition capacity of RJ from different instar larvae and P. larvae treated by N-MRJP2, respectively. The similar antibacterial efficiency of RJ from different larval instar indicates that RJ is vital for the adaptive immune defense of small larvae. The killing of P. larvae by N-MRJP2 is achieved by disturbing the cell wall biosynthesis, increasing the permeability of cell membrane, hindering aerobic respiration, restraining cell division and inducing cell death. This demonstrates that RJ is critical for the passive immunity of immature larvae and N-MRJP2 can be used as natural antibiotic substance to resist P. larvae, even for other gram-positive bacteria. This constitutes solid evidence that RJ and N-MRJP2 have potentials as novel antibacterial agents.
