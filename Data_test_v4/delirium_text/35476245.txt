35476245|t|COVID-19 and neurologic manifestations: a synthesis from the child neurologist's corner.
35476245|a|BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been a global health issue. The main clinical presentation of this virus is a flu-like disease; however, patients with diverse neurologic manifestations have also been reported. In this review, we attempt to summarize, discuss and update the knowledge of the neurologic manifestations in the pediatric population affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pandemic's effects in children with neurologic diseases. DATA SOURCES: This review analyzes studies found on the PubMed database using the following keywords: Neurologic manifestations COVID-19, Neurological COVID-19, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, pediatric COVID-19, COVID-19 in children, MIS-C, Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome, Guillain Barre Syndrome, Stroke, ADEM, and Anti-NMDA encephalitis. All studies cited were published between 2004 and 2022, and represent the most relevant articles in the field. The World Health Organization COVID-19 online dashboard was assessed to obtain updated epidemiological data. RESULTS: The most common neurologic symptoms in the pediatric population are headache, seizures, encephalopathy, and muscle weakness. These can be present during COVID-19 or weeks after recovering from it. Children who presented with multi-system inflammatory syndrome had a higher incidence of neurologic manifestations, which conferred a greater risk of morbidity and mortality. Several neuro-pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed, including direct virus invasion, hyper-inflammatory reactions, multi-systemic failure, prothrombotic states, and immune-mediated processes. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected patients with neurologic diseases, making it challenging to access controls, treatment, and therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Various neurologic manifestations have been associated with children's SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is important to identify and give them proper and opportune treatment because they can be potentially grave and life-threatening; some can lead to long-lasting sequelae. Different neuro-pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed, however, a causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurologic manifestations remains to be proven. Patients with neurologic diseases are especially affected by COVID-19, not only by the disease itself but also by its complications and pandemic management measures.
