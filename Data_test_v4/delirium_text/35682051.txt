35682051|t|Adipokines Level and Cognitive Function-Disturbance in Homeostasis in Older People with Poorly Managed Hypertension: A Pilot Study.
35682051|a|AIM: To explore the network relationship between cognitive function, depressive symptom intensity, body composition, proxies of cognitive reserve, trophic factor, adipokines and myokines, physical performance and blood pressure in a group of older people with poorly managed hypertension (PMHTN) compared to a normotensive (NTN) group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: History of hypertension and blood pressure level were examined in older participants. Thirty-one subjects diagnosed with PMHTN (history of hypertension diagnosis and values of sBP or dBP over 140/90 mmHg) and eighteen NTN (lack of history of hypertension and sBP and dBP lower than 140/90 mmHg) participated. Participants completed physical and cognitive function assessments: including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and its two subtests Delayed Recall (DR) and Verbal Fluency (VF) and Trail Making Test Part B (TMT B). Factors associated with cognitive functioning: age, years of education, cognitive and travel activity were assessed using a questionnaire. Visceral fat was determined by bioimpedance testing and gait velocity and agility assessed using an Up and Go test. To summarize the strength and direction (negative or positive) of a relationship between two variables, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used. Then, network graphs were created to illustrate the relationship between variables. Node strength (number of edges per node), neighbourhood connectivity (the average connectivity of all the neighbours of a node), stress (the number of shortest paths passing through each node) were compared in network from PMHTN group to network from NTN group. RESULTS: Neighbourhood connectivity and stress were significantly higher in of the PMHTN network compared to NTN (6.03 +- 1.5 vs. 4.23 +- 2.5, p = 0.005 and 118.21 +- 137.6 vs. 56.87 +- 101.5, p = 0.02, accordingly). CONCLUSION: In older subjects with poorly managed hypertension, dyshomeostasis was observed, compared to normotensive subjects.
