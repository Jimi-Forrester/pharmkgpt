38226790|t|Photocontrol of the beta-Hairpin Polypeptide Structure through an Optimized Azobenzene-Based Amino Acid Analogue.
38226790|a|A family of neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxias, are associated with an abnormal polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in mutant proteins that become prone to form amyloid-like aggregates. Prior studies have suggested a key role for beta-hairpin formation as a driver of nucleation and aggregation, but direct experimental studies have been challenging. Toward such research, we set out to enable spatiotemporal control over beta-hairpin formation by the introduction of a photosensitive beta-turn mimic in the polypeptide backbone, consisting of a newly designed azobenzene derivative. The reported derivative overcomes the limitations of prior approaches associated with poor photochemical properties and imperfect structural compatibility with the desired beta-turn structure. A new azobenzene-based beta-turn mimic was designed, synthesized, and found to display improved photochemical properties, both prior and after incorporation into the backbone of a polyQ polypeptide. The two isomers of the azobenzene-polyQ peptide showed different aggregate structures of the polyQ peptide fibrils, as demonstrated by electron microscopy and solid-state NMR (ssNMR). Notably, only peptides in which the beta-turn structure was stabilized (azobenzene in the cis configuration) closely reproduced the spectral fingerprints of toxic, beta-hairpin-containing fibrils formed by mutant huntingtin protein fragments implicated in HD. These approaches and findings will enable better deciphering of the roles of beta-hairpin structures in protein aggregation processes in HD and other amyloid-related neurodegenerative diseases.
