24938869|t|Incidence of delirium in children with cancer.
24938869|a|There are limited data on the incidence of delirium in children with cancer. We performed a retrospective chart review of all pediatric oncology admissions over a 1 year period to determine the incidence of delirium in this population. We identified seven patients with delirium (10% incidence). Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and is likely under-recognized in this population. Improved diagnosis and treatment of delirium may improve outcomes in children with cancer.
