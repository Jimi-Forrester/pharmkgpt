38202798|t|A Review: Pharmacological Effect of Natural Compounds in Diospyros kaki Leaves from the Perspective of Oxidative Stress.
38202798|a|Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between reactive oxygen species and antioxidant levels. Current research suggests that oxidative stress is one of the key factors in the development of many chronic diseases, and it has been a concern for many years. Many natural compounds have been studied for their special free-radical-scavenging properties. The major chemical constituents of the leaves of Diospyros kaki are flavonoids and triterpenoids, both of which are potential antioxidants that can prevent damage caused by reactive oxygen species or reactive nitrogen species and ameliorate diseases associated with oxidative stress. In addition to the major constituents such as flavonoids and triterpenoids, the leaves of Diospyros kaki include compounds such as phenylpropanoids, alkaloids, phenolic acids, and terpenes. Studies have shown these compounds have certain antioxidant and neuroprotective activities. Experiments have shown that flavonoids or the extracts from the leaves of Diospyros kaki have a variety of good pharmacological activities, which could activate oxidative stress and mitochondrial apoptosis, inhibit the proliferation of human prostate cancer cells and induce apoptosis. It also could achieve the effect of anti-cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis by regulating oxidative stress. The main chemical substance of the leaves of Diospyros kaki regulating oxidative stress may be these multi-hydroxyl structure compounds. These natural products exhibit significant antioxidant activity and are an important basis for the leaves of Diospyros kaki to treat human diseases by regulating oxidative stress. This review summarizes the structural types of natural products in the leaves of Diospyros kaki and elaborates the mechanism of the leaves of Diospyros kaki in neuroprotection, anti-diabetes, renal protection, retinal degenerative diseases, and anti-cancer from a new perspective of oxidative stress, including how it supplements other pharmacological effects. The chemical constituents and pharmacological effects of the leaves of Diospyros kaki are summarized in this paper. The relationship between the chemical components in the leaves of Diospyros kaki and their pharmacological effects is summarized from the perspective of oxidative stress. This review provides a reference for the study of natural anti-oxidative stress drugs.
