12045399|a|Imbalances of oxidative homeostasis and lipid peroxidation have been revealed as important factors involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease contain increased levels of lipid-peroxidation products such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal or acrolein, and enhanced lipid peroxidation can also be detected in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma from such patients. Recent research revealed that the interplay of transition metals, amyloid-beta peptide and lipid peroxidation might be responsible for increased oxidative stress and cell damage in this disease. In particular, the contrasting roles of amyloid-beta peptide, as a possible transition metal-chelating antioxidant for lipoproteins and a pro-oxidant when aggregated in brain tissue, has been the focus of discussion recently. In this context, lipid peroxidation has to be seen as an important part of the pathophysiological cascade in Alzheimer's disease, and its measurement in body fluids might serve as a therapy control for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.
