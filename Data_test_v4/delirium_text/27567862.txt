27567862|t|Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases: Expected Economic Impact on Europe-A Call for a Uniform European Strategy.
27567862|a|The purpose of this study is to analyze the economic burden of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) in Europe. On the basis of available data about the number of persons with dementia, their prevalence, and treatment and care costs, a mean cost burden is estimated for the year of 2030 and for the year of 2050 in Europe. The method of retrospective analysis of available sources was used; furthermore, analysis of database data such as WHO and Eurostat, which provide information about the number of older people and people with dementia; and specification of direct and indirect medical and nonmedical costs of patients with AD and PD from current studies was also used. The findings of this study confirm that the number of patients affected with AD and PD, as well as annual costs of the treatment and care of these patients, in the selected European countries are rapidly growing. The cost burden of both AD and PD in the selected European countries rises year by year, and by 2050, the cost burden of both diseases in fact will be almost two times higher in comparison with the year of 2010. In 2050, the overall mean cost burden is estimated to reach 357 billion Euros. The European Union calls for a joint initiative in the development of a uniformed strategic plan in the fight against dementia.
