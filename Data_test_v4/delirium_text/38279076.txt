38279076|t|Cognition and Cognitive Reserve.
38279076|a|Cognition is a mental process that provides the ability to think, know, and learn. Though cognitive skills are necessary to do daily tasks and activities, cognitive aging causes changes in various cognitive functions. Cognitive abilities that are preserved and strengthened by experience can be kept as a reserve and utilized when necessary. The concept of reserving cognition was found when people with Alzheimer's disease had differences in clinical manifestations and cognitive functions. The cognitive reserve builds resilience against cognitive decline and improves the quality of life. Also, several lines of studies have found that the plasticity between neurons has a significant impact on cognitive reserve and acts against cognitive decline. To extend the findings, the present study provides a comprehensive understanding of cognitive reserve and the variables that are involved in maintaining cognition. The study also considers reading as one of the cognitive proxies that develops and maintains cognitive reserve.
