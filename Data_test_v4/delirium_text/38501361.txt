38501361|t|Chemical characterization, multivariate analysis and comparison of biological activities of different parts of Fraxinus mandshurica.
38501361|a|Fraxinus mandshurica (Oleaceae) is used as a traditional medicinal plant for the treatment of red eyes, menstrual disorders, excessive leucorrhea, chronic bronchitis and psoriasis. To perform chemical characterization of the secondary metabolites of F. mandshurica roots, bark, stems and leaves, 32 samples were collected from eight provinces in this study. A total of 64 chemical components were detected from four different parts of F. mandshurica by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Meanwhile, a total of nine secoiridoids were obtained by natural product chemical extraction, isolation and identification methods. Quantitative analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-mass spectrometry showed the highest total content of secoiridoids in the bark, which is also consistent with the traditional medicinal parts. The results of methodological validation showed that the correlation coefficient (R2 ) values were all >0.9993, indicating a good linear range of the standard curve, while the relative standard deviations of precision, reproducibility and stability were <3%, and the spiked recoveries ranged from 98.22 to 102.27%, indicating that the experimental method was reliable and stable. In addition, fingerprinting and a heatmap were established to demonstrate the content trends of F. mandshurica more visually from different origins. Multivariate analysis, including principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis, was performed to determine the chemical characteristics of different parts of F. mandshurica, and six characteristic secoiridoids that could be used to distinguish different origins were screened. Finally, the inhibition of tyrosinase, alpha-glucosidase, acetylcholinesterase and pancreatic lipase activities by the nine characteristic compounds and extracts from different parts were investigated, and the results showed that they all exhibited different degrees of enzyme activity inhibition and thus have potential applications in whitening and blemish removal, hypoglycemia, anti-Alzheimer's disease and anti-obesity as a new source of natural enzyme activity inhibitors. This study establishes an identification and evaluation method applicable to phytochemistry of different origins, which is a guideline for quality control, origin evaluation and clinical application of traditional medicinal plants. This is also an unprecedented study on the identification of the chemical composition of different parts of F. mandshurica, characteristic compounds and the inhibition of enzyme activity of extracts from different parts.
