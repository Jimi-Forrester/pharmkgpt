36314202|a|BACKGROUND: Klotho is a longevity and neuroprotective hormone encoded by the KLOTHO gene, and heterozygosity for the KL-VS variant confers a protective effect against neurodegenerative disease. OBJECTIVE: Test whether klotho concentrations in serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) vary as a function of KLOTHO KL-VS genotype, determine whether circulating klotho concentrations from serum and CSF differ from one another, and evaluate whether klotho levels are associated with Alzheimer's disease risk factors. METHODS: Circulating klotho was measured in serum (n = 1,116) and CSF (n = 183) of cognitively intact participants (aged 62.4 +- 6.5 years; 69.5% female). KLOTHO KL-VS zygosity (non-carrier; heterozygote; homozygote) was also determined. Linear regression was used to test whether klotho hormone concentration varied as a function of KL-VS genotype, specimen source, and demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Serum and CSF klotho were higher in KL-VS carriers than non-carriers. Klotho concentration was higher in CSF than in serum. Females had higher serum and CSF klotho, while younger age was associated with higher klotho in CSF. CONCLUSION: In a cohort enriched for risk for Alzheimer's disease, heterozygotic and homozygotic carriers of the KL-VS allele, females, and younger individuals have higher circulating klotho. Fluid source, KL-VS genotype, age, and sex should be considered in analyses of circulating klotho on brain health.
