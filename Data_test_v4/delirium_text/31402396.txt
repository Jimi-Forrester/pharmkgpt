31402396|a|Previous diagnoses of patients with hip fracture influence the hospitalization cost of these patients, either directly or by increasing the risk of in-hospital adverse events associated with increased costs. PURPOSE: To investigate how previous diagnoses influence the occurrence of in-hospital adverse events and how both factors impact on hospital costs. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of the hospital Minimum Basic Data Set. Patients aged 70 years or older admitted for hip fracture (HF) at a single University Hospital between January 2012 and December 2016. Both, previous diagnoses and adverse events, were defined according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9/ICD-10). The anticipated cost of each admission was calculated based on diagnosis-related groups and using the "all patients refined" method (APR-DRG). The occurrence of adverse events during hospital stay was assessed by excluding all diagnoses present on admission. RESULTS: The record included 1571 patients with a mean (SD) age of 84 years. The most frequent previous diagnoses were diabetes (n = 432, 27.5%) and dementia (n = 251, 16.0%), and the most frequent adverse events were delirium (n = 238, 15.1%) and anemia (n = 188, 12.0%). The mean (SD) total acute care costs per patient were $8752.1 (1864.4). The presence of heart failure, COPD, and kidney disease at admission significantly increased the hospitalization cost. In-hospital adverse events of delirium, cardiac events, anemia, urinary tract infection, and digestive events significantly increased costs. The multivariate analyses identified kidney disease as a previous diagnosis significantly contributing to explain an increase in hospitalization costs, and delirium, cardiac disease, anemia, urinary infection, respiratory event, and respiratory infection as in-hospital adverse events significantly contributing to an increase of hospitalization costs. CONCLUSIONS: Although few baseline comorbidities have a direct impact on hospitalization costs, most previous diagnoses increase the risk of in-hospital adverse events, which ultimately influence the hospitalization cost.
