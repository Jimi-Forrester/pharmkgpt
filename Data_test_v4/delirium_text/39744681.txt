39744681|a|Background: Cathepsin D (Ctsd) has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its role in degrading intracellular amyloid beta (Abeta). Enhancing Ctsd activity could reduce Abeta42 accumulation and restore the Abeta42/40 ratio, offering a potential AD treatment strategy. Methods: This study explored Ctsd demethylation in AD mouse models using dCas9-Tet1-mediated epigenome editing. We identified dCas9-Tet1 as an effective tool for demethylating the endogenous Ctsd gene in primary neurons and in vivo brains. Results: Treatment with Ctsd-targeted dCas9-Tet1 in primary neurons overexpressing mutant APP (mutAPP) reduced Abeta peptide levels and the Abeta42/40 ratio. Additionally, in vivo demethylation of Ctsd via dCas9-Tet1 in 5xFAD mice significantly altered Abeta levels and alleviated cognitive and behavioral deficits. Conclusion: These findings offer valuable insights into developing epigenome editing-based gene therapy strategies for AD.
