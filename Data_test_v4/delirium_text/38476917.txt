38476917|a|As the global population ages, the prevalence of neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke continues to increase. Therefore, it is necessary to develop preventive and therapeutic methods against neuroinflammatory diseases. Lipofundin is a lipid emulsion commonly used in clinical anesthetic solvents and nutritional supplements. Lipid emulsions have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties. However, the potential beneficial effect of lipofundin against neuroinflammation requires elucidation. In the present study, two cell models were used to investigate the efficacy of lipofundin against neuroinflammation. In the first model, BV2 mouse microglial cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce nitric oxide (NO) production as a model of neuroinflammation. In the second model, HMC3 human microglial were activated by LPS, and changes in the secretion of factors associated with inflammation were analyzed using Luminex xMAP  technology. Griess assay results revealed that lipofundin significantly prevented and treated LPS-induced NO production. An anti-neuroinflammatory effect was also observed in HMC3 cells, where lipofundin exhibited excellent preventive and therapeutic properties by reducing the LPS-induced expression and secretion of interleukin-1beta. Notably, lipofundin also promoted the secretion of certain growth factors, suggesting a potential neuroprotective effect. These results demonstrate that, in addition to its role as a solvent for drugs and nutritional support, lipofundin may also have beneficial effects in alleviating the progression of neuroinflammation. These findings may serve as an important reference for future translational medicine applications.
