39218460|t|Geriatric nutritional risk index predicts postoperative delirium in elderly: A meta-analysis.
39218460|a|OBJECTIVES: To review current evidence on using the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) in predicting postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients. METHODS: The literature search was performed in core databases to include all the cohort studies on the association between GNRI and risk of POD for further meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies with 4242 patients underwent this meta-analysis, which showed that the risk of POD was higher in patients with moderate and high GNRI than the ones with low GNRI (odds ratio [OR]=2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.58, 2.64], p<0.001), and moderate and high GNRI significantly increased the risk of POD in patients of 60 to 75 years or above [OR=1.98, 95%CI (1.49, 2.62), p<0.001; OR=2.79, 95%CI (1.38, 5.64), p=0.004, respectively]. CONCLUSION: Therefore, moderate and high GNRI increased the risk of POD in elderly patients.
