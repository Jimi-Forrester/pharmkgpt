37736681|t|Identification of key lipid metabolism-related genes in Alzheimer's disease.
37736681|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents profound degenerative conditions of the brain that cause significant deterioration in memory and cognitive function. Despite extensive research on the significant contribution of lipid metabolism to AD progression, the precise mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Hence, this study aimed to identify key differentially expressed lipid metabolism-related genes (DELMRGs) in AD progression. METHODS: Comprehensive analyses were performed to determine key DELMRGs in AD compared to controls in GSE122063 dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus. Additionally, the ssGSEA algorithm was utilized for estimating immune cell levels. Subsequently, correlations between key DELMRGs and each immune cell were calculated specifically in AD samples. The key DELMRGs expression levels were validated via two external datasets. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was utilized for deriving associated pathways of key DELMRGs. Additionally, miRNA-TF regulatory networks of the key DELMRGs were constructed using the miRDB, NetworkAnalyst 3.0, and Cytoscape software. Finally, based on key DELMRGs, AD samples were further segmented into two subclusters via consensus clustering, and immune cell patterns and pathway differences between the two subclusters were examined. RESULTS: Seventy up-regulated and 100 down-regulated DELMRGs were identified. Subsequently, three key DELMRGs (DLD, PLPP2, and PLAAT4) were determined utilizing three algorithms [(i) LASSO, (ii) SVM-RFE, and (iii) random forest]. Specifically, PLPP2 and PLAAT4 were up-regulated, while DLD exhibited downregulation in AD cerebral cortex tissue. This was validated in two separate external datasets (GSE132903 and GSE33000). The AD group exhibited significantly altered immune cell composition compared to controls. In addition, GSEA identified various pathways commonly associated with three key DELMRGs. Moreover, the regulatory network of miRNA-TF for key DELMRGs was established. Finally, significant differences in immune cell levels and several pathways were identified between the two subclusters. CONCLUSION: This study identified DLD, PLPP2, and PLAAT4 as key DELMRGs in AD progression, providing novel insights for AD prevention/treatment.
