39343603|t|Medical Management of Acute Stroke based on Japan Stroke Society Guidelines and the Japan Stroke Data Bank.
39343603|a|Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in Japan, necessitating standardized treatment guidelines. The Japan Stroke Society (JSS) periodically revises its guidelines to incorporate new research. This review provides a short overview of acute stroke management based on JSS Guideline 2021 (revised 2023) and the Japan Stroke Data Bank (JSDB), and discusses future directions in stroke management. Acute stroke management emphasizes systemic support and complication management. Risk factor control during acute hospitalization is also crucial for preventing recurrent strokes in the chronic phase.In ischemic stroke, super-acute recanalization therapies, including intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, are the most important and effective. Antiplatelet therapy, particularly aspirin and clopidogrel, is recommended for noncardiogenic stroke and high-risk transient ischemic attack. In cardioembolic stroke, early initiation of direct oral anticoagulants might be considered according to stroke severity.For brain hemorrhage, early blood pressure management is recommended. Specific reversal agents are advised for patients on anticoagulant therapy. Minimally invasive hematoma removal may improve outcomes for intracerebral hemorrhage.Subarachnoid hemorrhage treatments reported from Japan include intravenous drugs to prevent vasospasm.The JSDB revealed improvements in functional outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke over the past 20 years, although patients with hemorrhagic stroke showed no clear improvement. The evolving guidelines and research underscore the importance of stratified and timely intervention in stroke care.
