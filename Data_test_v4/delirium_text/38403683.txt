38403683|t|Association between dietary flavonol intake and mortality risk in the U.S. adults from NHANES database.
38403683|a|Using updated National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) follow-up data, and a large nationwide representative sample of adult U.S. citizens, the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between dietary flavonol intake, all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks. In this prospective cohort study based on NHANES (2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2017-2018), a total of 11,679 participants aged 20 years and above were evaluated. The amount and type of food taken during a 24-h dietary recall were used to estimate dietary flavonol intake, which includes total flavonol, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and quercetin. Each analysis of the weighted data was dealt with in accordance with the NHANES reporting requirements' intricate stratification design. The Cox proportional risk regression model or Fine and Gray competing risks regression model were applied to evaluate all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks, respectively. The follow-up period was calculated using the time interval between the baseline and the death date or December 31, 2019 (whichever occurs first). Each data analysis was performed between October 1, 2023, and October 22, 2023. Dietary flavonol intake included total flavonol, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and quercetin. Up to December 31, 2019, National Death Index (NDI) mortality data were used to calculate mortality from all causes as well as cause-specific causes. A total of 11,679 individuals, which represents 44,189,487 U.S. non-hospitalized citizens, were included in the study; of these participants, 49.78% were male (n = 5816), 50.22% were female (n = 5, 863); 47.56% were Non-Hispanic White (n = 5554), 18.91% were Non-Hispanic Black (n = 2209), 16.23% were Mexican American (n = 1895), and 17.30% were other ethnicity (n = 2021); The mean [SE] age of the sample was 46.93 [0.36] years, with a median follow-up of 7.80 years (interquartile range, 7.55-8.07 years). After adjusting covariates, Cox proportional hazards models and fine and gray competing risks regression models for specific-cause mortality demonstrated that total flavonol intake was associated with all-cause (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54-0.75), cancer-specific (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28-0.70) and CVD-specific (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.96) mortality risks; isorhamnetin intake was associated with all-cause (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60-0.86), and cancer-specific (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46-0.83) mortality risks; kaempferol intake was associated with all-cause (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.86), and cancer-specific (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40-0.97) mortality risks; myricetin intake was associated with all-cause (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67-0.88), AD-specific (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.85), and CVD-specific (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47-0.80) mortality risks; quercetin intake was associated with all-cause (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.54-0.81), cancer-specific (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.35-0.84), and CVD-specific (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.93) mortality risks; there was no correlation observed between dietary flavonol intake and DM-specific mortality. According to the current study, all-cause, AD, cancer, and CVD mortality risks declined with increased dietary flavonoid intake in the U.S. adults. This finding may be related to the anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative stress properties of flavonol.
