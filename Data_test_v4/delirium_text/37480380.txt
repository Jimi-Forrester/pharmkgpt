37480380|t|Orthogeriatric care-outcome of different fragility fractures.
37480380|a|INTRODUCTION: Fragility fractures (FF) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and reflect a dramatic turning point in the life of older adults. The scientific discourse is dominated by proximal femoral fractures, but FF affect multiple parts of the body and often precede hip fractures. Orthogeriatric co-management has multiple shown to improve patient's outcome. We hypothesize that all geriatric patients with FF benefit from orthogeriatric co-management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all patients over 70 years with FF (hip joint, periprosthetic, spine, pelvic ring, and humerus) of our geriatric trauma center for the years 2019-2021, who received orthogeriatric co-management. Demographic data, fracture type, complications, discharge modality and in-hospital mortality were recorded. For patients transferred to geriatrics, the Barthel Index (BI) and the discharge modality were recorded. Primary outcome parameters were discharge modality and BI difference. Secondary outcome parameters were complication rates and in-hospital mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: 555 patients (83.8 +- 6.5 years, 182 males, 373 females) were evaluated. 245 (44.1%) patients were referred to geriatrics for further orthogeriatric treatment. Positive predictors were age, surgery, and a high Charlson Comorbidity Index. The overall in-hospital mortality was 8.6% (n = 48) (5.8% (n = 32) during acute trauma care and 6.5% (n = 16) during stay in geriatrics). The mortality rate of nursing home residents was significantly higher compared to patients living at home (10.4% vs. 5.6%). The rate of non-surgical complications was 44.5%. 26.9% of patients living at home were discharged to a nursing home, while 51.3% were able to return home. The risk of admission to a nursing home was reduced for thoracolumbar fractures (OR = 0.22) and increased markedly for periprosthetic fractures (OR = 3.95). During orthogeriatric treatment, all fractures showed a significant increase in BI. Patients living at home benefited more than nursing home residents (20.5 +- 19.5 vs. 8.7 +- 18.0 points). The chance of a BI increase (> 19 points) was increased for hip and pelvic ring fractures. Devastating results showed patients with dementia. In comparison, mentally healthy patients had a 4.5-fold increased chance of increasing their BI (> 19 points). CONCLUSIONS: Presented data shows that all patients with FF are at high risk for complications and could benefit from standardized orthogeriatric management. Modern patient care requires a holistic orthogeriatric approach to improve patient's outcome.
