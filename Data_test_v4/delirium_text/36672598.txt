36672598|t|Prophylactic Effect of Bovine Colostrum on Intestinal Microbiota and Behavior in Wild-Type and Zonulin Transgenic Mice.
36672598|a|The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) involves bidirectional communication between intestinal microbiota and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, central nervous system (CNS), neuroendocrine/neuroimmune systems, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and enteric nervous system (ENS). The intestinal microbiota can influence host physiology and pathology. Dysbiosis involves the loss of beneficial microbial input or signal, diversity, and expansion of pathobionts, which can lead to loss of barrier function and increased intestinal permeability (IP). Colostrum, the first milk from mammals after birth, is a natural source of nutrients and is rich in oligosaccharides, immunoglobulins, growth factors, and anti-microbial components. The aim of this study was to investigate if bovine colostrum (BC) administration might modulate intestinal microbiota and, in turn, behavior in two mouse models, wild-type (WT) and Zonulin transgenic (Ztm)-the latter of which is characterized by dysbiotic microbiota, increased intestinal permeability, and mild hyperactivity-and to compare with control mice. Bioinformatics analysis of the microbiome showed that consumption of BC was associated with increased taxonomy abundance (p = 0.001) and diversity (p = 0.004) of potentially beneficial species in WT mice and shifted dysbiotic microbial community towards eubiosis in Ztm mice (p = 0.001). BC induced an anxiolytic effect in WT female mice compared with WT female control mice (p = 0.0003), and it reduced anxiogenic behavior in Ztm female mice compared with WT female control mice (p = 0.001), as well as in Ztm male mice compared with WT BC male mice (p = 0.03). As evidenced in MGBA interactions, BC supplementation may well be applied for prophylactic approaches in the future. Further research is needed to explore human interdependencies between intestinal microbiota, including eubiosis and pathobionts, and neuroinflammation, and the potential value of BC for human use. The MGH Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee authorized the animal study (2013N000013).
