38361729|t|Palliative Care Rounds: A Thanksgiving Break to Discuss Rib Fractures.
38361729|a|Rib fractures are common injuries, especially in the frail and elderly. They can happen in isolation or may be associated with significant concomitant morbidity, including but not limited to pain, pneumonia, or pneumothorax. In the palliative care population, rib fractures can be overlooked or attributed to other entities, which may lead to inappropriate treatment. The commonly accepted standards of care for the treatment of rib fractures are centered around early and adequate pain control, and stabilization of other complications. Accurate diagnosis and management demand a thorough history and physical examination, effective communication, and intentional clinical consideration of all differential diagnoses.
