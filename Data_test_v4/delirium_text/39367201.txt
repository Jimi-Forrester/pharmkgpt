39367201|t|Endothelial Neurogranin Regulates Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability via Modulation of the AKT Pathway.
39367201|a|Neurogranin (Ng) expression is a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. A loss of brain Ng and an increase in CSF Ng positively correlate with cognitive decline. Ng is known to regulate neuronal calcium-calmodulin binding and synaptic plasticity, which are critical for learning/memory. Interestingly, we discovered that Ng is also expressed in mouse and human blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, the role of Ng expression in brain vasculature remains largely undefined. In this study, we investigated the role of Ng expression on neurovascular structure and function using Ng null mice and human cerebral microvascular endothelial (hCMEC/D3) cells. We performed brain clearing and immunolabeling of blood vessels from whole brains and brain slices. Deletion of Ng significantly decreases neurovascular density in mice. Using in vivo permeability assays, we found increased neurovascular permeability in Ng null mice. We also observed significant changes in the expression of tight junction proteins using western blot and immunofluorescent staining. To identify the molecular pathways involved, we carried out label-free proteomics on brain lysates from endothelial-specific Ng knockout mice. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicated that the AKT pathway is attenuated in the vasculature of endothelial-specific Ng knockout mice. To validate these in vivo findings, we pharmacologically manipulated AKT signaling in hCMEC/D3 cells and observed that inhibition of AKT activation causes increased permeability. Our results indicate that the loss of Ng expression alters neurovascular structure and permeability, potentially contributing to neurological dysfunction. Therefore, modulating Ng expression in the BBB may offer a novel therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.
