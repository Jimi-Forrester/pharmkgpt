32370123|t|A Qualitative View of Homecare Support Workers on Unmet Health Needs of People with Dependency.
32370123|a|BACKGROUND: Longevity and population growth generate an increase in the number of people with dependency, who require homecare assistance to meet their health needs. Homecare support workers provide this care in Spain, and they may have unique insights into the unmet health needs of those receiving homecare assistance. The aim of this study was to determine the unmet health needs of people with dependency based on the perspective of homecare support workers. METHODS: Qualitative exploratory-descriptive study. Through convenience sampling, homecare support workers from a Spanish province were selected, following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Four focus groups, transcription and thematic analyses were performed using Atlas.ti. Coding triangulation was carried out, applying criteria for scientific rigour. RESULTS: The six themes obtained were classified into the material, psychoemotional, socioeconomical and psychosocial needs of people with dependency from the point of view of homecare support workers, along with the contributions of improvements and the need of these professionals for continuous training. CONCLUSIONS: People with dependency need complex technical assistance, materials, psychological attention due to their situation, and more effective assessments of their health and disability status. Homecare support workers perceive themselves to be essential in these assessments. They ask for psychological assistance, due to the emotional burden of their work, and believe this help would contribute to improving the quality of their service. Homecare support workers perceive that they are capable of performing their job, although they believe that some delegated activities are beyond their levels of competency.
