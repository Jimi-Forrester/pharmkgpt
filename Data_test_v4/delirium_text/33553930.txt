33553930|t|Ethanolamine Plasmalogen Suppresses Apoptosis in Human Intestinal Tract Cells in Vitro by Attenuating Induced Inflammatory Stress.
33553930|a|Ethanolamine plasmalogen (PlsEtn) is a subtype of ethanolamine glycerophospholipids (EtnGpl). Recently, PlsEtn has attracted increasing research interest due to its beneficial effects in health and disease; however, its functional role in colonic health has not been well established. This study was conducted to determine the mechanism underlying the antiapoptotic effect of PlsEtn in human intestinal tract cells under induced inflammatory stress. Lipopolysaccharide induced apoptosis of differentiated Caco-2 cells, which was suppressed by EtnGpl in a dose-dependent manner. Cells treated with ascidian muscle EtnGpl containing high levels of PlsEtn demonstrated a lower degree of apoptosis, and downregulated TNF-alpha and apoptosis-related proteins compared to those treated with porcine liver EtnGpl containing low PlsEtn. This indicates that PlsEtn exerted the observed effects, which provided protection against induced inflammatory stress. Overall, our results suggest that PlsEtn with abundant vinyl ether linkages is potentially beneficial in preventing the initiation of inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer.
