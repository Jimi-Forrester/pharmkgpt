20167837|a|The author presents a case report of an elderly patient who was extremely frail and debilitated. The patient was a resident of a skilled care facility because of advanced chronic illnesses that included end-stage Alzheimer, dementia, and Parkinson disease. This patient had acquired multiple stages III to IV pressure ulcers. Aggressive wound care treatment was initiated with partial success, but the patient passed away before the wound could completely heal. Medical literature was reviewed to offer the best possible wound care approach in providing care to patients who are terminally ill without compromising the patient's dignity and comfort and at the same time delivering cost-effective quality care.
