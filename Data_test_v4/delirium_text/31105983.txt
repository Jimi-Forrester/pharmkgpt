31105983|t|Tryptophan Metabolism: A Versatile Area Providing Multiple Targets for Pharmacological Intervention.
31105983|a|The essential amino acid L-tryptophan (Trp) undergoes extensive metabolism along several pathways, resulting in production of many biologically active metabolites which exert profound effects on physiological processes. The disturbance in Trp metabolism and disposition in many disease states provides a basis for exploring multiple targets for pharmaco-therapeutic interventions. In particular, the kynurenine pathway of Trp degradation is currently at the forefront of immunological research and immunotherapy. In this review, I shall consider mammalian Trp metabolism in health and disease and outline the intervention targets. It is hoped that this account will provide a stimulus for pharmacologists and others to conduct further studies in this rich area of biomedical research and therapeutics.
