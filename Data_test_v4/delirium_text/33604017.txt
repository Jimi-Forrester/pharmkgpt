33604017|a|Deep brain stimulation is a primary treatment method that improves motor and motor complications in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Delirium is a common and serious complication following deep brain stimulation. However, the clinical attention toward this complication remains insufficient. Advanced age, cognitive decline, and the severity of the disease may all be risk factors for delirium. The presence of delirium may also affect cognitive function and disease prognosis. Neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine may be involved in the occurrence of delirium. Furthermore, inflammation, the effects of microlesioning of local nuclei, and brain atrophy may also play roles in the onset of delirium. Nonpharmacological therapy appears to be the primary treatment for postoperative delirium in Parkinson's disease. The current article reviews the pathogenesis, epidemiology, prognosis, and treatment of delirium following deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease to help clinicians better understand this common complication and to prevent, identify, and treat it as soon as possible, as well as to provide more accurate treatment for patients.
