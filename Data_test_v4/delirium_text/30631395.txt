30631395|a|The past two decades have witnessed an explosion of research and clinical application of stem cells, transforming the field of regenerative medicine. Stem cell transplantation has already been performed to treat patients with cancer, liver diseases, and various types of chronic diseases. Indeed, stem cell-based therapies are effective in many diseases, and provide novel insights into the treatment of end-stage liver disease. Several clinical trials have indicated the efficacy profiles of stem cell transplantation in patients with end-stage liver disease, including liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver tumors. Animal models of acute liver failure have also provided important insights into the safety, mechanisms, and efficacy of stem cell therapies. Nevertheless, excitement due to this promising field must be tempered with careful and calculated research. In particular, studies on the quality, safety, and efficacy of stem cell transplantation are needed to ensure that qualified products are tested in well-designed clinical trials and approved by governments. Therefore, further investigations are required to effectively balance the safety with the innovation of stem cell transplantation research toward the effective treatment of end-stage liver disease.
