29134288|a|Except for task-specific functional MRI, the vast majority of imaging studies assessed human brain function at resting conditions. However, tracking task-specific neuronal activity yields important insight how the brain responds to stimulation. We specifically investigated changes in glucose metabolism, functional connectivity and white matter microstructure during task performance using several recent methodological advancements. Opening the eyes and right finger tapping had elicited an increased glucose metabolism in primary visual and motor cortices, respectively. Furthermore, a decreased metabolism was observed in the regions of the default mode network, which allowed absolute quantification of commonly described deactivations during cognitive tasks. These brain regions showed widespread task-specific changes in functional connectivity, which stretched beyond their primary resting-state networks and presumably reflected the level of recruitment of certain brain regions for each task. Finally, the corresponding white matter fiber pathways exhibited changes in axial and radial diffusivity during the tasks, which were regionally distinctive for certain tract groups. These results highlight that even simple task performance leads to substantial changes of entire brain networks. Exploiting the complementary nature of the different imaging modalities may reveal novel insights how the brain processes external stimuli and which networks are involved in certain tasks.
