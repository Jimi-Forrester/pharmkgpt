35309670|t|SARS, MERS and CoVID-19: An overview and comparison of clinical, laboratory and radiological features.
35309670|a|In the 21st century, we have seen a total of three outbreaks by members of the coronavirus family. Although the first two outbreaks did not result in a pandemic, the third and the latest outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) culminated in a pandemic. This pandemic has been extremely significant on a social and international level. As these viruses belong to the same family, they are closely related. Despite their numerous similarities, they have slight distinctions that render them distinct from one another. The Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) cases were reported to have a very high case fatality rate of 9.5 and 34.4% respectively. In contrast, the CoVID-19 has a case fatality rate of 2.13%. Also, there are no clear medical countermeasures for these coronaviruses yet. We can cross information gaps, including cultural weapons for fighting and controlling the spread of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and plan efficient and comprehensive defensive lines against coronaviruses that might arise or reemerge in the future by gaining a deeper understanding of these coronaviruses and the illnesses caused by them. The review thoroughly summarises the state-of-the-art information and compares the biochemical properties of these deadly coronaviruses with the clinical characteristics, laboratory features and radiological manifestations of illnesses induced by them, with an emphasis on comparing and contrasting their similarities and differences.
