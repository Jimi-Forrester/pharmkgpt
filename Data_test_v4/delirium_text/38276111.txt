38276111|a|Several studies described neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) as markers of COVID-19 severity. In a recently published study, age and frailty affected NLR and PLR more than disease severity. The study compared two distinct cohorts. The first comprised older frailer patients positive for SARS-CoV-2, with mild or asymptomatic disease, admitted to designated COVID-19 departments in a large geriatric medical center (GMC). The second cohort comprised COVID-19 patients admitted to a large general hospital (GH) for symptomatic disease. This was a follow-up study comparing a subgroup of patients who had NLR and PLR values measured a week after admission. Only 100 of 177 patients in the original GMC cohort had a second NLR test compared to almost all (287 of 289) patients in the general hospital (GH) cohort. The subgroup baseline characteristics did not change significantly from that of the original cohort. Disease symptoms were more prevalent in the GH cohort. In the GMC group, the median second NLR rose from 3.9 to 4.6, while in the GH cohort, the NLR value dropped from 3.5 to 2.8, enhancing the NLR differences between the groups. Smaller changes were observed in the second PLR. These results strengthen the prior results that age and frailty seem to have a stronger impact on NLR and PLR than disease severity.
