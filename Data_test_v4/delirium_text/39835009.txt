39835009|t|Complex Genetic Framework in Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis With a C9ORF72 Mutation: A Case Report.
39835009|a|A significantly diverse clinical presentation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), even in its best-studied familial form, continues to hinder current efforts to develop effective disease-modifying drugs for the cure of this rapidly progressive, fatal neuromuscular disease. We have previously shown that clinical heterogeneity of sporadic ALS (sALS) could be explained, at least in part, by its polygenic nature as well as by the presence of mutated genes linked to non-ALS neurological diseases and genes known to mediate ALS-related pathologies. We hypothesized that a similar genetic framework could also be present in patients with familial ALS (fALS). To test this hypothesis, we conducted post-mortem genetic screening of an individual with fALS and a mutation in the C9ORF72 gene. C9ORF72 mutations are highly penetrant and are present in the majority of fALS patients. Genetic screening by whole exome sequencing (WES) on the next generation sequencing (NGS) Illumina platform (San Diego, CA, USA) followed by examination of the respective rare (minor allele frequency (MAF) <= 0.01) pathological/deleterious genetic variants yielded results consistent with our hypothesis of the presence of a complex genetic framework in fALS. Additional members of this genetic framework were identified when the low-frequency (0.01 < MAF < 0.05) pathological/deleterious genetic variants were analyzed with the low-frequency biallelic AHNAK2, GLI3, PTIRM1, and ZNF254 variants, warranting a closer look at their potentially important role in fALS as C9ORF72 genetic modifiers as well as their link to both neuromuscular disorders/ALS and cancer. Therefore, in addition to the current genetic screening using a standard panel of ALS-related genes, a supplementary screening by WES could be very beneficial for the development of personalized treatment of ALS patients as well as in search of the respective efficient disease-modifying drugs.
