34978407|t|Nanoporous Substrates with Molecular-Level Perfluoroalkyl/Alkylamide Surface for Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry of Small Proteins.
34978407|a|The rapid detection of biomolecules greatly contributes to health management, clinical diagnosis, and prevention of diseases. Mass spectrometry (MS) is effective for detecting and analyzing various molecules at high throughput. However, there are problems with the MS analysis of biological samples, including complicated separation operations and essential pretreatments. In this study, a nanostructured organosilica substrate for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) is designed and synthesized to detect peptides and small proteins efficiently and rapidly. The surface functionality of the substrate is tuned by perfluoroalkyl/alkylamide groups mixed at a molecular level. This contributes to both lowering the surface free energy and introducing weak anchoring sites for peptides and proteins. Analyte molecules applied onto the substrate are homogeneously distributed and readily desorbed by the laser irradiation. The organosilica substrate enables the efficient LDI of various compounds, including peptides, small proteins, phospholipids, and drugs. An amyloid beta protein fragment, which is known as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, is detectable at 0.05 fmol muL-1. The detection of the amyloid beta at 0.2 fmol muL-1 is also confirmed in the presence of blood components. Nanostructured organosilica substrates incorporating a molecular-level surface design have the potential to enable easy detection of a wide range of biomolecules.
