33478054|a|So far, there is no effective disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in clinical practice. In this context, glycine-L-proline-L-glutamate (GPE) and its analogs may open the way for developing a novel molecule for treating neurodegenerative disorders, including AD. In turn, this study was aimed to investigate the neuroprotective potentials exerted by three novel GPE peptidomimetics (GPE1, GPE2, and GPE3) using an in vitro AD model. Anti-Alzheimer potentials were determined using a wide array of techniques, such as measurements of mitochondrial viability (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays, determination of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), alpha-secretase and beta-secretase activities, comparisons of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidative status (TOS) levels, flow cytometric and microscopic detection of apoptotic and necrotic neuronal death, and investigating gene expression responses via PCR arrays involving 64 critical genes related to 10 different pathways. Our analysis showed that GPE peptidomimetics modulate oxidative stress, ACh depletion, alpha-secretase inactivation, apoptotic, and necrotic cell death. In vitro results suggested that treatments with novel GPE analogs might be promising therapeutic agents for treatment and/or or prevention of AD.
