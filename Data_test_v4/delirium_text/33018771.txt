33018771|a|Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (AtDCS) can improve memory and cognitive dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), which has been proven in basic and clinical studies. Intervention of AD in preclinical stage is important to prevent progression of AD in the aging society. At the same time, there is increasing evidence that a close link exists between cerebrovascular dysfunction and AD disease. Here we investigated the changes of local cerebral blood microcirculation in preclinical AD mouse model after AtDCS based on the previous studies. Twenty-four 6-month-old male APP/PS1 double transgenic mice were randomly divided into three groups: a model group (AD), a model sham stimulation (ADST) group and a model stimulation group (ATD). Eight 6-month-old male C57 wild-type mice served as a control group (CTL). Mice in the ATD group received 10 AtDCS sessions. Two months after the end of AtDCS in the ATD group, the microcirculation parameters of the frontal cortex of the mice in each group, including cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood flow velocity (Velo), oxygen saturation (SO2) and relative hemoglobin content (rHb), were obtained by the non-invasive laser-Doppler spectrophotometry system "Oxygen-to-See (O2C)". The results showed that AtDCS increased CBF, Velo and SO2, and reduce rHb in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice at the preclinical stage of AD.Clinical Relevance-This shows the positive effect of AtDCS on preclinical AD in cerebrovascular function, and provides effective basic research facts for AtDCS to intervene and delay the clinical application of AD disease.
