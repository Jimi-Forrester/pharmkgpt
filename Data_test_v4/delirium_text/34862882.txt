34862882|a|BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Beyond the most common clinical features of COVID-19, mainly represented by respiratory symptoms, other systems may be interested by the infection. Among these, through a neurotropic pathway, the central nervous system (CNS) may be affected by the virus, leading to developing neuropsychiatric symptoms. Particularly, this study focuses on neurological symptoms determined by the Sars-CoV-2 infection, as well as on the underlying pathogenetic processes. METHODS: For the present review, we followed a narrative approach. A literature search was carried out concerning the neurological consequences of COVID-19. Papers were screened, focusing on the clinical manifestations interesting the CNS and on their possible role in the early diagnosis of the disease. RESULTS: We display the most significant neurological clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Common neurological manifestations (ageusia, anosmia, and encephalitis) are first described. Subsequently, we provide a focus on delirium and its possible pathogenetic and clinical correlates. Delirium is not only a possible resultant of the COVID-19 neurotropism, but it may also be precipitated by a number of environmental factors that assume further relevance during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms, and particularly delirium, can help identifying the infection at an early stage. Tailored treatments should be identified in order to prevent complications.
