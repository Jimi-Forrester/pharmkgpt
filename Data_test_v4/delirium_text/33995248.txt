33995248|t|Case Report: Behavioral Unresponsiveness in Acute COVID-19 Patients: The Utility of the Motor Behavior Tool-Revised and 18F-FDG PET/CT.
33995248|a|Along with the propagation of COVID-19, emerging evidence reveals significant neurological manifestations in severely infected COVID-19 patients. Among these patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), behavioral unresponsiveness may occur frequently, yet, there are still only a few cases reported and with rare descriptions of their motor behavior after pathological awakening. Several hypotheses regarding central lesions in these patients are conceivable. Here, we describe two acute SARS-CoV-2- infected patients who developed neurological symptoms evoking the condition of clinical cognitive motor dissociation (CMD). This diagnosis could be confirmed first by clinical observation of a dissociation between preserved cognitive abilities and lack of initial motor interaction and second, by performing 18F- FDG PET imaging. Accurate diagnosis led to an appropriate neuro-rehabilitation regimen with long-term neuro-rehabilitation leading to an improved outcome for both patients.
