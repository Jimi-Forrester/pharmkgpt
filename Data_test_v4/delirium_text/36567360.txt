36567360|a|Growing evidence has associated major depressive disorder (MDD) as a risk factor or prodromal syndrome for the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although this dilemma remains open, it is widely shown that a lifetime history of MDD is correlated with faster progression of AD pathology. Therefore, antidepressant drugs with neuroprotective effects could be an interesting therapeutic conception to target this issue simultaneously. In this sense, 1-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)-N-(4-methoxybenzyl)-5-methyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4- carboxamide (QTC-4-MeOBnE) was initially conceived as a multi-target ligand with affinity to beta-secretase (BACE), glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), and acetylcholinesterase but has also shown secondary effects on pathways involved in neuroinflammation and neurogenesis in preclinical models of AD. Herein, we investigated the effect of QTC-4-MeOBnE (1 mg/kg) administration for 45 days on depressive-like behavior and memory impairment in 3xTg mice, before the pathology is completely established. The treatment with QTC-4-MeOBnE prevented memory impairment and depressive-like behavior assessed by the Y-Maze task and forced swimming test. This effect was associated with the modulation of plural pathways involved in the onset and progression of AD, in cerebral structures of the cortex and hippocampus. Among them, the reduction of amyloid beta (Abeta) production mediated by changes in amyloid precursor protein metabolism and hippocampal tau phosphorylation through the inhibition of kinases. Additionally, QTC-4-MeOBnE also exerted beneficial effects on neuroinflammation and synaptic integrity. Overall, our studies suggest that QTC-4-MeOBnE has a moderate effect in a transgenic model of AD, indicating that perhaps studies regarding the neuropsychiatric effects as a neuroprotective molecule are more prone to be feasible.
