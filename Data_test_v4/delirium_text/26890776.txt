26890776|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation (CAA-ri) is a relatively rare syndrome of reversible encephalopathy and could be divided into two subtypes of inflammatory CAA (ICAA) and amyloid-beta-related angiitis (ABRA) according to histopathology. We present a case of pathologically proved ABRA with partial seizures and headache, and a focal lesion in the right temporal lobes on magnetic resonance imaging. Summarized from previous 139 ABRA and ICAA cases, ABRA is preferred when the lesion is enhanced on MRI and requires combination drug therapy, while ICAA is highly suspected with ApoE genotype of e4/e4. More clinical markers for diagnosis of CAA-ri warrant further researches.
