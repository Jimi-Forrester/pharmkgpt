8940079|t|The alternatively spliced Kunitz protease inhibitor domain alters amyloid beta protein precursor processing and amyloid beta protein production in cultured cells.
8940079|a|The insoluble amyloid deposited extracellularly in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is composed of amyloid beta protein, a approximately 4-kDa secreted protein that is derived from a set of large proteins collectively referred to as the amyloid beta protein precursor (betaAPP). During normal processing the betaAPP is cleaved by beta secretase, producing a large NH2-terminal secreted derivative (sAPPbeta) and a COOH-terminal fragment beginning at Abeta1, which is subsequently cleaved by gamma secretase releasing secreted Abeta. Most secreted Abeta is Abeta1-40, but approximately 10% of secreted Abeta is Abeta1-42. Alternative betaAPP cleavage by alpha secretase produces a slightly longer NH2-terminal secreted derivative (sAPPalpha) and a COOH-terminal fragment beginning at Abeta17, which is subsequently cleaved by gamma secretase releasing a approximately 3-kDa secreted form of Abeta (P3). Several of the betaAPP isoforms that are produced by alternative splicing contain a 56-amino acid Kunitz protease inhibitor (KPI) domain known to inhibit proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. To determine whether the KPI domain influences the proteolytic cleavages that generate Abeta, we compared Abeta production in transfected cells expressing human KPI-containing betaAPP751 or KPI-free betaAPP695. We focused on Abetas ending at Abeta42 because these forms appear to be most relevant to AD. Using specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we analyzed full-length Abeta1-42 and total Abeta ending at Abeta42 (Abeta1-42 + P3(42)). In addition, we analyzed the large secreted derivatives produced by alpha secretase (sAPPalpha) and beta secretase (sAPPbeta). In mouse teratocarcinoma (P19) cells expressing betaAPP695 or betaAPP751, expression of the KPI-containing betaAPP751 resulted in the secretion of a lower percentage of P3(42) and sAPPalpha and a correspondingly higher percentage of Abeta1-42 and sAPPbeta. Similar results were obtained in human embryonic kidney (293) cells. These results indicate that expression of the KPI domain reduces alpha secretase cleavage so that less P3 and relatively more full-length Abeta are produced. Thus, in human brain and in animal models of AD, the amount of KPI-containing betaAPP produced may be an important factor influencing Abeta deposition.
