28106549|t|The Multimerization State of the Amyloid-beta42 Amyloid Peptide Governs its Interaction Network with the Extracellular Matrix.
28106549|a|The goals of this work were i) to identify the interactions of amyloid-beta (Abeta)42 under monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar forms with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and receptors, ii) to determine the influence of Abeta42 supramolecular organization on these interactions, and iii) to identify the molecular functions, biological processes, and pathways targeted by Abeta42 in the ECM. The ECM and cell surface partners of Abeta42 and its supramolecular forms were identified with protein and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) arrays (81 molecules in triplicate) probed by surface plasmon resonance imaging. The number of partners of Abeta42 increased upon its multimerization, ranging from 4 for the peptide up to 53 for the fibrillar aggregates. The peptide interacted only with ECM proteins but their percentage among Abeta42 partners decreased upon multimerization. Abeta42 and its supramolecular forms recognized different molecular features on their partners, and the partners of Abeta42 fibrillar forms were enriched in laminin IV-A, N-terminal, and EGF-like domains. Abeta42 oligomerization triggered interactions with receptors, whereas Abeta42 fibrillogenesis promoted binding to GAGs, proteoglycans, enzymes, and growth factors and the ability to interact with perineuronal nets. Fibril aggregation bind to further membrane proteins including tumor endothelial marker-8, syndecan-4, and discoidin-domain receptor-2. The partners of the Abeta42 supramolecular forms are enriched in proteins contributing to cell growth and/or maintenance, involved in integrin cell surface interactions and expressed in kidney cancer, preadipocytes, and dentin. In conclusion, the supramolecular assembly of Abeta42 governs its ability to interact in vitro with ECM proteins, remodeling and crosslinking ECM enzymes, proteoglycans, and receptors.
