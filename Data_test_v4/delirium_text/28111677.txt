28111677|t|Rhenium(i) complexes of N-heterocyclic carbene ligands that bind to amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's disease.
28111677|a|A series of [Re(i)L(CO)3]+ complexes (where L is a bifunctional bis(NHC)-amine ligand) that are analogues of potential Tc-99m diagnostic imaging agents for Alzheimer's disease have been synthesised. One of the complexes bound to amyloid plaques in human frontal cortex brain tissue from subjects with Alzheimer's disease.
