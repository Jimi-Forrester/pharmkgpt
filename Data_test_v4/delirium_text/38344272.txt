38344272|a|In the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), the role of cholinergic modulation via alpha7 nicotinic receptors and their involvement in memory is unknown. In recent years, the RSC has been shown to deteriorate in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Likewise, the cholinergic system has been postulated as one of those responsible for cognitive impairment in patients with AD. Great interest has arisen in the study of alpha7 nicotinic receptors as more specific targets for the treatment of this disease. For this reason, we aim to study the role of alpha7 receptors of the RSC in memory processing. We infused a selective alpha7 receptor antagonist into the anterior part of the RSC (aRSC) to assess its role in different phases of aversive memory processing using an inhibitory avoidance task. We found that alpha7 nicotinic receptors are involved in memory acquisition and expression, but not in its consolidation. These results identify aRSC alpha7 nicotinic receptors as key players in aversive memory processing and highlight their significant potential as therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease.
