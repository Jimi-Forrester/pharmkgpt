32556269|t|Attracting New Investigators to Alzheimer's Disease Research: Outcomes of Increased Funding and Outreach.
32556269|a|Since 2015, the National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), has experienced significant increases in funding for Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD). This analysis assesses the impact of these funds on expanding the AD/ADRD workforce. NIA administered 860 awards to 695 AD/ADRD R01 awardees during fiscal year 2015-2018. Twenty-nine percent of awardees were new or early-stage investigators, while 38% were new to the AD/ADRD research field (NTF). Among these NTFs, 59% were established investigators, that is, experts with NIH funding in another discipline but new to AD/ADRD research. Awards were further analyzed to determine the focus of their research based on International Alzheimer's Disease Research Portfolio (IADRP) categories. Forty-six percent were focused on Molecular Pathogenesis and Physiology. Other IADRP categories, including Diagnosis, Assessment, and Disease Monitoring and Translational Research and Clinical Interventions, represented 5%-15% of awards. Significantly, NTF investigators received 50%, 42%, and 70% of the total grants awarded in Population Studies, Dementia Care, and Brain Aging, respectively, suggesting that NTF investigators are filling research gaps. While these results suggest that enhanced funding is associated with recruitment of new talent, opportunities for further growth remain, particularly related to care, caregiving, and health disparities.
