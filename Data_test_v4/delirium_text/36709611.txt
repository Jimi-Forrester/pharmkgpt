36709611|a|OBJECTIVE: Anxiety has been identified as both a risk factor and prodromal symptom for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, however, the underlying neurobiological correlates remain unknown. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the association between anxiety symptoms and two defining markers of AD neuropathology: amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau. METHODS: Systematic literature searches were conducted across 5 databases. Studies investigating the relationship between anxiety and AD neuropathology (i.e., Abeta and/or tau) in cognitively healthy adults were eligible. Where possible, effect sizes were combined across studies, for Abeta and tau separately, using random-effects meta-analyses. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess whether results differed according to anxiety type (i.e., state and trait) and biomarker assessment modality (i.e., positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid). RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies reporting data from 14 unique cohorts met eligibility criteria. Random-effects meta-analyses revealed no associations between self-reported anxiety symptoms and either Abeta (13 studies, Fisher's z = 0.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.01-0.05, p = 0.194) or tau (4 studies, Fisher's z = 0.04, 95% CI -0.02-0.09, p = 0.235). Results remained unchanged across sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In cognitively healthy adults, meta-analytic syntheses revealed no associations between anxiety symptoms and either Abeta or tau. There is a critical need, however, for larger studies with follow-up periods to examine the effect of anxiety symptom onset, severity, and chronicity on AD neuropathology. Additionally, further research investigating other potential neurobiological correlates is crucial to advance scientific understanding of the relationship between anxiety and dementia.
