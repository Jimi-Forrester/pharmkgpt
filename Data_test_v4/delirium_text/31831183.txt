31831183|t|Signaling molecules targeting cannabinoid receptors: Hemopressin and related peptides.
31831183|a|Cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) are part of the endocannabinoid system, which is involved in various physiological processes such as nociception, inflammation, appetite, stress, and emotion regulation. Many studies have linked the endocannabinoid system to neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Hemopressin [Hp; a fragment of the hemoglobin alpha1 chain (95-103 amino acids)] and related peptides [VD-Hpalpha and RVD-Hpalpha] are peptides that bind to CBRs. Hp acts as an inverse agonist to CB1 receptor (CB1R), VD-Hpalpha acts as an agonist to CB1R, and RVD-Hpalpha acts as a negative allosteric modulator of CB1R and a positive allosteric modulator of CB2R. Because of the critical roles of CBRs in numerous physiological processes, it is appealing to use Hp and related peptides for therapeutic purposes. This review discusses their discovery, structure, metabolism, brain exposure, self-assembly characteristics, pharmacological characterization, and pharmacological activities.
