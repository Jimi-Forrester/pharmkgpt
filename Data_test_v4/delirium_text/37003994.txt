37003994|t|The relationship between pre-surgery self-rated health and changes in functional and mental health in older adults: insights from a prospective observational study.
37003994|a|BACKGROUND: Elective surgeries are among the most common health stressors in later life and put a significant risk at functional and mental health, making them an important target of research into healthy aging and physical resilience. Large-scale longitudinal research mostly conducted in non-clinical samples provided support of the predictive value of self-rated health (SRH) for both functional and mental health. Thus, SRH may have the potential to predict favorable adaptation processes after significant health stressors, that is, physical resilience. So far, a study examining the interplay between SRH, functional and mental health and their relative importance for health changes in the context of health stressors was missing. The present study aimed at addressing this gap. METHODS: We used prospective data of 1,580 inpatients (794 complete cases) aged 70 years or older of the PAWEL study, collected between October 2017 and May 2019 in Germany. Our analyses were based on SRH, functional health (Barthel Index) and self-reported mental health problems (PHQ-4) before and 12 months after major elective surgery. To examine changes and interrelationships in these health indicators, bivariate latent change score (BLCS) models were applied. RESULTS: Our analyses provided evidence for improvements of SRH, functional and mental health from pre-to-post surgery. BLCS models based on complete cases and the total sample pointed to a complex interplay of SRH, functional health and mental health with bidirectional coupling effects. Better pre-surgery SRH was associated with improvements in functional and mental health, and better pre-surgery functional health and mental health were associated with improvements in SRH from pre-to-post surgery. Effects of pre-surgery SRH on changes in functional health were smaller than those of functional health on changes in SRH. CONCLUSIONS: Meaningful changes of SRH, functional and mental health and their interplay could be depicted for the first time in a clinical setting. Our findings provide preliminary support for SRH as a physical resilience factor being associated with improvements in other health indicators after health stressors. Longitudinal studies with more timepoints are needed to fully understand the predictive value of SRH for multidimensional health.
