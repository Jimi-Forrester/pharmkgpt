30336995|a|We gathered some theoretic and practical concepts related to the importance of nutrition in the prevention and management of Alzheimer disease (AD). Besides the role of nutrients in brain development and functioning, some nutrients exert special control in the development of AD, due to their participation in neurotransmitter synthesis, their modulation in epigenetics mechanisms, and as antioxidants. In addition, some non-nutrient food-derived substances have shown potential in the control of neuroinflammation and consequently in the prevention of AD. Finally, it is important to be aware of the nutritional status and food intake patterns of the patient with AD.
