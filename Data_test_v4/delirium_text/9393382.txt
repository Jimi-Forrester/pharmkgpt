9393382|t|Use of physician services among family caregivers of elderly persons with dementia.
9393382|a|It is well known that there is an excess of physical and psychological health problems among family caregivers of elderly persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. The objective of this study was to determine whether the higher level of morbidity translates into a higher level of medical care utilization. Data from a previously completed longitudinal study of caregivers for elderly persons with dementia were merged with data on physician visits obtained from the computerized records of the Quebec Health Insurance Board. Utilization of physician care (adjusted for age, sex, number of chronic diseases, and depression) was no higher for family caregivers of elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias than for comparable family members of older persons without dementia. The annual cost of physician care was almost identical among caregivers and noncaregivers. However, the pattern of utilization for the two groups was somewhat different: there was a significantly higher frequency of physician utilization among caregivers for services billed by psychiatrists and internal medicine specialists. In multivariate analysis, physician utilization was significantly associated with having more than one chronic condition and with increased age. Future studies should focus on determining whether caregivers neglect their own health care needs as a result of the exigencies of the caregiving role.
