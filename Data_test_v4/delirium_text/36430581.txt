36430581|t|An Altered Neurovascular System in Aging-Related Eye Diseases.
36430581|a|The eye has a complex and metabolically active neurovascular system. Repeated light injuries induce aging and trigger age-dependent eye diseases. Damage to blood vessels is related to the disruption of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB), altered cellular communication, disrupted mitochondrial functions, and exacerbated aggregated protein accumulation. Vascular complications, such as insufficient blood supply and BRB disruption, have been suggested to play a role in glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD), resulting in neuronal cell death. Neuronal loss can induce vision loss. In this review, we discuss the importance of the neurovascular system in the eye, especially in aging-related diseases such as glaucoma, AMD, and AD. Beneficial molecular pathways to prevent or slow down retinal pathologic processes will also be discussed.
