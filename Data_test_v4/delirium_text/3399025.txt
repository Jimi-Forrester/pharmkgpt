3399025|t|A case of familial, atypical Alzheimer's disease: immunohistochemical study of amyloid P-component.
3399025|a|The presence of amyloid P-component (AP) in the amyloid plaques of a case of familial, atypical Alzheimer's disease was examined by means of the anti-AP immunoperoxidase method. Many amyloid plaques stained strongly positive for AP, so that they were analogous in AP stainability to those of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
