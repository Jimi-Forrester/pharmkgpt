35541297|t|Purple Urine Bag Syndrome as the Primary Presenting Feature of a Urinary Tract Infection.
35541297|a|Purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS) is a curious condition that manifests with purple discoloration of a urinary catheter bag as a result of a urinary tract infection (UTI). This syndrome is produced through a reaction between urinary by-products and the components of a plastic urinary catheter bag. Predisposing factors include old age, long-term catheterization, chronic constipation, and limited mobility. We describe a case of a UTI in a 90-year-old woman in which the initial presentation was PUBS. Here, late recognition of PUBS led to delayed treatment of the associated UTI. Despite being a simple spot diagnosis, knowledge about this uncommon syndrome is lacking amongst clinicians and this may have implications on patient outcomes.
