39353831|a|This study aims to investigate whether butylphthalide can inhibit ferroptosis and ameliorate cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats by activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) / heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signalling pathway, known for its antioxidative and cytoprotective properties. Middle cerebral artery occlusion reperfusion (MCAO/R) rat models were established. Male rats were randomly divided into five groups: a sham-operated group (sham), MCAO/R group, MCAO/R + ML385 (Nrf2-specific inhibitor) group, MCAO/R + NBP (butylphthalide) group and MCAO/R + ML385 + NBP group. The effect of butylphthalide on cerebral I/R injury was evaluated using neurological deficit scores. The expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) protein were detected using Western blot. Moreover, the expression levels of GPX4, HO-1 and TfR1 mRNA were determined through real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The distribution of Nrf2, HO-1, GPX4 and TfR1 was detected using immunohistochemical staining. The levels of iron and related lipid peroxidation indexes, such as reduced glutathione, reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and nitric oxide, were measured using a kit. The changes in mitochondria were observed through transmission electron microscopy. Butylphthalide treatment significantly improved neurological dysfunction, reduced cerebral infarction volume and mitigated histopathological damage in MCAO/R rats. It induced the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and upregulated HO-1 expression, which was attenuated by ML385. Butylphthalide also attenuated lipid peroxidation, iron accumulation and mitochondrial damage induced by MCAO/R. The expression of GPX4, ACSL4 and TfR1 proteins, as well as their mRNA levels, was modulated through butylphthalide treatment, with improvements observed in mitochondrial morphology. Butylphthalide exerts neuroprotective effects by attenuating neurological dysfunction and ferroptosis in MCAO/R rats through the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and inhibition of lipid peroxidation and iron accumulation.
