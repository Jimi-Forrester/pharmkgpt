37835777|t|Progress in the Diagnostic and Predictive Evaluation of Crush Syndrome.
37835777|a|Crush syndrome (CS), also known as traumatic rhabdomyolysis, is a syndrome with a wide clinical spectrum; it is caused by external compression, which often occurs in earthquakes, wars, and traffic accidents, especially in large-scale disasters. Crush syndrome is the second leading cause of death after direct trauma in earthquakes. A series of clinical complications caused by crush syndrome, including hyperkalemia, myoglobinuria, and, in particular, acute kidney injury (AKI), is the main cause of death in crush syndrome. The early diagnosis of crush syndrome, the correct evaluation of its severity, and accurate predictions of a poor prognosis can provide personalized suggestions for rescuers to carry out early treatments and reduce mortality. This review summarizes various methods for the diagnostic and predictive evaluation of crush syndrome, including urine dipstick tests for a large number of victims, traditional and emerging biomarkers, imaging-assisted diagnostic methods, and developed evaluation models, with the aim of providing materials for scholars in this research field.
