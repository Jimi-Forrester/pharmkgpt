10961420|a|A growing body of evidence supports the notion that inflammatory reactions in the central nervous system (CNS) are not only restricted to established immune mediated disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, but also contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and other types of neurodegenerative disorders. The biological roles of toxic mediators, such as nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, as well as complement and proteases in the genesis of inflammatory reactions in the CNS are reviewed within the context of demyelination and neuronal damage.
