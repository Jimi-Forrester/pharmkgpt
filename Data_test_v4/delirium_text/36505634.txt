36505634|a|Since the pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, many people have been affected in different ways. The majority of infected people experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without the need for hospitalization. However, in some affected people, it may lead to catastrophic disease. The severity of COVID-19 infection is widely influenced by co-morbidities, immune system functions, and extra-pulmonary organ injuries. Since the emergence of COVID-19, multi-organ involvement has been documented. In order to implement preventative and protective measures, full attention to potential organ injuries is required. Most existing articles and review papers are focused on a specific organ system, and their numbers are growing. In this review paper, attempts were made to collect review papers and articles published on seven organ system involvements in COVID-19 infection published till 15 July and highlight conclusions and managements of all affected organs. We tried to add to the medical knowledge on COVID-19, pointing out its multi-organ system impact. Finally, we tried to facilitate access to organized information and optimum conclusion by representing review tables for each organ system. Besides, this review article can clarify and magnify the empty research space easily for future investigations.
