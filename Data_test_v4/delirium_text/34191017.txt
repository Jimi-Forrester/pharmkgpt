34191017|t|Detection of the Microvascular Changes of Diabetic Retinopathy Progression Using Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography.
34191017|a|Purpose: To investigate microvascular parameters that are related to the severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR) with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Methods: In total, 105 eyes from 105 diabetic patients were recruited in this prospective cross-sectional study, including 37 eyes with no clinical signs of DR (NoDR), 43 eyes with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and 25 eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Angiogram images from the parafoveal superficial capillary plexus (SCP), the deep capillary plexus (DCP), and the radial peripapillary capillary plexus were analyzed, and metrics were compared among groups. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify the best OCTA parameters that could distinguish DR severity among groups. Results: Parafoveal vessel diameter index in the SCP and vessel density (VD) in the DCP showed the strongest correlation with the severity of DR (P < 0.01). Extrafoveal avascular area in the SCP was the parameter that could most distinguish NoDR from NPDR (P < 0.01) with sensitivity and specificity of 83.72% and 78.38%, respectively. VD in the DCP also was the most sensitive biomarker to distinguish NPDR from PDR (P < 0.01) with sensitivity and specificity of 84.00% and 79.07%, respectively. Conclusions: The microvascular changes in the SCP and DCP in DR may have different characteristics that could be identified with specific OCTA parameters. OCTA serves as a promising technology to discriminate eyes with different severity of DR. Translational Relevance: Our study investigated OCTA metrics and severity of DR. At different stages of DR, ophthalmologists may focus on specific OCTA parameters to predict the progression of retinopathy in individual patients.
