36565113|t|Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome Among Chinese Older Adults with White Matter Lesions: A Cross-Sectional Observational Study.
36565113|a|Brain aging is characterized by the declines in motor and cognitive features. The present study is to detect motor cognitive risk syndrome (MCRS) in older adults with white matter lesions (WML). 134 WML aged patients were recruited and diagnosed with the criteria for MCRS. Numerous cognitive function tests and walking tests were performed. The frequency of MCRS is 28.35%. Verbal fluency test, Mini-Mental State Examination, and dual-task walking speed were independent risk factor of MCRS. These findings indicated that MCRS was common in WML seniors. MCRS was associated with the pathologies of WML in older adults.
