34057080|t|Impact of Dementia-Related Behavioral Symptoms on Healthcare Resource Use and Caregiver Burden: Real-World Data from Europe and the United States.
34057080|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia is commonly accompanied by neurobehavioral symptoms; however, the relationship between such symptoms and health-related outcomes is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of specific neurobehavioral symptoms in dementia on healthcare resource use (HCRU), patient quality of life (QoL), and caregiver burden. METHODS: Data were taken from the 2015/16 Adelphi Real World Dementia Disease Specific Programme , a point-in-time survey of physicians and their consulting dementia patients. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine associations between patient symptom groups and health-related outcomes. RESULTS: Each patient symptom group of interest (patients with agitation/aggression and related symptoms [AARS] with psychosis, patients with AARS without psychosis, and patients with other behavioral symptoms) had a positive association with HCRU variables (i.e., HCRU was greater), a negative association with proxy measures of patient QoL (i.e., QoL was decreased), and a positive association with caregiver burden (i.e., burden was greater) compared with patients with no behavioral symptoms (control group). The magnitude of effect was generally greatest in patients with AARS with psychosis. Regression analysis covariates that were found to be most often significantly related to the outcomes were dementia severity and the patients' living situation (i.e., whether they were in nursing homes or living in the community). CONCLUSION: Combinations of behavioral symptoms, particularly involving AARS plus psychosis, may have a detrimental impact on health-related outcomes such as HCRU, patient QoL, and caregiver burden in dementia. Our results have implications for intervention development in patients who report clusters of symptoms and caregivers, and for identifying at-risk individuals.
