35689208|t|Remimazolam tosilate compared with propofol for gastrointestinal endoscopy in elderly patients: a prospective, randomized and controlled study.
35689208|a|BACKGROUND: Remimazolam tosilate (HR7056, RT), a novel ultrashort-acting benzodiazepine, can be used for procedural sedation and general anaesthesia. However, few studies have focused on the sedative effect of RT during gastrointestinal endoscopy in elderly patients. The purpose of this study is to compare the sedative effect of RT and propofol for gastrointestinal endoscopy in elderly patients. METHODS: A total of 82 patients aged >=65 years with an American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade I-II and a body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2 who were scheduled for gastrointestinal endoscopy from Jan 2021 to Aug 2021 were selected and randomly divided into a RT group and a propofol group. Alfentanil 5 mug/kg was used for analgesia in both groups. The RT group was given remimazolam tosilate 0.15 mg/kg with supplemental doses of 0.05 mg/kg as need, while the propofol group was given propofol 1.5 mg/kg with supplemental doses of 0.5 mg/kg. The supplemental doses were determined by the modified observational alertness/sedation assessment (MOAA/S) score and the patients' body movements. Sedative effects, such as the time to loss of consciousness (LOC) (MOAA/S score <= 1), successful sedation in one dose, number of supplemental doses after successful induction, and recovery time, were evaluated. Sedation-related side effects, such as injection pain, haemodynamic events and respiratory depression, were also noted. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at rest, remedial analgesics, and dizziness or headache were recorded. In addition, patients' satisfaction and physician's satisfaction of the procedure were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Data from 77 patients were analysed. The success rate of sedation in both groups was 100%. The time to LOC (MOAA/S score <= 1) in the RT group was longer than that in the propofol group (20.7 +- 6.1s vs. 13.2 +- 5.2s, P < 0.001). There were fewer patients in the RT group reporting injection pain than that in the propofol group (0/39 vs. 5/38, P = 0.025). Haemodynamic events and respiratory depression in the RT group were less frequent than those in the propofol group ((6/39 vs. 17/38, P = 0.005), (2/39 vs. 9/38, P = 0.026), respectively). The number of supplemental doses after successful induction in the RT group was greater than that in the propofol group (4/9/11/13/1/1 vs. 8/4/18/6/2/0 requiring 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 supplemental doses, P = 0.014). The characteristics of the patients enrolled, postoperative parameters of the patients, and patients' and physician's satisfaction of the procedure were comparable in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with propofol, RT can be safely and effectively used for gastrointestinal endoscopy sedation in elderly patients, and the incidence of sedation-related adverse reactions, especially haemodynamic events and respiratory depression, is lower. When RT is used, the number of supplemental doses after successful induction may increase slightly. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chictr.org.cn ChiCTR2000040498.
