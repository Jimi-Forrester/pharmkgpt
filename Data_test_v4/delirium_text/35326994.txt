35326994|t|Pathophysiology and Symptomatology of Drooling in Parkinson's Disease.
35326994|a|Drooling can present in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and it is manifested as an excessive pooling of saliva inside the oral cavity. Currently, the exact pathophysiological mechanism of drooling in PD is not yet fully explicated. Thus, it becomes crucial to understand if some clinical characteristics may emphasize drooling or if they are just concomitant. In PD, excessive drooling has been associated with a higher burden of non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, sleep problems, autonomic dysfunction, constipation and orthostatic hypotension, and of worse severity of motor fluctuations and bradykinesia. PD patients with excessive drooling also showed a reduction of striatal DAT availability at DaTSCAN imaging. Excessive drooling in patients with Parkinson's cannot be attributed to a single factor but to a mixture of factors, including but not limited to impaired nigrostriatal pathways.
