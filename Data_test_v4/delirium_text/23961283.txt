23961283|a|BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency and serum calcium disturbance have been reported to be more common in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients than in healthy control subjects, which may be due to a chronic disease or reduced mobility contributes to these relatively disturbances. Because of the high-vitamin D insufficiency in our population, we aimed to compare a biochemical levels which are related to bone metabolism, in PD patients in comparison with age-matched healthy controls, for the 1(st) time in a Middle East population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-control study was involved 105 (20 were excluded) PD patients, who were age- and -sex matched with 112 controls. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and parathyroid hormone analyzed by enzyme immunoassay; another laboratory data including, calcium, phosphorous, and alkaline phosphatase were performed by spectrophotometric methods. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in 25OHD between PD patients and control group (P = 0.071). 25OHD level was not significantly different in PD patients compared to controls {odds ratio 1.003, (confidence interval [CI], 0.98-1.02), P value 0.793}. None of the other biochemical levels did not induce more chance for PD, only we observed in men has more risk of PD than women (odds ratio 2.53, [CI, 1.27-5.03], P value 0.008). CONCLUSION: Our data do not support a possible role of vitamin D insufficiency in PD. Regarding to variable changes in biochemical markers in PD patients than in controls; further studies are suggested to determine any plausibility role of them as a causal relationship or as an outcome of PD.
