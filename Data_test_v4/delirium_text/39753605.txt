39753605|t|Space exploration and risk of Parkinson's disease: a perspective review.
39753605|a|Systemic mitochondrial dysfunction, dopamine loss, sustained structural changes in the basal ganglia including reduced tyrosine hydroxylase, and altered gait- these effects observed in space-flown animals and astronauts mirrors Parkinson's disease (PD). Evidence of mitochondrial changes in space-flown human cells, examined through the lens of PD, suggests that spaceflight-induced PD-like molecular changes are important to monitor during deep space exploration. These changes, may potentially elevate the risk of PD in astronauts.
