36012351|t|Physiological and Pathological Functions of Neuronal Hemoglobin: A Key Underappreciated Protein in Parkinson's Disease.
36012351|a|The expression of Hemoglobin (Hb) is not restricted to erythrocytes but is also present in neurons. Hb is selectively enriched in vulnerable mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons of Parkinson's disease (PD) instead of resistant neurons. Controversial results of neuronal Hb levels have been reported in postmortem brains of PD patients: although neuronal Hb levels may decline in PD patients, elderly men with higher Hb levels have an increased risk of developing PD. alpha-synuclein, a key protein involved in PD pathology, interacts directly with Hb protein and forms complexes in erythrocytes and brains of monkeys and humans. These complexes increase in erythrocytes and striatal cytoplasm, while they decrease in striatal mitochondria with aging. Besides, the colocalization of serine 129-phosphorylated (Pser129) alpha-synuclein and Hb beta chains have been found in the brains of PD patients. Several underlying molecular mechanisms involving mitochondrial homeostasis, alpha-synuclein accumulation, iron metabolism, and hormone-regulated signaling pathways have been investigated to assess the relationship between neuronal Hb and PD development. The formation of fibrils with neuronal Hb in various neurodegenerative diseases may indicate a common fibrillization pathway and a widespread target that could be applied in neurodegeneration therapy.
