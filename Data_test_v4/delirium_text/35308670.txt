35308670|t|Tiny Toes to Tau Tangles: Down's Syndrome and Its Association With Alzheimer's Disease.
35308670|a|Down's syndrome (DS) is a common genetic condition caused by the trisomy of chromosome 21, which leads to the development of many multisystemic complications, early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) being one of its most common complications. In this article, we have performed an intensive literature review that established a strong relationship between AD and DS. These two conditions are clubbed pathologically, clinically, and diagnostically to understand the association between AD and DS. This article focuses on understanding the impact of AD on a DS patient on both clinical and pathological levels and exploring some advanced treatment modalities. It has also emphasized the importance of early screening and diagnosis for AD in this group of patients to prevent AD development. Regular monitoring, early diagnosis, and a proper treatment plan can slow the AD occurrence in DS patients.
