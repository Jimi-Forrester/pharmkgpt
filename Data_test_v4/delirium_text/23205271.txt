23205271|a|Since age-dependent deposition of Abeta-amyloid has been reported in the Microcebusmurinus, we posited that this animal could as well be a model of age-related synucleinopathy. We characterized the distribution of Abeta-amyloid, alpha-synuclein and two of its modified forms in the brain of Microcebusmurinus aged from 1.5 to 10 years. Intracytoplasmic alpha-synuclein aggregates were observed only in aged animals in different brain regions, which were also phospho-Ser129 and nitrated alpha-synuclein immunoreactive. Age-dependent alpha-synuclein aggregation occurs spontaneously in mouse lemur primates. Microcebus murinus may provide a model to study age-associated alpha-synucleinopathy and for testing putative therapeutic interventions for both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
