37990344|a|OBJECTIVE: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) caused by opioid drugs show individual differences. Our objective was to explore the association between gene polymorphism and ADRs induced by opioid drugs. METHODS: Evidence-based medical data analysis was conducted for genes related to ADRs induced by opioid drugs to select target genes. Sixty patients with cancer pain who had ADRs after taking opioid drugs (morphine, codeine, oxycodone) and 60 patients without ADRs after taking opioid drugs were used as the experimental group and control group, respectively. Then, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or in situ hybridization to detect target genes. By combining with clinical data such as age, sex, dosage and duration of medication, the effect of gene polymorphism on the ADR of patients after taking opioid drugs was statistically analysed. RESULTS: Based on a database search and evidence-based medical data, we identified CYP2D6*10, CYP3A5*3, ABCB1, and OPRM1 as target genes for detection. The results of statistical analysis showed no significant difference in genotype distribution between the experimental group and the control group (p > 0.05). However, if 32 patients with ADRs after taking oxycodone and 32 controls were selected for comparison, the SPSS22.0 and SNPStats genetic models showed that the ABCB1 (062rs1045642) CT and TT genotypes correlated with the occurrence of ADRs (p < 0.05): the total number of CT + TT genotypes in the experimental group was 29 (90.62%), with 11 (34.37%) CT + TT genotypes types in the control group. CONCLUSION: Polymorphism of ABCB1 (062rs1045642) is related to ADRs caused by oxycodone, and the incidence of ADRs is higher with the allele T. Polymorphism of ABCB1 is expected to become a clinical predictor of ADRs to oxycodone, and attention should be given to the occurrence of serious ADRs in patients with ABCB1 (062rs1045642) CT and TT genotypes.
