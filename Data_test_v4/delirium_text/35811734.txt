35811734|t|Validation of T-MoCA in the Screening of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Chinese Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.
35811734|a|Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a high risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. However, feasible and simple instruments that facilitate the regular assessment of cognitive status in patients with AF remain underdeveloped. Methods: Cognitive function was first evaluated using telephone Montreal cognitive assessment (T-MoCA), and then patients were invited for an in-person interview for cognitive assessment using both Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and mini-mental status evaluation (MMSE). Using CDR = 0.5 as a reference standard, the ability of T-MoCA and MMSE to discriminate cognitive dysfunction, stratified by education level, was tested by receiver-operating curve (ROC) analysis. The net reclassification index was calculated for comparison between the performance of T-MoCA and MMSE. Results: One hundred and one patients completed both telephone and in-person interview. Thirty-five MCI patients were identified as MCI using the criteria of CDR = 0.5. The areas under the ROC curve of T-MoCA were 0.80 (0.71-0.89), 0.83 (0.71-0.95), and 0.85 (0.64-0.92) for all patients, patients with high educational level, and patients with low education level, respectively. The optimal threshold was achieved at 16/17 with a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 69.7% in overall patients, 15/16 with a sensitivity of 88.2% and a specificity of 64.5% in the low educational level patients, and 16/17 with a sensitivity of 77.8% and a specificity of 87.9% in the high educational level patients. Compared to the criterion MMSE <= 27 and MMSE norms for the elderly Chinese community, the stratified T-MoCA threshold improves correct classification by 23.7% (p = 0.033) and 30.3% (p = 0.020), respectively. Conclusion: T-MoCA is a feasible and effective instrument for MCI screening in patients with AF.
