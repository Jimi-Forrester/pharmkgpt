31450512|t|Functional Connectivity Signatures of Parkinson's Disease.
31450512|a| Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) studies have been extensively applied to analyze the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present narrative review, we attempt to summarize the most recent RS-fMRI findings highlighting the role of brain networks re-organization and adaptation in the course of PD. We also discuss limitations and potential definition of early functional connectivity signatures to track and predict future PD progression. Understanding the neural correlates and potential predisposing factors of clinical progression and complication will be crucial to guide novel clinical trials and to foster preventive strategies.
