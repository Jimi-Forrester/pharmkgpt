34405262|a|The research on human gut microbiome, regarded as the black box of the human body, is still at the stage of infancy as the functional properties of the complex gut microbiome have not yet been understood. Ongoing metagenomic studies have deciphered that the predominant microbial communities belong to eubacterial phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and archaebacterial phylum Euryarchaeota. The indigenous commensal microbial flora prevents opportunistic pathogenic infection and play undeniable roles in digestion, metabolite and signaling molecule production and controlling host's cellular health, immunity and neuropsychiatric behavior. Besides maintaining intestinal health via short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, gut microbes also aid in neuro-immuno-endocrine modulatory molecule production, immune cell differentiation and glucose and lipid metabolism. Interdependence of diet and intestinal microbial diversity suggests the effectiveness of pre- and pro-biotics in maintenance of gut and systemic health. Several companies worldwide have started potentially exploiting the microbial contribution to human health and have translated their use in disease management and therapeutic applications. The present review discusses the vast diversity of microorganisms playing intricate roles in human metabolism. The contribution of the intestinal microbiota to regulate systemic activities including gut-brain-immunity crosstalk has been focused. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first of its kind to collate and discuss the companies worldwide translating the multi-therapeutic potential of human intestinal microbiota, based on the multi-omics studies, i.e. metagenomics and metabolomics, as ready solutions for several metabolic and systemic disorders.
