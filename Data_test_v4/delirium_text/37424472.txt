37424472|t|Sex-Related Differences in the Association Between Body Mass Index and Dementia Risk.
37424472|a|In this issue, Zakharova et al. report on important findings concerning the association between body mass index and dementia risk as related to sex. Concretely, underweight was strongly associated with dementia risk in men but not in women. We compare the results of this study with a recent publication by Jacob et al. and consider the role of sex in the association between body mass index and dementia.
