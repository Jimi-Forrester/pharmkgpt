10477120|t|Genetic association between alpha-2 macroglobulin and Japanese sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
10477120|a|Alpha-2 macroglobulin (encoded by the gene A2M) is a serum pan-protease inhibitor that may be related with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of its ability to mediate amyloid beta degradation. Recently, several groups have reported that the five-nucleotides deletion in A2M gene at the 5' splice site of exon 18 might increase risk for AD. In the present study, therefore, this mutation was studied in 69 healthy controls and 55 sporadic AD cases by polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The allelic frequencies with the deletion (A2M-2) are 9.4 and 6.4% in the control and AD groups, respectively. There is no significant difference in the A2M-2 frequencies between the controls and sporadic AD cases. This is the first report to study the frequencies of A2M-2 in Japanese AD cases, suggesting its no genetic association with sporadic AD.
