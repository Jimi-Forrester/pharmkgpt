35659469|t|An HIT-Supported Care Coordination Framework for Reducing Structural Racism and Discrimination for Patients With ADRD.
35659469|a|Black and Latinx Americans are disproportionately at greater risk for having Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) than White Americans. Such differences in risk for ADRD are arguably explained through health disparities, social inequities, and historical policies. Structural racism and discrimination (SRD), defined as "macro-level conditions that limit opportunities, resources, and well-being of less privileged groups," have been linked with common comorbidities of ADRD, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes, depression. Given the historical impact of SRD-including discriminatory housing policies resulting in racial residential segregation that has been shown to limit access to education, employment, and healthcare-Black and Latinx populations with ADRD are directly or indirectly negatively affected by SRD in terms of access, quality and cost for healthcare. Emerging studies have brought to light the value of structural-level hospital and public health collaboration on care coordination for improving healthcare quality and access, and thus could serve as a macro-level mechanism for addressing disparities for minoritized racial and ethnic populations with ADRD. This paper presents a conceptual framework delineating how care coordination can successfully be achieved through health information technology (HIT) systems and ultimately address SRD. To address health inequities, it is therefore critical that policy initiatives invest in HIT capacities and infrastructures to promote care coordination, identify patient needs and preferences, and promote engagement of patients with ADRD and their caregivers.
