35046168|a|INTRODUCTION: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) principles is an evidence-based surgical management approach that requires cooperation across various medical specialties. In this study, we applied ERAS principles in total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) and the post-operative outcomes like post-operative pain, nausea and vomiting, opioid requirement, day of discharge, and any other complaints were studied. METHODS: The study was conducted in a private healthcare setup in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. In this non-randomised controlled study 103 patients who underwent TLH over a period of 1 year were alternatively allocated to the study group and the control group. There were 51 patients in the study group in whom ERAS principles were applied and 52 patients in control group in whom traditional post-operative care was given. RESULTS: Post-operative nausea and vomiting and opioid requirement were significantly reduced in the study group (P < 0.05). The post-operative pain was similar in both groups. The majority of patients in study group were discharged within 24 h as compared to the routine discharge after 48 h. CONCLUSION: Following ERAS principles in TLH results in decrease in post-operative nausea and vomiting, post-operative opioid requirement and hospital stay. Hence, the ERAS principles should be the standard practice in TLH even in a developing country setup.
