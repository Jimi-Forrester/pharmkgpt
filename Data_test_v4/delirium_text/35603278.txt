35603278|a|Background: With the rising number of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell treated patients, it is increasingly important to understand the treatment's impact on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and, ideally, identify biomarkers of central nervous system (CNS) adverse effects. Methods: The purpose of this exploratory study was to assess short-term PROs and serum kynurenine metabolites for associated neurotoxicity among patients treated in an anti-CD20, anti-CD19 (LV20.19) CAR T cell phase I clinical trial (NCT03019055). Fifteen CAR T treated patients from the parent trial provided serum samples and self-report surveys 15 days before and 14, 28, and 90 days after treatment. Results: Blood kynurenine concentrations increased over time in patients with evidence of neurotoxicity (p = 0.004) and were increased in self-reported depression (r = 0.52, p = 0.002). Depression improved after CAR T infusion (p = 0.035). Elevated 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA) concentrations prior to cell infusion were also predictive of neurotoxicity onset (p = 0.031), suggesting it is a biomarker of neurotoxicity following CAR T cell therapy. Conclusions: Elevated levels of kynurenine pathway metabolites among CAR T cell recipients are associated with depressed mood and neurotoxicity. Findings from this exploratory study are preliminary and warrant validation in a larger cohort.
