37302170|a|Ischemic stroke (IS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Immunity and inflammation are key factors in the pathophysiology of IS. The inflammatory response is involved in all stages of stroke, and microglia are the predominant cells involved in the post-stroke inflammatory response. Resident microglia are the main immune cells of the brain and the first line of defense of the nervous system. After IS, activated microglia can be both advantageous and detrimental to surrounding tissue; they can be divided into the harmful M1 types or the neuro-protective M2 type. Currently, with the latest progress of transcriptomics analysis, different and more complex phenotypes of microglia activation have been described, such as disease-related microglia (DAM) associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), white matter associated microglia (WAMs) in aging, and stroke-related microglia (SAM) etc. The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell 2 (TREM2) is an immune-related receptor on the surface of microglia. Its expression increases after IS, which is related to microglial inflammation and phagocytosis, however, its relationship with the microglia phenotype is not clear. This paper reviews the following: 1) the phenotypic changes of microglia in various pathological stages after IS and its relationship with inflammatory factors; 2) the relationship between the expression of the TREM2 receptor and inflammatory factors; 3) the relationship between phenotypic changes of microglia and its surface receptor TREM2; 4) the TREM2-related signalling pathway of microglia after IS and treatment for TREM2 receptor; and finally 5) To clarify the relationship among TREM2, inflammation, and microglia phenotype after IS, as well as the mechanism among them and the some possible treatment of IS targeting TREM2. Moreover, the relationship between the new phenotype of microglia such as SAM and TREM2 has also been systematically summarized, but there are no relevant research reports on the relationship between TREM2 and SAM after IS.
