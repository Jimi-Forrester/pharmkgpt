34208163|t|Predictors of Changes in Cognitive Function in Older Korean Adults: The 2006-2018 Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging.
34208163|a|Cognitive decline with normal aging varies widely among individuals. This study aimed to investigate predictors of longitudinal changes in cognitive function in community-dwelling Korean adults aged 65 years and older. Data from 727 older adults who participated in the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) survey from 2006 (baseline) until 2018 (seventh wave) were used. Cognitive performance was assessed with the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination. The participants were retrospectively classified into normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and moderate/severe cognitive impairment. Education, income, religion, living area, alcohol intake, smoking, physical activity, handgrip strength, functional dependency, depression, comorbidity, medications, fall experience, and unintentional weight loss were included as covariates. A linear mixed regression analysis showed that a steeper decline in cognitive function over time was significantly associated with parameters of poor socio-economic status, health conditions, and unhealthy behaviors. Individuals with mild cognitive impairment or moderate/severe cognitive impairment were likely to have steeper cognitive declines compared with individuals with normal cognition. The current findings of the study showed that age-related cognitive decline was multifactorial in older Korean adults.
