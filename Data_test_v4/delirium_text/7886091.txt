7886091|a|Interest has recently focused on tobacco and/or nicotine in relation to senile dementia of the Alzheimer type because the population of patients with this disease among tobacco smokers is significantly smaller than in nonsmokers. We investigated whether, in relation to the dopaminergic neuronal system, nicotine was effective in ameliorating the impairment of performance in passive avoidance tasks in rats induced by scopolamine, an inhibitor of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Scopolamine and nicotine were coadministered to rats 30 min before the acquisition trial. Some rats received scopolamine alone; they showed much shorter step-through latency (STL) than the control group in the retention test. Nicotine significantly prolonged the decreased STL induced by scopolamine. The effects of nicotine were inhibited by the preadministration of mecamylamine, SCH 23390, and (-)sulpiride, which are nicotinic acetylcholine, D1, and D2 receptor antagonists, respectively. These results suggest that nicotine, by activating the nicotinic acetylcholinergic and dopaminergic neuronal systems, ameliorates the impairment of performance in the passive avoidance task induced by a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor blocker.
