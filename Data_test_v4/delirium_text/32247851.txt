32247851|t|Alzheimer's disease beyond amyloid: Can the repetitive failures of amyloid-targeted therapeutics inform future approaches to dementia drug discovery?
32247851|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) therapeutics based on the amyloid hypothesis have repeatedly failed in clinical trials. Together with numerous reports that amyloid is present in brains from aged individuals without cognitive dysfunction, this suggests that the association of amyloid with AD is collateral rather than causal. However, the preeminence of the amyloid hypothesis has resulted in the 'systematic ...thwart[ing of] alternative approaches' to AD/dementia driven by a 'cabal' of amyloid acolytes who have effectively controlled the ideas funded and published, which startups received venture investment and which programs were advanced in biopharmaceutical companies where they consulted. As a result, dementia research is estimated to be 15-30 years behind where it could be with conflicting data ignored in favor of the amyloid dogma and clinical trial failures being ascribed to faulty design or inadequacies in the compound selection process including flawed animal models. Major concerns regarding the precise diagnosis of AD/dementia and conflicting views on the validated status of fluid biomarker assays have resulted in trials that included patients with unknown amyloid pathologies. With the failure of the amyloid approach, emerging data on the role(s) of vascular, mitochondrial and synaptic network dysfunction, infection, diabetes, sleep, hearing loss, the gut microbiome and neuroinflammation/ innate immune function as dementia targets are driving research in new directions bolstered by recent findings on the genetic, omics and systems biology associated with AD/dementia. In moving forward, lessons learnt from the amyloid debacle should be used to enhance the objective identification of AD/dementia therapeutics as a multifactorial disease syndrome.
