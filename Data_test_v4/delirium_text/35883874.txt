35883874|t|Main Bioactive Components and Their Biological Activities from Natural and Processed Rhizomes of Polygonum sibiricum.
35883874|a|Polygonatum sibiricum (Asparagaceae) is often used as an herbal drug in the traditional medicine of Southeast Asia. Its rhizome, called "Huang Jing", is used in traditional Chinese medicine as an immune system stimulant, hypolipidemic agent, anti-aging agent, anti-fatigue agent, and cardiovascular protectant. We investigated the antioxidant, anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE), anti-inflammatory, and anti-alpha-glucosidase effects of various solvent extracts and major bioactive components of Polygonatum sibiricum (PS) and processed Polygonatum sibiricum (PPS). Dichloromethane extract of PS showed stronger antioxidant effects by DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays, and EtOAc extract displayed relatively high antioxidant activity by a superoxide radical scavenging test. Moreover, acetone, EtOAc, and dichloromethane extracts displayed a significant anti-alpha-glucosidase effect. EtOH and CH2Cl2 extracts showed effective AChE inhibitory activity. In addition, dichloromethane extract showed the best inhibition against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) accumulation in RAW264.7 macrophages. HPLC analysis was used to investigate and compare the content of major active components of various solvent extracts of PS and PPS. Rutin showed the most effective scavenging of DPPH and ABTS free radicals, while scopoletin and isoquercetin displayed the strongest anti-alpha-glucosidase and anti-AChE effect, respectively. Rutin showed the best inhibition against LPS-induced NO production and also inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in Western blot. The molecular docking of AChE and iNOS revealed that active components could have a better antagonistic effect than positive controls (common inhibitors). This study shows that the active extracts and components of Polygonatum sibiricum have the potential to be further developed as a natural anti-AChE, anti-alpha-glucosidase, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.
