35030318|t|Factors and Outcomes Associated With Dysphagia in Hospitalized Persons With Dementia.
35030318|a|OBJECTIVES: Dysphagia is prevalent in older adults with dementia, particularly in the acute care setting. The objective of this study was to use an innovative approach to extract a more representative sample of patients with dysphagia from the electronic health record (EHR) to determine patient characteristics, hospital practices, and outcomes associated with dysphagia in hospitalized persons with dementia. DESIGN: A retrospective study of hospitalized adults (aged >=65 years) with dementia was conducted in 7 hospitals across the greater New York metropolitan area. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were obtained from the inpatient EHR with the following inclusion criteria: age >=65 years; admitted to one of 7 health system hospitals between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019; and documented past medical diagnosis of dementia (based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision). METHODS: A diagnosis of dysphagia was defined as nurse documentation of a positive bedside swallow screening, nurse documentation of "difficulty swallowing" as reason for not performing bedside swallow screening, and physician documentation of a dysphagia diagnosis. RESULTS: Of adults with dementia (N = 8637), the average age was 84.5 years, 61.6% were female, and 18.1% were Black and 9.3% Hispanic. Dysphagia was identified in 41.8% (n = 3610). In multivariable models, dysphagia was associated with invasive mechanical ventilation [odds ratio (OR) 4.53, 95% CI 3.55-5.78], delirium (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.40-1.68), increased length of stay (B = 3.29, 95% CI 2.98-3.60), and mortality (OR 4.44, 95% CI 3.54-5.55). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Given its high prevalence, underrecognition, and associated poor outcomes, improving large-scale dysphagia identification can impact clinical care and advance research in hospitalized persons with dementia.
