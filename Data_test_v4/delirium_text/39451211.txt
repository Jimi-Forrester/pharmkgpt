39451211|t|Phase Separation Mediated Sub-Nuclear Compartmentalization of Androgen Receptors.
39451211|a|The androgen receptor (AR), a member of the nuclear steroid hormone receptor family of transcription factors, plays a crucial role not only in the development of the male phenotype but also in the development and growth of prostate cancer. While AR structure and AR interactions with coregulators and chromatin have been studied in detail, improving our understanding of AR function in gene transcription regulation, the spatio-temporal organization and the role of microscopically discernible AR foci in the nucleus are still underexplored. This review delves into the molecular mechanisms underlying AR foci formation, focusing on liquid-liquid phase separation and its role in spatially organizing ARs and their binding partners within the nucleus at transcription sites, as well as the influence of 3D-genome organization on AR-mediated gene transcription.
