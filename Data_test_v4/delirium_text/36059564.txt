36059564|t|Older adults and the unique role of the radiation therapist: Future directions for improving geriatric oncology training and education.
36059564|a|There is widespread recognition that the provision of high quality, appropriate and equitable care to older adults with cancer is a growing challenge in oncology practice. Radiation therapy (RT) is an effective and localised treatment that represents an attractive curative or palliative option for many older adults, and radiation therapists (RTT) play an important role in the delivery, support and quality of care for people during RT. The need to develop an evidence-based, global approach to improving all radiation oncology (RO) professionals' knowledge and clinical practice in geriatric oncology (GO) has been previously identified. This article specifically focusses on the status quo of GO clinical practice and education for RTT worldwide. We explore the unique clinical role that RTT play in the management of older adults with cancer and define multiple clinical care points in which RTT could potentially participate in geriatric screening, geriatric assessment and intervention to optimise the care of older adults, with a focus on dementia. Directions for future efforts to improve the knowledge and clinical skills of RTT in caring for older adults are discussed.
