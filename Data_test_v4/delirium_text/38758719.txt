38758719|t|The Utility of BIS  Monitoring in Anesthesia for Elderly Patients.
38758719|a|Aging leads to anatomic and physiologic changes in the brain, making it more sensitive to the depressant effects of anesthetic medications and increasing the risk of postoperative neurocognitive complications such as postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This article explores the implications of anesthesia on elderly patients' brain health, emphasizing the heightened risk of postoperative neurocognitive disorders, and describes the BIS  Monitoring System as a neuromonitoring tool for anesthesia professionals to assess the depth of anesthesia. The integration of the BIS Monitoring System into clinical practice can contribute to a more tailored and patient-centered approach to anesthesia management, ultimately improving perioperative outcomes and safety.
