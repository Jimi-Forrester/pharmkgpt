12802177|a|A panel of novel monoclonal antibodies was tested on the human entorhinal cortex for the recognition of age- and disease-related changes of neurofilament proteins (NF). Several antibodies identified phosphorylated NF-H subunit, which occurred preferentially in those aged between 60 and 80 years and were localized in degenerating neurons. Such neurons also contained neurofibrillary tangles, but neurofilament aggregates did not co-localize with tangles, nor did the quantity nor the number of NF-positive neurons correlate with the severity of Alzheimer's disease. This points to a susceptibility of NF in a subset of neurons for phosphorylation- and metabolically related morphological changes during neurodegeneration.
