38250602|a|Background: The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) is an antidiabetic medication with vascular protection and anti-inflammatory properties. Theoretically, the use of GLP-1RA should inhibit the development of open-angle glaucoma (OAG) as both vascular damage and inflammation are associated with OAG. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the association between the application of GLP-1RA and the subsequent OAG in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study by using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. Participants with T2DM were divided into those who used GLP-1RA and those who did not, forming the GLP-1RA and control groups. The primary outcome was the occurrence of OAG based on diagnostic codes. Cox proportional hazard regression was employed to calculate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for OAG. Results: 91 patients in the control group developed OAG, and 40 patients in the GLP-1RA group developed OAG. After adjustment for all covariates, the GLP-1RA group exhibited a significantly lower incidence of OAG compared with the control group (aHR: 0.712, 95% CI: 0.533-0.936. P = 0.0025). In the subgroup analyses, the association between GLP-1RA use and OAG incidence was more pronounced in patients with T2DM using GLP-1RA and aged younger than 60 years (P = 0.0438). Conclusion: The prescription of GLP-1RA is associated with a lower incidence of subsequent OAG in individuals with T2DM, and this association was more significant in patients with T2DM under the age of 60 years.
