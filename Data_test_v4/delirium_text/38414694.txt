38414694|t|Evaluation of Antibacterial and Anti-oxidant Activities of Suaeda monoica Extract for Its Potential Application.
38414694|a|BACKGROUND:  An assessment of Suaeda monoica extract's antimicrobial and antioxidant properties was undertaken in light of its possible application as an oral care product. The maintenance of optimal dental health is just as important as overall wellness. Food particles become trapped in the mouth cavity, making it easy for oral bacteria to infect. AIM:  The study sought to ascertain the antibacterial and antioxidant properties of salt marsh Suaeda monoica extract. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Leaves of Suaeda monoica, collected, dried and powdered, were dissolved in 70% methanol and the extract of 25-100 mug/ml was analyzed for antioxidant activity through total antioxidant assay, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, and total reducing power. Suaeda monoica antibacterial activity was also performed and the minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for 75 mug/ml, 100mug/ml, and 150 mug/ml concentrations and tetracycline in 10mcg/disc as a control against three different oral pathogens: Staphylococcus mutans, Streptococcus aureus, and Klebsiella spp. RESULTS:  At varying concentrations of 75 mg/ml to 150 mg/ml, Suaeda monoica extracts are efficacious with varying concentrations against the investigated bacterial strains. In the present study, in the DPPH assay, total reducing power, and total antioxidant activity assay, there was an increase in inhibitory percentage as the concentration increased from 25-100 microg/ml, showing maximum inhibition at 100 microg/ml concentration. CONCLUSION:  The results of the investigation show that Suaeda monoica has significant antibacterial and antioxidant activity in a concentration-dependent manner and can be potentially used as an oral care agent after it is assessed for clinical use.
