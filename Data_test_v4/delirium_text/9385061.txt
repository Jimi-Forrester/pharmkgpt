9385061|t|Protocol for quantitative analysis of paired helical filament solubilization: a method applicable to insoluble amyloids and inclusion bodies.
9385061|a|Biochemical studies of amyloidoses have been plagued by the sparing solubility of most amyloids in denaturant solvents. Consequently often only a subclass of amyloid protein is analyzed, a fact that is omitted in most studies. This means that there is often no evaluation of the chemical basis for amyloid insolubility, a factor that may provide valuable information concerning amyloid pathogenesis. We have devised a protocol to quantitatively evaluate the solubilization of insoluble amyloid proteins. Specifically, we use protein extraction and reduction in the volume of insoluble material as quantitative assays to establish solvents that dissolve all protein. Here we describe the application of this protocol to quantitatively establish complete solubilization of the paired helical filaments (PHFs) from Alzheimer disease. PHFs are distinct from the other amyloid that defines Alzheimer disease (AD), i.e., extracellular amyloid-beta deposits of senile plaques, nonetheless, PHFs share all the properties of, and are defined as, an amyloid, i.e., binding Congo red; beta-pleated sheet conformation and, most significantly, sparing solubility. PHFs of neurofibrillary tangles are the most striking intraneuronal change seen within the brains of patients with AD. Despite intense efforts to understand the molecular composition of this amyloid, quantitative biochemical analyses have been severely hampered by the extreme insolubility of PHF and by difficulties obtaining a homogeneous PHF fraction. Therefore, to date, all of the published studies on the biochemical composition of insoluble PHFs (SDS-insoluble) are qualitative and have provided little or no quantitative data on the proportion of material assayed. Using the solubilization protocol described herein, we found that only high pH was effective in solubilizing PHF while a variety of denaturants and chaotropes resulted in only partial release of component protein. Significantly, the approach is analytical because it allows direct assessment of the significance of two posttranslational modifications in mediating PHF insolubility, i.e., phosphorylation and glycation. Further this protocol provides solubilized protein that can be readily characterized. For example, coupling the method to immunoblotting, ELISA, microsequencing or other analytical techniques would identify components as well as provide a quantitative measure.
