32741833|t|The Iron Chelator Deferiprone Improves the Phenotype in a Mouse Model of Tauopathy.
32741833|a|BACKGROUND: Abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau is a defining pathological feature of tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and accumulating evidence suggests a role for iron in mediating tau pathology that may lead to cognitive decline in these conditions. The metal chelator deferiprone (DFP), which has a high affinity for iron, is currently in clinical trials for AD and Parkinson's disease. However, the effect of DFP on tau pathology remains underexplored. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the impact of chronic DFP treatment on tau pathology using a well-characterized mouse model of tauopathy (rTg(tauP301L)4510). METHODS: Animals were treated daily with DFP (100 mg/kg) via oral gavage for 16 weeks. After 14 weeks, mice were tested in the Y-maze, open field, Morris water maze, and rotorod. At the end of the study, brain tissue was collected to examine metal levels (using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry) and for western blot analysis of DFP on tau and iron associated pathways. RESULTS: DFP significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior, and revealed a trend toward improved cognitive function. This was accompanied by a decrease in brain iron levels and sarkosyl-insoluble tau. Our data also showed downregulation of the tau kinases glycogen synthase kinase 3beta and cyclin dependent kinase-5 in DFP treated mice and an increase in the methylation of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that suggests that iron plays a neurotoxic role in tauopathies and may be a potential therapeutic target for this class of disorders.
