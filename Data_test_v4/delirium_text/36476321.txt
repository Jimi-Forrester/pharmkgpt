36476321|a|BACKGROUND: To investigate functional changes in brain resting-state networks (RSNs) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) and their correlations with sleep breathing disorders and neurocognitive performance. METHODS: In this study, 18 OSAHS patients and 18 matched healthy controls underwent neurocognitive assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Group-level independent component analysis (ICA) and statistical analyses were used to explore between-group differences in RSNs and the relationship between functional changes in RSNs, sleep breathing disorders and neurocognitive performance. RESULTS: The OSAHS patients performed worse on neuropsychological tests than the healthy controls. Eight RSNs were identified, and between-group analyses showed that OSAHS patients displayed significantly decreased functional connectivity in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri (PCC) within the default mode network (DMN), the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) within the dorsal attention network (DAN), and the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) within the ventral attention network (VAN), and increased functional connectivity in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) within the salience network (SN). Further correlation analyses revealed that the average ICA z-scores in the bilateral PCC were correlated with sleep breathing disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that the DMN, SN, DAN, and VAN are impaired during the resting state and are associated with decreased functionally distinct aspects of cognition in patients with OSAHS. Moreover, the intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation caused by OSAHS are likely to be the main influencing factors.
