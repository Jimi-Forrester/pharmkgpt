35499026|a|The nutritional quality and bioactive potential of breads made with partial replacement of refined wheat flour (RWF) with 30% or 45% refined buckwheat flour (RBF) or whole buckwheat flour (WGBF) was assessed through mineral bioaccessibility, starch digestibility, dietary fiber content and bioactive potential by determining rutin and quercetin levels during processing. Moreover, technological quality and sensory acceptance were also evaluated. Breads made with 30% or 45% WGBF showed higher mineral and fiber contents compared to the control, while the formulations with RBF showed higher bioaccessibility. No changes were observed in the rutin levels of the dough before and after fermentation, but after baking, rutin and quercetin levels increased. The highest starch hydrolysis was found in the formulation containing 45% RBF. The formulations made with 30% RBF or 30% WGBF were well accepted by consumers. Our study shows interesting results, as few studies report the effect of processing on bioactive compounds.
