30610591|a|Soluble amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers are the most common forms of Abeta in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). They are highly toxic to the neurons but their capability to activate microglia remains controversial. Microglia develop two distinct phenotypes, classic (M1) and alternative (M2). Tuning of microglia to the alternative (anti-inflammatory) state is of major interest in treatment of neuroinflammatory disease. This study aimed to assess tuning the microglia to produce interferon beta (IFN-beta) as an anti-inflammatory cytokine through TLR4 pathway in a rat model of AD. Microglial BV-2 cells were treated with 1 mug/ml lipopolysaccharides (LPS), Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), or vehicles for 24 h, and then incubated with Abeta oligomer. After 24 h, cell pellets were harvested and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and IFN-beta levels were measured. The ligands/vehicle were microinjected into the right ventricle of male Wistar rats every 3 days. Two weeks later, an osmotic pump filled with oligomeric Abeta/vehicle was implanted in the left ventricle. After 2 weeks, TRIF, IRF3, and IFN-beta levels were measured in the hippocampal tissue. TNF-alpha and IFN-beta levels were assessed in the hippocampus using immunohistochemistry. The oligomeric Abeta did not change TRIF, IRF3, and IFN-beta levels in both cell culture and hippocampal tissue. However, pretreatment with LPS or MPL increased the level of these proteins. BV-2 cells morphologically express M1 state in presence of higher dose of Abeta oligomer (10 muM). Pretreatment with LPS or MPL decreased the TNF-alpha and increased the number of IFN-beta positive cells in the hippocampus of Abeta-treated rats. In conclusion, pretreatment with low dose TLR4 agonists could induce microglia to produce neuroprotective cytokines including IFN-beta which may be considered as a potential strategy to combat neuronal degeneration in AD.
