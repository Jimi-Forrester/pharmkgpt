36120593|t|The Effect of Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) Add-On Treatment on Inflammatory, Oxidative Stress, Lipid, and Biochemical Parameters in the Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients: Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Study.
36120593|a|Methods: Sixty patients with a mean age of 68.60 +- 2.10 comprising 29 females (48.33%), who were admitted to an academic tertiary care facility within the first 12 hours poststroke symptoms onset or last known well (LKW), in case symptom onset time is not clear, were included in this study. AIS was confirmed based on a noncontrast head CT scan and also neurological symptoms. Patients were randomly and blindly assigned to OEA of 300 mg/day (n = 20) or 600 mg/day (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) in addition to the standard AIS treatment for three days. A blood sample was drawn at 12 hours from symptoms onset or LKW as the baseline followed by the second blood sample at 72 hours post symptoms onset or LKW. Blood samples were assessed for inflammatory and biochemical parameters, oxidative stress (OS) biomarkers, and lipid profile. Results: Compared to the baseline, there is a significant reduction in the urea, creatinine, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, cholesterol, alanine transaminase, total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde (MDA), total thiol groups (TTG), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein levels on the follow-up blood testing in the OEA (300 mg/day) group. In patients receiving OEA (600 mg/day) treatment, there was only a significant reduction in the MDA level comparing baseline with follow-up blood testing. Also, the between-group analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between patients receiving OEA (300 mg/day) and placebo in terms of IL-6 and TTG level reduction when comparing them between baseline and follow-up blood testing. Conclusion: OEA in moderate dosage, 300 mg/day, add-on to the standard stroke treatment improves short-term inflammatory, OS, lipid, and biochemical parameters in patients with AIS. This effect might lead to a better long-term neurological prognosis.
