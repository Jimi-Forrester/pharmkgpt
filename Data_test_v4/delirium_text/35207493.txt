35207493|t|Classification of Dystonia.
35207493|a|Dystonia is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by abnormal movement or posture caused by excessive muscle contraction. Because of its wide clinical spectrum, dystonia is often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. In clinical practice, dystonia could often present in association with other movement disorders. An accurate physical examination is essential to describe the correct phenomenology. To help clinicians reaching the proper diagnosis, several classifications of dystonia have been proposed. The current classification consists of axis I, clinical characteristics, and axis II, etiology. Through the application of this classification system, movement disorder specialists could attempt to correctly characterize dystonia and guide patients to the most effective treatment. The aim of this article is to describe the phenomenological spectrum of dystonia, the last approved dystonia classification, and new emerging knowledge.
