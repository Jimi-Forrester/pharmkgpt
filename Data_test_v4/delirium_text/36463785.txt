36463785|t|Integrated in silico and experimental discovery of trimeric peptide ligands targeting Butyrylcholinesterase.
36463785|a|Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is recognized as a high value biotherapeutic in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and drug addiction. This study presents the rational design and screening of an in-silico library of trimeric peptides against BChE and the experimental characterization of peptide ligands for purification. The selected peptides consistently afforded high BChE recovery (> 90 %) and purity, yielding up to a 1000-fold purification factor. This study revealed a marked anti-correlated conformational movement governed by the ionic strength and pH of the aqueous environment, which ultimately controls BChE binding and release during chromatographic purification; and highlighted the role of residues within and allosteric to the catalytic triad of BChE in determining biorecognition, thus providing useful guidance for ligand design and affinity maturation.
