33002308|t|l-Lactate Dehydrogenase Identified as a Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B Substrate by Using K-BIPS.
33002308|a|Kinases and phosphatases are major players in a variety of cellular events, including cell signaling. Aberrant activity or mutations in kinases and phosphatases can lead to diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. Compared to kinases, phosphatases are understudied; this is partly a result of the limited methods for identifying substrates. As a solution, we developed a proteomics-based method called kinase-catalyzed biotinylation to identify phosphatase substrates (K-BIPS) that previously identified substrates of Ser/Thr phosphatases using small molecule inhibitors. Here, for the first time, K-BIPS was applied to identify substrates of a tyrosine phosphatase, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), under siRNA knockdown conditions. Eight possible substrates of PTP1B were discovered in HEK293 cells, including the known substrate pyruvate kinase. In addition, l-lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) was validated as a novel PTP1B substrate. With the ability to use knockdown conditions with Ser/Thr or Tyr phosphatases, K-BIPS represents a general discovery tool to explore phosphatases biology by identifying unanticipated substrates.
