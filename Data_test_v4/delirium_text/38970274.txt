38970274|a|INTRODUCTION: Understanding longitudinal change in key plasma biomarkers will aid in detecting presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Serial plasma samples from 424 Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention participants were analyzed for phosphorylated-tau217 (p-tau217; ALZpath) and other AD biomarkers, to study longitudinal trajectories in relation to disease, health factors, and cognitive decline. Of the participants, 18.6% with known amyloid status were amyloid positive (A+); 97.2% were cognitively unimpaired (CU). RESULTS: In the CU, amyloid-negative (A-) subset, plasma p-tau217 levels increased modestly with age but were unaffected by body mass index and kidney function. In the whole sample, average p-tau217 change rates were higher in those who were A+ (e.g., simple slopes(se) for A+ and A- at age 60 were 0.232(0.028) and 0.038(0.013))). High baseline p-tau217 levels predicted faster preclinical cognitive decline. DISCUSSION: p-tau217 stands out among markers for its strong association with disease and cognitive decline, indicating its potential for early AD detection and monitoring progression. HIGHLIGHTS: Phosphorylated-tau217 (p-tau217) trajectories were significantly different in people who were known to be amyloid positive. Subtle age-related trajectories were seen for all the plasma markers in amyloid-negative cognitively unimpaired. Kidney function and body mass index were not associated with plasma p-tau217 trajectories. Higher plasma p-tau217 was associated with faster preclinical cognitive decline.
