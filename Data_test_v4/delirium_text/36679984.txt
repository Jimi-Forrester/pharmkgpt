36679984|t|Malaysian Women's Viewpoint on HPV Screening and Vaccination: A Study on Barriers.
36679984|a|Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in low-income countries and the third most common cancer in Malaysia among women aged 15 to 44. This is a huge concern because of the high mortality rate compared to other countries. Cervical cancer is caused by a common sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV). Of cervical cancer cases, 80% are attributed to serotypes 16 and 18; therefore, early detection of premalignant lesions and infections from these viruses is important. Diagnosis can be carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based HPV DNA analysis and Pap smear, which act as a viable preventive strategy. (1) Background: This study determined the adoption of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and the willingness to get vaccinated in Malaysian women. (2) Methods: An online survey was conducted with women from across Malaysia to gather their views on the barriers that prevent them from accessing HPV services. Sentiment analysis was performed to detect and classify the comments into three groups (positive, neutral, and negative). (3) Results: A total of 449 opinions were received, and the findings revealed that 41.3% were not afraid to be diagnosed early, and were prepared to accept positive or negative screening results. In addition, 18.6% of those surveyed indicated that they feared a Pap smear and were very concerned that they would not get good results. Of the respondents, 36% believed in vaccination and preferred to know more about it; 43.24% claimed that their family members were very supportive towards screening and vaccination; and 21.3% felt embarrassed and were afraid to undergo the screening procedure, as they had no prior experience and were unsure of how the procedure was conducted. In addition, 40.5% indicated that they had no concerns about HPV testing and related procedures, as this information is widely available. Only a few respondents (8.1%) talked about the time constraints and busy work schedules that prevented them from going to medical appointments. The survey also revealed that women are prevented from participating in cervical cancer screening and vaccination programs due to a lack of knowledge, shyness, personal rumors, privacy issues, financial issues, a lack of access to medical services, and ignorance and beliefs about rumors spreading online. (4) Conclusion: Results indicate that awareness of HPV and related prevention measures among women is vague and that negative perceptions continue to exist. It is strongly advised to develop a well-designed and knowledge-based application on the efficacy of screening and vaccination among Malaysian women.
