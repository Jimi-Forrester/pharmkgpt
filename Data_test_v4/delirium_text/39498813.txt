39498813|t|Anticholinergic Burden and Dry Mouth Problems Among Older Adults (>= 50 Years) Receiving Dental Care-A Retrospective, Cross-Sectional Analysis.
39498813|a|OBJECTIVES: Anticholinergics cause dry mouth and are highly relevant for dentists, but little is known about the relationships between intake and the occurrence of subjective and objective dry mouth with age. The German anticholinergic burden score (GACB) is a novel anticholinergic score that re-evaluates medications, particularly, those with classification discrepancies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the GACB in older patients receiving dental care, evaluated whether GACB is related to xerostomia and unstimulated salivary secretion, and determined the influence of increasing age (beginning at 50 years of age). The GACB score quantified cumulative anticholinergic effects: 0 for no effect, 1 for possible, 2 for moderate, and 3 for strong. Cross-sectional data in patients >= 50 years were collected, including xerostomia with the visual analog scale, unstimulated salivary flow rates, and the GACB scores. RESULTS: Among 172 patients (mean age 65.67 +- 9.51 years), 23.8% had a GACB score >= 1. A moderate negative correlation was observed between GACB and unstimulated salivary flow rates (   r   $ mathop{r} limits^{&#773;}$   = -0.51). Patients with GACB >= 1 had fewer teeth (mean 21.76 +- 5.41) than those with GACB = 0 (24.07 +- 5.57). Moreover, unstimulated hyposalivation was observed in 61.0% with GACB >= 1 versus 6.8% with GACB = 0 (p < 0.001). Escalating chronic systemic conditions and prescribed medications were recorded with increasing age; those aged 76-80 years had the highest burden. CONCLUSIONS: The GACB quickly and reliably assesses anticholinergic exposure and risks for oral health in older patients. Routine use in those aged >= 50 years could enable early identification of risks and initiation of preventive dental measures.
