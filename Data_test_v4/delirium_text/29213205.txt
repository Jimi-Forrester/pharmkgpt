29213205|t|Hypercapnic Ventilatory Response in the Weaning of Patients with Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation.
29213205|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether hypercapnic ventilatory response (defined as the ratio of the change in minute ventilation [[Formula: see text]] to the change in end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide [DeltaPETCO2 ]) is a predictor of successful weaning in patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) and to determine a reference value for clinical use. METHODS: A hypercapnic challenge test was performed on 32 PMV subjects (average age: 74.3 years +- 14.9 years). The subjects were divided into two groups (i.e., weaning successes and weaning failures) and their hypercapnic ventilatory responses were compared. RESULTS: PMV subjects had an overall weaning rate of 68.8%. The weaning-success and weaning-failure groups had hypercapnic ventilatory responses ([Formula: see text]) of 0.40 +- 0.16 and 0.28 +- 0.12 L/min/mmHg, respectively (P = .036). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.716 of the hypercapnic ventilatory response, and the practical hypercapnic ventilatory response cut-off point for successful weaning was 0.265 with 86.4% sensitivity and 50% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: PMV subjects who failed weaning had a lower hypercapnic ventilatory response than successfully weaned subjects. However, the prediction capacity of this test, assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, poorly predicted weaning outcome.
