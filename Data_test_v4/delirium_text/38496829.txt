38496829|t|Associations Between Self-Reported Visual and Hearing Functioning and Cognitive Function Among Hispanics/Latino: Hispanic Community Health Study.
38496829|a|Background and Objectives: To investigate the associations between self-reported visual functioning (VF) and hearing functioning with cognition in the Hispanic/Latino population. Research Design and Methods: We utilized data from the Miami Ocular Study of Latinos ancillary study to Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos with 1,056 participants aged 45 and older. The outcomes were cognitive performances assessed by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Word Fluency, Brief-Spanish English Verbal Learning Test-recall (B-SEVLT recall), words recalled over 3 trials, and the Six-Item Screener. VF was measured by National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ), and hearing function was measured by Hearing Handicap Inventory Screening Questionnaire for Adults and Elderly (HHIA/E-S). Multiple regressions were performed for each cognitive outcome while controlling for covariates and complex sampling design. Results: NEI-VFQ was associated with 3 of the 5 cognitive outcomes. A 4-point NEI-VFQ score difference was associated with a 0.56-point difference in DSST (standard error [SE] = 0.27, p < .001), 0.17 in Word fluency (SE = 0.16, p < .01), and 0.08 in B-SEVLT-recall (SE = 0.07, p < .01). HHIA/E-S was not associated with any of the cognitive measures examined. Discussion and Implications: These data suggest that impaired VF is associated with worse cognition in the Hispanic/Latino population. Although previous work in this cohort indicated hearing loss assessed by pure tone audiometry was associated with worse cognition, we found self-perceived hearing function was not associated with cognition, suggesting the potential limitation of self-reported hearing function as a proxy for hearing loss in epidemiological research in Hispanic/Latino populations. Results also imply impaired VF and hearing function may be linked to cognition differently in the Hispanic population, and more research is needed to better understand the underlying linking mechanisms. Visual and hearing impairments are common and treatable and represent important modifiable risk factors that can be treated to preserve cognitive function in Hispanics/Latinos.
