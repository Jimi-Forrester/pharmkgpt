34677562|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), as a neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by mass neuronal and synaptic loss and, currently, there are no successful curative therapies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are an emerging approach to intercellular communication via transferring cellular materials such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and miRNAs from parental cells to recipient cells, leading to the reprogramming of the molecular machinery. Numerous studies have suggested the therapeutic potential of EVs derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the treatment of AD, based on the neuroprotective, regenerative and immunomodulatory effects as effective as MSCs. In this review, we focus on the biology and function of EVs, the potential of MSC-derived EVs for AD therapy in preclinical and clinical studies, as well as the potent mechanisms of MSC-derived EVs actions. Finally, we highlight the modification strategies and diagnosis utilities in order to make advance in this field.
