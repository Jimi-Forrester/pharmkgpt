31787864|t|The Beta Amyloid Dysfunction (BAD) Hypothesis for Alzheimer's Disease.
31787864|a|Beta amyloid, Abeta 1-42, originally named as Amyloid A4 protein, is one of the most investigated peptides in neuroscience and has attracted substantial interest since its discovery as the main insoluble fibril-type protein in cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy (Glenner and Wong, 1984; Masters et al., 1985) of Alzheimer's disease (AD). From the very beginning, Abeta was regarded per se as a "bad molecule," triggering the so-called "beta amyloid cascade hypothesis" (Hardy and Higgins, 1992). This hypothesis ignored any physiological function for in situ generated Abeta monomer with normal production and turnover rate (Bateman et al., 2006). Accordingly, pan-Abeta-related therapeutic approaches were designed to eliminate or lower the three structural isoforms in parallel: (1) the pre-amyloid monomer, (2) the misfolded oligomer, and (3) the final fibril. While we already knew about poor correlations between plaques and cognitive decline quite early (Terry et al., 1991), data for an essential benign physiological role for Abeta monomer at low concentrations were also not considered to be relevant. Here, a different Beta Amyloid hypothesis is described, the so-called "Beta Amyloid Dysfunction hypothesis," which, in contrast to the "Beta Amyloid Cascade hypothesis," builds on the homeostasis of essential Abeta monomer in the synaptic vesicle cycle (SVC). Disease-relevant early pathology emerges through disturbance of the Abeta homeostasis by so far unknown factors leading to the formation of misfolded Abeta oligomers. These early species interfere with the synaptic physiological Abeta monomer regulation and exert their neurotoxicity via various receptors for sticky oligomer-type Abeta aggregates. The Beta Amyloid Dysfunction (BAD) hypothesis is introduced and shown to explain negative clinical results of Gamma-secretase and Beta-secretase (BACE) inhibitors as well as pan-Abeta isotype unselective immunotherapies. This hypothesis gives guidance to what needs to be done therapeutically to revive successful clinical testing in AD for this highly validated target. The BAD hypothesis will need further refinement in particular through more detailed exploration for the role of physiological Abeta monomer.
