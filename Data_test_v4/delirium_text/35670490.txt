35670490|a|BACKGROUND: Older adults comprise an increasing proportion of emergency general surgery (EGS) admissions and face high morbidity and mortality. We created a geriatric surgical service with geriatric and palliative expertise to mitigate risks of hospitalization most hazardous to older patients. We sought to identify geriatric surgical service interventions most relevant to EGS patients. METHODS: We prospectively identified patients >=75 years admitted to the EGS service at an urban tertiary care hospital from January 2020-March 2021 who screened positive for frailty (FRAIL score >=3 [scale 0-5, higher being worse]) or with cognitive impairment. A pilot geriatric surgical service, led by a dually-board certified geriatric and palliative care specialist, conducted a comprehensive geriatric assessment and modified Rockwood Frailty Index calculation for each eligible patient. Patient, hospital admission, and geriatric consultation characteristics were collected via chart review. RESULTS: Fifty consecutive patients (median age 82 years [IQR 78-90], 56% female) received geriatric consultation (median time 3 days [IQR 1-6] from admission). The most common admission diagnosis was bowel obstruction (32%). Sixty-four percent of patients underwent >=1 surgical procedure. Using the Frailty Index, 64% were moderately or severely frail. Interventions most frequently performed by the geriatric team included delirium prevention and management (66%), consideration of swallowing function (52%), individualized pain management (50%), and facilitation of serious illness conversations (58%). CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric service involvement addresses a high burden of both geriatric and palliative care needs in older EGS patients. Geriatric recommendations may direct interventions for surgical education in fundamental geriatric and palliative care knowledge to maximize geriatric resources for the most high-risk patients.
