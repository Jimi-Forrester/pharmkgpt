38865787|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological studies have shown that sleep disorders are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the causal relationship between sleep disorders and AD risk is unknown. We aim to assess the potential genetic causal association between sleep characteristics and AD, which may contribute to early identification and prediction of risk factors for AD. METHODS: Seven sleep-related traits and the outcome phenotype AD were selected from published genome-wide association studies (GWASs). These sleep-related characteristics and instrumental variables (IVs) for AD were extracted. Two-sample and multivariate Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to assess the causal relationships between sleep characteristics and AD. The inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median (WME), weighted mode (WM), MR-Egger regression (MR-Egger) and simple mode (SM) models were used to evaluate causality. The existence of pleiotropy was detected and corrected by MR-Egger regression, MR pleiotropy residuals and outliers. RESULTS: A two-sample MR study revealed a positive causal association between sleep duration and the onset of AD (OR = 1.002, 95 % CI: 1.000-1.004), and the risk of AD increased with increasing sleep duration. The MR-Egger regression method and MR-PRESSO were used to identify and correct pleiotropy, indicating that there was no horizontal pleiotropy. Heterogeneity was evaluated by Cochran's Q, which indicated no heterogeneity. In a multivariate MR study with seven sleep characteristics corrected for each other, we found that sleep duration remained causally associated with AD (OR = 1.004, 95 % CI: 1.000-1.007). Moreover, we found that after mutual correction, daytime napping had a causal relationship with the onset of AD, and daytime napping may reduce the risk of AD (OR = 0.995, 95 % CI: 0.991-1.000). CONCLUSION: This study is helpful for the early identification and prediction of risk factors for AD, long sleep durations are a risk factor for AD, and daytime napping can reduce the risk of AD.
