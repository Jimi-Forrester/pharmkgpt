34461609|a|BACKGROUND: N6 adenosine methylation (m6A) is the most abundant internal RNA modification in eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of m6A has been associated with the perturbations of cell proliferation and cell death in different diseases. However, the roles of m6A in the neurodegenerative process and cognitive dysfunction are unclear. METHODS: We systematically investigated the molecular alterations of m6A regulators and their clinical relevance with cognitive dysfunctions using published datasets of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). FINDINGS: The expressions of m6A regulators vary in different tissues and closely correlate with neurodegenerative pathways. We identified co-expressive m6A regulators SNRPG and SNRPD2 as potential biomarkers to predict transformation from MCI to AD. Moreover, we explored correlations between Apolipoprotein E4 and m6A methylations. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, these findings suggest that m6A methylations as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cognitive dysfunction.
