Because of the lack of proper tools, however, there have been very few studies on how the amount of Abeta42 affects the physical properties of exosomes. To answer the question, we investigated the physical properties of exosomes secreted by neuroblastoma by probing individual exosomes using electrostatic force microscopy. Interestingly, we observed that when the higher concentration of Abeta42 oligomers was fed to cells, the higher surface charge of the exosomes appeared. This result indicates that the exosomes contain more Abeta42 with the increase in Abeta42 concentration in cell media, implying that they serve as transport vesicles for Abeta42. Our approach could help to better understand how the neuronal exosomes are related to the propagation of neurodegenerative diseases and to seek how to make an early diagnosis of those diseases.
