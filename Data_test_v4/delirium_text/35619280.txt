35619280|a|The increasing morbidness of brain disorders and conditions, such as anxiety, stress, depression, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and others, have become severe. Although researchers have spent a significant amount of time examining these diseases and providing many benefits, there are still limited drugs available to treat these disorders. Eugenol, a dietary component present in numerous plants and herbs, possesses various health benefits. In various preclinical studies, eugenol has provided significant protective effects against a variety of brain disorders. Thus, including eugenol in the diet can fight various diseases and ensure a healthy life. Considering the fruitful impact of this compound, this review focuses on the brain disorders in which eugenol was used, and summarizes the beneficial properties of eugenol and its role in treating various brain diseases.
