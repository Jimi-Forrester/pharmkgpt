34467660|a|Many lignicolous mushroom species are used as a food supplement and may represent an alternative treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to evaluate acetylcholinesterase inhibition (AChEI) of Stereum hirsutum together with antioxidant activity (AO) and cytotoxic activity against HepG2 cells. Different extracts (water, ethanol, methanol, polysaccharide) were analyzed, with respect to their mineral composition and chemical content. Ethanol extract was the most potent in AChEI (98.44 %) and demonstrated cytotoxic activity (91.96 % at 900.00 mug/mL), while the highest AO was demonstrated for polar extracts (methanol and water) as well. These activities may be attributed to determined phenolics (hydroxybenzoic and quinic acid) and fatty acids (FA), while biflavonoid amentoflavone may be responsible for cytotoxic activity. The most prevalent FA was linoleic (40.00 %) and the domination of unsaturated FA (UFA) (71.91 %) over saturated (26.96 %) was observed. This is the first report of AChEI of S. hirsutum extracts and first detection of amentoflavone. Due to high amount of UFA and well-expressed AChEI, this species can be considered as a potent food supplement in the palliative therapy of AD.
