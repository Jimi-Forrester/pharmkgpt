38312528|t|Usability, Appeal, and Relevance of Music and Wellbeing Training for Carers of People with Dementia: A Think-Aloud Study.
38312528|a|Background: Personalized music listening can be highly effective in supporting people experiencing changes in mood and behavior due to Alzheimer's disease and other conditions causing dementia. However, a lack of staff education can be a barrier to effective use of music in residential aged care. Objective: This study investigates the usability, appeal and relevance of an online training course designed to help care staff develop personalized music programs for people living with dementia in their care. Methods: A mixed methods approach was taken in which 13 participants took part in a think-aloud session while using the training. Qualitative data from the think-aloud session and interviews were triangulated with results of a survey evaluation of the training. Results: Themes relating to Engagement, Usability and Appeal, Pedagogical Design and Content, and Transfer, Impact and Barriers to Uptake were discussed. Results indicated that participants regarded the virtual environment and pedagogical design as of high quality, although some minor issues in navigability were identified. Participants also found the training to be highly relevant to their roles as caregivers and reported ways they would incorporate key concepts into care practices. However, ongoing barriers to implementation of such training were identified including systemic issues that contribute to a culture of focus on physical care. Conclusions: Consistency of navigation and clear instructions for interacting with content are important in training of time-poor care staff. Linking training to industry standards can provide important motivation for implementation of training, although systemic barriers can impede real-world change.
