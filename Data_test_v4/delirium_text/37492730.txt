37492730|t|Hydrogen sulfide-induced post-translational modification as a potential drug target.
37492730|a|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is one of the three known gas signal transducers, and since its potential physiological role was reported, the literature on H2S has been increasing. H2S is involved in processes such as vasodilation, neurotransmission, angiogenesis, inflammation, and the prevention of ischemia-reperfusion injury, and its mechanism remains to be further studied. At present, the role of post-translational processing of proteins has been considered as a possible mechanism for the involvement of H2S in a variety of physiological processes. Current studies have shown that H2S is involved in S-sulfhydration, phosphorylation, and S-nitrosylation of proteins, etc. This paper focuses on the effects of protein modification involving H2S on physiological and pathological processes, looking forward to providing guidance for subsequent research.
