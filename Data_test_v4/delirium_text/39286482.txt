39286482|t|KIT-13, a novel plasmalogen derivative, attenuates neuroinflammation and amplifies cognition.
39286482|a|Plasmalogens (Pls) are specialized phospholipids integral to brain health, whose decline due to aging and stress contributes to cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation. This study explores the potential of a novel Pls derivative, KIT-13 (1-O-octadecyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoethanolamine), in mitigating neuroinflammation and enhancing cognition. When administered to mice, KIT-13 exhibited potent memory enhancement attributed to upregulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a key player in cognitive processes. In vitro experiments with neuronal cells revealed KIT-13's ability to induce robust cellular signaling, surpassing natural plasmalogens. KIT-13 also promoted neurogenesis and inhibited apoptosis of neuronal-like cells, highlighting its potential in fostering neuronal growth and plasticity. Additionally, KIT-13 treatments reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and attenuated glial activation in the brain. KIT-13's superior efficacy over natural Pls positions it as a promising therapeutic candidate for neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, characterized by cognitive decline and neuroinflammation. This study presents KIT-13 as an innovative approach for addressing cognitive impairment and neuroinflammatory pathologies.
