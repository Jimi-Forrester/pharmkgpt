37498507|t|Update on the management of elderly patients with colorectal cancer.
37498507|a|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common tumours worldwide, and 70% of CRC patients are over 65 years of age. However, the scientific evidence available for these patients is poor, as they are underrepresented in clinical trials. Therefore, a group of experts from the Oncogeriatrics Section of the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (SEOM), the Spanish Cooperative Group for the Treatment of Digestive Tumours, (TTD) and the Multidisciplinary Spanish Group of Digestive Cancer (GEMCAD) have reviewed the scientific evidence available in older patients with CRC. This group of experts recommends a multidisciplinary approach and geriatric assessment (GA) before making a therapeutic decision because GA predicts the risk of toxicity and survival and helps to individualize treatment. In addition, elderly patients with localized CRC should undergo standard cancer resection, preferably laparoscopically. The indication for adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) should be considered based on the potential benefit, the risk of recurrence, the life expectancy and patient comorbidities. When the disease is metastatic, the possibility of radical treatment with surgery, radiofrequency (RF) or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) should be considered. The efficacy of palliative CT is similar to that seen in younger patients, but elderly patients are at increased risk of toxicity. Clinical trials should be conducted with the elderly population and include GAs and specific treatment plans.
