39316465|t|Discovery of VU6016235: A Highly Selective, Orally Bioavailable, and Structurally Distinct Tricyclic M4 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor Positive Allosteric Modulator (PAM).
39316465|a|Herein, we report structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies to develop novel tricyclic M4 PAM scaffolds with improved pharmacological properties. This endeavor involved a "tie-back" strategy to replace a 5-amino-2,4-dimethylthieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxamide core, which led to the discovery of two novel tricyclic cores. While both tricyclic cores displayed low nanomolar potency against both human and rat M4 and were highly brain-penetrant, the 2,4-dimethylpyrido[4',3':4,5]thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine tricycle core provided lead compound, VU6016235, with an overall superior pharmacological and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) profile, as well as efficacy in a preclinical antipsychotic animal model.
