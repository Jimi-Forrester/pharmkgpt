35534717|t|A brief history of brain iron accumulation in Parkinson disease and related disorders.
35534717|a|Iron has a long and storied history in Parkinson disease and related disorders. This essential micronutrient is critical for normal brain function, but abnormal brain iron accumulation has been associated with extrapyramidal disease for a century. Precisely why, how, and when iron is implicated in neuronal death remains the subject of investigation. In this article, we review the history of iron in movement disorders, from the first observations in the early twentieth century to recent efforts that view extrapyramidal iron as a novel therapeutic target and diagnostic indicator.
