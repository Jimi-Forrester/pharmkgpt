39696753|t|Fundamental Neurochemistry Review: Lipids across microglial states.
39696753|a|The capacity of immune cells to alter their function based on their metabolism is the basis of the emerging field of immunometabolism. Microglia are the resident innate immune cells of the central nervous system, and it is a current focus of the field to investigate how alterations in their metabolism impact these cells. Microglia have the ability to utilize lipids, such as fatty acids, as energy sources, but also alterations in lipids can impact microglial form and function. Recent studies highlighting different microglial states and transcriptional signatures have highlighted modifications in lipid processing as defining these states. This review highlights these recent studies and uses these altered pathways to discuss the current understanding of lipid biology in microglia. The studies highlighted here review how lipids may alter microglial phagocytic functioning or alter their pro- and anti-inflammatory balance. These studies provide a foundation by which lipid supplementation or diet alterations could influence microglial states and function. Furthermore, targets modulating microglial lipid metabolism may provide new treatment avenues.
