33619316|a|A deeper understanding of the causal links from education level to health outcomes may shed a light for disease prevention. In the present Mendelian randomization study, we found that genetically higher education level was associated with lower risk of major mental disorders and most somatic diseases, independent of intelligence. Higher education level adjusted for intelligence was associated with lower risk of suicide attempts, insomnia, major depressive disorder, heart failure, stroke, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, breast cancer, type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis but with higher risk of obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, anxiety, bipolar disorder and prostate cancer. Higher education level was associated with reduced obesity and smoking, which mediated quite an extent of the associations between education level and health outcomes. These findings emphasize the importance of education to reduce the burden of common diseases.
