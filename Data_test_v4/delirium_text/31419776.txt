31419776|a|Facing the complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is now currently admitted that a therapeutic pleiotropic intervention is needed to alter its progression. Among the major hallmarks of the disease, the amyloid pathology and the oxidative stress are closely related. We propose in this study to develop original Multi-Target Directed Ligands (MTDL) able to impact at the same time Abeta protein accumulation and toxicity of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in neuronal cells. Such MTDL were obtained by linking on a central piperidine two scaffolds of interest: a typical aminochlorobenzophenone present in numerous 5-HT4R agonists, and diverse antioxidant chemotypes. Interestingly, the most active compound 9g possesses a Ki of 12.7 nM towards 5-HT4R and an antioxidant activity in vitro and in cellulo.
