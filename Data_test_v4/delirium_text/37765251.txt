37765251|t|Elucidating Berberine's Therapeutic and Photosensitizer Potential through Nanomedicine Tools.
37765251|a|Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from plants of the Berberidaceae family, has been gaining interest due to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, as well as neuro and cardiovascular protective effects in animal models. Recently, photodynamic therapy demonstrated successful application in many fields of medicine. This innovative, non-invasive treatment modality requires a photosensitizer, light, and oxygen. In particular, the photosensitizer can selectively accumulate in diseased tissues without damaging healthy cells. Berberine's physicochemical properties allow its use as a photosensitising agent for photodynamic therapy, enabling reactive oxygen species production and thus potentiating treatment efficacy. However, berberine exhibits poor aqueous solubility, low oral bioavailability, poor cellular permeability, and poor gastrointestinal absorption that hamper its therapeutic and photodynamic efficacy. Nanotechnology has been used to minimize berberine's limitations with the design of drug delivery systems. Different nanoparticulate delivery systems for berberine have been used, as lipid-, inorganic- and polymeric-based nanoparticles. These berberine nanocarriers improve its therapeutic properties and photodynamic potential. More specifically, they extend its half-life, increase solubility, and allow a high permeation and targeted delivery. This review describes different nano strategies designed for berberine delivery as well as berberine's potential as a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy. To benefit from berberine's overall potential, nanotechnology has been applied for berberine-mediated photodynamic therapy.
