37327228|t|Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol conserves cardiovascular functions in a rat model of endotoxemia: Involvement of endothelial molecular mechanisms and oxidative-nitrative stress.
37327228|a|In endotoxemic models, the inflammatory parameters are altered to a favorable direction as a response to activation of cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2. The phytocannabinoid Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is an agonist/partial antagonist of both cannabinoid receptors. This report targets the effects of THC on the cardiovascular system of endotoxemic rats. In our 24-hour endotoxemic rat model (E. coli derived lipopolysaccharide, LPS i.v. 5mg/kg) with THC treatment (LPS+THC 10 mg/kg i.p.), we investigated cardiac function by echocariography and endothelium-dependent relaxation of the thoracic aorta by isometric force measurement compared to vehicle controls. To evaluate the molecular mechanism, we measured endothelial NOS and COX-2 density by immunohistochemistry; and determined the levels of cGMP, the oxidative stress marker 4-hydroxynonenal, the nitrative stress marker 3-nitrotyrosine, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymers. A decrease in end-systolic and end-diastolic ventricular volumes in the LPS group was observed, which was absent in LPS+THC animals. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was worsened by LPS but not in the LPS+THC group. LPS administration decreased the abundance of cannabinoid receptors. Oxidative-nitrative stress markers showed an increment, and cGMP, eNOS staining showed a decrement in response to LPS. THC only decreased the oxidative-nitrative stress but had no effect on cGMP and eNOS density. COX-2 staining was reduced by THC. We hypothesize that the reduced diastolic filling in the LPS group is a consequence of vascular dysfunction, preventable by THC. The mechanism of action of THC is not based on its local effect on aortic NO homeostasis. The reduced oxidative-nitrative stress and the COX-2 suggest the activation of an anti-inflammatory pathway.
