34419572|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, the exact etiology of the disease has not been known yet. The use of single-target drugs limits the efficacy of drugs and has certain side effects. In this study, the 'hidden' multi-target strategy was used in combination with chrysin's metal chelating site and rivastigmine's anti-cholinesterase pharmacophore to form an ester, which improves the hydrophobicity and protects the phenolic hydroxyl group at the same time. Four derivatives (1-4) were synthesized as the hidden multifunctional agents for AD therapy. Most of the compounds displayed good activities of anti-cholinesterase, antioxidant, appropriate blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration and certain inhibitory activity of beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation. Compound 3 was demonstrated as the highest selective butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitor and targeted both the catalytic active site (CAS) and the peripheral anion site (PAS). And it could be hydrolyzed by BuChE to release chrysin with good ability to chelate Cu2+ and Fe2+. At the same time, phenol fragment can exert its good antioxidant effect. Overall, these findings demonstrated that compound 3 might be considered as a potential hidden multifunctional candidate in the therapy of AD.
