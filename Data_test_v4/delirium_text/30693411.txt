30693411|a|PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence and characteristics of motor cortex hypointensity on 3-T susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) in patients with cognitive impairment and examine its clinical significance. METHODS: The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the requirement for informed consent. A total of 127 patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 32) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 95) and 127 age- and sex-matched control subjects underwent 3-T brain magnetic resonance imaging. SWI was analyzed for both subjective visual scoring and the quantitative estimation of phase shift in the posterior bank of the motor cortex. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify clinical and imaging variables associated with motor cortex hypointensity on SWI. RESULTS: Motor cortex hypointensity on SWI was observed in 94/127 cognitively impaired patients (74.0%) and 72/127 control subjects (56.7%) (p = 0.004). Age was the only variable that was significantly associated with motor cortex hypointensity in patients with cognitive impairment (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.065-1.242; p < 0.001). The quantitative analysis confirmed a significant increase in phase shifting in the posterior bank of the motor cortex in patients with positive motor cortex hypointensity on SWI (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Motor cortex hypointensity on SWI was more frequently found in patients with cognitive impairment than in age-matched controls and was positively associated with age. Thus, it may be a potential imaging marker of iron accumulation in patients with MCI or AD.
