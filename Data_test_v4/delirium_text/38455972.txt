38455972|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease often associated with olfactory dysfunction. Abeta is a typical AD hall marker, but Abeta-induced molecular alterations in olfactory memory remain unclear. In this study, we used a 5xFAD mouse model to investigate Abeta-induced olfactory changes. Results showed that 4-month-old 5xFAD have olfactory memory impairment accompanied by piriform cortex neuron activity decline and no sound or working memory impairment. In addition, synapse and glia functional alteration is consistent across different ages at the proteomic level. Microglia and astrocyte specific proteins showed strong interactions in the conserved co-expression network module. Moreover, this interaction declines only in mild cognitive impairment patients in human postmortem brain proteomic data. This suggests that astrocytes-microglia interaction may play a leading role in the early stage of Abeta-induced olfactory memory impairment, and the decreasing of their synergy may accelerate the neurodegeneration.
