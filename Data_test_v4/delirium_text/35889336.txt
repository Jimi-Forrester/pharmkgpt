35889336|t|A Novel Based-Network Strategy to Identify Phytochemicals from Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae (Danshen) for Treating Alzheimer's Disease.
35889336|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disease that strikes millions worldwide. Herein, we demonstrate a new approach based on network target to identify anti-AD compounds from Danshen. Network pharmacology and molecular docking were employed to establish the DS-AD network, which mainly involved apoptosis of neuron cells. Then network scoring was confirmed via Connectivity Map analysis. M308 (Danshenxinkun D) was an anti-AD candidate with a high score (p < 0.01). Furthermore, we conducted ex vivo experiments with H2O2-treated PC12 cells to verify the neuroprotective effect of Salvia miltiorrhiza-containing plasma (SMP), and UPLC-Q-TOF/MS and RT-qPCR were performed to demonstrate the anti-AD activity of M308 from SMP. Results revealed that SMP could enhance cell viability and level of acetylcholine. AO/EB staining and Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) analysis showed that SMP significantly suppressed apoptosis, which may be due to anti-oxidative stress activity. Moreover, the effects of M308 and SMP on expressions of PSEN1, DRD2, and APP mRNA were consistent, and M308 can significantly reverse the expression of PSEN1 and DRD2 mRNA in H2O2-treated PC12 cells. The strategy based on the network could be employed to identify anti-AD compounds from Chinese herbs. Notably, M308 stands out as a promising anti-AD candidate for development.
