38380761|t|Association between perioperative self-reported sleep disturbances and delirium risk in elderly patients following total joint arthroplasty: a cohort study.
38380761|a|Perioperative sleep disturbance may increase delirium risk. However, the role of perioperative sleep disturbance in delirium following total joint arthroplasty remains unclear. This prospective cohort study aimed to observe the delirium risk in patients with sleep disturbances. After excluding pre-existing sleep disturbances, older patients scheduled for total joint arthroplasty from July 17, 2022, to January 12, 2023, were recruited. Preoperative sleep disturbance or postoperative sleep disturbance was defined as a Chinese version of the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) score of <50 during hospitalisation. A cut-off score of 25 was used to classify the severity of sleep disturbance. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium. In all, 11.6% of cohort patients (34/294) developed delirium. After multivariate analysis, a preoperative Day 1 RCSQ score of <=25 (odds ratio [OR] 3.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-10.92; p = 0.02), occurrence of sleep disturbances (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.19-6.38; p = 0.02) and RCSQ score of <=25(OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.33-6.37; p = 0.007) postoperatively were strong independent predictors of delirium. After sensitivity analysis for daily delirium, a postoperative Day 1 RCSQ score of <=25 (OR 9.27, 95% CI 2.72-36.15; p < 0.001) was associated with a greater risk of delirium on postoperative Day 1, with a reasonable discriminative area under the curve of 0.730. We concluded that postoperative but not preoperative sleep disturbances may be an independent factor for delirium risk. Sleep disturbance on the first night after surgery was a good predictor of subsequent delirium, no matter the nature of self-reported sleep disturbance.
