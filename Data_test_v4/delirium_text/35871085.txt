35871085|a|This study aimed to evaluate the association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cognitive impairment and explore the effect modification by the inflammatory status. A total of 4400 community-based participants aged 50-64 years from the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Etiology Research Center were included in this cross-sectional study. NAFLD was identified as the Fatty Liver Index 30 or higher in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption. Cognitive impairment was defined as the total score of the Mini-Mental State Examination (cutoff 24). The inflammatory status was evaluated using white blood cell (WBC) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Stratified analyses by the WBC count (the highest quartile) and the hsCRP level (>= 1.0 mg/dL vs. < 1.0 mg/dL) were conducted. Participants with NAFLD showed an increased prevalence of cognitive impairment (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-1.52) compared with the non-NAFLD population. In women, this association was significantly stronger in the highest quartile WBC group than in lower WBC group (OR = 1.81; 95% CI = 1.19-2.74 vs. OR = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.78-1.33, p-interaction = 0.05). NAFLD was positively associated with a higher proportion of cognitive impairment, and this association was stronger in women with higher inflammatory status.
