37035120|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neuronal loss, cognitive disorder, and memory decline. Leptin has been reported to have a neuroprotective effect on neurodegenerative diseases. Objective: Our aim was to investigate whether intraperitoneal injection of leptin has a neuroprotective effect and to explore its underlying mechanisms in the AD mouse model. Methods: Abeta1-42 was injected into male C57BL/6J mice to construct an AD mouse model, and leptin was injected intraperitoneally to cure AD. The Morris water maze test was used to investigate spatial learning ability. Neuronal loss was tested by tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the hippocampus, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay was applied to detect neuronal apoptosis. Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were monitored by RT-PCR and western blotting was selected to explore which signaling pathway leptin acted on. Results: Leptin ameliorated spatial learning impairment, restored neuronal loss and apoptosis, and inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by activating the p-Akt signaling pathway in Abeta1-42-induced AD mice. Conclusion: Leptin ameliorates Abeta1-42-induced AD by suppressing inflammation via activating the p-Akt signaling pathway.
