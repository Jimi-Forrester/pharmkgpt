37226921|t|Factors Associated With Function-Focused Care Among Hospitalized Older Adults Living With Dementia.
37226921|a|This article reports a study that was designed to describe the incidence of pain among older hospitalized patients with dementia and to evaluate the factors that influence pain among these individuals. It was hypothesized that function, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, delirium, pain treatment, and patient exposure to care interventions would be associated with pain. Patients who performed more functional activities had less delirium. They also experienced higher quality-of-care interactions and were less likely to have pain. The findings from this study support the relationship between function, delirium, and quality-of-care interactions and pain. It suggests that it may be useful to encourage patients with dementia to engage in functional and physical activity to prevent or manage pain. This study serves as a reminder to avoid neutral or negative care interactions among patients with dementia as a strategy to mediate delirium and pain.
