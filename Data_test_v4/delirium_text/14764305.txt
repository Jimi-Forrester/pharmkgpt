14764305|a|Psychosocial treatment was studied on improving socially non integrated behavior and in containing cognitive-behavioral degeneration in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The hypothesis was that patients who do not maintain social relationships decline in their psycho-social and psycho-cognitive behavior more rapidly and that intervention helps to attain the above mentioned objectives (18 patients in day care center). All subjects had to perform the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory and the Cornell Depression Scale at the beginning of the study and were tested again after 1.5 years. The results of the group of Alzheimer patients showed a significant difference in the CMAI Scale (P<0.01) and sub-scales and in the Cornell Scale (0.014). In conclusion, the usefulness of the center is fundamental in encouraging the maintenance of significant relationships and helping patients adapt to their disease.
