39244025|a|Postoperative delirium (POD), a common complication following surgery and anesthesia, is particularly prone to occur after reconstruction surgery in the oral and maxillofacial region. The occurrence of POD seriously affects the incidence of postoperative complications, the survival of free flaps, the length of hospital stays, and brings great pain to patients and their families, and even increases perioperative mortality. Currently, a large number of studies have reported on the risk factors for POD after oral and maxillofacial free-flap reconstruction. Multiple independent risk factors have been identified, including age, history of excessive alcohol consumption, and perioperative nutritional status. This review summarizes the relevant literature and hopes to provide insights for the prevention of POD in high-risk patients.
