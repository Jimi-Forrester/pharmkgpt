39115720|a|ABSTRACT: Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a life-threatening condition. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical characteristics, management, and complication rate of patients with CS admitted to a high-volume hospital in Italy. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical, echocardiographic, and laboratory data, therapeutic management, and outcomes of patients with CS admitted to the Policlinico Gemelli (Rome) between January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2023. We included 96 patients [median age 71 years, interquartile range 60-79; 65 (68%) males], of whom 49 patients (51%) presented CS secondary to acute myocardial infarction and 60 (63%) with a de novo presentation of CS. Dobutamine was the most frequently used inotrope and noradrenaline the most frequently used vasopressor (adopted in 56% and 82% of cases, respectively). Forty-five (47%) patients died during the hospitalization. Nonsurvivors were older and had a higher inflammatory burden at admission, elevated lactate levels, a greater increase in lactate levels, higher left ventricular filling pressures, and worse right ventricular function. C-reactive protein levels [odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.00-1.04), P = 0.027], lactate levels at admission (OR 3.49, 95% CI, 1.59-7.63, P = 0.02), and increase in lactate levels (OR 2.8, 95% CI, 1.37-5.75, P = 0.005) were independent predictors of in-hospital all-cause death. Our data contribute to the assessment of the regional variations in the management and outcomes of patients with CS. We observed a high mortality and complication rate. Lactate acidosis and C-reactive protein measured at admission may help in identifying patients at higher risk of adverse in-hospital outcomes.
