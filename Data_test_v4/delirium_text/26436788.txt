26436788|a|INTRODUCTION: Legionellosis is a multisystem bacterial disease, which causes pneumonia with high mortality in patients with comorbidity and admitted in intensive care units (ICU). OBJECTIVE: Determine predictors of mortality or ICU admission. METHODS: Retrospective follow-up of patients diagnosed with Legionella pneumophila pneumonia in Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de A Coruna. Period 2000-2013 (n=240). Analysis of multivariate logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: Mean age was 57.2+-15.4 years old, 88.3% were male. Average score of comorbidity (Charlson score) was 2.3+-2.3. There was a clear seasonal variation. Predominant symptoms were fever (92.5%), dry cough (38.1%) and dyspnea (33.9%). Creatinine clearance was lower than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in 29.7% and sodium<135 mEq/l in 58.3%. Admission to ICU rate was 16.3% and 10.8% needs mechanical ventilation. Inhospital mortality rate was 4.6%, rising to 23.1% in patients admitted to ICU. Variables associated to predict ICU admission were age (OR=0.96), liver disease (OR=7.13), dyspnea (OR=4.33), delirium (OR=5.86) and high levels of lactatedehydrogenase (OR=1.002). Variables associated with inhospital mortality were Charlson index (OR=1.70), mechanical ventilation (OR=31.44) and high levels of lactatedehydrogenase (OR=1.002). DISCUSSION: Younger patients with liver disease, dyspnea and confusion are more likely to be admitted to ICU. Comorbidity, mechanical ventilation and elevated LDH levels are associated with higher mortality rate.
