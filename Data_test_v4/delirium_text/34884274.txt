34884274|t|Dual Disorders in the Consultation Liaison Addiction Service: Gender Perspective and Quality of Life.
34884274|a|Dual disorders (DD) and gender differences comprise an area of considerable concern in patients with substance use disorder (SUD). This study aims to describe the presence of DD among patients with SUD admitted to a general hospital and attended by a consultation liaison addiction service (CLAS), in addition to assessing its association with addiction severity and quality of life from a gender perspective, between 1 January and 30 September 2020. The dual diagnosis screening interview (DDSI), the severity of dependence scale (SDS), and the WHO well-being index were used to evaluate the patients. In the overall sample, DD prevalence was 36.8%, (women: 53.8% vs. men: 32.7%, NS). In both genders the most prevalent DD was depression (33.8%, women: 46.2% vs. men: 30.9%, p = 0.296). Women presented more panic disorders (46.2% vs. 12.7%, p = 0.019) and generalized anxiety (38.5% vs. 10.9%, p = 0.049) than men. When DD was present, women had worse quality of life than men (21.7 vs. 50 points, p = 0.02). During lockdown period 77 patients were attended to and 13 had COVID-19 infection, with no differences in relation to sociodemographic and consumption history variables. The study confirms a high prevalence of DD among patients with SUD admitted to a general hospital for any pathology, and its being associated with worse quality of life, particularly in women.
