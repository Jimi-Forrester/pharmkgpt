34756839|a|OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the impact of a novel model of care called Geriatric Comanagement of Older Vascular surgery inpatients on clinical outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A pre-post study of geriatric comanagement, comparing prospectively recruited preintervention (February-October 2019) and prospectively recruited postintervention (January-December 2020) cohorts. Consecutively admitted vascular surgery patients age >=65 years at a tertiary academic hospital in Concord and with an expected length of stay (LOS) greater than 2 days were recruited. INTERVENTION: A comanagement model where a geriatrician was embedded within the vascular surgery team and delivered proactive comprehensive geriatric assessment based interventions. METHODS: Primary outcomes of incidence of hospital-acquired geriatric syndromes, delirium, and LOS were compared between groups using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Prespecified subgroup analysis was performed by frailty status. RESULTS: There were 150 patients in the preintervention group and 152 patients in the postintervention group. The postintervention group were more frail [66 (43.4%) vs 45 (30.0%)], urgently admitted [72 (47.4%) vs 56 (37.3%)], and nonoperatively managed [52 (34.2%) vs 33 (22.0%)]. These differences were attributed to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic during the postintervention phase. The postintervention group had fewer hospital-acquired geriatric syndromes [74 (48.7%) vs 97 (64.7%); P = .005] and reduced incident delirium [5 (3.3%) vs 15 (10.0%); P = .02], in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Cardiac [8 (5.3%) vs 30 (20.0%); P < .001] and infective complications [4 (2.6%) vs 12 (8.0%); P = .04] were also fewer. LOS was unchanged. Frail patients in the postintervention group experienced significantly fewer geriatric syndromes including delirium. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This is the first prospective study of inpatient geriatric comanagement for older vascular surgery patients. Reductions in hospital-acquired geriatric syndromes including delirium, and cardiac and infective complications were observed after implementing geriatric comanagement. These benefits were also demonstrated in the frail subgroup.
