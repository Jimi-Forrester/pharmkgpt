Our paper aimed to observe the effect of using transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on sleep quality and complications after surgery in patients undergoing selective video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients were divided into the TEAS group or the control group randomly. Thirty minutes of TEAS treatment was performed on TEAS group at the following time points: the first night before surgery, at the end of surgery, and before sleeping on the second and third nights after surgery. The Portable Sleep Monitor (PSM) was performed to determine the sleep quality of the two nights before the operation (Sleep preop 2 and Sleep preop 1) and the first and third night after surgery (Sleep POD 1 and Sleep POD 3). The visual analog scale (VAS) was performed to evaluate pain scores after surgery and the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) was used for evaluating subjective sleep quality. RESULTS: Participants in the TEAS group had a lower AIS score and higher sleep efficiency at each time point except Sleep preop 2. Participants in the TEAS group showed significantly higher proportion of each sleep stage during Sleep-preop 1, Sleep POD 1, and Sleep POD 3. Patients in the TEAS group had significantly lower VAS scores at 2, 4, and 6 h during the first 24 h after surgery. The incidence of nausea and vomiting and dizziness in the control group was statistically higher than in the TEAS group. CONCLUSION: Patients usually have sleep disturbances after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, such as decreased distribution of each sleep stage, lower sleep efficiency, and higher AIS score. Undergoing TEAS treatment perioperatively can improve sleep quality, and effectively promote the postoperative analgesic effect and alleviate postoperative complications.
