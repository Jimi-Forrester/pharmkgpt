19591660|t|Broadening our perspectives on ICU delirium risk factors.
19591660|a|ICU delirium is associated with poor patient outcome. Risk factor stratification is essential to the understanding, prevention and treatment of this disorder. Alcohol consumption, smoking and prior cognitive impairment appear strongly correlated with delirium risk. Several potentially modifiable associations deserve prospective study: these include administration of sedatives and opiates; multiple catheters; as well as minimizing physical restraints and enabling visitors.
