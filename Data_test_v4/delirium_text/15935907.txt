15935907|t|p-Aminobenzoic acid derivatives as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
15935907|a|Because Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a medical problem characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognition that is associated with a deficient cholinergic system, this work aims to evaluate some p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) derivatives as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in vitro, in continuation with our last studies. The assayed compounds are low toxic, simple-structured and low cost.
