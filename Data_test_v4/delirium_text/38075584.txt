38075584|a|As a stressor, cardiac surgery affects the physiology and psychology of patients, as well as their postoperative recovery. Patients tend to worry about cognitive deficiency, pain, discomfort, the risk of death, sleep, complications, and other factors, resulting in stress and anxiety. Moreover, serious adverse events, such as circulatory and respiratory dysfunction and infection, tend to occur after cardiac surgery and increase the economic burden on patients. Therefore, appropriate nursing interventions should be selected to strengthen patients' cognitive levels, compliance, and postoperative practices to accelerate their recovery, reduce complications, and shorten hospital stays so as to contribute to patients' lives and health.
