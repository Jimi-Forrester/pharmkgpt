37396786|a|Neurodegenerative disease-causing proteins such as alpha-synuclein, tau, and huntingtin are known to traverse across cells via exosomes, extracellular vesicles and tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). There seems to be good synergy between exosomes and TNTs in intercellular communication. Interestingly, many of the known major neurodegenerative proteins/proteolytic products are leaderless and are also reported to be secreted out of the cell via unconventional protein secretion. Such classes contain intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDRs) within them. The dynamic behavior of these proteins is due to their heterogenic conformations that is exhibited owing to various factors that occur inside the cells. The amino acid sequence along with the chemical modifications has implications on the functional roles of IDRs inside the cells. Proteins that form aggregates resulting in neurodegeneration become resistant to degradation by the processes of autophagy and proteasome system thus leading to Tunneling nanotubes, TNT formation. The proteins that traverse across TNTs may or may not be dependent on the autophagy machinery. It is not yet clear whether the conformation of the protein plays a crucial role in its transport from one cell to another without getting degraded. Although there is some experimental data, there are many grey areas which need to be revisited. This review provides a different perspective on the structural and functional aspects of these leaderless proteins that get secreted outside the cell. In this review, attention has been focused on the characteristic features that lead to aggregation of leaderless secretory proteins (from structural-functional aspect) with special emphasis on TNTs.
