37745659|a|Objective: To investigate the quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) features associated with a high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients with Dravet syndrome (DS). Methods: Patients with DS and healthy controls (HCs) who underwent EEG were included in the study. EEG signals were recorded using a 21 channel digital EEG system, and pre-processed data were analyzed to identify quantitative EEG features associated with a high SUDEP risk. To assess the risk of SUDEP, SUDEP-7 scores were used. Results: A total of 64 patients with DS [38 males and 26 females, aged: 128.51 +- 75.50 months (range: 23-380 months)], and 13 HCs [7 males and 6 females, aged: 95.46 +- 86.48 months (range: 13-263 months)] were included. For the absolute band power, the theta power was significantly higher in the high-SUDEP group than in the low-SUDEP group in the central brain region. For the relative band power, the theta power was also significantly higher in the high-SUDEP group than in the low-SUDEP group in the central and occipital brain regions. The alpha power was significantly lower in the high-SUDEP group than in the low-SUDEP group in the central and parietal brain regions. Conclusion: Patients with high SUDEP-7 scores have different EEG features from those with low SUDEP-7 scores, suggesting that EEG may be used as a biomarker of SUDEP in DS. Significance: Early intervention in patients with DS at a high risk of SUDEP can reduce mortality and morbidity. Patients with high theta band powers warrant high-level supervision.
