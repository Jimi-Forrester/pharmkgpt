11470959|a|Transgenic mouse models exist for the major neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although many of the mice do not completely replicate the human disease they are intended to model, they have provided insight into the mechanisms that underlie disease etiology. In the case of the Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis models, the mice have also provided a therapeutic testing ground for the testing of agents that have been shown to have considerable clinical promise.
