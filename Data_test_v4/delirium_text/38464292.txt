We topographically describe retinal perivascular amyloid plaque (AP) burden in subjects with normal or impaired cognition. Methods: Using scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, we quantified retinal peri-arteriolar and peri-venular curcumin-positive APs in the first, secondary and tertiary branches in twenty-eight subjects. Perivascular AP burden among cognitive states was correlated with neuroimaging and cognitive measures. Results: Peri-arteriolar exceeded peri-venular AP count (p<0.0001). Secondary branch AP count was significantly higher in cognitively impaired (p<0.01). Secondary small and tertiary peri-venular AP count strongly correlated with clinical dementia rating, hippocampal volumes, and white matter hyperintensity count. Discussion: Our topographic analysis indicates greater retinal amyloid accumulation in the retinal peri-arteriolar regions overall, and distal peri-venular regions in cognitively impaired individuals. Larger longitudinal studies are warranted to understand the temporal-spatial relationship between vascular dysfunction and perivascular amyloid deposition in AD. Highlights: Retinal peri-arteriolar region exhibits more amyloid compared with peri-venular regions.Secondary retinal vascular branches have significantly higher perivascular amyloid burden in subjects with impaired cognition, consistent across sexes.Cognitively impaired individuals have significantly greater retinal peri-venular amyloid deposits in the distal small branches, that correlate with CDR and hippocampal volumes.
