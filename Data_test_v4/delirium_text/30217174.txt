30217174|a|BACKGROUND: Elderly people are representative for the patients most likely to be treated with anticholinergics for overactive bladder (OAB). They often receive further drugs with anticholinergic properties for concomitant conditions. This increases the risk for side effects, including central nervous system disorders. Data on comorbidities and baseline anticholinergic burden of OAB patients seen in urological practice is scarce. Therefore, we included an epidemiological survey on these issues in our study which assessed the effectiveness and tolerability of trospium chloride (TC) in established dosages under routine conditions. METHODS: Outpatients (>= 65 years of age), for whom treatment with TC was indicated, were eligible to participate in this non-interventional, prospective study performed in 162 urological practices in Germany. Epidemiological questions were evaluated by the Anticholinergic Burden (ACB) scale and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G) at baseline. Efficacy was assessed by changes in symptom-related variables of OAB after treatment. Dosage regimen, duration of treatment, adverse events, withdrawals, and ease of subdivision of the prescribed SNAP-TAB tablet were documented. Patients and physicians rated efficacy and tolerability of treatment. Statistics were descriptive. RESULTS: Four hundred fourty-five out of 986 (47.54%) patients in the epidemiological population had a baseline ACB scale score > 0, 100 (24.72%) of whom a score >= 3. The median CIRS-G comorbidity index score for all patients was 5. 78.55% (608/774) of patients in the efficacy population received a daily dose of 45 mg TC. 60.03% (365/608) of them took this dose by dividing the SNAP-TAB tablet in three equal parts. Before-after-comparisons of the core symptoms of OAB showed clear improvements. An influence of the dosage scheme (1 x 45 mg TC/d vs 3 x 15 mg TC/d) on clinical outcome could not be observed. Most urologists and patients rated TC treatment as effective and well tolerated. 44 (4.37%) out of 1007 patients in the safety collective ended their treatment prematurely, while 75 patients (7.45%) experienced adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Anticholinergic burden and comorbidities in elderly OAB patients are frequent. The acceptance of the SNAP-TAB tablet, which facilitates flexible dosing with TC, was high, which is supportive in ensuring adherence in therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This non-interventional study was registered on October 29, 2014 with the number DRKS00007109 at the German Register of Clinical Studies (DRKS).
