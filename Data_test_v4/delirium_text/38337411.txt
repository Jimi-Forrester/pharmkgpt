38337411|t|Wernicke Syndrome: Case Report and Literature Review of Contributing Factors-Can Malpractice Dynamics Be Identified?
38337411|a|Wernicke Encephalopathy (WE) is a neurological acute syndrome related to vitamin B1 deficiency and is relatively common in patients with chronic alcoholism. In the case of Hyperemesis Gravidarum, thiamine body stores become unable to meet the increased demand, resulting in acute deficiency. WE is associated with typical clinical and radiological findings. Treatment pathways rely on thiamine replacement. The case herein reported is centered around a 33-year-old diabetic patient at 12 weeks of gestation, with WE due to hyperemesis gravidarum. The disease manifested itself with weakness, mental confusion, headache, and impaired vision. The diagnosis was established after the detection of typical findings by MRI. Thirty days after therapy was started, most of the patient's neurological disorders were resolved. The patient was discharged 40 days later with instructions to continue daily thiamine supplementation. The pregnancy outcome was good. Unfortunately, mild ataxia persisted in 2-year follow-up as a long-term consequence. When diagnosed and treated, WE has a favorable prognosis. However, roughly 80% of patients experience memory loss, which may continue for a long time, while gait disorders reportedly affect about 35% of patients. Mild ataxia and dysmetria may persist, too. We reviewed the scientific literature on WE in women with HG until February 2023. Hardly any authors report data on long-term sequelae. Our report emphasizes how important it is to take into consideration this complication in clinical practice, referring to published guidelines and recommendations. Neurological maternal sequelae can demonstrably persist despite early diagnosis and appropriate management. For this reason, a long-term follow-up is recommended. Wernicke syndrome management cannot yet rely on well-established conclusive guidelines; hence, a cautionary approach ought to be prioritized in order to ensure medicolegal soundness.
