10762167|t|Nitration of manganese superoxide dismutase in cerebrospinal fluids is a marker for peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases.
10762167|a|Peroxynitrite can nitrate tyrosine residues of proteins. We examined nitrotyrosine-containing proteins in cerebrospinal fluid of 66 patients with neurogenic disease by immunoblot analysis. Nitrated tyrosine residue-containing protein was observed in the cerebrospinal fluid and was concluded to be manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD). The nitrated Mn-SOD level was strikingly elevated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and was slightly increased in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients, whereas an elevated Mn-SOD level was observed only in progressive supranuclear palsy group.
