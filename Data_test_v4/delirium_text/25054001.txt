25054001|a|The aim of the present study was to identify the inhibitory activity of natural flavonoids, stilbenes and caffeic acid oligomers on protein glycation. Antioxidant activity was evaluated using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity. The production of 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) by glycation reactions were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence, respectively. Certain flavonoids, stilbenes and caffeic acid oligomers prevented AGE production and the IC50 values of the compounds were compared. These examined compounds are assumed to suppress AGE generation by inhibiting the increase in 3-DG production through a specific unknown mechanism in the early phase of the Maillard reaction, by inhibiting the generation of active oxygen in the later phase and by suppressing the progression of the reaction. Regular, daily consumption of these compounds in the form of a food or extract is expected to aid in the prevention or inhibition of non-enzymatic amino acid glycation in the living body, which is possibly associated with aging, diabetic complications, arteriosclerotic diseases and Alzheimer's disease, and they may also be effective agents in cosmetics promoting anti-aging.
