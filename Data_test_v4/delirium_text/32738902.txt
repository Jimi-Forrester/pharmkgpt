32738902|a|BACKGROUND: Preexisting cognitive impairment is emerging as a predictor of poor postoperative outcomes in seniors. Nevertheless, cognitive impairment in a large proportion of geriatric patients has not been well identified and diagnosed. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. Mini-mental state examination scale was used to assess the cognitive function of elderly patients aged >=65 years undergoing orthopedic surgery preoperatively. The baseline, living habits and laboratory examination results of two groups were compared, and a multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify independent predictors of preoperative cognitive impairment. RESULTS: A total of 374 elderly patients with orthopedic surgery indications met the inclusion criteria, and 28.61% of them had preoperative cognitive impairment. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age (OR = 1.089, P < 0.001), subjective sleep disorders (OR = 1.996, P = 0.021), atherosclerosis (OR = 2.367, P = 0.017), and high cholesterol level (OR = 1.373, P = 0.028) were independent risk factors for preoperative cognitive impairment, while high education level performed as a protective factor (compared with the illiterate group, primary school group: OR = 0.413, P = 0.009; middle school or above group: OR = 0.120, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of preoperative cognitive dysfunction in geriatric elective orthopedic surgical patients was high. Our study identified venerable age, low level of education, subjective sleep disorders, atherosclerosis, and high cholesterol level as risk factors for preoperative cognitive impairment in these patients. Understanding these risk factors contributes to assisting in prevention and directed interventions for the high-risk population.
