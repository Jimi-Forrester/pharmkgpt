38874921|t|Intravenous Opioid Administration During Mechanical Ventilation and Use After Hospital Discharge.
38874921|a|Importance: Guidelines recommend an analgesia-first strategy for sedation during mechanical ventilation, but associations between opioids provided during mechanical ventilation and posthospitalization opioid-related outcomes are unclear. Objective: To evaluate associations between an intravenous opioid dose received during mechanical ventilation and postdischarge opioid-related outcomes in medical (nonsurgical) patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study evaluated adults receiving mechanical ventilation lasting 24 hours or more for acute respiratory failure and surviving hospitalization. Participants from 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2019, were included. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2020, to October 31, 2023. Exposures: Terciles of median daily intravenous fentanyl equivalents during mechanical ventilation. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the first filled opioid prescription in 1 year after discharge. Secondary outcomes included persistent opioid use and opioid-associated complications. Secondary analyses tested for interaction between opioid doses during mechanical ventilation, prior opioid use, and posthospitalization opioid use. Estimates were based on multivariable-adjusted time-to-event analyses, with death as a competing risk, and censored for hospice or palliative care referral, rehospitalization with receipt of opioid, or loss of Kaiser Permanente plan membership. Results: The study included 6746 patients across 21 hospitals (median age, 67 years [IQR, 57-76 years]; 53.0% male). Of the participants, 3114 (46.2%) filled an opioid prescription in the year prior to admission. The median daily fentanyl equivalent during mechanical ventilation was 200 mug (IQR, 40-1000 mug), with terciles of 0 to 67 mug, more than 67 to 700 mug, and more than 700 mug. Compared with patients who did not receive opioids during mechanical ventilation (n = 1013), a higher daily opioid dose was associated with opioid prescriptions in the year after discharge (n = 2942 outcomes; tercile 1: adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.00 [95% CI, 0.85-1.17], tercile 2: AHR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.03-1.40], and tercile 3: AHR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.07-1.47]). Higher doses of opioids during mechanical ventilation were also associated with persistent opioid use after hospitalization (n = 1410 outcomes; tercile 3 vs no opioids: odds ratio, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.14-1.83]). No interaction was observed between opioid dose during mechanical ventilation, prior opioid use, and posthospitalization opioid use. Conclusions and Relevance: In this retrospective cohort study of patients receiving mechanical ventilation, opioids administered during mechanical ventilation were associated with opioid prescriptions following hospital discharge. Additional studies to evaluate risks and benefits of strategies using lower opioid doses are warranted.
