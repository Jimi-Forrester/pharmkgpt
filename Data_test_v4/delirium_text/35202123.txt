35202123|t|Olfactory Bulb D2/D3 Receptor Availability after Intrastriatal Botulinum Neurotoxin-A Injection in a Unilateral 6-OHDA Rat Model of Parkinson's Disease.
35202123|a|Olfactory deficits occur as early non-motor symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) in humans. The first central relay of the olfactory pathway, the olfactory bulb (OB), depends, among other things, on an intact, functional crosstalk between dopaminergic interneurons and dopamine receptors (D2/D3R). In rats, hemiparkinsonism (hemi-PD) can be induced by unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), disrupting dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). In a previous study, we showed that subsequent injection of botulinum neurotoxin-A (BoNT-A) into the striatum can reverse most of the pathological motor symptoms and normalize the D2/D3R availability. To determine whether this rat model is suitable to explain olfactory deficits that occur in humans with PD, we examined the availability of D2/D3R by longitudinal [18F]fallypride-PET/CT, the density of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the OB, olfactory performance by an orienting odor identification test adapted for rats, and a connectome analysis. PET/CT and immunohistochemical data remained largely unchanged after 6-OHDA lesion in experimental animals, suggesting that outcomes of the 6-OHDA hemi-PD rat model do not completely explain olfactory deficits in humans. However, after subsequent ipsilateral BoNT-A injection into the striatum, a significant 8.5% increase of the D2/D3R availability in the ipsilateral OB and concomitant improvement of olfactory performance were detectable. Based on tract-tracing meta-analysis, we speculate that this may be due to indirect connections between the striatum and the OB.
