38132122|t|Potentially Pathogenic SORL1 Mutations Observed in Autosomal-Dominant Cases of Alzheimer's Disease Do Not Modulate APP Physiopathological Processing.
38132122|a|The SORL1 gene encodes LR11/SorLA, a protein that binds beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and drives its intracellular trafficking. SORL1 mutations, occurring frequently in a subset of familial cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD), have been documented, but their pathogenic potential is not yet clear and questions remain concerning their putative influence on the physiopathological processing of APP. We have assessed the influence of two SORL1 mutations that were described as likely disease-causing and that were associated with either benign (SorLA924) or severe (SorLA511) AD phenotypes. We examined the influence of wild-type and mutants SorLA in transiently transfected HEK293 cells expressing either wild-type or Swedish mutated APP on APP expression, secreted Abeta and sAPPalpha levels, intracellular Abeta 40 and Abeta42 peptides, APP-CTFs (C99 and C83) expressions, alpha-, beta- and gamma-secretases expressions and activities as well as Abeta and CTFs-degrading enzymes. These paradigms were studied in control conditions or after pharmacological proteasomal modulation. We also established stably transfected CHO cells expressing wild-type SorLA and established the colocalization of APP and either wild-type or mutant SorLA. SorLA mutations partially disrupt co-localization of wild-type sorLA with APP. Overall, although we mostly confirmed previous data concerning the influence of wild-type SorLA on APP processing, we were unable to evidence significant alterations triggered by our set of SorLA mutants, whatever the cells or pharmacological conditions examined. Our study , however, does not rule out the possibility that other AD-linked SORL1 mutations could indeed affect APP processing, and that pathogenic mutations examined in the present study could interfere with other cellular pathways/triggers in AD.
