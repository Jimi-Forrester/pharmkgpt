3308646|a|Hemorheological disturbances are present in more than 50% of cerebrovascular disease (CVD). An inverse relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and viscosity has been established. There also exists an interaction of vessel wall changes, whole blood viscosity, and plasma fibrinogen. The acute ischemic episode is associated with hyperaggregability of the blood platelets, increased blood viscosity, hyperaggregability of the red cells and an increase in plasma fibrinogen. Hemorheological changes to a certain extend may occur not only in CVD but also in senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT) and certain cases of Parkinson's disease. This fact allows to differentiate between idiopathic parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease with high hemodynamic risk.
