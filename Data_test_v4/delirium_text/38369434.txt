38369434|a|Urine-derived stem cells (USCs) are a promising source of stem cells for cell therapy, renal toxicity drug testing, and renal disease biomarker discovery. Patients' own USCs can be used for precision medicine. In this review we first describe the isolation and characterization of USCs. We then discuss preclinical studies investigating the use of USCs in cell therapy, exploring the utility of USCs and USC-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (u-iPSCs) in drug toxicity testing, and investigating the use of USCs as biomarkers for renal disease diagnosis. Finally, we discuss the challenges of using USCs in these applications and provide insights into future research directions. USCs are a promising tool for advancing renal therapy, drug testing, and biomarker discovery. Further research is needed to explore their potential.
