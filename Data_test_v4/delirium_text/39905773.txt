39905773|t|The Effect of Massage, Acupressure and Reflexology on Restless Legs Syndrome Severity and Sleep Quality in Patients Receiving Haemodialysis Treatment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
39905773|a|AIM: This study aimed to review massage, acupressure and reflexology interventions applied to haemodialysis patients with restless legs syndrome and to examine the effects of these interventions on sleep quality. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search was conducted on databases ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EBSCO and PubMed. METHODS: The Modified Jadad scale was used. The statistical analysis was conducted using the Stata 15.0 software, with the aim of evaluating heterogeneity between studies using both chi-square and I2 statistics. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using both the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool and statistical tests. A funnel plot was used to detect potential publication bias, which is indicated by an asymmetry in the plot. The Egger regression test was also performed to evaluate publication bias. RESULTS: Twelve studies were selected for the meta-analysis. All studies included in this meta-analysis were of good quality. In the subgroup analysis, it was determined that massage and acupressure reduced the severity of restless legs syndrome as a result of the intervention, while reflexology had no effect. Interventions did not affect the sleep quality of patients. Restless legs syndrome severity was significantly reduced in studies using oil and in studies that intervened for more than 15 min per session. CONCLUSION: Interventions applied to haemodialysis patients with restless legs syndrome can reduce the severity of restless legs syndrome. It is recommended to conduct randomised controlled trials that determine the effects of methods on restless legs syndrome severity and sleep quality in haemodialysis patients.
