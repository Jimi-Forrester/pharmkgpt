39003466|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence agitation is a transient confusional state of a child associated with consciousness from general anaesthesia, commonly occurs in the postoperative setting which delays their recovery and exposes them to traumas. The main objective of the current study was to investigate the magnitude of emergence agitation, its interventions and associated factors among paediatric surgical patients at Saint Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: Hospital based cross-sectional study with prospective follow-up framework was conducted on a paediatric surgical patients aged 2-14 years who underwent surgery under general anaesthesia between June 1 - October 30 2022. Stratified sampling method followed by simple random sampling technique was employed to reach study participants. Magnitude of emergence agitation and its interventions done at post-anaesthetic care units were recorded. Data analysis was carried out using a descriptive statistics method and the results were summarized using tables and diagrams. Bivariate analysis was done to identify causal relationship and multivariable analysis to assess the confounding effects of factors associated with emergence agitation. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant factor. RESULTS: A total of 150 participants were included in the current study, where 107 (71.3%) were male and 97 (64.7%) were preschool aged. About 81 (54%) of care givers were female and majority of them have completed primary school. The mean (standard deviation) age of the participants was 6.4 (3.57) years. Around 42.7% of them developed emergence agitation with an average duration of 8.39 +- 4.45 minutes. Factors such as propofol administration at the end of procedure (OR of 0.104 with 95% CI [0.035, 0305]), Ear, nose, throat surgery and oral maxillofacial surgery (OR of 2.341 with 95% CI [1.051, 5.211]) and arrival of patient to recovery awake (OR of 0.456 95% CI [0.209, 0.994]) showed statistically significant association with emergence agitation. CONCLUSION: Almost half of the study participants experienced emergence agitation which is high magnitude. Ear, nose, throat surgery and oral maxillofacial surgeries were predictive factors of emergence agitation while propofol administration at the end of procedure and arrival of patient to recovery awake significantly decreased risk of emergence agitation. Therefore, anaesthesia personnel should have essential skills and knowledge to effectively care for children perioperatively including to minimize and treat emergence agitation.
