22034450|a|There is increasing knowledge about considerable comorbidity between psychiatric and somatic diseases, questioning whether variations in genes could be predisposing factors for both conditions. With respect to the multiple interactions between brain and body investigations have centered on variants in several candidate genes for proteins that mediate these interactions and therefore also have implications in psychiatric disorders. The available data, although still preliminary and rare, indicate the importance of polymorphic variants in genes coding for the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) transporter (5-HTT), the 5-HT(2A) receptor, proinflammatory cytokines, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in migraine, fibromyalgia, cardiovascular disorders, and psychiatric conditions. The role played by these various polymorphisms remains to be determined, as does whether they are indicative of common pathophysiological mechanisms or identify a subgroup of patients with somatic disorders that are more closely related to psychiatric symptoms. Nevertheless, they do at least illustrate the potential influence of genetic differences on illness course and treatment outcome, and might be a rational approach to drug development and treatment paradigms.
