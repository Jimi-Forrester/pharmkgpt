19922794|a|The misguided control of inflammatory signaling has been previously implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Induction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a central mediator of neuroinflammation, occurs commensurate with the onset of early disease in 3xTg-AD mice, which develop both amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathologies in an age- and region-dependent pattern. Herein, we describe regulation inherent to 3xTg-AD neurons, which results in the loss of TNF-alpha mediated enhancement of inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3R)-mediated Ca2+ release. This modulation also leads to significant down-regulation of IP3R signaling following protracted cytokine exposure. Through the experimental isolation of each AD-related transgene, it was determined that expression of the PS1M146V transgene product is responsible for the loss of the TNF-alpha effect on IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release. Furthermore, it was determined that the suppression of TNF-alpha receptor expression occurred in the presence of the presenilin transgene. Our findings attribute this familial AD mutation to suppressing a Ca2+-regulated signal cascade potentially intended to "inform" neurons of proximal neuroinflammatory events and trigger compensatory responses for protection of neural transmission.
