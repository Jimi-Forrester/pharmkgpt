28043074|a|The inhibition of beta-secretase (BACE1) is currently the main pharmacological strategy available for Alzheimer's disease (AD). 2D QSAR and 3D QSAR analysis on some cyclic sulfone hydroxyethylamines inhibitors against beta-secretase (IC50: 0.002-2.75muM) were carried out using hologram QSAR (HQSAR), comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA), and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) methods. The best model based on the training set was generated with a HQSAR q2 value of 0.693 and r2 value of 0.981; a CoMFA q2 value of 0.534 and r2 value of 0.913; and a CoMSIA q2 value of 0.512 and r2 value of 0.973. In order to gain further understand of the vital interactions between cyclic sulfone hydroxyethylamines and the protease, the analysis was performed by combining the CoMFA and CoMSIA field distributions with the active sites of the BACE1. The final QSAR models could be helpful in the design and development of novel active BACE1 inhibitors.
