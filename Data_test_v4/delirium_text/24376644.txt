24376644|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the buildup of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) aggregates derived from proteolytic processing of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Amyloidogenic cleavage of APP by beta-secretase/BACE1 generates the C-terminal fragment C99/CTFbeta that can be subsequently cleaved by gamma-secretase to produce Abeta. Growing evidence indicates that high levels of C99/CTFbeta are determinant for AD. Although it has been postulated that gamma-secretase-independent pathways must control C99/CTFbeta levels, the contribution of organelles with degradative functions, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or lysosomes, is unclear. In this report, we investigated the turnover and amyloidogenic processing of C99/CTFbeta in human H4 neuroglioma cells, and found that C99/CTFbeta is localized at the Golgi apparatus in contrast to APP, which is mostly found in endosomes. Conditions that localized C99/CTFbeta to the ER resulted in its degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner that first required polyubiquitination, consistent with an active role of the ER associated degradation (ERAD) in this process. Furthermore, when proteasomal activity was inhibited C99/CTFbeta was degraded in a chloroquine (CQ)-sensitive compartment, implicating lysosomes as alternative sites for its degradation. Our results highlight a crosstalk between degradation pathways within the ER and lysosomes to avoid protein accumulation and toxicity.
