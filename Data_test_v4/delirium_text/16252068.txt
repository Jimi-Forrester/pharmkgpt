16252068|t|DBH*444G/A polymorphism of the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase gene is associated with alcoholism but not with severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
16252068|a|As the enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DbetaH) converts dopamine to norepinephrine and both transmitters seem to be involved in the pathology of alcoholism and severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms, the gene encoding DbetaH (DBH) was applied to explore the genetic background of alcoholism and severe withdrawal symptoms. 102 healthy control subjects and 208 alcoholics, including 97 patients with a history of mild withdrawal symptoms, 57 with a history of alcohol withdrawal seizure (AWS) and 82 with a history of delirium tremens (DT) were genotyped for the DBH*444G/A polymorphism revealing a significantly elevated frequency of genotypes carrying the A-allele (p = 0.02; after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple tests) in alcoholics compared to healthy controls. Frequencies of alleles and genotypes of individuals with mild withdrawal symptoms did not differ significantly from those of patients with DT or AWS.
