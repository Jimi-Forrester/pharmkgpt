39081608|a|Introduction: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been linked to cognitive impairment and dementia, but its impact on brain cortical structures in individuals prior to or without cognitive impairment remains unclear. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of 2,331 entries investigating cerebral cortical thickness changes in T2D individuals without cognitive impairment, 55 of which met our inclusion criteria. Results: Most studies (45/55) reported cortical brain atrophy and reduced thickness in the anterior cingulate, temporal, and frontal lobes between T2D and otherwise cognitively healthy controls. However, the balance of studies (10/55) reported no significant differences in either cortical or total brain volumes. A few reports also noticed changes in the occipital cortex and its gyri. As part of the reports, less than half of studies (18/55) described a correlation between T2D and hippocampal atrophy. Variability in sample characteristics, imaging methods, and software could affect findings on T2D and cortical atrophy. Discussion: In conclusion, T2D appears linked to reduced cortical thickness, possibly impacting cognition and dementia risk. Microvascular disease and inflammation in T2D may also contribute to this risk. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and brain health implications.
