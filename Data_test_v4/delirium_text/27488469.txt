27488469|a|In E. coli cells, rescue of non-native proteins and promotion of native state structure is assisted by the chaperonin GroEL. An important key to this activity lies in the structure of the apical domain of GroEL (GroEL-AD) (residue 191-376), which recognizes and binds non-native protein molecules through hydrophobic interactions. In this study, we investigated the effects of GroEL-AD on the aggregation of various client proteins (alpha-Synuclein, Abeta42, and GroES) that lead to the formation of distinct protein fibrils in vitro. We found that GroEL-AD effectively inhibited the fibril formation of these three proteins when added at concentrations above a critical threshold; the specific ratio differed for each client protein, reflecting the relative affinities. The effect of GroEL-AD in all three cases was to decrease the concentration of aggregate-forming unfolded client protein or its early intermediates in solution, thereby preventing aggregation and fibrillation. Binding affinity assays revealed some differences in the binding mechanisms of GroEL-AD toward each client. Our findings suggest a possible applicability of this minimal functioning derivative of the chaperonins (the "minichaperones") as protein fibrillation modulators and detectors.
