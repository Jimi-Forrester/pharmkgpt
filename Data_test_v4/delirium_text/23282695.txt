23282695|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is an important problem in older medical inpatients. AIM: To assess if delirium is associated with higher mortality, functional decline or higher rates of readmission or institutionalization in a one year follow-up period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective cohort study of consecutive patients 65 years and older, admitted to a general hospital medical ward. A psychogeriatric team assessed patients every 48 h using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), functionality, acute severity and comorbidity scores. Analysis of one year mortality and telephone functional assessment was performed. RESULTS: Five hundred forty two patients were enrolled and 35.4% had delirium. After one year, mortality was 34.9 and 13% in delirium and non-delirium cohorts, respectively (p < 0.01). After adjustment for covariates, delirium was independently associated with higher mortality, and higher functional decline and institutionalization. No significant differences were seen in readmission rates. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium was significantly associated with higher mortality and functional decline over a one year follow up period in geriatric inpatients.
