34017272|t|Facial Emotion Recognition in Schizophrenia.
34017272|a|Deficits in facial emotion recognition are one of the most common cognitive impairments, and they have been extensively studied in various psychiatric disorders, especially in schizophrenia. However, there is still a lack of conclusive evidence about the factors associated with schizophrenia and impairment at each stage of the disease, which poses a challenge to the clinical management of patients. Based on this, we summarize facial emotion cognition among patients with schizophrenia, introduce the internationally recognized Bruce-Young face recognition model, and review the behavioral and event-related potential studies on the recognition of emotions at each stage of the face recognition process, including suggestions for the future direction of clinical research to explore the underlying mechanisms of schizophrenia.
