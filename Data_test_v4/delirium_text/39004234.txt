39004234|a|Clinical studies have reported that increased epileptiform and subclinical epileptiform activity can be detected in many patients with an Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis using electroencephalogram (EEG) and this may correlate with poorer cognition. Ascorbate may have a specific role as a neuromodulator in AD as it is released concomitantly with glutamate reuptake following excitatory neurotransmission. Insufficiency may therefore result in an exacerbated excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in neuronal signaling. Using a mouse model of AD that requires dietary ascorbate (Gulo-/-APPswe/PSEN1dE9), EEG was recorded at baseline and during 4 weeks of ascorbate depletion in young (5-month-old) and aged (20-month-old) animals. Data were scored for changes in quantity of spike trains, individual spikes, sleep-wake rhythms, sleep fragmentation, and brainwave power bands during light periods each week. We found an early increase in neuronal spike discharges with age and following ascorbate depletion in AD model mice and not controls, which did not correlate with brain amyloid load. Our data also show more sleep fragmentation with age and with ascorbate depletion. Additionally, changes in brain wave activity were observed within different vigilance states in both young and aged mice, where Gulo-/-APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice had shifts towards higher frequency bands (alpha, beta, and gamma) and ascorbate depletion resulted in shifts towards lower frequency bands (delta and theta). Microarray data supported ascorbate insufficiency altering glutamatergic transmission through the decreased expression of glutamate related genes, however no changes in protein expression of glutamate reuptake transporters were observed. These data suggest that maintaining optimal brain ascorbate levels may support normal brain electrical activity and sleep patterns, particularly in AD patient populations where disruptions are observed.
