29441654|a|AIM: Alzheimer's disease causes loss of appetite, resulting in bodyweight reduction. This, in turn, causes progression of cognitive dysfunction and physical complications that hasten death. Earlier care for loss of appetite is essential in Alzheimer's disease management. Rivastigmine is a therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease that has dual inhibition effects on acetylcholine esterase and butyrylcholine esterase. Butyrylcholine esterase is known to degrade the gastric hormone, ghrelin, which regulates appetite; therefore, we considered that rivastigmine might have an effect on appetite. The present study aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that rivastigmine improves appetite in Alzheimer's disease patients. METHODS: Rivastigmine was given to mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease patients for 16 weeks. We evaluated the effects of rivastigmine on food intake, bodyweight, motivation (estimated by the vitality index), cognition function (estimated by the Hasegawa Dementia Scale-Revised), plasma butyrylcholine esterase activity, active ghrelin and inactive ghrelin. RESULTS: Plasma butyrylcholine esterase activity significantly decreased over time (percent change: -18.9 +- 27.0%, P < 0.05 at week 8; percent change: -33.4 +- 45.4%, P < 0.05 at week 16). Negative correlations were detected between percent changes in butyrylcholine esterase activity and active ghrelin (rs  = -0.62, P = 0.033) or active/inactive ghrelin ratio (rs  = -0.73, P = 0.007). Furthermore, motivation (including appetite) improved significantly (percent change: 17.9 +- 18.6%, P < 0.05 at week 16). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that rivastigmine might improve appetite in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease patients by suppressing degradation of plasma active ghrelin through the inhibition of plasma butyrylcholine esterase.
