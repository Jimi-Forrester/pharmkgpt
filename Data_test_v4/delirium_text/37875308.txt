37875308|t|Metallic nanocarriers for therapeutic peptides: Emerging solutions addressing the delivery challenges in brain ailments.
37875308|a|Peptides and proteins have recently emerged as efficient therapeutic alternatives to conventional therapies. Although their advent a few decades back, extensive exploration of various ailments or disorders began recently. The drawbacks of current chemotherapies and irradiation treatments such as drug resistance and damage to healthy tissues have enabled the rise of the peptides as quest for better prospects. The chemical tunability and smaller size make them easy to design selectively for target tissues. Other remarkable properties include antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, protection from hemorrhage stroke, and as therapeutic agents for gastric disorders, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. Despite these unmatched properties, their practical applicability is often hindered due to their weak susceptibility to enzymatic digestion, degradation in serum, metabolism in the liver, clearance by the kidney, and immunogenic reactions. There are several methods adapted in order to increase the half-life of peptides such as chemical modifications, fusing with Fc fragment, change in amino acid composition, and by using carrier-based delivery. Among these, nano-carrier-mediated encapsulation not only increases the half-life of the peptides in vivo but also it aids in the targeted delivery. They are also efficient in delivering the therapeutic molecules across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), despite its structural complexity. Here, in this review we tried to emphasize on the possible potentiality of metallic nanoparticles to be used as efficient peptide delivery system against brain tumor, and neurodegenerative disorders. Significance Statement In this review, we have emphasized the various therapeutic applications of peptides/proteins, including antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and neurodegenerative diseases. We also focussed on the challenges these peptides face under physiological conditions after administration. We highlighted the importance and potentiality of metallic nanocarriers in the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, increasing the stability and half-life of peptides, their efficiency in targeting the delivery, and their diagnostic applications.
