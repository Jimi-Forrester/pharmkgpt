Crosstalk between tumor cells and immune cells plays an important role in immune escape and immunotherapy drug resistance. Herein, this study aimed to obtain in-depth understanding of crosstalk in the tumor microenvironment for providing potential therapeutic strategies to prevent tumor progression. METHODS: T-cell killing assays and co-culture models were developed to determine the role of crosstalk between macrophages and tumor cells in breast cancer resistant to IL-15. Western blotting, histological analysis, CRISPR-Cas9 knockout, multi-parameter flow cytometry, and tumor cell-macrophage co-injection mouse models were developed to examine the mechanism by which IL-15Ralpha+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) regulate breast cancer cell resistance to IL-15. RESULTS: We found that macrophages contributed to the resistance of tumor cells to IL-15, and tumor cells induced macrophages to express high levels of the alpha subunit of the IL-15 receptor (IL-15Ralpha). Further investigation showed that IL-15Ralpha+ TAMs reduced the protein levels of chemokine CX3C chemokine ligand 1 (CX3CL1) in tumor cells to inhibit the recruitment of CD8+ T cells by releasing the IL-15/IL-15Ralpha complex (IL-15Rc). Administration of an IL-15Rc blocking peptide markedly suppressed breast tumor growth and overcame the resistance of cancer cells to anti- programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody immunotherapy. Interestingly, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) induced gamma chain (gammac) expression to promote tumor cell-macrophage crosstalk, which facilitated tumor resistance to IL-15. Additionally, we observed that the non-transcriptional regulatory function of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) was essential for IL-15Rc to regulate CX3CL1 expression in tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: The IL-15Rc-HIF-1alpha-CX3CL1 signaling pathway serves as a crosstalk between macrophages and tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment of breast cancer. Targeting this pathway may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.
