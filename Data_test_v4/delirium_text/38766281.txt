38766281|t|Implication of serum and salivary albumin tests in the recent oral health related epidemiological studies: A narrative review.
38766281|a|Albumin is the most abundant protein in human serum and a specific amount of albumin also can be found in the saliva. It has several physiological functions such as blood colloidal osmotic pressure, antioxidant activity, binding and transporting of endogenous and exogenous substrates. We conducted an electronic search across several databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Embase and Science Direct using the relevant MeSH terms and keywords like "albumin", "serum albumin", "salivary albumin", "oral health" "dental caries" and "epidemiology". Only the epidemiological studies published between 2010 and 2023 were included. After the application of the inclusion criteria, a total of 51 studied were included in this narrative review. Serum and salivary albumin tests have been used in various aspects of oral health as a diagnostic and prognostic factor. Some of the results point out to a pattern of association while some of them are inconclusive and even contradictory. This narrative review discusses the role, significance and impact of albumin in epidemiological oral health related studies including the categories of periodontal health and disease, dental caries, oral function and hypofunction, nutrition and malnutrition, tooth loss and its treatment, diabetes and cancer. In addition, it offers a short manual for the researchers on when, where and how to use albumin tests in planning their study designs whether investigating an association or measure them as a covariate.
