36736378|t|A novel regulator in Alzheimer's disease progression: The astrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles.
36736378|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known as an age-related irreversible neurodegenerative disease. AD seriously endangers the health of the elderly, but there is still no effective treatment. In the past several decades, the significant role of astrocytes in the process of AD has been universally acknowledged. In addition, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been recognized as an essential mediator in intercellular communication and participate in various pathophysiological processes by carrying and transporting diverse cargoes. Moreover, specific conditions and stimuli can modulate the amount and properties of astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) to affect AD progression. Thus, recent studies focused on the involvement of ADEVs in the pathogenesis of AD and the potential application of ADEVs in the diagnosis and treatment of AD, which provides a new direction and possibility for revealing the mystery of AD. Interestingly, it can be concluded that ADEVs have both pathogenic and protective effects in the process of AD through a comprehensive generalization. In this review, we aim to summarize the multi-faces of ADEVs effects on AD development, which can provide a novel strategy to investigate the underlying mechanism in AD. We also summarize the current ADEVs clinically relevant studies to raise the potential use of ADEVs in the discovery of novel biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutic targets for AD.
