1576573|t|The prevention of major depression in the elderly.
1576573|a|Limited information is available regarding the relationship between elderly individuals and depression; but the clinician can anticipate problems in those who have had depression in the past, in those who are bereaved, in caretakers, and in patients with a number of other illnesses, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, stroke, alcoholism, and severe medical illness. Treatment may shorten the duration of the depression, limit long-term sequelae, and reduce the likelihood of suicide. More research with careful methodology would be helpful in clarifying directions for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.
