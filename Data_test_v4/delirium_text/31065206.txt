31065206|a|CONTEXT: Critically ill patients are at risk of post-traumatic stress disorder development. AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of using eye masks and earplugs on the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder development in patients admitted to cardiac surgery intensive care units. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This is a clinical trial that conducted in intensive care units in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sample of the present clinical trial consisted of 68 patients undergoing open-heart cardiac surgery that were randomly assigned to two groups. Patients in the control group received the usual care, and patients in the intervention group used eye masks and earplugs during sleep. The risk of post-traumatic stress disorder development before surgery and 2 months after discharge from the intensive care unit was assessed using the impact of event scale-revised. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Statistical analysis: Data were analyzed using paired t-test and independent t-test in Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 software. RESULTS: Patients in the two groups were similar in terms of demographic characteristics. The mean of the total scores of patients in the control and intervention group before surgery was 10.41 +- 5.25 and 10.71 +- 5.10, respectively (p = 0.82). The mean of the total scores of patients in the control and intervention group 2 months after discharge was 29.50 +- 5.90 and 11.72 +- 6.48, respectively (p <0.001). CONCLUSION: The use of eye masks and earplugs significantly reduces the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) development in patients undergoing open-heart cardiac surgery.
