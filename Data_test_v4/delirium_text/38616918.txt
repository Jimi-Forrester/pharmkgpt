38616918|t|Retrospective analysis of veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in paediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation -a multicentre study.
38616918|a|Background: Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is a potentially fatal complication following hematopoietic cell transplantation, high-intensity chemotherapies and increasingly seen with calicheamicin based leukemia therapies. Paediatric specific European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (pEBMT) diagnostic criteria have demonstrated benefit in single center studies compared to historic criteria. Yet, the extent to which they have been universally implemented remains unclear. Methods: We conducted a retrospective multi-centre study to examine the potential impact of the Baltimore, modified Seattle and pEBMT criteria on the incidence, severity, and outcomes of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome among paediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation patients. Findings: The incidence of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in this cohort (n = 488) was higher by pEBMT (21.5%) vs historic modified Seattle (15.6%) and Baltimore (7.0%) criteria (p < 0.001). Application of pEBMT criteria identified 44 patients who were not previously diagnosed with sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Overall, 70.5% of all patients diagnosed with sinusoidal obstruction syndrome ultimately developed very severe disease and almost half of diagnosed patients required critical care support. Overall survival was significantly lower in patients who were diagnosed with sinusoidal obstruction syndrome vs those who were not. Interpretation: Taken together, pEBMT criteria may be a sensitive method for prompter diagnosis of patients who subsequently develop severe/very severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-centre study in the United States (US) to demonstrate that pEBMT guidelines are associated with earlier detection of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Since early initiation of definitive treatment for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome has been associated with improved survival in paediatric patients and implementation of pEBMT criteria appears feasible in the US, universal adoption should facilitate prompter diagnosis and lead to improved outcomes of children with sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Funding: None.
