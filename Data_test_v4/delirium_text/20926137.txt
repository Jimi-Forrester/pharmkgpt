20926137|t|Hydroxyquinoline based binders: promising ligands for chelatotherapy?
20926137|a|We report here a thorough physico-chemical study of the coordination properties of clioquinol, an oxine-type active neurological drug in Alzheimer's disease, toward biologically relevant divalent metal ions (Cu, Zn, Ni, Co and Mn). Using a fruitful combination of electrospray mass spectrometry, absorption spectrophotometry and potentiometry, we have characterized the mono- and bis-chelated metal ion species. The determination of the stability constants showed a classical thermodynamic behavior along the studied series with the cupric complexes being by far the most stable species. Our data are discussed within the scope of Alzheimer's disease.
