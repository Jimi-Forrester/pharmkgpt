29802553|t|Near-infrared Fluorescence Ocular Imaging (NIRFOI) of Alzheimer's Disease.
29802553|a|PURPOSE: Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging has been widely used in preclinical studies; however, its low tissue penetration represents a daunting problem for translational clinical imaging of neurodegenerative diseases. The retina is known as an extension of the central nerve system (CNS), and it is widely considered as a window to the brain. Therefore, the retina can be considered as an alternative organ for investigating neurodegenerative diseases, and an eye represents an ideal NIRF imaging organ, due to its minimal opacity. PROCEDURES: NIRF ocular imaging (NIRFOI), for the first time, was explored for imaging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) via utilizing "smart" fluorescent probes CRANAD-X (X = - 2, - 3, - 30, - 58, and - 102) for amyloid beta (Abeta), and CRANAD-61 for reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mice were intravenously injected the fluorescence dyes and images from the eyes were captured with an IVIS imaging system at different time points. RESULTS: All of the tested NIRF probes could be used to differentiate transgenic AD mice and WT mice, and NIRFOI could provide much higher sensitivity for imaging Abetas than NIRF brain imaging did. Our data suggested that NIRFOI could capture the imaging signals from both soluble and insoluble Abeta species. Moreover, we demonstrated that NIRFOI with CRANAD-102 could be used to monitor the therapeutic effects of BACE-1 inhibitor LY2811376. Compared to NIRF brain imaging, NIRFOI provided a larger change of Abeta levels before and after LY2811376 treatment. In addition, we demonstrated that CRANAD-61 could be used to image reactive oxygen species in the eyes. CONCLUSION: The large detection margin by NIRFOI is very important for both diagnosis and therapy response monitoring. Compared to fluorescence microscopic imaging, NIRFOI captures signals with a wide angle (large field of view (FOV)) and can be used to detect soluble Abetas. We believe that NIRFOI has remarkable translational potential for future human studies and can be a potential imaging technology for fast, cheap, accessible, and reliable screening of AD in the future.
