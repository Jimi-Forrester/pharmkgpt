31266021|a|BACKGROUND: Neprilysin (NEP) cleaves amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta42) in the brain. Hence, we aimed to elucidate the effect of NEP on Abeta42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and on in vivo brain amyloid load using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]PiB (Pittsburgh compound B). In addition, associations with the biomarkers for neuronal injury, CSF-tau and FDG-PET, were investigated. METHODS: Associations were calculated using global and voxel-based (SPM8) linear regression analyses in the same cohort of 23 highly characterized Alzheimer's disease patients. RESULTS: CSF-NEP was significantly inversely associated with CSF-Abeta42 and positively with the extent of neuronal injury as measured by CSF-tau and FDG-PET. CONCLUSIONS: Our results on CSF-NEP are compatible with the assumption that local degradation, amongst other mechanisms of amyloid clearance, plays a role in the development of Alzheimer's pathology. In addition, CSF-NEP is associated with the extent and the rate of neurodegeneration.
