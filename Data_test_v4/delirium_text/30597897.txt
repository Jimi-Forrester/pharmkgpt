30597897|a|Nanomedicine compounds containing nanoparticles, such as iron oxides and gold, have been demonstrated to be effective in promoting different magnitudes of interaction with amyloid beta fibrils, of which disintegrating or inhibiting effects are of great importance to treating fibrillary aggregation-induced neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. This research herein studies the interaction between lysozyme amyloid fibrils, a type of fibers derived from hen egg white lysozyme, and Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) of an assorted diameter sizes of 5 nm, 10 nm and 20 nm, using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Specifically, the effects of the sizes of negatively charged MNPs on the resultant amyloid fibrillary mixture was investigated. Our results of AFM images indicated that the interaction between MNPs and the fibrils commences immediately after adding MNPs to the fibril solution, and the actions of such MNPs-doped fibrillary interplay, either integration or segmentation, is strongly dependent on the size and volume concentration of MNPs. In the cases of 5 nm and 20 nm particles of equivalent volume concentration, the adsorption and agglomeration of MNPs onto the fibrillary surfaces was observed, whereas, interestingly, MNPs with diameter size of 10 nm enables segmentation of the slender fibrils into debris when a proper implemented volume concentration was found, which signifies utter destruction of the amyloid fibrillary structure.
