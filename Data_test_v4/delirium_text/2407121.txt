2407121|t|Neurofibrillary tangles in some cases of dementia pugilistica share antigens with amyloid beta-protein of Alzheimer's disease.
2407121|a|Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded temporal lobe sections from eight former boxers' brains were examined using an immunohistochemical method with antibodies to amyloid beta protein. In accord with recent observations in Alzheimer's disease, significant numbers of beta-protein immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) were observed in three cases. Most of these immunoreactive NFTs appeared to be tombstone tangles, although not all such tangles were stained. This immunoreaction was completely abolished by preincubation of antibodies with synthetic beta-protein peptides, and the identity of the immunostained NFTs was confirmed by polarization microscopy of sections counterstained with Congo red. However, it is not yet clear if the beta-protein antigens are, in fact, an integral part of paired helical filaments. These observations, together with our recent finding of beta-immunoreactive plaque-like lesions in dementia pugilistica, also emphasize the many similarities in pathology between this condition and Alzheimer's disease.
