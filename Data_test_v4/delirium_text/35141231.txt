35141231|a|Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) has been reported to be the most prevalent contributor to low back pain, posing a significant strain on the healthcare systems on a global scale. Currently, there are no approved therapies available for the prevention of the progressive degeneration of intervertebral disc (IVD); however, emerging regenerative strategies that aim to restore the normal structure of the disc have been fundamentally promising. In the last decade, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have received a significant deal of interest for the treatment of IVDD due to their differentiation potential, immunoregulatory capabilities, and capability to be cultured and regulated in a favorable environment. Recent investigations show that the pleiotropic impacts of MSCs are regulated by the production of soluble paracrine factors. Exosomes play an important role in regulating such effects. In this review, we have summarized the current treatments for disc degenerative diseases and their limitations and highlighted the therapeutic role and its underlying mechanism of MSC-derived exosomes in IVDD, as well as the possible future developments for exosomes.
