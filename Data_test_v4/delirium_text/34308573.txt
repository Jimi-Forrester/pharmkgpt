34308573|a|OBJECTIVE: Choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPECs) have the epithelial characteristic, produce cerebrospinal fluid, contribute to the detoxification process in the central nervous system (CNS), and are responsible for the synthesis and release of many nerve growth factors. On the other hand, studies suggest that normobaric hyperoxia (HO) by induction of ischemic tolerance (IT) can protect against brain damage and neurological diseases. We examined the effect of combination therapy of encapsulated CPECs and HO to protect against ischemic brain injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, six groups of adult male Wistar rats were randomly organized: sham, room air (RA)+middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), HO+MCAO, RA+MCAO+encapsulated CPECs, HO+MCAO+encapsulated CPECs, RA+MCAO+empty capsules. RA/HO were pretreatment. The CPECs were isolated from the brain of neonatal Wistar rats, cultured, and encapsulated. Then microencapsulated CPECs were transplanted in the neck of the animal immediately after the onset of reperfusion in adult rats that had been exposed to 60 minutes MCAO. After 23 hours of reperfusion, the neurologic deficit score (NDS) was assessed. Next, rats were killed, and brains were isolated for measuring brain infarction volume, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, edema, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) and also, the level of malondialdehyde (MDA). RESULTS: Our results showed that NDS decreased equally in HO+MCAO, RA+MCAO+encapsulated CPECs, and HO+MCAO+encapsulated CPECs groups. Brain infarction volume decreased up 79%, BBB stability increased, edema decreased, SOD and CAT activities increased, and MDA decreased in the combination group of HO and transplantation of encapsulated CPECs in the ischemic brain as compared with when HO or transplantation of encapsulated CPECs was applied alone. CONCLUSION: The combination of HO and transplantation of encapsulated CPECs for stroke in rats was more effective than the other treatments, and it can be taken into account as a promising treatment for ischemic stroke.
