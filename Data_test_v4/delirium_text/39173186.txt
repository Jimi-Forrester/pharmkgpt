39173186|t|Mechanistic Approach to Immunity and Immunotherapy of Alzheimer's Disease: A Review.
39173186|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss, affecting millions of people worldwide. Traditional treatments, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists, offer limited symptomatic relief without addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. These limitations have driven the development of more potent and effective therapies. Recent advances in immunotherapy present promising avenues for AD treatment. Immunotherapy strategies, including both active and passive approaches, harness the immune system to target and mitigate AD-related pathology. Active immunotherapy stimulates the patient's immune response to produce antibodies against AD-specific antigens, while passive immunotherapy involves administering preformed antibodies or immune cells that specifically target amyloid-beta (Abeta) or tau proteins. Monoclonal antibodies, such as aducanumab and lecanemab, have shown potential in reducing Abeta plaques and slowing cognitive decline in clinical trials, despite challenges related to adverse immune responses and the need for precise targeting. This comprehensive review explores the role of the immune system in AD, evaluates the current successes and limitations of immunotherapeutic approaches, and discusses future directions for enhancing the treatment efficacy.
