39034660|a|The introduction of lecanemab has dramatically changed the field of dementia medicine. Lecanemab, defined as an anti-amyloid-beta (Abeta) drug, comprises an antibody against Abeta, a protein structure believed to cause Alzheimer's disease. This drug represents a new direction in dementia treatment. In a phase III study, lecanemab was found to significantly slow cognitive decline, while showing manageable levels of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, which are side-effects of lecanemab. Furthermore, lecanemab has been shown to effectively reduce Abeta accumulation in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, which might contribute not only to delaying the progression of cognitive decline, but also to improving the quality of life of patients and their families. However, there are conditions for the use of lecanemab, for which the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has issued the Guidelines for Promotion of Optimal Use. These guidelines specify requirements for appropriate patient selection, prescribing physicians and administering medical institutions to ensure safe and effective use. Particular emphasis is placed on the confirmation of amyloid-beta accumulation, amyloid-related imaging abnormalities risk management and appropriate handling of side-effects. The clinical use of lecanemab represents an important advancement in the treatment of dementia; however, the understanding and cooperation of healthcare professionals, patients and families are essential to maximize its efficacy and safety. Future issues to be addressed include the sustainability and long-term efficacy of treatment, improvement of clinical symptoms after removal of Abeta and motivation to administer the drug. Although lecanemab offers hope for the treatment of dementia, its use requires careful management. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2024;   :   -  .
