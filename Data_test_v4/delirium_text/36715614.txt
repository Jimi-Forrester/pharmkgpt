36715614|a|Tandem CAG repeat sizes of 36 or more in the huntingtin gene (HTT) cause Huntington disease. Apart from neuropsychiatric complications, the disease is also accompanied by metabolic dysregulation and weight loss, which contribute to a progressive functional decline. Recent studies also reported an association between repeats below the pathogenic threshold (<36) for Huntington's disease and body mass index (BMI), suggesting that HTT repeat sizes in the non-pathogenic range are associated with metabolic dysregulation. In this study we hypothesized that HTT repeat sizes < 36 are associated with metabolite levels, possibly mediated through reduced BMI. We pooled data from three European cohorts (n = 10 228) with genotyped HTT CAG repeat size and metabolomic measurements. All 145 metabolites were measured on the same targeted platform in all studies. Multilevel mixed-effects analysis using the CAG repeat size in HTT identified 67 repeat size-metabolite associations. Overall, the metabolomic profile associated with larger CAG repeat sizes in HTT were unfavorable-similar to those of higher risk of coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes-and included elevated levels of amino acids, fatty acids, LDL, VLDL and IDL related metabolites whilst with decreased levels of very large HDL related metabolites. Furthermore, the associations of 50 metabolites, in particular specific very large HDL related metabolites, were mediated by lower BMI. However, no mediation effect was found for 17 metabolites related to LDL and IDL. In conclusion, our findings indicate that large non-pathogenic CAG repeat sizes in HTT are associated with an unfavorable metabolomic profile despite their association with a lower BMI.
