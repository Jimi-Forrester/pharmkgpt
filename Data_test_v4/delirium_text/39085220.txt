39085220|t|Depression clinical trials worldwide: a systematic analysis of the ICTRP and comparison with ClinicalTrials.gov.
39085220|a|Major depressive disorder (MDD), commonly known as depression, affects over 300 million people worldwide as of 2018 and presents a wide range of clinical symptoms. The international clinical trials registry platform (ICTRP) introduced by WHO includes aggregated data from ClinicalTrials.gov and 17 other national registers, making it the largest clinical trial platform. Here we analysed data in ICTRP with the aim of providing comprehensive insights into clinical trials on depression. Applying a novel hidden duplicate identification method, 10,606 depression trials were identified in ICTRP, with ANZCTR being the largest non- ClinicalTrials.gov database at 1031 trials, followed by IRCT with 576 trials, ISRCTN with 501 trials, CHiCTR with 489 trials, and EUCTR with 351 trials. The top four most studied drugs, ketamine, sertraline, duloxetine, and fluoxetine, were consistent in both groups, but ClinicalTrials.gov had more trials for each drug compared to the non-ClinicalTrials.gov group. Out of 9229 interventional trials, 663 unique agents were identified, including approved drugs (74.5%), investigational drugs (23.2%), withdrawn drugs (1.8%), nutraceuticals (0.3%), and illicit substances (0.2%). Both ClinicalTrials.gov and non-ClinicalTrials.gov databases revealed that the largest categories were antidepressive agents (1172 in ClinicalTrials.gov and 659 in non-ClinicalTrials.gov) and nutrients, amino acids, and chemical elements (250 in ClinicalTrials.gov and 659 in non-ClinicalTrials.gov), indicating a focus on alternative treatments involving dietary supplements and nutrients. Additionally, 26 investigational antidepressive agents targeting 16 different drug targets were identified, with buprenorphine (opioid agonist), saredutant (NK2 antagonist), and seltorexant (OX2 antagonist) being the most frequently studied. This analysis addresses 40 approved drugs for depression treatment including new drug classes like GABA modulators and NMDA antagonists that are offering new prospects for treating MDD, including drug-resistant depression and postpartum depression subtypes.
