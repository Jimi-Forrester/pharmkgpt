34663485|a|OBJECTIVE: Providing good end-of-life (EOL) care for noncancer patients has been made a national priority in Singapore. A combined medical and nursing ward-based intervention known as the EOL care plan was piloted in a general medicine ward at our institution, aiming to guide key aspects of EOL care. The aim of this study is to assess the EOL care plan's effect on EOL care for general medicine patients. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on inpatients who died in a general ward under the discipline "General Medicine" from May to October 2019. We collected data around symptom management, rationalization of care and communication with families. The primary analysis compared care received by patients who died in the pilot ward with that of a control group of patients who died in other wards. RESULTS: In total, 112 records were included in the analysis. Pain assessment was more common in the pilot ward compared with the control group (35.3% vs. 6.3%, p < 0.001), as were anti-psychotic prescriptions for delirium (64.7% vs. 24.4%, p = 0.001). Fewer patients received blood glucose monitoring in the last 48 h of life in the pilot ward (69.5% vs. 35.3%, p = 0.007). There were also less frequent parameters monitoring in the pilot ward (p < 0.004). SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The implementation of the EOL care plan was associated with process-level indicators of better EOL care, suggesting that it could have a significant positive impact when implemented on a wider scale.
