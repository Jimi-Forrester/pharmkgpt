37907345|a|Generally, if the size of a lip cancer defect exceeds 30% of the lower lip, a local flap or free flap is recommended. However, defects up to 50% of the lower lip in size have been reconstructed successfully by primary closure without a local flap or free flap. In one case, an 80-year-old male farmer who had smoked for more than 50 years presented with squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip and underwent mass resection and supraomohyoid neck dissection. The defect accounted for almost 2/3 of the lower lip and was repaired by primary closure with V-shaped resection. Biopsy results confirmed pT2N0cM0 stage II disease with clear margins. In another case, a 68-year-old male also presented with squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip and underwent mass resection. The defect accounted for about half the size of the lower lip but was repaired by primary closure with V-shaped resection. Both patients experienced no discomfort while eating or speaking and were satisfied with the cosmetic and functional outcomes with no evidence of recurrence. Thus, direct closure can be considered even in large lower lip cancers.
