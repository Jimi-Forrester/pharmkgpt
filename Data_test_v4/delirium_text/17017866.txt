17017866|a|Considerable evidence suggests a role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of neuron degeneration in several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although debated, increasing evidence suggests that oxidative stress/damage (amyloid beta peptide, iron/hydrogen peroxide) or neurotoxic by-products of lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, acrolein) lead to cell death through apoptosis or programmed cell death in AD. This review discusses current evidence supporting the role of oxidative stress/damage mediated apoptosis in in vitro models of neurodegeneration.
