24619276|a|Emerging evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) share neurodegenerative mechanisms. We sought to directly compare cerebral perfusion in these two conditions using arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI). In total, 17 AD, 20 PDD, and 37 matched healthy controls completed ASL and structural MRI, and comprehensive neuropsychological testing. Alzheimer's disease and PDD perfusion was analyzed by whole-brain voxel-based analysis (to assess absolute blood flow), a priori specified region of interest analysis, and principal component analysis (to generate a network differentiating the two groups). Corrections were made for cerebral atrophy, age, sex, education, and MRI scanner software version. Analysis of absolute blood flow showed no significant differences between AD and PDD. Comparing each group with controls revealed an overlapping, posterior pattern of hypoperfusion, including posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and occipital regions. The perfusion network that differentiated AD and PDD groups identified relative differences in medial temporal lobes (AD<PDD) and right frontal cortex (PDD<AD). In conclusion, the pattern of cerebral hypoperfusion is very similar in AD and PDD. This suggests closely linked mechanisms of neurodegeneration mediating the evolution of dementia in both conditions.
