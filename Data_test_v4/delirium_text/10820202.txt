10820202|t|Retinoic acid-mediated enhancement of the cholinergic/neuronal nitric oxide synthase phenotype of the medial septal SN56 clone: establishment of a nitric oxide-sensitive proapoptotic state.
10820202|a|It is unclear what mechanisms lead to the degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer's or other human brain diseases. Some brain cholinergic neurons express neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (nNOS), which produces a free radical that has been implicated in some forms of neurodegeneration. We investigated nNOS expression and NO toxicity in SN56 cells, a clonal cholinergic model derived from the medial septum of the mouse basal forebrain. We show here that, in addition to expressing choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), SN56 cells express nNOS. Treatment of SN56 cells with retinoic acid (RA; 1 microM) for 48 h increased ChAT mRNA (+126%), protein (+88%), and activity (+215%) and increased nNOS mRNA (+98%), protein (+400%), and activity (+15%). After RA treatment, SN56 cells became vulnerable to NO excess generated with S-nitro-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP) and exhibited increased nuclear DNA fragmentation that was blocked with a caspase-3 inhibitor. Treatment with dexamethasone, which largely blocked the RA-mediated increase in nNOS expression, or inhibition of nNOS activity with methylthiocitrulline strongly potentiated the apoptotic response to SNAP in RA-treated SN56 cells. Caspase-3 activity was reduced when SNAP was incubated with cells or cell lysates, suggesting that NO can directly inhibit the protease. Thus, whereas RA treatment converts SN56 cells to a proapoptotic state sensitive to NO excess, endogenously produced NO appears to be anti-apoptotic, possibly by tonically inhibiting caspase-3.
