35629790|t|Clinical Evaluation of Micro-Embolic Activity with Unexpected Predisposing Factors and Performance of Horizon AF PLUS during Cardiopulmonary Bypass.
35629790|a|Background: During Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) gaseous micro-emboli (GMEs) decrease the quality of the blood flow and the capillary oxygen delivery, increasing the incidence of postoperative neurocognitive disorders (POCD) following cardiac surgery. In these circumstances, the use of an efficient device, could be crucial for the removal and reduction of micro-embolic activity. Methods: From February 2022 to March 2022, we prospectively collected data from 40 consecutive patients undergoing conventional and minimally invasive cardiac surgery that used the Horizon AF PLUS (Eurosets, Medolla, Italy). We collected, during the CPB's time, the incidence of unexpected predisposing factors for micro-embolic activity reported in the literature with the GMEs count and their diameter through the GAMPT BCC 300 (Germany). Results: The group of patients without unexpected predisposing factors for micro-embolic activity (55%) reported a GME volume of 0.59 +- 0.1 (muL) in the arterial line (p-value 0.67). In both groups were no reported performance deficit during the procedures for oxygenation and CO2 removal. Conclusions: Our clinical analysis showed that Horizon AF PLUS is an effective and safe device without iatrogenic perioperative complications, for the reduction of micro embolic activity during CPBs procedures, with high efficiency in terms of oxygenating performance and thermal exchange.
