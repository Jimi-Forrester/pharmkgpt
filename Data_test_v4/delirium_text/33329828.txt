33329828|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the degree of sedation and the incidence of adverse effects resulting from various methods of administering the initial dose followed by continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine (DEX) for sedation in elderly patients undergoing spinal anesthesia. METHODS: In total, 72 patients aged over 65 years who were to be administered spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated into three groups. The initial doses were injected to the groups as follows: group DD, DEX 0.5 mug/kg for 10 min; group MD, midazolam 0.02 mg/kg; and group D, no initial dose. This was followed immediately by infusing a maintenance dose of DEX 0.5 mug/kg/h to all groups. RESULTS: The Bispectral index (BIS) in the D group was significantly higher than in the other two groups. There were no significant differences in the Ramsay sedation scale (RSS) among the groups. The RSS 3 level was reached in 10 min from the start of sedation in MD and DD groups and in 20 min from the start of sedation in D group. Neither bradycardia nor hypotension was observed in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in all three groups reached the RSS 3 sedating-effect level. However, the group that received continuous infusion only without the initial dose showed higher BIS than the other two groups and reached the RSS 3 later. No adverse events were observed in any of the groups.
