34502359|a|Under metabolic stress conditions such as hypoxia and glucose deprivation, an increase in the AMP:ATP ratio activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, resulting in the modulation of cellular metabolism. Metformin, which is widely prescribed for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, regulates blood sugar by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis and promoting insulin sensitivity to facilitate glucose uptake by cells. At the molecular level, the most well-known mechanism of metformin-mediated cytoprotection is AMPK pathway activation, which modulates metabolism and protects cells from degradation or pathogenic changes, such as those related to aging and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Recently, it has been revealed that metformin acts via AMPK- and non-AMPK-mediated pathways to exert effects beyond those related to diabetes treatment that might prevent aging and ameliorate DR. This review focuses on new insights into the anticancer effects of metformin and its potential modulation of several novel types of nonapoptotic cell death, including ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. In addition, the antimetastatic and immunosuppressive effects of metformin and its hypothesized mechanism are also discussed, highlighting promising cancer prevention strategies for the future.
