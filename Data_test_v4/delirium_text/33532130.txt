33532130|t|Identifying Biomarkers Associated with Venous Infarction in Acute/Subacute Cerebral Venous Thrombosis.
33532130|a|Among cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) patients, those with venous infarction have more severe clinical presentations and worse outcomes. Identifying biomarkers associated with venous infarction in CVT may help understand the pathogenesis and provide potentially useful therapeutic markers. Fifty-two CVT patients were prospectively recruited and divided into three groups: acute/subacute CVT with venous infarction (ASVI, n=30), without venous infarction (ASOVI, n=13), and chronic CVT (n=9). Blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability-related proteins, including claudin-5, occludin, matrix metalloproteinase-9, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and S100B, and inflammation-related factor high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), were tested in serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid upon admission. We compared these biomarkers between the three groups and investigated their associations with venous infarction and clinical symptom severity in acute/subacute CVT patients on admission using the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Serum hs-CRP was significantly higher in acute/subacute CVT patients than chronic CVT patients. For acute/subacute CVT patients, levels were significantly higher in the ASVI group than the ASOVI group for serum claudin-5 (medians 2.80 vs. 2.50 mg/I, respectively, P = 0.039) and hs-CRP (medians 17.25 vs. 2.27 mg/l, respectively, P = 0.003). Both these biomarkers, analyzed as categorical or continuous variables, were also significantly associated with venous infarction in acute/subacute CVT patients after logistic regression analysis. Additionally, hs-CRP was positively correlated with the NIHSS (r = 0.710, P < 0.001) on admission in acute/subacute CVT patients. In CVT patients, venous infarction was associated with BBB disruption and potentially inflammation. Hs-CRP might serve as a biomarker reflecting the clinical severity of CVT in the acute/subacute stages.
