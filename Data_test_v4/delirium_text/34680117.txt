34680117|a|Biomarkers to discriminate the main pathologies underlying frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-Tau, FTLD-TDP) are lacking. Our previous FTLD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome study revealed that sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was specifically increased in FTLD-Tau patients. Here we investigated the potential of CSF SHBG as a novel biomarker discriminating the main FTLD pathological subtypes. SHBG was measured in CSF samples from patients with FTLD-Tau (n = 23), FTLD-TDP (n = 29) and controls (n = 33) using an automated electro-chemiluminescent immunoassay. Differences in CSF SHBG levels across groups, as well as its association with CSF YKL40, pTau181/total-Tau ratio and cognitive function were analyzed. CSF SHBG did not differ across groups, though a trend towards elevated levels in FTLD-Tau cases compared to FTLD-TDP and controls was observed. CSF SHBG levels were not associated with either CSF YKL40 or the p/tTau ratio. They, however, inversely correlated with the MMSE score (r = -0.307, p = 0.011), an association likely driven by the FTLD-Tau group (r FTLD-Tau = -0.38; r FTLD-TDP = -0.02). CSF SHBG is not a suitable biomarker to discriminate FTLD-Tau from FTLD-TDP.
