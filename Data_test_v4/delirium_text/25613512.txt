25613512|a|Individual microRNAs and/or microRNA signatures were associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We report here the recent advances brought to the identification of microRNA changes in AD brain and their biological function in the molecular pathways associated with the disease. This field represents a fertile route to understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease. In addition we review recent studies aimed to discover promising biomarkers for AD diagnosis by microRNA expression profiles of biofluids from AD patients.
