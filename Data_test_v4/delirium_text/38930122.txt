38930122|t|Effect of Preoperative Clear Liquid Consumption on Postoperative Recovery in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Minimally Invasive Repair of Pectus Excavatum: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Study.
38930122|a|Background/Objectives: Preoperative fasting guidelines traditionally aim to reduce pulmonary aspiration risk. However, concerns over the adverse effects of prolonged fasting have led to exploring alternatives. This study aimed to investigate the impact of preoperative clear liquid intake on postoperative outcomes in children undergoing minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE). Methods: A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted on children aged 3-6 years scheduled for elective MIRPE. Patients were randomized into either a routine overnight fasting group (NPO) or a clear liquid group. The incidence and severity of emergence delirium (ED) were assessed using Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) and Watcha scales at recovery room. Postoperative pain scores and opioid requirements were evaluated at intervals of 1-6 h, 6-12 h, and 12-24 h after surgery. Results: Fasting time was 178.6 +- 149.5 min and 608.9 +- 148.4 min in the clear liquid group compared and NPO group, respectively. The incidence of ED, measured by PAED and Watcha scales, was lower in the clear liquid group (PAED score >= 12: 55.6% vs. 85.2%, p = 0.037; Watcha score >= 3: 51.9% vs. 85.2%, p = 0.019). The highest PAED score recorded in the recovery room was significantly lower in the clear liquid group (11.4 +- 2.8 vs. 14.6 +- 2.8, p < 0.001). Clear liquid group showed significantly lower pain scores at 1-6, 6-12, and 12-24 h postoperatively. Additionally, clear liquid group had lower opioid requirement at 1-6 and 6-12 h postoperatively. Conclusions: Preoperative clear liquid consumption was associated with a lower incidence of ED in pediatric patients undergoing MIRPE.
