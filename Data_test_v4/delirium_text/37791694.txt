37791694|t|[Dementia : current guidelines for clinical management].
37791694|a|Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe a group of symptoms associated with a decline in cognitive abilities that are severe enough to interfere with daily functioning and independence. While Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause, dementia in old aged persons represents rather a syndrome caused by various underlying conditions and diseases. Successful treatment allows for the individual clinical picture, and should be aimed at helping the patient regarding his cognitive deficits, behavioral and psychiatric complaints, sleep disorders, as well as management of daily life. Recently published promising study results on the use of monoclonal antibody therapies in AD give reason to believe that treatments will be available soon that can modulate disease progression at the neurobiological level.
