24860840|a|OBJECTIVE: The neuropathogenesis of postoperative delirium remains unknown. Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) betaamyloid protein (Abeta) and high CSF Tau levels are associated with Alzheimer's disease. We therefore assessed whether lower preoperative CSF Abeta/Tau ratio was associated with higher incidence and greater severity of postoperative delirium. METHODS: One hundred and fifty three participants (71+-5 years, 53% males) who had total hip/knee replacement under spinal anesthesia were enrolled. CSF was obtained during initiation of spinal anesthesia. The incidence and severity of postoperative delirium were determined by Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) on postoperative day 1 and 2. Abeta40, Abeta42, and Tau levels in the CSF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relationships among these variables were determined, adjusting for age and gender. RESULTS: Participants in the lowest quartile of preoperative CSF Abeta40/Tau and Abeta42/Tau ratio had higher incidence (32% versus 17%, P=0. 0482) and greater symptom severity of postoperative delirium (Abeta40/Tau ratio: 4 versus 3, P=0. 034; Abeta42/Tau ratio: 4 versus 3, P=0. 062, the median of the highest Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale score) as compared to the combination of the rest of the quartiles. The preoperative CSF Abeta40/Tau or Abeta42/Tau ratio was inversely associated with Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale score (Abeta40/Tau ratio: -0.12+-0.05, P=0.014, adj. -0.12+-0.05, P=0.018; Abeta42/Tau ratio: -0.65+-0.26, P=0.013, adj. -0.62+-0.27, P=0.022). INTERPRETATION: Lower CSF Abeta/Tau ratio could be associated with postoperative delirium, pending confirmation of our preliminary results in further studies. These findings suggest potential roles of Abeta and/or Tau in postoperative delirium neuropathogenesis.
