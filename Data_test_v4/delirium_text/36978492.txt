36978492|t|A Comprehensive Review on Chemical Synthesis and Chemotherapeutic Potential of 3-Heteroaryl Fluoroquinolone Hybrids.
36978492|a|Fluoroquinolones have been studied for more than half a century. Since the 1960s, four generations of these synthetic antibiotics have been created and successfully introduced into clinical practice. However, they are still of interest for medicinal chemistry due to the wide possibilities for chemical modification, with subsequent useful changes in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the initial molecules. This review summarizes the chemical and pharmacological results of fluoroquinolones hybridization by introducing different heterocyclic moieties into position 3 of the core system. It analyses the synthetic procedures and approaches to the formation of heterocycles from the fluoroquinolone carboxyl group and reveals the most convenient ways for such procedures. Further, the results of biological activity investigations for the obtained hybrid pharmacophore systems are presented. The latter revealed numerous promising molecules that can be further studied to overcome the problem of resistance to antibiotics, to find novel anticancer agents and more.
