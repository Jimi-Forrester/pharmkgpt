20704977|a|Extract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that results initially in memory dysfunction, and is subsequently followed by a more general decline in intellectual function. In western societies, it accounts for the majority (60-70%) of all cases of dementia. Currently, Alzheimer's disease affects over 4 million adults in the United States. With the increase in life expectancy of the general population, more individuals are living longer, exposing them to the increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. If current population projections hold true, it is estimated that by 2050 the number of cases of Alzheimer's disease will have quadrupled, and that Alzheimer's disease will begin to rival heart disease, cancer, and stroke as a leading cause of death. This has caused many to observe that Alzheimer's disease represents a new epidemic in medicine. The implications for society, in terms of both human suffering and monetary cost, are far reaching and underscore the urgency in finding effective therapies for the prevention and treatment of the disease.
