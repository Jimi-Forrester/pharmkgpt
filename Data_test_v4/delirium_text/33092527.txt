33092527|a|BACKGROUND: The catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) of male patients is a common clinical problem, albeit lacking effective solutions. The present study aimed to investigate whether intravesical dexmedetomidine instillation alleviates the postoperative urinary discomfort in male patients with catheter under general anesthesia. METHODS: This single-blinded, prospective, randomized study included a total of 167 male patients American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-II scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia were allocated to two groups: 84 in the dexmedetomidine group and 83 in the control group. Dexmedetomidine group patients received intravesical instillation of the drug 0.5 mug/kg and normal saline 20 mL, while the control group received intravesical instillation of 20 mL normal saline. The catheter was clamped for 30 min after intravesical instillation for all patients. CRBD scores and urethra pain numerical rating scale (NRS) scores were measured at admittance to post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) (T0), intravesical instillation (T1), 30 min (T2), 60 min (T3), 2 h (T4) after intravesical instillation, discharged from PACU (T5), and 6 h (T6) and 24 h (T7) after the operation. Patient satisfaction at discharge from PACU and 24 h post-operation were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: CRBD scores and urethra pain NRS scores after 30 min of intravesical dexmedetomidine instillation to 24 h post-operation were significantly lower than the control group (p < 0.001), and patient satisfaction was higher at discharge from PACU and 24 h post-operation (p < 0.001). No differences were detected in Steward score out of PACU (p = 0.213) and from the time of the end of operation to fully awake (p = 0.417). CONCLUSION: Intravesical dexmedetomidine instillation reduces postoperative urinary discomfort and urethra pain and improves satisfaction in male patients under general anesthesia.
