METHODS: We selected individuals with MCI, who reverted at follow-up to NC, with follow-up after reversion from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Common clinical markers, Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers, and neurodegeneration imaging markers were used to compare MCI reverters based on subsequent clinical outcome (i.e., subsequent decline or stable reversion). For independent comparison, findings of the clinical Amsterdam Dementia Cohort are presented. RESULTS: Seventy-seven (10%) out of 757 individuals with MCI reverted to NC and 61 of these individuals had follow-up data available. After 3.2 +- 2.2 years, 16 (24%) progressed to MCI, and 3 (5%) to dementia. Those who declined were older and had a higher amyloid PET burden and higher CSF tau levels. CONCLUSION: In MCI reverters, abnormal biomarkers for AD pathology are associated with subsequent decline. AD biomarkers may aid in the prognosis of reverting MCI.
