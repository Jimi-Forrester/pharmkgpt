36127087|a|INTRODUCTION: Postoperative cognitive decline affects cognitive domains such as executive functions, memory, concentration and information processing. The analogue neuropsychological test developed by the International Study Group of Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (ISPOCD) is a well-established test for assessing cognitive performance. However, analogue tests are time-consuming, rarely cost-effective and can be at risk of administration bias. Digital solutions are comparable to analogue ones, have higher degrees of compliance and enable more standardised execution than analogue tests. Currently, there is a lack of recommendations for clinical evaluation of the patient's cognition in the perioperative setting, standard care usually means no cognitive assessments prior or after the surgery. There is a need to find an equivalent neuropsychological test to the ISPOCD to make it accessible and easier to implement in a clinical context for perioperative patients. This study aims to examine how healthy seniors perform on two neuropsychological tests, analogue versus digital and measure equivalency between tests with correlation analysis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will use a randomised cross-over design, including qualitative interviews regarding test experiences. Healthy participants >=60 years of age will be eligible to participate in the study. Cognitive function will be measured by using the ISPOCD test and the Mindmore digital test. The participants will self-report depressive symptoms with the Geriatric Depression Scale-15, user experience of the digital test using a modified version of the System Usability Scale and answer questionnaires targeting their experiences after the tests. Furthermore, according to the Swedish Quality of Recovery Scale, self-reported concentration difficulties will also be measured. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Dnr 2021-05486-01) and will follow the principles outlined in the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. Results from this study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, at scientific conferences, and in social media. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 2021-01095; ClinicalTrials.gov.
