36195892|a|BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors avoid inhibition of T-cell responses, upregulating antitumor immune response. Moreover, a dysregulation with hyperactive immune response can be caused, some of them underdiagnosed. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a rare and often fatal syndrome of uncontrolled and ineffective hyperinflammatory response that triggers an inflammatory cascade that can lead in many cases to death. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 67-year-old Caucasian man with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma who developed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis after initiation of atezolizumab, an antagonist of programmed death-ligand 1. Even with early diagnosis and proper treatment, death occurs in approximately half of all cases reported. CONCLUSION: Key markers are needed to better identify patients at risk of developing severe immune-related adverse events. In addition to key markers, a higher degree of suspicion and early intervention are needed to improve outcomes in acquired hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, especially with the increasingly and expanding use of immune activation.
