33608044|a|Four fluid-based biomarkers have been developed into diagnostic tests for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology: the ratio of 42 to 40 amino acid-long amyloid beta, a marker of plaque pathology; total-tau and phosphorylated tau, markers of AD-related changes in tau metabolism and secretion; and neurofilament light, a marker of neurodegeneration. When measured in cerebrospinal fluid, these biomarkers can be used in clinical practice to support a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to AD. Recently, technological breakthroughs have made it possible to measure them in standard blood samples as well. Here, we give an updated account of the current state of the fluid-based AD biomarker research field. We discuss how the new blood tests may be used in research and clinical practice, and what role they may play in relation to more established diagnostic tests, such as CSF biomarkers and amyloid and tau positron emission tomography, to facilitate the effective implementation of future disease-modifying therapies.
