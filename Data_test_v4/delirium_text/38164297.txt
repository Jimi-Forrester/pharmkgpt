38164297|t|Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices of Military Personnel Regarding Heat-Related Illness.
38164297|a|INTRODUCTION: Heat-related illnesses are a global concern, affecting millions of people and leading to numerous deaths annually. Since military personnel are exposed to heat, the purpose of the study was to evaluate military personnel's knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to heat-related illnesses. Their KAP may help to prevent heat-related illness.  Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using a structured online questionnaire on 168 military personnel who were training and working in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment all year round in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire assessed the KAP and associated factors and was distributed as a Google Form. RESULTS: The mean knowledge score was 9.04 (range = 2-13, SD = 1.832), the mean awareness score was 9.61 (range = 4-15, SD = 2.415), and the mean practice score was 3.39 (range = 0-6, SD = 1.703). Most participants correctly identified symptoms (n=130; 77.4%). In terms of attitudes, most participants showed a good attitude (n=151; 81%), though 24.4% did not perceive the risk. Regarding practice, most were attentive to heat-related illness signs and hydration(75.6%), but there were gaps in receiving briefings from doctors (69%) and adequate guidance on treatment (56%). There was a split opinion on whether commanders adjust field activities based on temperature warnings (54.8% Yes, 45.2% No). There were no significant differences in knowledge scores based on age or educational level (both p>0.05), while some age and education-related differences were noted in practice scores (p<0.05). There was a positive correlation between knowledge and attitudes (r = 0.222, p = 0.004), knowledge and practices (r = 0.165, p = 0.033), and attitudes and practice (r=0.326, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study found that military personnel generally possess good knowledge of heat-related illnesses and good attitudes and practices concerning heat-related illnesses. However, there are areas in need of improvement, and enhancing awareness and practical implementation of preventive measures, along with the development of precise guidance and protocols, should involve active collaboration between military commanders and healthcare professionals.
