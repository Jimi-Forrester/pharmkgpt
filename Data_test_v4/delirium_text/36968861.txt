36968861|a|This observational study reported patient data derived from the emergency files of a primary health care (PHC) center in Greece, with the aim of providing potential solutions for a well-organized, well-structured, and effective social healthcare system. This series was conducted at a single urban PHC center in Greece between August 2017 and March 2020. A total of 83,592 patient visits were registered. The mean patient age was 42.5 years (range: three months to 93 years). Demographics, presenting complaints, and the need for patients who visited the healthcare center to be referred to tertiary hospitals were examined. Further perspectives and future strategies to strengthen the national PHC system were addressed. The most common reasons for visits were pathological (33.6%), followed by general surgery (21.2%) and orthopedics (18.1%). Pediatric conditions accounted for 12% of visits, cardiological conditions accounted for 8.6%, and dental problems accounted for 6.8%. The majority of the patients (n = 81,317, 97.3%) were managed within the health center, and only 2.7% of cases (n = 2275) needed to be referred to a secondary or tertiary healthcare structure. Reasons for patient referral included the severity or complexity of the patient's situation, lack of a specific medical specialty, and the unavailability of overnight laboratory tests. The PHC center remains the cornerstone of a high-quality healthcare system. A well-structured PHC unit can improve health outcomes and decongest secondary and tertiary health care.
