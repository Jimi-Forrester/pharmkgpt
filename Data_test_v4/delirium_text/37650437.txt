37650437|t|Comparing Lookback Periods to Ascertain Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.
37650437|a|Claims data are a valuable resource for studying Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is often identified using a list of claims codes and a fixed lookback period of 3 years of data. However, a 1-year lookback or an approach using all-available lookback data could be beneficial based on different research questions. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare 1-year and all-available lookback approaches to ascertaining ADRD compared to the standard 3-year approach. Using a cohort of Veterans hospitalized for heart failure (N = 373, 897), our results suggested high agreement (93% or greater) between the lookback periods. The 1-year lookback period had lower sensitivity (60%) and underestimated the prevalence of ADRD. These results suggest that 1-year and all-available lookback periods are viable approaches when using claims data.
