37418690|t|Evaluation of phenobarbital for prevention of alcohol withdrawal in trauma patients.
37418690|a|BACKGROUND: Up to 30% of trauma patients experience alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) during their hospital admission which is associated with worse outcomes. While benzodiazepines and phenobarbital are the mainstay of AWS management, there is limited data on the prevention of AWS. The objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of phenobarbital for the prevention of AWS. METHODS: Adult patients admitted to a level 1 trauma center who received at least one dose of phenobarbital for the prevention of AWS between January 2019 and August 2021 were included. Patients were case-matched to a control group managed with symptom-triggered therapy based on risk of AWS. Risk factors included: gender, age, history of AWS/delirium tremens (DT) or withdrawal seizures, selected lab values, and screening questionnaires. The primary endpoint was the need for rescue therapy. Secondary endpoints included the time to rescue therapy, ICU length of stay (LOS), and hospital LOS. RESULTS: Overall, 110 patients were included with 55 patients in each group. The phenobarbital group had higher baseline injury severity scores (p = 0.03) and were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (44% vs. 24%; p = 0.03). The phenobarbital group required less rescue therapy (16% vs. 62%; p < 0.001) with a longer time to rescue therapy administration (26 vs. 11 hours; p = 0.01). The phenobarbital group had a longer hospital LOS (216 vs. 87 hours; p = 0.0001) but no difference in ICU LOS (p = 0.36). There was no incidence of DT or seizures and no difference in intubation rates (p = 0.68). There was no incidence of hypotension associated with phenobarbital. CONCLUSIONS: Patients managed with phenobarbital had a lower need for rescue therapy for AWS with no increased adverse effects. Further studies should evaluate a protocol to prevent alcohol withdrawal in the trauma population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE AND STUDY TYPE: Level III, Therapeutic/Care Management.
