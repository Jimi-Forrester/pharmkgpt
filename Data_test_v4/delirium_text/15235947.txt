15235947|a|PURPOSE: We attempted to determine the frequency of adverse psychological events after total intravenous anesthesia with propofol-fentanyl-ketamine (PFK) in surgical schizophrenic patients. METHODS: PFK was used in 25 schizophrenic patients undergoing various surgical procedures from 1995 to 1997. Adverse events occurring during and after anesthesia were recorded. Psychiatric follow-up was also done during the first 3 postoperative weeks at least. RESULTS: One patient died postoperatively of airway obstruction from concomitant severe malignant thyroid disease, but in the remaining patients neither respiratory nor cardiovascular states during or after anesthesia became unstable. None of the patients developed adverse psychological emergence reactions immediately after anesthesia. Two patients undergoing major surgical procedures exhibited delirium in the early postoperative days despite taking their routine antipsychotic drugs postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that PFK maintains stable respiratory and cardiovascular states, and causes no psychological emergence reactions in schizophrenic surgical patients. However, adverse psychological events may occur postoperatively, probably due to continued psychic stress. We therefore recommend appropriate perioperative management and further psychological studies for such patients.
