37547035|t|Estimation of Some Phytochemical Compounds and Antioxidant Properties of Leaves from Different Mulberry Varieties Grown in Syria.
37547035|a|The study was conducted to compare the chemical composition and bioactive compounds of leaves from different mulberry species grown in Syria (Morus alba, Morus nigra, Morus rubra, and Morus nigra sp). The leaves were collected in July 2022 and their proximate composition (moisture, ash, lipids, and protein), total polyphenol content (TPC), ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity, as measured by ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), were investigated. The results showed that the moisture, ash, and fat content ranged from 61.84 to 71.17%, 12.87 to 17.61%, and 3.82 to 9.68% dry weight (DW), respectively. The phenolic concentration of leaves from four different mulberry cultivars varied significantly, from 164.9 (Morus alba) to 461.5 gallic acid equivalents mg/100 g DW (M. nigra). The antioxidant activity of mulberry leaves ranged from 122 to 166.3 meq ascorbic acid/100 g DW and was arranged as follows: M. rubra > M. nigra sp > M. nigra > M. alba. According to the findings, mulberry leaves could be used to create new food supplements, functional foods, and medical applications.
