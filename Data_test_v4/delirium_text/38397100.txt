38397100|t|Autism Spectrum Disorder: Brain Areas Involved, Neurobiological Mechanisms, Diagnoses and Therapies.
38397100|a|Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), affecting over 2% of the pre-school children population, includes an important fraction of the conditions accounting for the heterogeneity of autism. The disease was discovered 75 years ago, and the present review, based on critical evaluations of the recognized ASD studies from the beginning of 1990, has been further developed by the comparative analyses of the research and clinical reports, which have grown progressively in recent years up to late 2023. The tools necessary for the identification of the ASD disease and its related clinical pathologies are genetic and epigenetic mutations affected by the specific interaction with transcription factors and chromatin remodeling processes occurring within specific complexes of brain neurons. Most often, the ensuing effects induce the inhibition/excitation of synaptic structures sustained primarily, at dendritic fibers, by alterations of flat and spine response sites. These effects are relevant because synapses, established by specific interactions of neurons with glial cells, operate as early and key targets of ASD. The pathology of children is often suspected by parents and communities and then confirmed by ensuing experiences. The final diagnoses of children and mature patients are then completed by the combination of neuropsychological (cognitive) tests and electro-/magneto-encephalography studies developed in specialized centers. ASD comorbidities, induced by processes such as anxieties, depressions, hyperactivities, and sleep defects, interact with and reinforce other brain diseases, especially schizophrenia. Advanced therapies, prescribed to children and adult patients for the control of ASD symptoms and disease, are based on the combination of well-known brain drugs with classical tools of neurologic and psychiatric practice. Overall, this review reports and discusses the advanced knowledge about the biological and medical properties of ASD.
