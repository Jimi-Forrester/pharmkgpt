30475768|a|BACKGROUND: Identifying protective factors that promote healthy cognitive aging is of importance due to the growing older adult population. Preventing chronic hyperglycemia may be one such way to preserve cognitive abilities, as high blood glucose levels have been associated with cognitive impairment and decline. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of blood glucose levels on cognition among older adults using common neuropsychological tests and a spatial navigation task. METHODS: The association between cognitive performance and blood glucose levels was assessed among 117 older adults classified as cognitively healthy, subjective cognitive decline, amnestic mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer's disease dementia from the Czech Brain Aging Study. Cognitive abilities were measured by tests of verbal memory, nonverbal memory, working memory, visuospatial skills, and executive function. A test of spatial navigation known as the Hidden Goal Task was also used. Blood glucose levels were measured by glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Analyses were performed using multiple linear regression controlling for age, gender, education, depressive symptoms, diabetes, and cognitive status. RESULTS: A significant relationship was observed for HbA1c and executive function performance (beta = -2.46, SE = 0.92, p = 0.008). Following moderation analysis, this relationship was significant only among those with cognitive impairment (beta = -4.37, SE = 1.28, p = 0.001, 95% CI [-6.91, -1.83]). Associations between HbA1c and other cognitive domains were not significant (ps > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Higher HbA1c was associated with poorer executive function among persons with cognitive impairment, but not with performance on other cognitive domains. Maintaining proper glucoregulation may help preserve executive function performance among cognitively impaired older adults.
