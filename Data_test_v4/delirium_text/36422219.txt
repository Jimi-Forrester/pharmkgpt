36422219|t|Assessing the Safety of Total Intravenous Anesthesia with Remimazolam in General Anesthesia for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation of Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis: A Case Series.
36422219|a|Background and Objectives: In patients with severe aortic stenosis (sAS), it is crucial to maintain hemodynamic stability during the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). In this study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of remimazolam in maintaining hemodynamic stability during anesthetic induction and maintenance. Cases: TAVI was performed on seven patients with sAS, and remimazolam was administered for total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) of general anesthesia with induction (3.0 mg/kg/h) and maintenance (1.0 mg/kg/h). All patients underwent TAVI without major hemodynamic concerns and later recovered. Conclusions: Remimazolam can be safely used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia in patients with sAS when performing TAVI.
