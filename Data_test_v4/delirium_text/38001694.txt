38001694|t|The Potential Preventive and Therapeutic Roles of NSAIDs in Prostate Cancer.
38001694|a|Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most common type of cancer and the leading cause of death among men worldwide. Preventing the progression of cancer after treatments such as radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy is a major concern faced by prostate cancer patients. Inflammation, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, the microbiome, obesity and a high-fat diet, is considered to be the main cause of PC. Inflammatory cells are believed to play a crucial role in tumor progression. Therefore, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with their effects on the treatment of inflammation-related diseases, can prevent cancer and its progression by suppressing various inflammatory pathways. Recent evidence shows that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer. In this review, we discuss the different pathways through which these drugs exert their potential preventive and therapeutic effects on prostate cancer.
