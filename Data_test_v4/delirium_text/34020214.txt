34020214|a|Coronavirus is known to cause various systemic infections both in human and animal which are mostly mild in nature. However, recent years have seen major pandemics caused by coronavirus which are very invasive and virulent in nature. The recent SARS-CoV2 is a new addition to this list of coronavirus pandemics. So the present study was done to systematically review the CNS involvement and its manifestations in SARS-CoV2 positive patients. Systemic review of article published between 1st Dec 2019 to 31st July 2020 searched through web-based database of MEDLINE (Pubmed) and Google scholar using following keywords "COVID -19" OR "CORONAVIRUS" OR "SARS-CoV2" AND "NEUROLOGICAL" OR "CNS" OR "BRAIN". Using the steps of systemic review eight article were selected for qualitative analysis. Majority of these article were reporting neurological symptoms among patients admitted in different wards along with others general symptoms. None of the study was specifically devoted to study the neurological manifestations and complications in SARS-CoV2 positive patients. The present study concludes that there is a scarcity of good quality research which attempts to establish the role of SARS-CoV2 infection in CNS and its manifestations. However, there are evidences that CNS involvement is present in majority of the patients. Proper documentation of theses involvement and indentification of these into mild, moderate and severe infection will help in early identification and treatment of these patients.
