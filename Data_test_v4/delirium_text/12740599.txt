12740599|t|Islet-brain1/C-Jun N-terminal kinase interacting protein-1 (IB1/JIP-1) promoter variant is associated with Alzheimer's disease.
12740599|a|Islet-brain1 (IB1) or c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase interacting protein-1 (JIP-1), the product of the MAPK8IP1 gene, functions as a neuronal scaffold protein to allow signalling specificity. IB1/JIP-1 interacts with many cellular components including the reelin receptor ApoER2, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), kinesin and the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein. Coexpression of IB1/JIP-1 with other components of the c-Jun NH2 terminal-kinase (JNK) pathway activates the JNK activity; conversely, selective disruption of IB1/JIP-1 in mice reduces the stress-induced apoptosis of neuronal cells. We therefore hypothesized that IB1/JIP-1 is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). By immunocytochemistry, we first colocalized the presence of IB1/JIP-1 with JNK and phosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles. We next identified a -499A>G polymorphism in the 5' regulatory region of the MAPK8IP1 gene. In two separate French populations the -499A>G polymorphism of MAPK8IP1 was not associated with an increased risk to AD. However, when stratified on the +766C>T polymorphism of exon 3 of the LRP gene, the IB1/JIP-1 polymorphism was strongly associated with AD in subjects bearing the CC genotype in the LRP gene. The functional consequences of the -499A>G polymorphism of MAPK8IP1 was investigated in vitro. In neuronal cells, the G allele increased transcriptional activity and was associated with an enhanced binding activity. Taken together, these data indicate that the increased transcriptional activity in the presence of the G allele of MAPK8IP1 is a risk factor to the onset of in patients bearing the CC genotype of the LRP gene.
