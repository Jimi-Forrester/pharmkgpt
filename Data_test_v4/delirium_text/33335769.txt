33335769|a|The 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (COVID-19), has been a worldwide urgent public health threat, resulting in six-hundred seventy thousand deaths to date. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a series of public health challenges. One such challenge is the management of diseases such as chronic neurological diseases during an epidemic event. COVID-19 affects all kinds of people, including older people with chronic underlying diseases, who are particularly at risk of severe infection or even death. Chronic neurological diseases such as epilepsy, dementia, Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS) are frequently associated with comorbidities; thus, these patients are in the high-risk category. Therefore, in this article, we review associations and challenges the people with epilepsy, dementia, PD, and MS faces during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest approaches to provide consensus recommendations on how to provide the best possible care.
