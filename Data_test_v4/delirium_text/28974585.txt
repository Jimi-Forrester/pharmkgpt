28974585|t|Routine screening in the general hospital: what happens after discharge to those identified as at risk of dementia?
28974585|a|Cognitive screening is recommended for older patients with unplanned hospital admission. We determined rates of reassessment/specialist memory referral after routine inclusion of at risk of dementia status in discharge documentation to primary care. Questionnaires were sent to relevant GP practices on consecutive patients aged >=75 years identified as at risk and discharged 6 months earlier. Among 53 patients (mean age +-SD = 87.3+-6.0 years, mean+-SD Abbreviated Mental Test Score = 4.4+-2.7), 49 (92%) patients had been reviewed since discharge, and 12/43 (28%) without previously known cognitive problem had had a cognitive reassessment. The most common reasons for non-assessment/referral included clinical factors (eg terminal illness/comorbidities) (n=15) and patient/family wishes (n=5) and that confusion was expected in unwell older patients (n=5). Routine cognitive reassessment/specialist referral appears unjustified in patients identified as at risk of dementia during unplanned hospital admission. However, the prognostic value of delirium/confusion in acute illness is under-recognised and could be used to highlight those at risk.
