31431802|a|In our article, we asked whether Sox2, a transcription factor important in brain development and disease, is involved in gene regulation through its action on long-range interactions between promoters and distant enhancers. Our findings highlight that Sox2 shapes a genome-wide network of promoter-enhancer interactions, acting by direct binding to these elements. Sox2 loss affects the three-dimensional (3D) genome and decreases the activity of a subset of genes involved in Sox2-bound interactions. At least one of such downregulated genes, Socs3, is critical for long-term neural stem cell maintenance. These results point to the possibility of identifying a transcriptional network downstream to Sox2, and involved in neural stem cell maintenance. In addition, interacting Sox2-bound enhancers are often connected to genes which are relevant, in man, to neurodevelopmental disease; this may facilitate the detection of functionally relevant mutations in regulatory elements in man, contributing to neural disease.
