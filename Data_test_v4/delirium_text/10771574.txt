10771574|t|[Three patients with systemic sclerosis complicated by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia].
10771574|a|Clinical profiles and the treatment process of three female patients with systemic sclerosis (cases 1, 2, and 3) complicated by thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TMHA) were described. Thrombocytopenia preceded renal damage and hypertension in cases 1 and 2, although the chronological relationship between these parameters were unknown in case 3. Plasma exchange therapy using fresh frozen plasma was beneficial in cases 1 and 2. Cases land 3 presented with delirium and fluctuating psychosis, respectively. Early detection of thrombocytopenia and insidious hemolysis might be essential for starting effective plasmapheresis treatment in a part of patients with scleroderma kidney who present with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) like disorder.
