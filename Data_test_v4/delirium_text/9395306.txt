9395306|t|Hemin and related porphyrins inhibit beta-amyloid aggregation.
9395306|a|Porphyrins related to the naturally occurring pigment heme were found to effectively interfere with the aggregation of beta-amyloid peptides as determined by an immunoassay configured for the detection of beta-amyloid oligomers. Oligomerisation of beta-amyloid is believed to be a key event in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Inhibition of this aggregation is thus an important strategy in combating this commonest form of senile dementia. Evidence was also generated for hemin and hematin mediated protection of cultured cells against the neurotoxic effects of beta-amyloid. These data are discussed with reference to the known pathology of Alzheimer's disease and the chemistry of porphyrins.
