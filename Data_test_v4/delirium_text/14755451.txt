14755451|a|Susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to be regulated by multiple genetic factors. Recently, three independent studies have reported that loci on chromosome 10q are linked with AD, and the insulin degrading enzyme (IDE; MIM 146680) gene located on chromosome 10q23-q25; IDE is located close to the maker D10S583, which exhibits a maximum LOD score for late-onset AD. We examined seven polymorphisms in the IDE gene, the marker D10S583 in the 5' flanking region, and SNPs in introns 1, 3, 11, 20, 21, and 22 (rs#1999764, 1855915, 1970244, 538469, 551266, and 489517, respectively). Four SNPs in introns 3, 11, 20, and 22 did not exhibit any polymorphisms in the Japanese population that was studied. D10S583 and two SNPs in introns 1 and 21 did not exhibit a significant association with early- or late-onset AD. In addition, no associations were observed for subgroups of AD grouped according to APOE status. The present study indicates that the IDE gene polymorphisms do not confer susceptibility to early- or late-onset AD at least in a Japanese population.
