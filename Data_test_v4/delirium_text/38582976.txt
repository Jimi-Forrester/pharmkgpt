38582976|t|Metabolomic Analysis in Saliva and Different Brain Regions of Older Mice with Postoperative Delirium Behaviors.
38582976|a|Objective: Postoperative delirium (POD) has become a critical challenge with severe consequences and increased incidences as the global population ages. However, the underlying mechanism is yet unknown. Our study aimed to explore the changes in metabolites in three specific brain regions and saliva of older mice with postoperative delirium behavior and to identify potential non-invasive biomarkers. Methods: Eighteen-month-old male C57/BL6 mice were randomly assigned to the anesthesia/surgery or control group. Behavioral tests were conducted 24 h before surgery and 6, 9, and 24 h after surgery. Complement C3 (C3) and S100 calcium-binding protein B protein (S100beta) levels were measured in the hippocampus, and a metabolomics analysis was performed on saliva, hippocampus, cortex, and amygdala samples. Results: In total, 43, 33, 38, and 14 differential metabolites were detected in the saliva, hippocampus, cortex, and amygdala, respectively. "Pyruvate" "alpha-linolenic acid" and "2-oleoyl-1-palmitoy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine" are enriched in one common pathway and may be potential non-invasive biomarkers for POD. Common changes were observed in the three brain regions, with the upregulation of 1-methylhistidine and downregulation of D-glutamine. Conclusion: Dysfunctions in energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and neurotransmitter dysregulation are implicated in the development of POD. The identification of changes in the level of salivary metabolite biomarkers could aid in the development of noninvasive diagnostic methods for POD.
