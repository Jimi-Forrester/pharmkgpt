33921385|t|Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy: Update on Current Clinical Diagnosis and Management.
33921385|a|Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a disease afflicting individuals exposed to repetitive neurotrauma. Unfortunately, diagnosis is made by postmortem pathologic analysis, and treatment options are primarily symptomatic. In this clinical update, we review clinical and pathologic diagnostic criteria and recommended symptomatic treatments. We also review animal models and recent discoveries from pre-clinical studies. Furthermore, we highlight the recent advances in diagnosis using diffusor tensor imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and the fluid biomarkers t-tau, sTREM2, CCL11, NFL, and GFAP. We also provide an update on emerging pharmaceutical treatments, including immunotherapies and those that target tau acetylation, tau phosphorylation, and inflammation. Lastly, we highlight the current literature gaps and guide future directions to further improve clinical diagnosis and management of patients suffering from this condition.
