36361868|t|CNS Pericytes Modulate Local T Cell Infiltration in EAE.
36361868|a|Pericytes at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are located between the tight endothelial cell layer of the blood vessels and astrocytic endfeet. They contribute to central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis by regulating BBB development and maintenance. Loss of pericytes results in increased numbers of infiltrating immune cells in the CNS in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS). However, little is known about their competence to modulate immune cell activation or function in CNS autoimmunity. To evaluate the capacity of pericytes to directly interact with T cells in an antigen-specific fashion and potentially (re)shape their function, we depleted major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II from pericytes in a cell type-specific fashion and performed T cell-pericyte cocultures and EAE experiments. We found that pericytes present antigen in vitro to induce T cell activation and proliferation. In an adoptive transfer EAE experiment, pericyte-specific MHC II KO resulted in locally enhanced T cell infiltration in the CNS; even though, overall disease course of mice was not affected. Thus, pericytes may serve as non-professional antigen-presenting cells affecting states of T cell activation, thereby locally shaping lesion formation in CNS inflammation but without modulating disease severity.
