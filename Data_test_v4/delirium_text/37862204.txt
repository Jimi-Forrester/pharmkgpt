37862204|a|Tauopathies are a group of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, which involve progressive neurodegeneration, cognitive deficits, and aberrant tau protein accumulation. The development of tauopathies cannot currently be stopped or slowed down by treatment measures. Given the significant contribution of tau burden in primary tauopathies and the strong association between pathogenic tau accumulation and cognitive deficits, there has been a lot of interest in creating therapies that can alleviate tau pathology and render neuroprotective effects. Recently, small molecules, immunotherapies, and gene therapy have been used to reduce the pathological tau burden and prevent neurodegeneration in animal models of tauopathies. However, the major pitfall of the current therapeutic approach is the difficulty of drugs and gene-targeting modalities to cross the blood-brain barrier and their unintended side effects. In this review, the current therapeutic strategies used for tauopathies including the use of oligonucleotide-based gene therapy approaches that have shown a promising result for the treatment of tauopathies and Alzheimer's disease in preclinical animal models, have been discussed.
