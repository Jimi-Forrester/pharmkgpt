38307226|t|Outcomes Following Use of Bovine Pericardium (Xenoprosthetic) Grafts for Reconstruction of Mycotic Aortic Aneurysms and Infected Aortic Grafts: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
38307226|a|BACKGROUND: Infected aortic grafts and mycotic aneurysms represent one of the most complex challenges faced by vascular surgeons. Treatment has progressed from extra-anatomical bypass to in situ reconstruction. Additionally, bovine pericardium reconstruction (BPR) has increased, due to accessibility and reduced lower limb morbidity. There remains, however, limited evidence for its use. The aim is to pool all known data to understand outcomes following BPR of mycotic aneurysms or infected vascular grafts. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in November 2021 with subsequent computerized meta-analysis of the pooled results and a final search in March 2022. Three databases, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and National Institutes of Health PubMed (PubMed), were searched for the search term "(bovine OR xenoprosthetic) AND (aneurysm)", according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. RESULTS: From 9 studies, there were 133 patients: 67% graft infections and 33% mycotic aneurysms. Fifty-seven percent of reconstructions were in the abdominal aorta and 33% were in the thoracic aorta. One hundred fifty-eight pathogens were identified, including Staphylococcus aureus (23%), Candida albicans (13%), and Escherichia coli (13%). In 12%, no microorganisms were identified. Thirty-day mortality was 19.14% (CI 10.83-28.71), late mortality was 19.08% (confidence interval [CI] 7.76-32.83), and overall mortality was 40.20% (CI 29.82-50.97). One patient died intraoperatively. There were a total of 151 in-hospital complications after 30 days postoperation. Common complications were acute renal failure (17%), pneumonia (14%), delirium (12%), respiratory insufficiency (11%) and renal insufficiency (7%). Lower limb ischemia was low, occurring in 5.66% (CI 0.54-13.82) of patients. Loss of graft patency leading to reintervention occurred in 1.20% (CI 0.00-7.71) of the grafts. Reinfection rate was 0.00% (CI 0.00-1.21). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis highlights low reinfection and high graft patency using BPR with medium-length follow-up; however, there remain limited long-term and comparative data regarding options for aortic reconstruction. As expected in this complex cohort, the complication rate and 30-day mortality remain high.
