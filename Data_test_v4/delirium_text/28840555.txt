28840555|t|Can Astrocytes Be a Target for Precision Medicine?
28840555|a|Astrocytes are the most abundant non-neural cell type residing within the central nervous system (CNS) displaying tremendous heterogeneity depending on their location. Once believed to be 'passive support cells for electrically active neurons', astrocytes are now recognised to play an active role in brain homeostasis by forming connections with the surrounding neurons, microglia and endothelial cells. Most importantly, they provide an optimum microenvironment for functional neurons through regulation of the blood brain barrier, energy supply and removal of debris and toxic waste.Their dysfunction has been identified as a potential contributing factor for several neurodegenerative disorders, from Alzheimer's Disease to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.In this chapter, we will explore the implications of astrocyte dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases and how these cells can be used as therapeutic targets in precision medicine.
