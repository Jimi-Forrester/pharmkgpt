36852655|a|Resveratrol is a polyphenol with diverse pharmacological activities, but its clinical efficacy is limited due to low solubility/permeability, light-induced isomerization, auto-oxidation, and rapid metabolism. Nanodelivery systems, such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, lipid nanocarriers, micelles, nanocrystals, inorganic nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, protein-based nanoparticles, exosomes, macrophages, and red blood cells (RBCs) have shown great potential for improving the solubility, biocompatibility, and therapeutic efficacy of resveratrol. This review comprehensively summarizes the recent advances in resveratrol nanoencapsulation and describes potential strategies to improve the pharmacokinetics of existing nanoformulations, enhance targeting, reduce toxicity, and increase drug release and encapsulation efficiency. The article also suggests that in order to avoid potential safety issues, resveratrol nanoformulations must be tested in vivo in a wide range of diseases.
