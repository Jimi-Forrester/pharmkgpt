24000923|t|Familial Alzheimer's disease Osaka mutant (DeltaE22) beta-barrels suggest an explanation for the different Abeta1-40/42 preferred conformational states observed by experiment.
24000923|a|An unusual DeltaE693 mutation in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) producing a beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide lacking glutamic acid at position 22 (Glu22) was recently discovered, and dabbed the Osaka mutant (DeltaE22). Previously, several point mutations in the Abeta peptide involving Glu22 substitutions were identified and implicated in the early onset of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Despite the absence of Glu22, the Osaka mutant is also associated with FAD, showing a recessive inheritance in families affected by the disease. To see whether this aggregation-prone Abeta mutant could directly relate to the Abeta ion channel-mediated mechanism as observed for the wild type (WT) Abeta peptide in AD pathology, we modeled Osaka mutant beta-barrels in a lipid bilayer. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, two conformer DeltaE22 barrels with the U-shaped monomer conformation derived from NMR-based WT Abeta fibrils were simulated in explicit lipid environment. Here, we show that the DeltaE22 barrels obtain the lipid-relaxed beta-sheet channel topology, indistinguishable from the WT Abeta1-42 barrels, as do the outer and pore dimensions of octadecameric (18-mer) DeltaE22 barrels. Although the DeltaE22 barrels lose the cationic binding site in the pore which is normally provided by the negatively charged Glu22 side chains, the mutant pores gain a new cationic binding site by Glu11 at the lower bilayer leaflet, and exhibit ion fluctuations similar to the WT barrels. Of particular interest, this deletion mutant suggests that toxic WT Abeta1-42 would preferentially adopt a less C-terminal turn similar to that observed for Abeta17-42, and explains why the solid state NMR data for Abeta1-40 point to a more C-terminal turn conformation. The observed DeltaE22 barrels conformational preferences also suggest an explanation for the lower neurotoxicity in rat primary neurons as compared to WT Abeta1-42.
