38640099|t|Protocol for a magnetic resonance imaging study of participants in the fever RCT: Does fever control prevent brain injury in malaria?
38640099|a|BACKGROUND: Despite eradication efforts, ~135,000 African children sustained brain injuries as a result of central nervous system (CNS) malaria in 2021. Newer antimalarial medications rapidly clear peripheral parasitemia and improve survival, but mortality remains high with no associated decline in post-malaria neurologic injury. A randomized controlled trial of aggressive antipyretic therapy with acetaminophen and ibuprofen (Fever RCT) for malarial fevers being conducted in Malawi and Zambia began enrollment in 2019. We propose to use neuroimaging in the context of the RCT to further evaluate neuroprotective effects of aggressive antipyretic therapy. METHODS: This observational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ancillary study will obtain neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes in children previously enrolled in the Fever RCT at 1- and 12-months post discharge. Analysis will compare the odds of any brain injury between the aggressive antipyretic therapy and usual care groups based upon MRI structural abnormalities. For children unable to undergo imaging without deep sedation, neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes will be used to identify brain injury. DISCUSSION: Neuroimaging is a well-established, valid proxy for neurological outcomes after brain injury in pediatric CNS malaria. This MRI ancillary study will add value to the Fever RCT by determining if treatment with aggressive antipyretic therapy is neuroprotective in CNS malaria. It may also help elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) of neuroprotection and expand upon FEVER RCT safety assessments.
