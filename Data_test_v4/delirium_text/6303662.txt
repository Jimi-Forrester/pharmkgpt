6303662|t|The EEG in chronic alcoholism.
6303662|a|The EEG has only rarely been considered in discussions on psychosis in alcoholism. The main topic of this paper is the question whether the EEG is capable of revealing elements for elucidating the pathophysiology of some of the psychotic conditions or symptoms occurring in alcoholism. Although EEG abnormalities are a-specific in nature and no particular EEG signs may be consistent with psychosis, some types of EEG patterns are more frequently observed in certain clinical conditions such as delirium tremens and amnestic-confabulatory states. Taking these 'common' EEG-patterns into account, it may be possible to use the EEG as a diagnostic tool in differentiating between clinical psychopathological syndromes. The pathogenetic importance of tissue hypoxidosis for the development of psychosis in alcoholism is discussed.
