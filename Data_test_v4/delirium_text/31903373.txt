31903373|t|Traumatic Atlantoaxial Dislocation with an Odontoid Fracture: A Rare and Potentially Fatal Injury.
31903373|a|Traumatic dislocation of the atlanto-axial joint in combination with an odontoid fracture remains a rare entity. Beaucause of its instability, it's alsoo a seriuous injury. A fatal outcome is feared especially in elderly. We report a case of 74-year-old man who presented with neck pain Confusion and spastic tetraparesia after a low energy trauma. Radiographs and computed tomography demonstrated a C1C2 dislocation with odontoid fracture. After an unsuccessful attempt at closed reduction with halo traction, a surgical stabilisation was performed using a posterior approach. Death was occured in early postoperative due to respiratory distress.
