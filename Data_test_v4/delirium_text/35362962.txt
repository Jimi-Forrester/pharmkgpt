35362962|t|Cross-Reactive Fluorescent Sensor Array for Discrimination of Amyloid Beta Aggregates.
35362962|a|It has been hypothesized that misfolding and misassembly of proteins into various aggregation states contribute to several neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation is considered a major factor in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Herein, a fluorescent sensor array for detecting Abeta aggregates was fabricated using two probe pairs of conjugated polyelectrolytes and organic dye molecules, PPE1-Thioflavin T (ThT) and PPESO3-Nile Red (NR). Pattern recognition was achieved by linear discriminant analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis algorithms. As a result of distinguishing among monomers and three pure aggregate species, namely oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils, the cross-reactive sensor array was also able to monitor aggregation kinetics in various aggregate forms and distinguish between on- and off- aggregate pathways. Our study provides a convenient approach for simultaneous detection of Abeta aggregates in mixtures, which may also be applied to the analysis of other disease-related proteins that are prone to aggregates.
