37884773|t|Ketamine sedation in the intensive care unit: a survey of Canadian intensivists.
37884773|a|PURPOSE: We sought to understand the beliefs and practices of Canadian intensivists regarding their use of ketamine as a sedative in critically ill patients and to gauge their interest in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining its use in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We designed and validated an electronic self-administered survey examining the use of ketamine as a sedative infusion for ICU patients. We surveyed 400 physician members of the Canadian Critical Care Society (CCCS) via email between February and April 2022 and sent three reminders at two-week intervals. The survey was redistributed in January 2023 to improve the response rate. RESULTS: We received 87/400 (22%) completed questionnaires. Most respondents reported they rarely use ketamine as a continuous infusion for sedation or analgesia in the ICU (52/87, 58%). Physicians reported the following conditions would make them more likely to use ketamine: asthma exacerbation (73/87, 82%), tolerance to opioids (68/87, 77%), status epilepticus (44/87, 50%), and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (33/87, 38%). Concern for side-effects that limited respondents' use of ketamine include adverse psychotropic effects (61/87, 69%) and delirium (47/87, 53%). The majority of respondents agreed there is need for an RCT to evaluate ketamine as a sedative infusion in the ICU (62/87, 71%). CONCLUSION: This survey of Canadian intensivists illustrates that use of ketamine as a continuous infusion for sedation is limited, and is at least partly driven by concerns of adverse psychotropic effects. Canadian physicians endorse the need for a trial investigating the safety and efficacy of ketamine as a sedative for critically ill patients.
