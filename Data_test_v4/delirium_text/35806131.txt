35806131|a|In this work, the investigation of type and inhibitory strength of catalase by two pairs of aminoalkanol derivatives (1,7 diEthyl- and 1,7-diMethyl-8,9-diphenyl-4-azatricyclo (5.2.1.02.6) dec-8-ene- 3,5,10-trione) has been presented. The obtained results allowed for the determination of all kinetic parameters (Km, Vmax, slope angles of Lineweaver-Burk plots, Ki and IC50) on the basis of which it was shown that all four aminoalkanol derivatives are competitive inhibitors of catalase. However, the strength of action of each of them depends on the type of substituents present in the main structure of the molecule. Subtle differences in the potency of individual derivatives were possible to detect thanks to the developed, sensitive method of capillary electrophoresis, which allowed simultaneous monitoring of the mutual changes in the concentrations of substrates and products of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. Detailed values of kinetic parameters showed that all derivatives are weak inhibitors of catalase, which in this case is a big advantage because each inhibition of catalase activity is associated with a greater amount of accumulated, harmful reactive oxygen species. The results of docking studies also show the convergence of the binding energies values of individual inhibitors with all kinetic parameters of the investigated catalase inhibition and thus additionally confirm the weak inhibitory strength of all four aminoalkanol derivatives.
