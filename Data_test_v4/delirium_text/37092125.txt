37092125|t|The effects of amyloid beta aggregation on neuronal transcription.
37092125|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating condition that impairs cognition and episodic memory. AD is well known for its behavioural phenotype however, knowing its cellular pathology, which is primarily based on the presence of amyloid beta (Abeta) in various aggregation states, is crucial for the development of research efforts against the disorder. The most notable of these aggregation states are the oligomeric and fibril forms of Abeta. This paper aims to describe the transcriptomic profile of neuronal cells exposed to these aggregation states in order to better understand the disorder and identify potential therapeutic genetic targets. The primary findings of this paper illustrate the significant effects of Abeta on genes associated with metabolism as well as the dramatically increased effects of oligomeric Abeta relative to fibril Abeta with respect to the overall changes in gene expression. The presented results also support the further examination of the role of GTPases in the deleterious effects of Abeta.
