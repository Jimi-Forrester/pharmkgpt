37151483|a|The genus Nepeta, belonging to the family Lamiaceae, includes about 300 species, most of which are used in folk medicine due to their pronounced biological properties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the agrobiological characteristics of Nepeta transcaucasica (N. transcaucasica) Grossh. and Nepeta cataria (N. cataria) L., cultivated in Bulgaria, and obtain their essential oils and determine their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. The agrobiological characteristics of the two species growing in Kazanlak were analyzed; therefore, high variability in the population of N. transcaucasica and comparative homogeneity in N. cataria was shown. The species N. transcaucasica contained 0.28% essential oil with main components beta-citronellol (52.05%), eucalyptol (7.34%), beta-citronellal (6.06%), germacrene D (5.45%), (Z)-beta-ocimene (5.14%), and beta-caryophyllene (3.06%). The species N. cataria consisted of 0.19% essential oil with main components beta-citronellol (26.31%), geraniol (15.92%), neral (11.45%), nerol (9.56%), carvacrol (6.04%), and beta-citronellal (5.35%). The antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Abony was determined. The essential oils showed antimicrobial activity only against E. coli. The diameters of the inhibition zones were found to be 26 mm for the species N. transcaucasica and 10 mm for the species N. cataria. The antioxidant activity of the two essential oils was also determined by four different methods, DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and CUPRAC, with the highest values for the ABTS radical, for the species N. transcaucasica (48.72 muM TE/mL), and the species N. cataria (310 muM TE/mL).
