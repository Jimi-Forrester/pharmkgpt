32619524|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a highly prevalent and preventable neuropsychiatric condition with major health consequences. Thiamine deficiency is a well-established cause of delirium in those with chronic, severe alcoholism, but there remains an underappreciation of its significance in non-alcoholic populations, including patients with cancer. Treatment of suspected thiamine-related mental status changes with high dose intravenous (IV) thiamine has preliminary evidence for improving a variety of cognitive symptoms in oncology inpatient settings but has never been studied for the prevention of delirium in any population. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine if high dose IV thiamine can prevent delirium in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for treatment of cancer. Secondary objectives are to determine if thiamine status is predictive of delirium onset and if high dose IV thiamine can attenuate the deleterious impact of delirium on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), functional status, and long-term neuropsychiatric outcomes. METHODS: In this phase II study, we are recruiting 60 patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, randomizing them to treatment with high dose IV thiamine (n = 30) versus placebo (n = 30), and systematically evaluating all participants for delirium and related comorbidities. We use the Delirium Rating Scale to measure the severity and duration of delirium during hospitalization for HSCT. We obtain thiamine levels weekly during the transplantation hospitalization. We assess HRQOL, functional status, depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and cognitive function prior to and at one, three, and six months after transplantation.
