39597835|a|Background: Attention deficits are notable in Lewy body dementia (LBD) and in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalograph (EEG) to detect neural correlates of attention dysfunctions in LBD and AD. Methods: We recruited 33 patients with LBD, 15 patients with AD and 19 elderly healthy controls. The participants performed the modified Attention Network Task (ANT) to investigate the attention dysfunctions. Results: We found that LBD had alerting attention deficits and AD showed apparent orienting attention dysfunctions, while LBD and AD maintained relatively normal executive/conflict attention. Based on source-level EEG analyses, LBD had frontal-central deficits for alerting attention while AD showed inferior frontal and precentral impairments for orienting attention. In addition, the insular and inferior frontal areas were hyper-activated in LBD and AD for executive/conflict attention. Apart from these areas, LBD showed activity in the complementary temporal-central-occipital network for the modified ANT task. Furthermore, the oscillational sources for the ANT effects indicated that the alpha and theta bands were partly impaired in dementia patients. Conclusions: In summary, using source-localised EEG, we found that attention dysfunctions in LBD and AD engaged different neural networks.
