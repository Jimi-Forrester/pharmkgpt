38393012|t|Metabolomics Reveals Antioxidant Metabolites in Colored Rice Grains.
38393012|a|Colored rice is richer in nutrients and contains more nutrients and bioactive substances than ordinary white rice. Moderate consumption of black (purple) rice has a variety of physiological effects, such as antioxidant effects, blood lipid regulation, and blood sugar control. Therefore, we utilized nontargeted metabolomics, quantitative assays for flavonoid and phenolic compounds, and physiological and biochemical data to explore the correlations between metabolites and the development of antioxidant characteristics in pigmented rice seeds. The findings indicated that, among Yangjinnuo 818 (YJN818), Hongnuo (HN), Yangchannuo 1 hao (YCN1H), and Yangzi 6 hao (YZ6H), YZ6H exhibited the highest PAL activity, which was 2.13, 3.08, and 3.25 times greater than those of YJN818, HN, and YCN1H, respectively. YZ6H likewise exhibited the highest flavonoid content, which was 3.8, 7.06, and 35.54 times greater than those of YJN818, HN, and YCN1H, respectively. YZ6H also had the highest total antioxidant capacity, which was 2.42, 3.76, and 3.77 times greater than those of YJN818, HN, and YCN1H, respectively. Thus, purple rice grains have stronger antioxidant properties than other colored rice grains. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that trans-3,3',4',5,5',7-hexahydroxyflavanone, phorizin, and trilobatin in the YZ6H, HN, and YCN1H comparison groups all had area under the curve (AUC) values of 1. Phlorizin, trans-3,3',4',5,5',7-hexahydroxyflavanone, and trilobatin were recognized as indices of antioxidant capability in colored rice in this research. This research adds to the understanding of antioxidant compounds in pigmented rice, which can increase the nutritional value of rice and promote the overall well-being of individuals. This type of information is of immense importance in maintaining a balanced and healthy diet.
