28706328|t|Trypsin inhibitors demonstrate antioxidant activities, inhibit A549 cell proliferation, and increase activities of reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes.
28706328|a|OBJECTIVES: Protease inhibitors are one of the most promising and investigated subjects for their role in pharmacognostical and pharmacological studies. This study aimed to investigate antineoplastic and antioxidant activity of trypsin inhibitors (TIs) isolated from three plant sources and their inhibitory role in the cell line. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY: TIs were obtained from different plant sources. Antineoplastic potential on adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial cell line (A549) and normal Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) was determined using MTT assay. Activities of antioxidant enzyme, nitric oxide scavenger, superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, and glutathione peroxidase were assessed in cell lines incubated with and without TIs. The outcome was analyzed by spectrophotometer. RESULTS: TIs showed the higher cytotoxicity on A549 cells as compared to normal HEK cell line. TIs exhibited fair increase in antioxidant enzyme activity in A549 cells as compared to control. This might be one of the strategies of antineoplastic effect in cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study has reported the antioxidant and antineoplastic properties of these TIs for the first time in A549 cells (to the best of our knowledge). The results show that TIs possess ability to prevent cancer and diseases caused due to oxidative stress. Therefore, we conclude that TIs can be used as supplements along with the conventional drugs for increased efficacy in the treatment of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and cancer.
