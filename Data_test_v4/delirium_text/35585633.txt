35585633|t|Predictors of health-related quality of life after cardiac surgery: a systematic review.
35585633|a|BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is important in determining surgical success, particularly from the patients' perspective. AIMS: To identify predictors for HRQoL outcome after cardiac surgery in order to identify potentially modifiable factors where interventions to improve patient outcomes could be targeted. METHODS: Electronic databases (including MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase) were searched between January 2001 and December 2020 for studies determining predictors of HRQoL (using a recognised and validated tool) in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Data extraction and quality assessments were undertaken and data was summarised using descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis, as appropriate. RESULTS: Overall, 3924 papers were screened with 41 papers included in the review. Considerable methodological heterogeneity between studies was observed. Most were single-centre (75.6%) prospective observational studies (73.2%) conducted in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (n = 51.2%) using a version of the SF-36 (n = 63.4%). Overall, 103 independent predictors (62 pre-operative, five intra-operative and 36 post-operative) were identified, where 34 (33.0%) were reported in more than one study. Potential pre-operative modifiable predictors include alcohol use, BMI/weight, depression, pre-operative quality of life and smoking while in the post-operative period pain and strategies to reduce post-operative complications and intensive care and hospital length of stay are potential therapeutic targets. CONCLUSION: Despite a lack of consistency across studies, several potentially modifiable predictors were identified that could be targeted in interventions to improve patient or treatment outcomes. This may contribute to delivering more person-centred care involving shared decision-making to improve patient HRQoL after cardiac surgery.
