36411212|a|INTRODUCTION: Geriatric interventions may improve the care of hospitalized older adults with cancer, but information regarding their effect on geriatric-specific outcomes is lacking. We studied the effect of a specialized geriatrician-led inpatient geriatric management unit compared with a conventional internal medicine ward on the outcomes of hospitalized older adults with cancer in Mexico. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case-control study including persons aged >=65 years with solid malignancies who had a cancer-related hospitalization at a university-affiliated hospital in Mexico City. Patients hospitalized in a geriatric unit (cases) were paired 1:2 with those in internal medicine wards (controls). Matching criteria included: age (+/- five years), tumor type (according to International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10 code), and admission date (+/- three months). The association between being hospitalized in the geriatric unit on various outcomes was determined using conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: One hundred cases and 200 controls were included. Mean age was 75.3 years (standard deviation 6.4 years) and 53% had gastrointestinal tumors. No difference in median length-of-stay was found between cases and controls (9.0 days, vs. 9.5 days, p = 0.34). Hospitalization in the geriatric unit was associated with a reduced risk of delirium (odds ratio [OR] 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.80). Being hospitalized in the geriatric unit was not associated with an effect on hospital-acquired complications (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.47-1.45) or in-hospital mortality (OR 1.82, 95% CI 0.32-10.18). DISCUSSION: Among older Mexican adults hospitalized for a cancer-related diagnosis, receiving care in a geriatric management unit was associated to a decreased risk of delirium, without influencing other outcomes.
