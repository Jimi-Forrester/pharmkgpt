38561806|t|White matter hyperintensity patterns: associations with comorbidities, amyloid, and cognition.
38561806|a|BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are often measured globally, but spatial patterns of WMHs could underlie different risk factors and neuropathological and clinical correlates. We investigated the spatial heterogeneity of WMHs and their association with comorbidities, Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors, and cognition. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we studied 171 cognitively unimpaired (CU; median age: 65 years, range: 50 to 89) and 51 mildly cognitively impaired (MCI; median age: 72, range: 53 to 89) individuals with available amyloid (18F-flutementamol) PET and FLAIR-weighted images. Comorbidities were assessed using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS). Each participant's white matter was segmented into 38 parcels, and WMH volume was calculated in each parcel. Correlated principal component analysis was applied to the parceled WMH data to determine patterns of WMH covariation. Adjusted and unadjusted linear regression models were used to investigate associations of component scores with comorbidities and AD-related factors. Using multiple linear regression, we tested whether WMH component scores predicted cognitive performance. RESULTS: Principal component analysis identified four WMH components that broadly describe FLAIR signal hyperintensities in posterior, periventricular, and deep white matter regions, as well as basal ganglia and thalamic structures. In CU individuals, hypertension was associated with all patterns except the periventricular component. MCI individuals showed more diverse associations. The posterior and deep components were associated with renal disorders, the periventricular component was associated with increased amyloid, and the subcortical gray matter structures was associated with sleep disorders, endocrine/metabolic disorders, and increased amyloid. In the combined sample (CU + MCI), the main effects of WMH components were not associated with cognition but predicted poorer episodic memory performance in the presence of increased amyloid. No interaction between hypertension and the number of comorbidities on component scores was observed. CONCLUSION: Our study underscores the significance of understanding the regional distribution patterns of WMHs and the valuable insights that risk factors can offer regarding their underlying causes. Moreover, patterns of hyperintensities in periventricular regions and deep gray matter structures may have more pronounced cognitive implications, especially when amyloid pathology is also present.
