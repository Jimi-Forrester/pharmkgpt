36471220|t|Association of Coenzyme Q10 with Premature Ovarian Insufficiency.
36471220|a|The aim of the study was to analyze the relationship between levels of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and the risk of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). In this cross-sectional case-control study, 32 women with POI and 58 women with normal menstrual cycles were recruited. The serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), CoQ10 and total cholesterol were measured. The association of CoQ10 with POI was assessed using binary logistic regression analysis. The CoQ10/total cholesterol ratio was significantly lower in the women with POI than in the women with normal menstrual cycles (120.94 +- 25.35 nmol/mmol vs 138.97 +- 39.19 nmol/mmol, P = 0.021). The serum CoQ10/total cholesterol ratio was inversely associated with POI (the unadjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.984, 95% CI: 0.970-0.998, P = 0.027). The same trend was found after adjusting for confounding factors (such as age, body mass index, annual household income and education) (OR = 0.976, 95% CI: 0.956-0.996, P = 0.020). The serum CoQ10/total cholesterol ratio was inversely associated with POI, indicating that antioxidant deficiency may be a risk associated with the development of POI. CoQ10 may be a protective factor for ovarian tissue.
