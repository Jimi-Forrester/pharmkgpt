37769422|t|The human gut microbiome in critical illness: disruptions, consequences, and therapeutic frontiers.
37769422|a|With approximately 39 trillion cells and over 20 million genes, the human gut microbiome plays an integral role in both health and disease. Modern living has brought a widespread use of processed food and beverages, antimicrobial and immunomodulatory drugs, and invasive procedures, all of which profoundly disrupt the delicate homeostasis between the host and its microbiome. Of particular interest is the human gut microbiome, which is progressively being recognized as an important contributing factor in many aspects of critical illness, from predisposition to recovery. Herein, we describe the current understanding of the adverse impacts of standard intensive care interventions on the human gut microbiome and delve into how these microbial alterations can influence patient outcomes. Additionally, we explore the potential association between the gut microbiome and post-intensive care syndrome, shedding light on a previously underappreciated avenue that may enhance patient recuperation following critical illness. There is an impending need for future epidemiological studies to encompass detailed phenotypic analyses of gut microbiome perturbations. Interventions aimed at restoring the gut microbiome represent a promising therapeutic frontier in the quest to prevent and treat critical illnesses.
