12240029|a|Synthesis and characterisation of organochalcogens has demonstrated a high correlation between their electrochemical oxidation potential on the glassy carbon electrode, their activity in bioassays and an unprecedented antioxidant activity in neuronal cell culture (EC50 approximately 20 nM) making electrochemical methodology a valuable tool in drug design for Alzheimer's and related diseases.
