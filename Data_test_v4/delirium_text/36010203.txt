36010203|t|Long-Term Health Consequences of SARS-CoV-2: Assumptions Based on SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV Infections.
36010203|a|Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is one of the worst pandemics in the history of the world. It is the third coronavirus disease that has afflicted humans in a short span of time. The world appears to be recovering from the grasp of this deadly pandemic; still, its post-disease health effects are not clearly understood. It is evident that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients usually recovered over time; however, disease manifestation is reported to still exist in some patients even after complete recovery. The disease is known to have left irreversible damage(s) among some patients and these damages are expected to cause mild or severe degrees of health effects. Apart from the apparent damage to the lungs caused by SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-surviving patients display a wide spectrum of dysfunctions in different organ systems that is similar to what occurs with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS diseases. The major long COVID-19 manifestations include the following aspects: (1) central nervous system, (2) cardiovascular, (3) pulmonary, (4) gastrointestinal, (5) hematologic, (6) renal and (7) psycho-social systems. COVID-19 has a disease display manifestation in these organs and its related systems amongst a large number of recovered cases. Our study highlights the expected bodily consequences of the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the understanding of the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.
