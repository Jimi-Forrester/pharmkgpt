32987182|a|INTRODUCTION: An acute respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARSCOV2) is spreading from China since January 2020. Surprisingly, few cases of Covid-19 have been reported in people living with HIV (PLWHIV). METHODS: Here we present a series of 30 PLWHIV diagnosed for SARS-COV2 infection. The principal outcome was to describe clinical characteristics of this population. RESULTS: Eighteen (60%) patients were men, 10/30 (33,3%) women and 2/30 (6,7%) transgender women. Median age was 53,7 years (range 30-80 years) and 23/30 patients (76,7%) were born in a foreign country (out of France). The most common comorbidities were cardiovascular disease (11/30, 36,7%), hypertension (11/30, 36,7%), diabetes (9/30,30%) obesity (7/30, 23%) and chronic renal disease (5/30, 16,7%). Twenty (66,7%) patients presented overweight. Five patients (16,7%) had a Charlson comorbidity (Quan et al., 2011) score >=3. Twenty-seven (90%) patients were virologically suppressed.CD4 count was >500cell/mm 3 in 23/30 (76,6%) patients. An antiviral treatment for SARS-COV2 was administered, in addition to HIV treatment, in 5/30 patients (16,3%). Twenty-four patients (80%) recovered from covid-19, 3/30 (10%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, 2/30 (6,7%) patients died and 4/30 (13,3%) patients were still hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients were virologically suppressed with CD4>500 mm3. Risk factors were the same as those described in other SARS-COV2 series, suggesting that HIV infection is probably not an independent risk factor for covid-19.
