35228741|a|The discovery of insulin in 1921 revolutionized the treatment of diabetes and paved the way for numerous studies on hormone signalling networks and actions in peripheral tissues and in the central nervous system. Impaired insulin signalling, a hallmark of diabetes, is now established as a key component of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. Here, we review evidence showing that brain inflammation and activation of cellular stress response mechanisms comprise molecular underpinnings of impaired brain insulin signalling in AD and integrate impaired insulin signalling with AD pathology. Further, we highlight that insulin resistance is an important component of allostatic load and that allostatic overload can trigger insulin resistance. This bidirectional association between impaired insulin signalling and allostatic overload favours medical conditions that increase the risk of AD, including diabetes, obesity, depression, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Finally, we discuss how the integration of biological, social and lifestyle factors throughout the lifespan can contribute to the development of AD, underscoring the potential of social and lifestyle interventions to preserve brain health and prevent or delay AD.
