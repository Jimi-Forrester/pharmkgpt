30042869|a|Metals and metalloids play fundamental roles in many physiological processes in biological systems, but imbalance of these elements in the body may cause many diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and even cancers. Thus, to better understand the metallome in health and disease, quantitative determination of their localization, concentration, speciation, and related metabolism at cellular or subcellular levels is of great importance. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging, as a new generation of analytical technique, has been reported as an ideal tool to quantitatively map multiple metals and metalloids in tissues with reasonable sensitivity, specificity, and resolution. In the current review, we have introduced the general concept of XRF imaging technique, reviewed the recent advances using XRF imaging to investigate toxicology of metals and metalloids in life science, and discussed the roles of metals and metalloids in various diseases, including cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. We believe that future research on revealing the roles of metals and metalloids in biological systems will directly benefit from the important breakthroughs in developing XRF imaging techniques.
