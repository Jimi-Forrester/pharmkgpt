39009097|t|An integrated approach to identifying sex-specific genes, transcription factors, and pathways relevant to Alzheimer's disease.

Understanding the impact of sex on specific molecular mechanisms associated with AD remains a critical challenge to creating tailored therapeutic interventions. METHODS: The exploration of the sex-based differential impact on disease (SDID) in AD used a systematic review to first select transcriptomic studies of AD with data regarding sex in the period covering 2002 to 2021 with a focus on the primary brain regions affected by AD - the cortex (CT) and the hippocampus (HP). A differential expression analysis for each study and two tissue-specific meta-analyses were then performed. Focusing on the CT due to the presence of significant SDID-related alterations, a comprehensive functional characterization was conducted: protein-protein network interaction and over-representation analyses to explore biological processes and pathways and a VIPER analysis to estimate transcription factor activity. RESULTS: We selected 8 CT and 5 HP studies from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository for tissue-specific meta-analyses. We detected 389 significantly altered genes in the SDID comparison in the CT. Generally, female AD patients displayed more affected genes than males; we grouped said genes into six subsets according to their expression profile in female and male AD patients. Only subset I (repressed genes in female AD patients) displayed significant results during functional profiling. Female AD patients demonstrated more significant impairments in biological processes related to the regulation and organization of synapsis and pathways linked to neurotransmitters (glutamate and GABA) and protein folding, Abeta aggregation, and accumulation compared to male AD patients. These findings could partly explain why we observe more pronounced cognitive decline in female AD patients. Finally, we detected 23 transcription factors with different activation patterns according to sex, with some associated with AD for the first time. All results generated during this study are readily available through an open web resource Metafun-AD (https://bioinfo.cipf.es/metafun-ad/). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analyses indicate the existence of differences in AD-related mechanisms in female and male patients. These sex-based differences will represent the basis for new hypotheses and could significantly impact precision medicine and improve diagnosis and clinical outcomes in AD patients.
