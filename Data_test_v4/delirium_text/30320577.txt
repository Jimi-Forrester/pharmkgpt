30320577|t|Increased Insoluble Amyloid-beta Induces Negligible Cognitive Deficits in Old AppNL/NL Knock-In Mice.
30320577|a|Commonly used Alzheimer's disease mouse models are based on the ectopic overexpression of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, together with a mutant presenilin gene. Surprisingly, humanized APP knock-in mouse models carrying a single APP Swedish mutation (AppNL), failed to develop amyloid plaque aggregation or cognitive deficits. Here we characterized the effect of this mutation in more advanced ages. We show that 24-month-old AppNL/NL mice, despite presenting an age dependent increase in insoluble amyloid-beta oligomers in the prefrontal cortex, they do not develop amyloid plaque deposition, reactive gliosis, or cognitive deficits.
