24083199|t|Assessment of multifunctional contrast agent probes in neuroimaging: Implications of nanopharmaceutical therapeutic interventions.
24083199|a|Recently, a clear association has been found between the progression of motor neurodegenerative disorders (MNDs) and carotid atherosclerosis. Significant vascular abnormalities with arterial hypertension were shown to be in patients with familial antecedents of MNDs. The main scope of this work is to explore the feasibility of recently developed integrated nano-based imaging modalities for the assessment of early diagnosis of the inflammatory processes associated with the neurological disorder syndromes, with the implication of recently developed nanopharmaceutical therapeutic interventions.
