36690723|a|Aging increases the risk to develop Alzheimer's disease. Cardiovascular diseases might accelerate this process. Our study aimed at investigating the impact of heart failure on brain connectivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging at resting state. Here we show brain connectivity alterations related to heart failure and cognitive performance. Heart failure decreases brain connectivity in the precuneus. Precuneus dysconnectivity was associated with biomarkers of heart failure-left ventricular ejection fraction and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide-and cognitive performance, predominantly executive function. Meta-analytical data-mining approaches-conducted in the BrainMap and Neurosynth databases-revealed that social and executive cognitive functions are mainly associated with those neural networks. Remarkably, the precuneus, as identified in our study in a mid-life cohort, represents one central functional hub affected by Alzheimer's disease. A long-term follow-up investigation in our cohort after approximately nine years revealed more severe cognitive impairment in the group with heart failure than controls, where social cognition was the cognitive domain mainly affected, and not memory such as in Alzheimer's disease. In sum, our results indicate consistently an association between heart failure and decoupling of the precuneus from other brain regions being associated with social and executive functions. Further longitudinal studies are warranted elucidating etiopathological mechanisms.
