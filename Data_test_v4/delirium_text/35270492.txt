35270492|t|Profile of Patients with Dementia or Cognitive Impairment Hospitalized with a Proximal Femur Fracture Requiring Surgery.
35270492|a|This study reports the characteristics of patients with dementia or cognitive impairment hospitalized with a proximal femur fracture requiring surgery. METHODS: Multicentric descriptive longitudinal study conducted in three traumatology units, representing high-technology public hospitals across Spain. Data collection took place between August 2018 and December 2019 upon admission to hospital, discharge, one month and three months after discharge. RESULTS: Study participants (n = 174) were mainly women (81.6%), and the mean age was 90.7+- 6.3 years old. Significant statistical differences were noted in the decline of functional capacity at baseline and one month later, and after three months they had still not recovered. Malnutrition increased from baseline to the one-month follow-up. The use of physical restraints increased during hospitalization, especially bilateral bedrails and a belt in the chair/bed. After one month, 15.2% of patients had pressure ulcers. Although pain decreased, it was still present after three months. CONCLUSION: Hospitalization after hip surgery for elderly people with dementia or cognitive impairment negatively impacted their global health outcomes such as malnutrition and the development of pressure ulcers, falls, functional impairment and the use of physical restraints and pain management challenges. Hospitals should implement policy-makers' strategic dementia care plans to improve their outcomes.
