35319670|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utilization of benzodiazepines (BZD) in Brazilian older adults, based on the Pesquisa Nacional de Acesso, Utilizacao e Promocao do Uso Racional de Medicamentos (PNAUM - National Survey of Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines). METHODS: The PNAUM is a cross-sectional study conducted between 2013 and 2014, representing the Brazilian urban population. In the present study, we included 60 years or older (n = 9,019) individuals. We calculated the prevalence of BZD utilization in the 15 days prior to survey data collection according to independent variables, using a hierarchical Poisson regression model. A semistructured interview performed empirical data collection (household interview). RESULTS: The prevalence of BZD utilization in the older adults was 9.3% (95%CI: 8.3-10.4). After adjustments, BZD utilization was associated with female sex (PR = 1.88; 95%CI: 1.52-2.32), depression (PR = 5.31; 95%CI: 4.41-6, 38), multimorbidity (PR = 1.44; 95%CI: 1.20-1.73), emergency room visit or hospitalization in the last 12 months (PR = 1.42; 95%CI: 1.18-1.70 ), polypharmacy (PR = 1.26; 95%CI: 1.01-1.57) and poor or very poor self-rated health (PR = 4.16; 95%CI: 2.10-8.22). Utilization was lower in the North region (PR = 0.18; 95%CI: 0.13-0.27) and in individuals who reported abusive alcohol consumption in the last month (PR = 0.42; 95%CI: 0.19-0.94). CONCLUSION: Despite contraindications, results showed a high prevalence of BZD utilization in older adults, particularly in those with depression, and wide regional and sex differences.
