METHODS: Serum samples collected from 45 AD patients and 44 healthy controls were analyzed by automatic biochemical analyzer to detect the levels of blood glucose, insulin, blood lipids. The variables were evaluated statistically by SPSS 11.0. RESULTS: Serum total cholesterol (TC), insulin (INS), insulin sensitivity index (IAI) and body mass index (BMI) from AD patients were significantly higher than those from health controls (P < 0.05), whereas the insulin resistance index (IR) and insulin secretion index (IS) from AD patients were significantly lower than those from healthy controls (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The abnormality of blood lipids and insulin might have potentially harmful effects on central nervous system, of which especially the neurotoxic effect on amyloid (Abeta) neurotoxicity and tau protein phosphorylation might result in memory impairment. These suggested that high blood lipids and insulin resistance were probable risk factors of Alzheimer's disease.
