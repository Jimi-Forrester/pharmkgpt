38187297|t|The role of tryptophan derivatives as anti-kinetoplastid agents.
38187297|a|Kinetoplastids are the causative agents for a spectrum of vector-borne diseases including Leishmaniasis, Chagas disease and Trypanosomiasis that affect millions of people worldwide. In the absence of safe and effective vaccines, chemotherapy, in conjunction with vector control, remain the most significant control approach for kinetoplastid diseases. However, commercially available treatment for these neglected tropical diseases frequently ends up with toxic side effects and increasing resistance. To meet the rising need for innovative medications, alternative chemotherapeutic agents are required. Moreover, insights into target-based mode of action of chemotherapeutic agents are required if novel drugs that may outwit resistance to commercially available drugs are to be developed. Tryptophan has been implicated in a variety of diseases and disorders due to its fundamental role as a precursor to several bioactive metabolites, as well as its importance in the improvement of health and nutrition, diagnostics, and therapeutics. The regulation of tryptophan metabolism plays a fundamental role in the growth of kinetoplastids. Moreover, the levels of tryptophan may serve as a biomarker to distinguish between the stages of kinetoplastids making it an important amino acid to explore for drug targets. The main aim of this review is thus to provide a comprehensive literature synthesis of tryptophan derivatives to explore as potential anti-kinetoplastids. Here we highlight the role of tryptophan derivatives as chemotherapeutic agents against kinetoplastids. The reviewed compounds provide insights into potential new drug interventions that may combat the increasing problem of anti-kinetoplastid resistance.
