36767708|t|Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia: Prevalence, Symptom Severity, and Caregiver Distress in South-Western Uganda-A Quantitative Cross-Sectional Study.
36767708|a|The purpose of the study was to investigate behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) prevalence, severity, and distress experienced by caregivers of people living with dementia (PLWD). A cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted in a rural area in southwestern Uganda. A Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) was used to determine the presence of BPSD as perceived by caregivers of PLWD. We carried out both descriptive and inferential data analysis. A total of 175 caregivers of PLWD were enrolled in this study. Among PLWD, 99% had presented BPSD in the past month. Hallucinations (75%) and dysphoria/depression (81%) were the two BPSD that occurred most frequently. Most participants (70%) stated that PLWD experienced hallucinations of significant severity. Aberrant motor activity was reported by 60% of the participants as the type of BPSD that caused severe distress. There was a high positive correlation (0.82) between the total severity score and total distress scores. Interventions aimed at addressing dysphoria and hallucinations may be essential for the reduction of caregiver distress. These findings point to the need for promoting early screening for BPSDs and the provision of support to caregivers.
