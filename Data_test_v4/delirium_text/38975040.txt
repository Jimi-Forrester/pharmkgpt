38975040|t|Association between sTREM2, an immune biomarker of microglial activation, and frontal lobe function in community-dwelling older adults: a cross-sectional study.
38975040|a|Objective: Identifying the peripheral biomarkers related to the prevention or modification of unhealthy mental conditions in older adults is extremely beneficial. This study aimed to evaluate the serum levels of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), a soluble form of an innate immune receptor expressed on microglia, in older adults living in a rural community, and their association with cognitive function. Materials and Methods: This survey was conducted between November 2016 and September 2017 in Kurokawa-cho, Imari, Saga Prefecture, Japan, among people aged >=65 years. Blood samples were collected from the participants for serum sTREM2 level analysis using a peptide enzyme immunoassay. The participants underwent cognitive function assessments, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating, and Frontal Assessment Battery. Therefore, we examined the association between serum sTREM2 levels and cognitive function. Results: Of the 95 participants, 25 were men and 70 were women with a mean age 78.24 +- 3.85 years and 77.96 +- 5.52 years, respectively. Serum sTREM2 levels were negatively associated with Frontal Assessment Battery scores, even after adjusting for age, sex, years of education, and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. Conclusion: Serum sTREM2 levels may be associated with frontal lobe function in adults aged >=65 years.
