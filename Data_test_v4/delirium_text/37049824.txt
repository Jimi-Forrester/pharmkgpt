37049824|a|Herein, advanced intermediates were synthesized through Ugi four-component reactions of isocyanides, aldehydes, masked amino aldehyde, and carboxylic acids, including N-protected amino acids. The presence of a masked aldehyde enabled acid-mediated deprotection and subsequent cyclization via the carbonyl carbon and the amide nitrogen. Utilizing N-protected amino acid as a carboxylic acid component, Ugi intermediates could be cyclized from two possible directions to target 3,4-dihydropyrazin-2(1H)-ones. Cyclization to the amino terminus (westbound) and to the carboxyl terminus (eastbound) was demonstrated. Deliberate selection of building blocks drove the reaction regioselectively and yielded diverse heterocycles containing a 3,4-dihydropyrazin-2(1H)-one core, pyrazin-2(1H)-one, and piperazin-2-one, as well as a tricyclic framework with a 3D architecture, 2,3-dihydro-2,6-methanobenzo[h][1,3,6]triazonine-4,7(1H,5H)-dione, from Ugi adducts under mild reaction conditions. The latter bridged heterocycle was achieved diastereoselectively. The reported chemistry represents diversity-oriented synthesis. One common Ugi advanced intermediate was, without isolation, rapidly transformed into various nitrogen-containing heterocycles.
