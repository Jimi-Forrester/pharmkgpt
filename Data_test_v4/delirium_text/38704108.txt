38704108|a|Neuropsychiatric disorders shorten human life spans through multiple ways and become major threats to human health. Exercise can regulate the estrogen signaling, which may be involved in depression, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), and other neuropsychiatric disorders as well in their sex differences. In nervous system, estrogen is an important regulator of cell development, synaptic development, and brain connectivity. Therefore, this review aimed to investigate the potential of estrogen system in the exercise intervention of neuropsychiatric disorders to better understand the exercise in neuropsychiatric disorders and its sex specific. Exercise can exert a protective effect in neuropsychiatric disorders through regulating the expression of estrogen and estrogen receptors, which are involved in neuroprotection, neurodevelopment, and neuronal glucose homeostasis. These processes are mediated by the downstream factors of estrogen signaling, including N-myc downstream regulatory gene 2 (Ndrg2), serotonin (5-HT), delta like canonical Notch ligand 1 (DLL1), NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3), etc. In addition, exercise can act on the estrogen response element (ERE) fragment in the genes of estrogenic downstream factors like beta-amyloid precursor protein cleavase 1 (BACE1). However, there are few studies on the relationship between exercise, the estrogen signaling pathway, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Hence, we review how the estrogen signaling mediates the mechanism of exercise intervention in neuropsychiatric disorders. We aim to provide a theoretical perspective for neuropsychiatric disorders affecting female health and provide theoretical support for the design of exercise prescriptions.
