20589175|a|BACKGROUND: We introduce a new, simple portable inhalational induction device (PD) that provides co-operative inhalational induction of anaesthesia using N(2)O and subsequent sevoflurane in the preanaesthetic induction area in children. METHODS: Forty-five children (30 to 94 months old age, <35 kg) who were scheduled to undergo simple operations were assigned randomly to one of three regimens. Patients were encouraged by their parents to inhale N(2)O followed by sevoflurane (PD N(2)O-sevo group) or sevoflurane (PD sevo group) using a portable inhalational induction device in the preanaesthetic induction area until they were unable to respond to their names. They were then transferred to the operating room while maintaining inhalation of sevoflurane via the device. The control group underwent conventional inhalational induction in the operating room with the parents in attendance. RESULTS: Patients in the PD N(2)O-sevo group had a higher co-operative inhalation frequency than the patients in the PD sevo or the control group. Anaesthesia induction in the PD N(2)O-sevo and the PD sevo groups were faster than in the control group. Parent satisfaction score (0-100) was higher for the PD N(2)O-sevo group than for the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A new portable inhalational induction device allows faster induction in co-operation with parents present in the preanaesthetic induction area compared to conventional inhalational induction in the unfamiliar operating room with the parents in attendance.
