25872538|a|Sedation of critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation should be minimized or completely avoided. Only in selected situations is sedation indicated as first line therapy (increased intracranial pressure or therapeutic hypothermia). The critical care physicians primary objective should be to focus on the reversible causes of agitation, such as: pain, anxiety, delirium, dyspnea, withdrawal symptoms, sleep or gastrointestinal symptoms. If sedation is used a validated sedation scale is recommended. On a daily basis sedation should be interrupted and only restarted after a thorough search for reversible causes of discomfort and stress.
