27287404|t|[Dexmedetomidine in the treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal delirium].
27287404|a|Alcohol withdrawal syndrome has a high clinical prevalence. Severe cases must be treated in an intensive care unit and are associated with a high mortality rate, depending on patient comorbidities. Clinical requirements include sedation, control of vegetative symptoms, treatment of hallucinations and, when necessary, anticonvulsive therapy. Currently, there is no single substance that fulfills these requirements. National and international guidelines recommend a combination of various substances. The central alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine is used as a therapeutic adjuvant. In consideration of its pharmacological characteristics, dexmedetomidine is assumed to be more advantageous compared to clondine. Case studies with dexmedetomidine in alcohol withdrawal syndrome show the safety of its application and a benzodiazepine-sparing effect. Its incorporation in escalating intensive care therapy of severe cases could be appropriate.
