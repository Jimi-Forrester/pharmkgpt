37468994|a|We aimed to analyse postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) incidence and risk factors in elderly adults who underwent surgery for oral malignancies. A total of 112 elderly patients (aged >= 55 years) were selected for expanded resection of oral malignancy and cervical lymphatic dissection at our institution from December 2020 to December 2021. Participants were cognitively evaluated using the neuropsychological test scale 1 day before and 7 days after surgery to determine whether they had developed POCD. Based on whether POCD occurred 7 days after surgery, patients were classified into the POCD and non-POCD groups. Logistic regression was applied to perioperative factors to analyse the risk factors for POCD onset. Seven days after surgery for oral malignancy, there were 37 (33.1%) POCD morbidities. Multiple factor logistic regression analysis revealed that venerable age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.269, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.056-1.525, P < 0.05), low education levels (OR = 0.792, 95% CI 0.644-0.974, P < 0.05), hypertension (OR = 4.153, 95% CI 1.335-12.732, P < 0.05), dyssomnia (OR = 1.272, 95% CI 1.001-1.617, P < 0.05), prolonged anaesthesia (OR = 1.009, 95% CI 1.001-1.018, P < 0.05), and intraoperative hypotension (OR = 5.512, 95% CI 1.240-24.506, P < 0.05) increased the POCD risk in elderly patients who underwent surgery for oral malignancies. Venerable age, low knowledge reserve, hypertension, dyssomnia, prolonged anaesthesia, and intraoperative hypotension are independent risk factors for POCD in elderly patients with oral malignancies.
