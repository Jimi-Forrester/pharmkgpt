34951865|t|The Development and Validation of Simplified Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Prognosis of Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19: Multicenter, Retrospective Study.
34951865|a|BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented; under resource-constrained settings, predictive algorithms can help to stratify disease severity, alerting physicians of high-risk patients; however, there are only few risk scores derived from a substantially large electronic health record (EHR) data set, using simplified predictors as input. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to develop and validate simplified machine learning algorithms that predict COVID-19 adverse outcomes; to evaluate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and calibration of the algorithms; and to derive clinically meaningful thresholds. METHODS: We performed machine learning model development and validation via a cohort study using multicenter, patient-level, longitudinal EHRs from the Optum COVID-19 database that provides anonymized, longitudinal EHR from across the United States. The models were developed based on clinical characteristics to predict 28-day in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, respiratory failure, and mechanical ventilator usages at inpatient setting. Data from patients who were admitted from February 1, 2020, to September 7, 2020, were randomly sampled into development, validation, and test data sets; data collected from September 7, 2020, to November 15, 2020, were reserved as the postdevelopment prospective test data set. RESULTS: Of the 3.7 million patients in the analysis, 585,867 patients were diagnosed or tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 50,703 adult patients were hospitalized with COVID-19 between February 1 and November 15, 2020. Among the study cohort (n=50,703), there were 6204 deaths, 9564 ICU admissions, 6478 mechanically ventilated or EMCO patients, and 25,169 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome or respiratory failure within 28 days since hospital admission. The algorithms demonstrated high accuracy (AUC 0.89, 95% CI 0.89-0.89 on the test data set [n=10,752]), consistent prediction through the second wave of the pandemic from September to November (AUC 0.85, 95% CI 0.85-0.86) on the postdevelopment prospective test data set [n=14,863], great clinical relevance, and utility. Besides, a comprehensive set of 386 input covariates from baseline or at admission were included in the analysis; the end-to-end pipeline automates feature selection and model development. The parsimonious model with only 10 input predictors produced comparably accurate predictions; these 10 predictors (age, blood urea nitrogen, SpO2, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respiration rate, pulse, temperature, albumin, and major cognitive disorder excluding stroke) are commonly measured and concordant with recognized risk factors for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The systematic approach and rigorous validation demonstrate consistent model performance to predict even beyond the period of data collection, with satisfactory discriminatory power and great clinical utility. Overall, the study offers an accurate, validated, and reliable prediction model based on only 10 clinical features as a prognostic tool to stratifying patients with COVID-19 into intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk groups. This simple predictive tool is shared with a wider health care community, to enable service as an early warning system to alert physicians of possible high-risk patients, or as a resource triaging tool to optimize health care resources.
