1605058|t|Inappropriate vasopressin secretion in severe alcohol withdrawal.
1605058|a|Forty-one male alcoholics suffering from alcohol withdrawal syndrome were investigated to assess the relationship between vasopressin (ADH), water homeostasis and alcohol withdrawal. During 10 d, we found a significant decrease in serum vasopressin, from 3.08 +/- 0.61 to 1.71 +/- 0.22 pg/nl. There were no concomitant changes in osmolality, so that a general dysregulatory state of vasopressin secretion during alcohol withdrawal cannot be assumed. Only patients with delirium tremens (8/41) had higher vasopressin levels despite lowered serum osmolalities. These findings support the hypothesis of an inappropriate rebound secretion of vasopressin in severe alcohol withdrawal. Furthermore, they may contribute to the pathogenesis of focal alcoholic brain damage, because rapid and/or profound changes in osmolality are suspected to cause circumscribed cerebral demyelinization.
