34671240|t|Bridging the Gap Between Morphometric Similarity Mapping and Gene Transcription in Alzheimer's Disease.
34671240|a|Disruptions in brain connectivity have been widely reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Morphometric similarity (MS) mapping provides a new way of estimating structural connectivity by interregional correlation of T1WI- and DTI-derived parameters within individual brains. Here, we aimed to identify AD-related MS changing patterns and genes related to the changes and further explored the molecular and cellular mechanism underlying MS changes in AD. Both 3D-T1WI and DTI data of 106 AD patients and 106 well-matched healthy elderly individuals from the ADNI database were included in our study. Cortical regions with significantly decreased MS were found in the temporal and parietal cortex, increased MS was found in the frontal cortex and variant changes were found in the occipital cortex in AD patients. Mean MS in regions with significantly changed MS was positively or negatively associated with memory function. Negative MS-related genes were significantly downregulated in AD, specifically enriched in neurons, and participated in biological processes, with the most significant term being synaptic transmission. This study revealed AD-related cortical MS changes associated with memory function. Linking gene expression to cortical MS changes may provide a possible molecular and cellular substrate for MS abnormality and cognitive decline in AD.
