38003523|t|The Impact of Cadmium Selenide Zinc Sulfide Quantum Dots on the Proteomic Profile of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
38003523|a|Quantum dots (QDs) have been highly sought after in the past few decades for their potential to be used in many biomedical applications. However, QDs' cytotoxicity is still a major concern that limits the incorporation of QDs into cutting-edge technologies. Thus, it is important to study and understand the mechanism by which QDs exert their toxicity. Although many studies have explored the cytotoxicity of quantum dots through the transcriptomic level and reactive species generation, the impact of quantum dots on the expression of cellular protein remains unclear. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, we studied the effect of cadmium selenide zinc sulfide quantum dots (CdSe/ZnS QDs) on the proteomic profile of budding yeast cells. We found a total of 280 differentially expressed proteins after 6 h of CdSe/ZnS QDs treatment. Among these, 187 proteins were upregulated, and 93 proteins were downregulated. The majority of upregulated proteins were found to be associated with transcription/RNA processing, intracellular trafficking, and ribosome biogenesis. On the other hand, many of the downregulated proteins are associated with cellular metabolic pathways and mitochondrial components. Through this study, the cytotoxicity of CdSe/ZnS QDs on the proteomic level was revealed, providing a more well-rounded knowledge of QDs' toxicity.
