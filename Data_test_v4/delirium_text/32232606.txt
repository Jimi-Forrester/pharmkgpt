32232606|a|BACKGROUND: Various studies evaluated the relationship between hypothermic circulatory arrest and neurological outcome in patients undergoing replacement of ascending aorta. The current analysis focuses on the effect of moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (MHCA) on elderly patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of MHCA on neurological outcomes in elderly patients undergoing replacement of the ascending aorta. RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed 905 consecutive patients, who underwent elective replacement of ascending aorta in MHCA (24 +- 2  C, nasopharyngeal) between 2001 and 2015. Patients with acute aortic dissection were excluded from this study. Patients were divided into two groups: those aged 75 years and older (elderly group 22.4%, n = 203) and those younger than 75 years (younger group 77.6%, n = 702). The average age was 63.2 +- 10.2 in the young group vs. 78.7 +- 3.0 years in elderly group (p < 0.001). The elderly group had a significantly higher EuroSCORE II [26.7% (18.1, 36.3) vs. 11.6% (7.4, 19.9); p < 0.001)]. The incidence of coronary heart disease (49.8% vs. 35.6%, p < 0.001) and chronic renal failure (17.2% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.001) was significantly higher in the elderly group. Intraoperatively, the time of MHCA [14 min (12, 17) vs. 15 min (12, 18); p = 0.42], cardiopulmonary bypass [139 min (110, 183) vs. 144 min (113, 189); p = 0.225], and cross-clamping [91 min (63, 116) vs. 92 min (65, 127); p = 0.348] was similar in both groups. Postoperatively, a higher incidence of delirium was significantly reported in the elderly group (24.1% vs. 9.0%, p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference regarding neurological complications between both groups. A 30-day mortality was acceptable for the elderly group, but significantly higher compared with the younger group (7.1% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that surgical replacement of the ascending aorta in MHCA can also be applied safely in elderly patients without increasing the risk of severe neurological complications.
