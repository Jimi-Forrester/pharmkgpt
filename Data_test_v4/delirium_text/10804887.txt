10804887|a|When alcoholics decrease or interrupt alcohol intake abruptly, they will in general experience alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Clinically in most cases it develops a vegetative syndrome with gastroenteropathy, cardiovascular diseases, neurological and psychopathological symptom. Usually alcohol withdrawal symptoms abate after four to seven days, longer courses are rare. Application of drugs is required in approximately one third to one half of the patients. A variety of drugs was suggested for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. In the first hours of alcohol detoxification, the sensitivity of epinephrine receptors is reduced, but rises afterwards substantially. The number of NMDA-receptors increases during chronic intoxication with ethanol. The standard therapy in Europe (except of Great Britain) is an oral mono therapy with clomethiazole in a dose which depends on the severity of the symptoms. Severe withdrawal symptoms may require treatment on an intensive care unit with infusion therapy, e.g. in the context of a delirium tremens, which represents a life-threatening status. In this case, benzodiazepines have been used successfully as an alternative to clomethiazole.
