15190683|t|The role of metabotropic glutamate receptors in Alzheimer's disease.
15190683|a|While glutamatergic transmission is severely altered by early degeneration of cortico-cortical connections and hippocampal projections in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the role of glutamate receptors in the pathogenesis of AD is not yet defined clearly. Nonetheless, as reviewed here, the topographical distribution of different types of receptors likely contributes to the regional selective nature of neuronal degeneration. In particular, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) may contribute the pathogenesis of many neurological conditions and also regulate neuronal vulnerability against cytotoxic stress. Thus, we here discuss the possible role of mGluR in the pathogenesis of AD based on the results from other neurodegenerative diseases that may give us clues to solve the mysterious selective neurodegeneration evident in AD.
