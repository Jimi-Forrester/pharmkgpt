32365716|a|BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in regulating host metabolism that affects the systemic health. To date, several studies have confirmed the fact that microbiota interacts with host, modulating immunity, controlling the homeostasis environment, and maintaining systemic condition. Recent studies have focused on the protective function of poly unsaturated fatty acids, 10-oxo-trans-11-oxadecenoic acid (KetoC) and 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid (HYA), generated by gut microbiota on periodontal disease. Nevertheless, the mechanism remains unclear as investigations are limited to in vivo and in vitro studies. In this present review, we found that the administration of metabolites, KetoC and HYA, by a probiotic gut microbiota Lactobacillus plantarum from linoleic acid is found to inhibit the oxidation process, possess an antimicrobial function, and prevent the inflammation. These findings suggest the promising use of functional lipids for human health. CONCLUSION: Protective modalities of bioactive metabolites may support periodontal therapy by suppressing bacterial dysbiosis and regulating periodontal homeostasis in the clinical setting.
