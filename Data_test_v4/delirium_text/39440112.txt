39440112|t|Is a Combination of Six Clinical Tests Useful as a Measure to Predict Short-Term Prognosis in Terminal Cancer Patients? A Prospective Observational Study in a Japanese Palliative Care Unit.
39440112|a|Background: To address the need for short-term prognostic methods using objective measures, we developed a method to predict a 2- or 3-week prognosis using only six clinical tests (known as the WPCBAL score). However, the method has not yet been directly compared with globally accepted prognostic methods. Objectives: This study aimed to clarify the usefulness of the WPCBAL score by comparing it with other prediction methods. Setting/Subjects: A prospective observational study was conducted with patients admitted to the palliative care unit of a Municipal Hospital in Japan between November 2017 and May 2021. Measurements: The primary endpoint was each prediction method's accuracy-the WPCBAL score, Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), Palliative Prognostic Index (PPI), Palliative Prognostic Score (PaP), Delirium-Palliative Prognostic Score (D-PaP), and Prognosis in Palliative Care Study predictor models (PiPS-A, PiPS-B)-in predicting a prognosis at 2 or 3 weeks. The secondary endpoints were sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and each prediction method's feasibility rate. Results: In total, 181 patients were included in this study. For the 3-week prognosis, the PaP had the highest accuracy (0.746), followed by the D-PaP (0.735), WPCBAL (0.696), PPI (0.652), and GPS (0.575). For the 2-week prognosis, the PiPS-B had the highest accuracy (0.702), followed by the WPCBAL (0.696) and PiPS-A (0.641). Conclusions: The WPCBAL score's accuracy in predicting a 2- or 3-week prognosis was comparable to that of commonly used prognostic methods, thus suggesting its usefulness as a short-term prognostic method.
