29033233|t|Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 2-acetyl-5-O-(amino-alkyl)phenol derivatives as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
29033233|a|A series of 2-acetyl-5-O-(amino-alkyl)phenol derivatives was designed, synthesized and evaluated as multi-function inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The results revealed that compound TM-3 indicated selective AChE inhibitory potency (eeAChE, IC50 = 0.69 muM, selective index (SI) = 32.7). Both kinetic analysis of AChE inhibition and molecular modeling study suggested that TM-3 could simultaneously bind to the catalytic active site and peripheral anionic site of AChE. And TM-3 was also a highly selective MAO-B inhibitor (IC50 = 6.8 muM). Moreover, TM-3 could act as antioxidant (ORAC value was 1.5eq) and neuroprotectant, as well as a selective metal chelating agent. More interestingly, compound TM-3 could cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro and abided by Lipinski's rule of five. Therefore, compound TM-3, a promising multi-targeted active molecule, offers an attractive starting point for further lead optimization in the drug-discovery process against AD.
