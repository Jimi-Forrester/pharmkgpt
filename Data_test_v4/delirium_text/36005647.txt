36005647|a|Background: There is currently no therapeutic that can stop or reverse the progressive memory impairment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, we recently published that 2 months of daily, in-home transcranial electromagnetic treatment (TEMT) reversed the cognitive impairment in eight mild/moderate AD subjects. These cognitive enhancements were accompanied by predicted changes in AD markers within both the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Methods: In view of these encouraging findings, the initial clinical study was extended twice to encompass a period of 21/2 years. The present study reports on the resulting long-term safety, cognitive assessments, and AD marker evaluations from the five subjects who received long-term treatment. Results: TEMT administration was completely safe over the 21/2-year period, with no deleterious side effects. In six cognitive/functional tasks (including the ADAS-cog13, Rey AVLT, MMSE, and ADL), no decline in any measure occurred over this 21/2-year period. Long-term TEMT induced reductions in the CSF levels of C-reactive protein, p-tau217, Abeta1-40, and Abeta1-42 while modulating CSF oligomeric Abeta levels. In the plasma, long-term TEMT modulated/rebalanced levels of both p-tau217 and total tau. Conclusions: Although only a limited number of AD patients were involved in this study, the results suggest that TEMT can stop the cognitive decline of AD over a period of at least 21/2 years and can do so with no safety issues.
