17401657|a|Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading invariably to death, usually within 7-10 years after diagnosis and is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. Not only is Alzheimer's disease a tragic disease in which people suffer from neurodegeneration in the years to come, it also becomes an incredible burden on the public health system. However, there is currently no effective treatment to halt the progression or prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease. This is partly due to the fact that the complex pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease is not yet completely understood. Recently, Golgi apparatus is found to play an important role in Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we discuss the changes of Golgi apparatus during clinical progression and pathological development of Alzheimer's disease. First, changes of Golgi apparatus size in Alzheimer's disease are summarized. We then address the role of Golgi apparatus in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease. Finally, the role of Golgi apparatus in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is discussed. Understanding the contribution of Golgi apparatus dysfunction to Alzheimer's disease and its pathophysiological basis will significantly impact our ability to develop more effective therapies for Alzheimer's disease.
