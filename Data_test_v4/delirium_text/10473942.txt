10473942|t|Assessment scales in delirium.
10473942|a|In research and in clinical practice instruments assessing symptoms of delirium are of value in the diagnostic process, in the evaluation of intervention as well as in the care of patients. Different assessment instruments are needed for different purposes. Most instruments developed are screening instruments or diagnostic tools. Confusional State Evaluation (CSE) is an observer's rating scale assessing severity of delirium. Interrater reliability and validity of the CSE have been found satisfactory. The CSE seems to be of value in following the course of delirium in elderly patients and useful for instance in evaluating effects of interventions.
