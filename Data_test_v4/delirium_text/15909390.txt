15909390|t|[Guideline 'Delirium'].
15909390|a|The Dutch Association of Psychiatry, together with the Dutch Association of Clinical Geriatrics and with methodological support from the Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement (CBO) has developed a guideline for the optimal diagnosis, treatment and prevention of delirium. Delirium is caused by somatic illness or the use of medication, drugs or alcohol. Delirium is common among the somatically ill admitted to a general hospital and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Important predisposing factors for delirium are: age > or =70 years, cognitive disturbances, sensory impairments, problems in daily activities, and the use of alcohol and opiates. Precipitating factors that may provoke delirium are: infection, fever, dehydration, serum electrolyte imbalance, polypharmacy, and the use of psychotropic medication, particularly anticholinergic drugs. Detection, diagnosis, and assessment of the severity of delirium are based on clinical examination, case history, observation, mental status examination including tests of cognitive function, and diagnosis of underlying somatic diseases. For daily practice, measurement tools are not necessary, nor are laboratory or imaging tests, such as electroencephalography. Haloperidol is the treatment of first choice for delirium due to somatic illness, except in patients with delirium due to drug use or medication, Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia. In cases of concurrent alcohol withdrawal syndrome, delirium may be treated with haloperidol and a benzodiazepine and B-vitamins. Medical and environmental interventions have been shown to reduce the incidence and duration of delirium.
