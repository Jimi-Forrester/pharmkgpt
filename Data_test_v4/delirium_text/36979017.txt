36979017|a|During oxidative stress, an important factor in the development of many diseases, cellular oxidative and antioxidant activities are imbalanced due to various internal and external factors such as inflammation or diet. The administration of probiotic Lactobacillus strains has been shown to confer a range of antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory effects in the host. This review focuses on the potential role of oxidative stress in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), cancer, and liver-related diseases in the context of preventive and therapeutic effects associated with Lactobacillus. This article reviews studies in cell lines and animal models as well as some clinical population reports that suggest that Lactobacillus could alleviate basic symptoms and related abnormal indicators of IBD, cancers, and liver damage, and covers evidence supporting a role for the Nrf2, NF-kappaB, and MAPK signaling pathways in the effects of Lactobacillus in alleviating inflammation, oxidative stress, aberrant cell proliferation, and apoptosis. This review also discusses the unmet needs and future directions in probiotic Lactobacillus research including more extensive mechanistic analyses and more clinical trials for Lactobacillus-based treatments.
