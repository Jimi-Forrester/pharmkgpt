39582565|a|The rising prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes globally necessitates a deeper understanding of associated complications, including glymphatic system dysfunction. The glymphatic system, crucial for brain waste clearance, is implicated in cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. This letter explores recent research on glymphatic function across different glucose metabolism states. Tian et al's study reveals significant glymphatic dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, evidenced by lower diffusion tensor imaging analysis along perivascular space indices compared to those with normal glucose metabolism and prediabetes. The research also reveals a link between glymphatic dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Additional research underscores the role of glymphatic impairment in neurodegenerative diseases. These findings highlight the importance of integrating glymphatic health into diabetes management and suggest potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and targeted therapeutic interventions.
