30628010|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A clinical trial was conducted to measure and analyse the pharmacokinetic parameters of a lipid formulation of risperidone, VAL401. The VAL401 formulation is designed to repurpose risperidone from an antipsychotic to an adenocarcinoma treatment, with the lipid formulation altering the cellular uptake of risperidone, thus enabling anticancer biology to be exhibited in preclinical testing. METHODS: This first human trial of VAL401 measured the concentrations of risperidone and its primary metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, in the blood of patients after treatment with a single 2-mg dose of VAL401. RESULTS: The trial provided information on differences in the pharmacokinetic profile of risperidone in VAL401 that may be caused by the formulation and/or the nature of the cancer patient population. VAL401 provided the following key pharmacokinetic parameters for the risperidone plasma concentration after a single 2-mg dose of VAL401, with results normalised to a dosage of 1 mg for comparison with literature values: Tmax, 2 h; Cmax, 8 ng/ml; half-life, 3.5 h; area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0- ), 58.2 ng h2/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Further comparisons of the pharmacokinetic parameters of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone in plasma of patients administered VAL401 and the corresponding parameters obtained from published data for conventionally formulated risperidone provide evidence for altered biological processing of VAL401 as compared to risperidone. The absolute values obtained provide support for future studies of VAL401 as a cancer treatment, as the Cmax demonstrates sufficient exposure to reach the concentrations seen during preclinical anticancer testing, yet the overall exposure to the active moiety supports the use of the safety and tolerability data from conventional risperidone during future clinical trials.
