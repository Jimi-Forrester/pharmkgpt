476355|t|Alcohol withdrawal states and the need for treatment.
476355|a|In an attempt to evaluate the clinical significance of alcohol withdrawal, the rate of symptoms and incidence of treatment were determined in 84 female alcoholics following abrupt withdrawal. Results indicated that abstinence symptoms of an emergency type (delirium tremens, convulsions) only rarely occur and require active treatment, whereas those physical and emotional disturbances frequently seen in alcohol withdrawal need very little medical help. This finding is in contradistinction to current clinical opinion.
