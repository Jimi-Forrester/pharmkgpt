29730806|t|Examining the Relationship Between Religious and Spiritual Motivation and Worry About Alzheimer's Disease in Later Life.
29730806|a|As awareness of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders and diagnosis rates rise, concern about developing such conditions may also increase, referred to here as dementia worry (DW). Few studies have examined DW and potential protective factors. Religiosity provides diverse psychological benefits and may be associated with lower DW; however, intrinsic/extrinsic motivations were expected to differentially relate to DW. Among 83 older adults (M = 69.48 years), both greater intrinsic and extrinsic-social religious motivation were associated with lower DW. Results suggest internalizing one's religious beliefs and building a social network within a religious community may provide a psychological buffer against DW.
