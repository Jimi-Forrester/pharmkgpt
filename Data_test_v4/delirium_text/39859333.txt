39859333|t|Two- and Three-Dimensional In Vitro Models of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Diseases: State-of-the-Art and Applications.
39859333|a|In vitro models play a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease (PD and AD). Traditionally, 2D cell cultures have been instrumental in elucidating the cellular mechanisms underlying these diseases. Cultured cells derived from patients or animal models provide valuable insights into the pathological processes at the cellular level. However, they often lack the native tissue environment complexity, limiting their ability to fully recapitulate their features. In contrast, 3D models offer a more physiologically relevant platform by mimicking the 3D brain tissue architecture. These models can incorporate multiple cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, creating a microenvironment that closely resembles the brain's complexity. Bioengineering approaches allow researchers to better replicate cell-cell interactions, neuronal connectivity, and disease-related phenotypes. Both 2D and 3D models have their advantages and limitations. While 2D cultures provide simplicity and scalability for high-throughput screening and basic processes, 3D models offer enhanced physiological relevance and better replicate disease phenotypes. Integrating findings from both model systems can provide a better understanding of NDs, ultimately aiding in the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we review existing 2D and 3D in vitro models for the study of PD and AD.
