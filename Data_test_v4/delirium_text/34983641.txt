34983641|t|Turning the tide on Alzheimer's disease: modulation of gamma-secretase.
34983641|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of neurodegenerative disorder. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques are integral to the "amyloid hypothesis," which states that the accumulation of Abeta peptides triggers a cascade of pathological events leading to neurodegeneration and ultimately AD. While the FDA approved aducanumab, the first Abeta-targeted therapy, multiple safe and effective treatments will be needed to target the complex pathologies of AD. gamma-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease that is critical for the generation of Abeta peptides. Activity and specificity of gamma-secretase are regulated by both obligatory subunits and modulatory proteins. Due to its complex structure and function and early clinical failures with pan inhibitors, gamma-secretase has been a challenging drug target for AD. gamma-secretase modulators, however, have dramatically shifted the approach to targeting gamma-secretase. Here we review gamma-secretase and small molecule modulators, from the initial characterization of a subset of NSAIDs to the most recent clinical candidates. We also discuss the chemical biology of gamma-secretase, in which small molecule probes enabled structural and functional insights into gamma-secretase before the emergence of high-resolution structural studies. Finally, we discuss the recent crystal structures of gamma-secretase, which have provided valuable perspectives on substrate recognition and molecular mechanisms of small molecules. We conclude that modulation of gamma-secretase will be part of a new wave of AD therapeutics.
