35889517|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS), currently represent major unmet medical needs. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are needed in order to improve patients' quality of life and prognosis. Since oxidative stress can be strongly involved in neurodegenerative diseases, the potential use of inosine, known for its antioxidant properties, in this context deserves particular attention. The protective action of inosine treatment could be mediated by its metabolite urate. Here, we review the current preclinical and clinical studies investigating the use of inosine in AD, PD, ALS, and MS. The most important properties of inosine seem to be its antioxidant action and its ability to raise urate levels and to increase energetic resources by improving ATP availability. Inosine appears to be generally safe and well tolerated; however, the possible formation of kidney stones should be monitored, and data on its effectiveness should be further explored since, so far, they have been controversial. Overall, inosine could be a promising potential strategy in the management of neurodegenerative diseases, and additional studies are needed in order to further investigate its safety and efficacy and its use as a complementary therapy along with other approved drugs.
