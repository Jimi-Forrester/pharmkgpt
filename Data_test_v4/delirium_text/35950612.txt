35950612|t|Clinical and metabolic imaging features of late-onset and early-onset posterior cortical atrophy.
35950612|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Late-onset (LO) and early-onset (EO) dementia show neurobiological and clinical differences. Clinical and 18 fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) features of LO and EO posterior cortical atrophy (LO_PCA, EO_PCA), the visual variant of Alzheimer's disease (AD), were compared. LO_PCA patients were also compared with a group of patients with LO typical AD (tAD). METHODS: Thirty-seven LO_PCA patients (onset age >= 65 years), 29 EO_PCA patients and 40 tAD patients who all underwent a standard neuropsychological battery were recruited; PCA patients were also assessed for the presence of posterior signs and symptoms. Brain FDG-PET was available in 32 LO_PCA cases, 23 EO_PCA cases and all tAD cases, and their scans were compared with scans from 30 healthy elderly controls. Within the entire PCA sample FDG uptake was also correlated with age at onset as a continuous variable. RESULTS: The main difference between the two PCA groups was a higher prevalence of Balint-Holmes symptoms in EO cases, which was associated with the presence of severe bilateral occipito-temporo-parietal hypometabolism, whilst LO_PCA patients showed reduction of FDG uptake mainly in the right posterior regions. The latter group also showed mesial temporal hypometabolism, similarly to the tAD group, although with a right rather than left lateralization. Correlation analysis confirmed the association between older age and decreased limbic metabolism and between younger age and decreased left parietal metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The major involvement of the temporal cortex in LO cases and of the parietal cortex in EO cases reported previously within the AD spectrum holds true also for the visual variant of AD.
