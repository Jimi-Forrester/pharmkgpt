24304563|t|Upregulation of PGC-1alpha expression by Alzheimer's disease-associated pathway: presenilin 1/amyloid precursor protein (APP)/intracellular domain of APP.
24304563|a|Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretase generates amyloid-beta (Abeta) and APP intracellular domain (AICD) peptides. Presenilin (PS) 1 or 2 is the catalytic component of the gamma-secretase complex. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an established phenomenon in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the causes and role of PS1, APP, and APP's cleavage products in this process are largely unknown. We studied the effect of these AD-associated molecules on mitochondrial features. Using cells deficient in PSs expression, expressing human wild-type PS1, or PS1 familial AD (FAD) mutants, we found that PS1 affects mitochondrial energy metabolism (ATP levels and oxygen consumption) and expression of mitochondrial proteins. These effects were associated with enhanced expression of the mitochondrial master transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha and its target genes. Importantly, PS1-FAD mutations decreased PS1's ability to enhance PGC-1alpha mRNA levels. Analyzing the effect of APP and its gamma-secretase-derived cleavage products Abeta and AICD on PGC-1alpha expression showed that APP and AICD increase PGC-1alpha expression. Accordingly, PGC-1alpha mRNA levels in cells deficient in APP/APLP2 or expressing APP lacking its last 15 amino acids were lower than in control cells, and treatment with AICD, but not with Abeta, enhanced PGC-1alpha mRNA levels in these and PSs-deficient cells. In addition, knockdown of the AICD-binding partner Fe65 reduced PGC-1alpha mRNA levels. Importantly, APP/AICD increases PGC-1alpha expression also in the mice brain. Our results therefore suggest that APP processing regulates mitochondrial function and that impairments in the newly discovered PS1/APP/AICD/PGC-1alpha pathway may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration.
