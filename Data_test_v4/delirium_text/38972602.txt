38972602|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, globally affecting men and women at an exponentially growing rate, with currently no cure. Disease progression starts when dopaminergic neurons begin to die. In PD, the loss of neurotransmitter, dopamine is responsible for the overall communication of neural cells throughout the body. Clinical symptoms of PD are slowness of movement, involuntary muscular contractions, speech & writing changes, lessened automatic movement, and chronic tremors in the body. PD occurs in both familial and sporadic forms and modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors and socioeconomic conditions cause PD. Early detectable diagnostics and treatments have been developed in the last several decades. However, we still do not have precise early detectable biomarkers and therapeutic agents/drugs that prevent and/or delay the disease process. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) science and machine learning tools have been promising in identifying early detectable markers with a greater rate of accuracy compared to past forms of treatment and diagnostic processes. Artificial intelligence refers to the intelligence exhibited by machines or software, distinct from the intelligence observed in humans that is based on neural networks in a form and can be used to diagnose the longevity and disease severity of disease. The term Machine Learning or Neural Networks is a blanket term used to identify an emerging technology that is created to work in the way of a "human brain" using many intertwined neurons to achieve the same level of raw intelligence as that of a brain. These processes have been used for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, to assess the severity of the patient's condition. In the current article, we discuss the prevalence and incidence of PD, and currently available diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. We also highlighted currently available artificial intelligence science and machine learning tools and their applications to detect disease and develop therapeutic interventions.
