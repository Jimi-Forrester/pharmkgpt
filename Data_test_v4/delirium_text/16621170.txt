16621170|t|Efficacy of MEM 1003, a novel calcium channel blocker, in delay and trace eyeblink conditioning in older rabbits.
16621170|a|Eyeblink conditioning is a relatively simple form of associative learning that shows neurobiological and behavioral parallels across several species, including humans. Aged subjects acquire eyeblink conditioning more slowly than young ones. In addition, eyeblink conditioning effectively discriminates patients with Alzheimer's disease from healthy older adults. The present study evaluated the effect of a novel L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist, MEM 1003, on delay and trace eyeblink conditioning in older (mean 33.4 months old) female New Zealand white rabbits. In the delay conditioning paradigm, an 850 ms tone conditioning stimulus (CS) was followed 750 ms after its onset by a 100 ms corneal air puff. Several trace conditioning paradigms were evaluated, with a silent period of 300, 400 or 500 ms between the end of the tone CS and the delivery of the air puff. Learning was more difficult in the longer trace paradigms than in the delay paradigm. MEM 1003, at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg, s.c., given daily 30 min prior to training on each of the 15 training days, enhanced learning compared to vehicle injections in both delay and trace paradigms. However, higher or lower doses were ineffective. These results support previous work demonstrating that modulation of Ca2+ channel activity can reduce age-related cognitive impairments.
