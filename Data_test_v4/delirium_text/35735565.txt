35735565|t|Recent Advances in DNA Nanotechnology for Plasmonic Biosensor Construction.
35735565|a|Since 2010, DNA nanotechnology has advanced rapidly, helping overcome limitations in the use of DNA solely as genetic material. DNA nanotechnology has thus helped develop a new method for the construction of biosensors. Among bioprobe materials for biosensors, nucleic acids have shown several advantages. First, it has a complementary sequence for hybridizing the target gene. Second, DNA has various functionalities, such as DNAzymes, DNA junctions or aptamers, because of its unique folded structures with specific sequences. Third, functional groups, such as thiols, amines, or other fluorophores, can easily be introduced into DNA at the 5' or 3' end. Finally, DNA can easily be tailored by making junctions or origami structures; these unique structures extend the DNA arm and create a multi-functional bioprobe. Meanwhile, nanomaterials have also been used to advance plasmonic biosensor technologies. Nanomaterials provide various biosensing platforms with high sensitivity and selectivity. Several plasmonic biosensor types have been fabricated, such as surface plasmons, and Raman-based or metal-enhanced biosensors. Introducing DNA nanotechnology to plasmonic biosensors has brought in sight new horizons in the fields of biosensors and nanobiotechnology. This review discusses the recent progress of DNA nanotechnology-based plasmonic biosensors.
