32958118|t|Na/K-ATPase beta1-subunit associates with neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) to participate in intercellular interactions.
32958118|a|Neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) is a GPI-anchored membrane protein that is involved in neural cell adhesion and communication. Multiple genome wide association studies have found that NEGR1 is a generic risk factor for multiple human diseases, including obesity, autism, and depression. Recently, we reported that Negr1-/- mice showed a highly increased fat mass and affective behavior. In the present study, we identified Na/K-ATPase, beta1-subunit (ATP1B1) as an NEGR1 binding partner by yeast two-hybrid screening. NEGR1 and ATP1B1 were found to form a relatively stable complex in cells, at least partially co-localizing in membrane lipid rafts. We found that NEGR1 binds with ATP1B1 at its C-terminus, away from the binding site for the alpha subunit, and may contribute to intercellular interactions. Collectively, we report ATP1B1 as a novel NEGR1-interacting protein, which may help deciphering molecular networks underlying NEGR1-associated human diseases. [BMB Reports 2021; 54(3): 164-169].
