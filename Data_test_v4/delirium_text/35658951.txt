35658951|a|BACKGROUND: Current understanding of the molecular basis of memory consolidation points to an important function of amyloid formation by neuronal-specific isoforms of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) protein family. In particular, CPEB is thought to promote memory persistence through formation of self-sustaining prion-like amyloid assemblies at synapses, mediated by its intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and leading to permanent physical alterations at the basis of memory persistence. Although the molecular mechanisms by which amyloid formation takes place in CPEB have been described in invertebrates, the way amyloid formation occurs in the human homolog CPEB3 (hCPEB3) remains unclear. Here, we characterize by NMR spectroscopy the atomic level conformation and ps-ms dynamics of the 426-residue IDR of hCPEB3, which has been associated with episodic memory in humans. RESULTS: We show that the 426-residue N-terminal region of hCPEB3 is a dynamic, intrinsically disordered region (IDR) which lacks stable folded structures. The first 29 residues, M1QDDLLMDKSKTQPQPQQQQRQQQQPQP29, adopt a helical + disordered motif, and residues 86-93: P83QQPPPP93, and 166-175: P166PPPAPAPQP175 form polyproline II (PPII) helices. The (VG)5 repeat motif is completely disordered, and residues 200-250 adopt three partially populated alpha-helices. Residues 345-355, which comprise the nuclear localization signal (NLS), form a modestly populated alpha-helix which may mediate STAT5B binding. These findings allow us to suggest a model for nascent hCPEB3 structural transitions at single residue resolution, advancing that amyloid breaker residues, like proline, are a key difference between functional versus pathological amyloids. CONCLUSION: Our NMR spectroscopic analysis of hCPEB3 provides insights into the first structural transitions involved in protein-protein and protein-mRNA interactions. The atomic level understanding of these structural transitions involved in hCPEB3 aggregation is a key first step toward understanding memory persistence in humans, as well as sequence features that differentiate beneficial amyloids from pathological ones.
