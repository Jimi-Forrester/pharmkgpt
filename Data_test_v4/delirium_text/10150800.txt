10150800|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate psychological status in consecutive survivors of ICU who needed mechanical ventilation (MV). DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Twenty-four bed intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Fifty-four mechanically ventilated patients were considered for the study; 43 patients were included, but 11 refused or were unable to fill in the form. INTERVENTIONS: A 32-question form was filled out by the patients 48-96 hours after weaning from mechanical ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean characteristics of the patients were: age 51.6 years, simplified acute physiologic score (SAPS) 14, organ system failure (OSF) 1.57, OMEGA score 277, length of stay 29 days, length of mechanical ventilation 14 days. Thirty-three required sedation, 30 analgesia, 20 paralysis. The results were as follows: Pain: 13 suffered intolerable pain with a mean intensity of pain during care of 3.5/10. Comfort: 25 felt an inability to communicate, 18 were bothered by noise and 15 by light, while nine feared to be abandoned by staff. Sleep disorders: 28 remember dreaming with a personal judgement about these dreams (0 = pleasant, 10 = nightmare) of 7.6/10; 17 noticed increasing sleep disorders during their stay. Anxiety: 22 felt diffuse anxiety disorder and 16 described intense fear of dying at least once. Mood: 38 felt physical depression and 18 intellectual depression. Delirium or confusion: 33 had delirium or a confused state at the time of weaning and nine suffered hallucinations. Nine correctly appreciated their length of stay and 18 knew the date when they were interviewed. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that psychological status is poor in ventilated ICU patients, which should be considered in their care.
