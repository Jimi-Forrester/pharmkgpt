28835239|t|Prospective comparison of the anterior and lateral approach in hemiarthroplasty for hip fractures: a study protocol.
28835239|a|BACKGROUND: The Direct Anterior Approach (DAA) is an alternative approach to the currently most used Lateral Approach (LA) for hip replacement in femoral neck fracture patients. Compared to the LA, the DAA minimizes soft tissue damage. Sparing muscle tissue may facilitate early and improved postoperative mobility. It may also be associated with fewer complications, increased quality of life and lower 1-year mortality. The aim of this study is to compare postoperative complications, hip function and patient mobility after hemiarthroplasty via the anterior or lateral approach following a displaced femoral neck fracture. METHODS: 138 elderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures will be operated using either the direct anterior approach or the lateral approach for a hemiarthroplasty in a single centre, prospective, comparative cohort study. The choice of surgical approach will depend on the expertise of the trauma surgeon on call. The primary outcome of this study will be the functionality of the hip after surgery measured using the Harris Hip Score during routine outpatient check-ups. Secondary outcomes include surgical and non-surgical complication rates, admission time, postoperative pain, rehabilitation time, performance in activities of daily living, health-related quality of life measured, cognitive function and balance. DISCUSSION: Many approaches are known for hip replacement arthroplasty in trauma patients with little consensus on the preferred method. Identifying the best approach facilitating an adequate and fast recovery could optimize patient independence and quality of life and minimize rehabilitation costs, morbidity and mortality rates. The study design will reflect daily clinical practice and aims to present an accurate depiction of clinical outcomes.
