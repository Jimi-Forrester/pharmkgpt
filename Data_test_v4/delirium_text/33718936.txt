33718936|a|The innate immune system plays an integral role in the brain. Synaptic pruning, a fundamental process in developmental circuit refinement, is partially mediated by neuroimmune signalling at the synapse. In particular, microglia, the major tissue-resident macrophages of the brain, and the classical complement cascade, an innate immune pathway that aids in the clearance of unwanted material, have been implicated in mediating synapse elimination. Emerging data suggest that improper signalling of the innate immune pathway at the synapse leads to pathological synapse loss in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Now the key questions are whether synapses are targeted by complement and, if so, which synapses are vulnerable to elimination. Here, we review recent work implicating C1q, the initiator of the classical complement cascade, and surrounding glia as mediators of synapse loss. We examine how synapses could undergo apoptosis-like pathways in the Alzheimer brain, which may lead to the externalisation of phosphatidylserine on synapses. Finally, we discuss potential roles for microglia and astrocytes in this 'synaptic apoptosis'. Critical insight into neuroimmune regulatory pathways on synapses will be key to developing effective targets against pathological synapse loss in dementia.
