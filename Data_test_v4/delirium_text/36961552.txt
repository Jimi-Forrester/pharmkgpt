36961552|t|MicroRNA-124: an emerging therapeutic target in central nervous system disorders.
36961552|a|The central nervous system (CNS) consists of neuron and non-neuron cells including neural stem/precursor cells (NSPCs), neuroblasts, glia cells (mainly astrocyte, oligodendroglia and microglia), which thereby form a precise and complicated network and exert diverse functions through interactions of numerous bioactive ingredients. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), with small size approximately  ~ 21nt and as well-documented post-transcriptional key regulators of gene expression, are a cluster of evolutionarily conserved endogenous non-coding RNAs. More than 2000 different miRNAs has been discovered till now. MicroRNA-124(miR-124), the most brain-rich microRNA, has been validated to possess important functions in the central nervous system, including neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation, cell fate determination, neuron migration, synapse plasticity and cognition, cell apoptosis etc. According to recent studies, herein, we provide a review of this conversant miR-124 to further understand the potential functions and therapeutic and clinical value in brain diseases.
