19348236|t|[New insights of ARB in central nervous system].
19348236|a|Renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) in the central nervous system (CNS) and therapeutical effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been highlighted. In stroke, clinical trials exhibit to prevent primary onset or recurrence of stroke beyond anti-hypertensive effect, inhibition of atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus. ARB could be also expected to prevent cognitive impairment induced by such as Alzheimer disease, stroke and metabolic syndrome; however, clinical evidence has not been revealed to date. Angiotensin II levels in cerebrospinal fluid in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is reduced, suggesting the role of RAAS in neural intractable diseases. These findings will provide us new therapeutic approaches of ARB in CNS disorder in t hefuture.
