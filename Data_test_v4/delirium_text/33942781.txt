33942781|a|Elderly patients undergoing major cardiac and non-cardiac surgeries have a high propensity (up to 40-60%) of developing postoperative cognitive dysfunction, which are caused by patient's factors, type of surgery, intraoperative and postoperative factors. All these pose a challenge to the clinicians. The noble gas xenon does not undergo metabolism or any kind of biotransformation in the body owing to its inert nature. Xenon confers excellent hemodynamic stability and provides excellent recovery at the end of surgery. This topical review discusses advantages of xenon anesthesia in elderly patients undergoing major cardiac and non-cardiac surgeries and whether it is worth using a costly anesthetic in elderly patients for preventing postoperative cognitive dysfunction.
