38505471|t|Drug Treatment for Patients with Postoperative Delirium and Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry in Japan: A Retrospective Observational Study of a Nationwide Hospital Claims Database.
38505471|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is the most commonly experienced disorder in consultation liaisons. There are currently research and guidelines in Japan for delirium treatment. Still, there is no retrospective observational study of consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) and antipsychotic-centered drugs. This study aims to examine CLP's effectiveness and drug treatment. METHODS: Using a Japanese national inpatient database of 2016 and 2017, we investigated the presence or absence of CLP for the treatment of delirium in postoperative delirium patients, the status of drug selection, delirium days, and the average days from surgery to discharge. We examined factors affecting days from surgery to discharge using multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: This study was classified into a CLP group (n = 1,142) and a non-CLP group (n = 11,355). The days from surgery to discharge in the CLP and non-CLP groups was 16.7 and 17.1, respectively (p = 0.3613). There was a significant difference in the delirium days between the CLP and non-CLP groups (8.9 vs. 7.4; p < 0.00001). Haloperidol infusion was frequently used between the days from surgery to first day of delirium. It was prescribed less often than other oral drugs. Multiple regression analysis identified an association between age, men, CCI1-2, CCI >=3, number of drugs used, days from surgery to first day of delirium, and early CLP (0-2days) with days from surgery to discharge. CONCLUSIONS: We investigated the effectiveness of CLP and the actual conditions of pharmacotherapy for postoperative delirium. Our findings suggest that early CLP may be associated with shorter days from surgery to discharge.
