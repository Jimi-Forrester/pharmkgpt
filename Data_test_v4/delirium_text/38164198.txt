38164198|a|Mechanical ventilation is a widely used short-term life support technique, but an accompanying adverse consequence can be pulmonary damage which is called ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Mechanical ventilation can potentially affect the central nervous system and lead to long-term cognitive impairment. In recent years, many studies revealed that VILI, as a common lung injury, may be involved in the central pathogenesis of cognitive impairment by inducing hypoxia, inflammation, and changes in neural pathways. In addition, VILI has received attention in affecting the treatment of cognitive impairment and provides new insights into individualized therapy. The combination of lung protective ventilation and drug therapy can overcome the inevitable problems of poor prognosis from a new perspective. In this review, we summarized VILI and non-VILI factors as risk factors for cognitive impairment and concluded the latest mechanisms. Moreover, we retrospectively explored the role of improving VILI in cognitive impairment treatment. This work contributes to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of VILI-induced cognitive impairment and may provide future direction for the treatment and prognosis of cognitive impairment.
