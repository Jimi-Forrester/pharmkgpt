38011512|t|Cholesterol Oxidation Products: Potential Adverse Effect and Prevention of Their Production in Foods.
38011512|a|Cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) are a group of substances formed during food processing. COPs in diet is a health concern because they may affect human health in association with the risk of various diseases including atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, age-related macular degeneration, diabetes, and chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory colitis. Production of COPs in foods can be affected by many factors such as temperature, pH, light, oxygen, water, carbohydrates, fatty acids, proteins, and metal cations. The key issue is preventing its generation in foods. Some COPs can also be produced in vivo by both nonenzymatic and enzymatic-catalyzed oxidation reactions. Currently, a number of natural antioxidants such as catechins, flavonoids, and other polyphenols have been proven to inhibit the generation of COPs. In addition, measures taken during food processing can also minimize the production of COPs, such as the Maillard reaction and marinating food with plant polyphenol-rich seasonings. In conclusion, a comprehensive approach encompassing the suppression on COPs generation and implementation of processing measures is imperative to safeguard human health against the production of COPs in the food chain.
