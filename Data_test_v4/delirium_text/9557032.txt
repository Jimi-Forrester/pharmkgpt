9557032|t|[Old, short-of-breath and confused; delirium as a manifestation of pulmonary embolism in geriatric patients].
9557032|a|Two women aged 88 and 70 and a man aged 90 years had become increasingly confused and short of breath over a period of a few weeks. Blood gas analysis revealed serious hypoxia. For lack of an explanation of the respiratory insufficiency, pulmonary emboli were assumed; this assumption could be confirmed by ventilation perfusion scintigraphy. Parallel with the treatment of the emboli the delirium cleared. Because of restlessness, initial treatment with low molecular weight heparin subcutaneously twice daily was preferred.
