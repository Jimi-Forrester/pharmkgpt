38281243|t|Association between low values of mean arterial pressure and impaired cognitive performance in older patients with mild cognitive impairment: cross-sectional preliminary findings from the STRENGTH Project.
38281243|a|BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) is a risk factor for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia. AIMS: This study examined the relationship between BP and clinical/cognitive/neuropsychological aspects in MCI individuals. METHODS: MCI patients underwent clinical, functional, cognitive and metacognitive, as well as psychological assessments. Social network, lifestyle characteristics, and medication prescriptions were also evaluated. Each patient underwent BP measurements. RESULTS: Lower values of systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were associated with poorer cognitive performance. Notably, MAP showed greater capability in detecting impairments in attention and visuospatial abilities compared to SBP and DBP. DISCUSSION: These findings support the notion that in older individuals with MCI excessively low BP values, particularly MAP, might represent a risk and suggest that cerebral hypoperfusion may play a key role. CONCLUSIONS: Routine assessment of MAP could aid clinicians in adjusting antihypertensive treatment and closely monitoring cognitive function in MCI patients.
