Species are defined by their genomes, and differences between individuals within a given species directly result from variations in their genetic codes. While genetic alterations can give rise to disease-causing acquisitions of distinct cell identities, it is now well-established that biochemical imbalances within a cell can also lead to cellular dysfunction and diseases. Specifically, nongenetic chemical events orchestrate cell metabolism and transcriptional programs that govern functional cell identity. Thus, imbalances in cell signaling, which broadly defines the conversion of extracellular signals into intracellular biochemical changes, can also contribute to the acquisition of diseased cell states. Metal ions exhibit unique chemical properties that can be exploited by the cell. For instance, metal ions maintain the ionic balance within the cell, coordinate amino acid residues or nucleobases altering folding and function of biomolecules, or directly catalyze specific chemical reactions. Thus, metals are essential cell signaling effectors in normal physiology and disease. Deciphering metal ion signaling is a challenging endeavor that can illuminate pathways to be targeted for therapeutic intervention. Here, we review key cellular processes where metal ions play essential roles and describe how targeting metal ion signaling pathways has been instrumental to dissecting the biochemistry of the cell and how this has led to the development of effective therapeutic strategies.
