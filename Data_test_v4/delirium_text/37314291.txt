37314291|a|The accumulation of tau protein aggregates is a common feature observed in many neurodegenerative diseases. However, the structural characteristics of tau aggregates can vary among different tauopathies. It has been established that the structure of the tau protofilament in Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is similar to that of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, a previous study found that purpurin, an anthraquinone, could inhibit and disassemble the pre-formed 306VQIVYK311 isoform of AD-tau protofilament. Herein, we used all-atom molecular dynamic (MD) simulation to investigate the distinctive features between CTE-tau and AD-tau protofilament and the influence of purpurin on CTE-tau protofilament. Our findings revealed notable differences at the atomic level between CTE-tau and AD-tau protofilaments, particularly in the beta6-beta7 angle and the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of the beta4-beta6 region. These structural disparities contributed to the distinct characteristics observed in the two types of tau protofilaments. Our simulations substantiated that purpurin could destabilize the CTE-tau protofilament and decrease beta-sheet content. Purpurin molecules could insert the beta4-beta6 region and weaken the hydrophobic packing between beta1 and beta8 through pi-pi stacking. Interestingly, each of the three rings in purpurin exhibited unique binding preferences with the CTE-tau protofilament. Overall, our study sheds light on the structural distinctions between CTE-tau and AD-tau protofilaments, as well as the destabilizing mechanism of purpurin on CTE-tau protofilament, which may be helpful to the development of drugs to prevent CTE.
