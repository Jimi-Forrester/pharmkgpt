34226604|a|The purpose of this study is to check the effectiveness of the analysis method that separates and quantifies beta-caryophyllene among clove extracts and validate according to current ICH guidelines. The beta-caryophyllene was active constituent of clove buds. The developed method gave a good detection response. In the specificity test, the standard solution was detected at about 17.32 min, and the test solution was detected at 17.32 min. The linearity of beta-caryophyllen was confirmed, and at this time, the correlation coefficient (R2) of the calibration curve showed a high linearity of 0.999 or more in the concentration range. The levels of LOD and LOQ were 1.28 ug/mL and 3.89 ug/mL, respectively. The accuracy was confirmed to be 101.6-102.2% and RSD 0.95 ~ 1.31%. As a result of checking the repeatability and inter-tester reproducibility to confirm the precision, the RSD was found to be 1.34 ~ 2.69%. This validated GC method was successfully applied to a soft capsule containing clove extract and other materials for clinical trials. Therefore, this method can be used as an analytical tool for quality control of various samples, including clove extracts and their products of food and pharmaceutical uses.
