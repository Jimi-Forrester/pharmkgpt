36352380|a|BACKGROUND: The restorative effect of classical music was assessed on the cyclophosphamide-induced animal model of premature ovarian failure (POF). METHODS: Mozart's piano classical music (K.448) was used for up to 4 and 8 weeks. Rats were exposed to music 6 h every day using a stereo system with a volume of 65-70 dB. Sera and ovarian tissue samples were collected for the evaluation of FSH, LH, and E2 and histopathological examination. At the same time points, samples were taken from the hypothalamus and hippocampus to monitor the expression of Ntrk2, Crh, and Pomc using real-time PCR. Mating trial was performed to evaluate the fertility status of POF rats. RESULTS: Histopathological examination revealed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the numbers of morphologically normal follicles at all the developmental stages in POF rats after music therapy compared to the POF group (p < 0.05). Music therapy decreased FSH and LH levels to near-to-normal levels conidied with elevation of E2 (p < 0.05). Ntrk2, Crh, and Pomc expressions were down-regulated in POF rats. Music therapy increasaed the expression of Ntrk2 in the hypothalamus of POF rats (p < 0.05). In contrast, Crh and Pomc failed to reach the detection limit before intervention and four weeks after the intervention however, these genes were expressed eight weeks after music therapy. Fertility status was increased (p < 0.05) in terms of litter size in POF rats after being exposed to music compared to the non-treated POF control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Results showed that music can exert therapeutic effects on POF rats via the alteration of sex-related hormones.
