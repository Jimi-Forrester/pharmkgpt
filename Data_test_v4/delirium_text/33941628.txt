33941628|a|OBJECTIVES: Summarise studies of outdoor green space exposure and brain health measures related to Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD), and determine scientific gaps for future research. DESIGN: Rapid review of primary research studies. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science Core Collection were searched for articles meeting the criteria published on/before 13 February 2020. The review excluded papers not in English, focused on transient states (eg, mental fatigue) or not using individual-level measures of brain health (eg, average school test scores). Brain health measures of interest included cognitive function, clinical diagnosis of cognitive impairment/dementia/ADRD and brain biomarkers such as those from MRI, measures typically associated with ADRD risk and disease progression. RESULTS: Twenty-two papers were published from 2012 to 2020, 36% on <18 years old, 32% on 18-64 years old and 59% on >=65 years old. Sixty-four per cent defined green space based on the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index ('greenness'/healthy vegetation) and 68% focused on cognitive measures of brain health (eg, memory). Seventeen studies (77%) found green space-brain health associations (14 positive, 4 inverse). Greater greenness/green space was positively associated various cognitive domains in 10 studies and with MRI outcomes (regional brain volumes, cortical thickness, amygdala integrity) in three studies. Greater neighbourhood greenness was associated with lower odds/risk of cognitive impairment/ADRD in some studies but increased odds/risk in others (n=4 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Published studies suggest positive green space-brain health associations across the life course, but the methods and cohorts were limited and heterogeneous. Future research using racially/ethnically and geographically diverse cohorts, life course methods and more specific green space and brain health measures (eg, time spent in green spaces, ADRD biomarkers) will strengthen evidence for causal associations.
