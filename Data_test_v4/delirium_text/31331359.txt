31331359|t|Alpha-synuclein structure and Parkinson's disease - lessons and emerging principles.
31331359|a|Alpha-synuclein (alphaS) is the major constituent of Lewy bodies and a pathogenic hallmark of all synucleinopathathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). All diseases are determined by alphaS aggregate deposition but can be separated into distinct pathological phenotypes and diagnostic criteria. Here we attempt to reinterpret the literature, particularly in terms of how alphaS structure may relate to pathology. We do so in the context of a rapidly evolving field, taking into account newly revealed structural information on both native and pathogenic forms of the alphaS protein, including recent solid state NMR and cryoEM fibril structures. We discuss how these new findings impact on current understanding of alphaS and PD, and where this information may direct the field.
