36471936|a|Through the non-targeted metabonomics study on endogenous substances in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, this paper aimed to discover biomarkers related to APP/PS1 mice with cognitive dysfunction, and find targets of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction(HLJDD) in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease(AD) and its mechanism. The brain tissue and serum metabolic mass spectrometry of mice were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-Orbitrap mass spectrometry(UPLC-Orbitrap MS). Through partial least squares-discriminant analysis(PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis(OPLS-DA), the metabolic data of the normal group, the model group, the high-dose and low-dose HLJDD groups, and the berberine group were compared and analyzed to screen out potential biomarkers, and the relevant metabolic pathways were constructed with the help of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) database. Forty-five potential endogenous metabolites were identified, including 13 in brain and 35 in serum, among which leukotriene B4, tyrosine, and adenosine were expected to be differential metabolites related to cognitive function. HLJDD recalled 22 differential metabolites, and the pathways mainly involved in aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, pantothenic acid and coenzyme A biosynthesis, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and arachidonic acid metabolism. These pathways suggested that the main mechanism of HLJDD in the intervention of AD was to inhibit central and peripheral inflammation, and regulate energy metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. HLJDD has a certain effect on the improvement of cognitive dysfunction, and regulates relative pathways by recalling endogenous differential metabolites, which helps to further discover the biomarkers of AD and clarify the intervention mechanism of HLJDD in the treatment of AD.
