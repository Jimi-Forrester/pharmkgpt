26643038|a|BACKGROUND: To report early and long-term outcomes of patients undergoing minimally invasive mitral valve surgery (MIMVS) through right mini-thoracotomy (RT) over a 10-year period. METHODS: From September 2003 to December 2013, a total of 1604 consecutive patients underwent MIMVS through RT. RESULTS: The mean age was 63 +- 13 years, 770 (48 %) patients were female and 218 (13.6 %) had previous cardiac operations. The most predominant pathology was degenerative disease (70 %), followed by functional mitral valve regurgitation (12 %), rheumatic disease (9.4 %), endocarditis (5 %) and prosthetic dysfunction (3.2 %). Mitral valve repair was performed in 1137 (71 %) patients and 476 (29 %) had mitral valve replacement. Direct aortic cannulation was achieved in 1325 (83 %) patients. Among patients with degenerative disease candidate for repair (n = 958), rate of mitral valve repair was 95 %. Repair techniques included annuloplasty (95 %), leafleat resection (63 %), neochordae implantation (16 %) and sliding plasty (11 %). Concomitant procedures included tricuspid valve repair (14.6 %), atrial fibrillation ablation (9.5 %) and atrial septal defect closure (3.2 %). Overall in-hospital mortality was 1.1 %. Thirty-four patients (2.1 %) had conversion to sternotomy. Incidence of stroke was 2 %. Overall survival at 10 years was 88 +- 2 %. Freedom from reoperation at 10 years was 94 +- 2 % for repair and 80 +- 6 % for replacement. Freedom from recurrent mitral regurgitation >3+ at 10 years was 90 +- 3 %. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive mitral valve surgery is a safe and reproducible approach associated with low mortality and morbidity, high rate of mitral valve repair and excellent late results.
