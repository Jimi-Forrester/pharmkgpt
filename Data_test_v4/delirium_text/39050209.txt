39050209|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by acute disturbances of consciousness with rapid onset, rapid progression, obvious fluctuations, and preventable, reversible, and other characteristics. Patients with delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) are often missed or misdiagnosed and do not receive adequate attention. AIM: To analyze the risk factors for delirium in ICU patients and explore the application of emotional nursing with pain nursing in the management of delirium. METHODS: General data of 301 critically ill patients were retrospectively collected, including histories (cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, smoking, alcoholism, and diabetes), age, sex, diagnosis, whether surgery was performed, and patient origin (emergency/clinic). Additionally, the duration of sedation, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale score, combined emotional and pain care, ventilator use duration, vasoactive drug use, drainage tube retention, ICU stay duration, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, white blood cell count, body temperature, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score were recorded within 24 h after ICU admission. Patients were assessed for delirium according to confusion assessment method for the ICU, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for delirium in the patients. RESULTS: Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed on the 24 potential risk factors associated with delirium in ICU patients. The results showed that 16 risk factors were closely related to delirium, including combined emotional and pain care, history of diabetes, and patient origin. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that no combined emotional and pain care, history of diabetes, emergency source, surgery, long stay in the ICU, smoking history, and high APACHE II score were independent risk factors for delirium in ICU patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with diabetes and/or smoking history, postoperative patients, patients with a high APACHE II score, and those with emergency ICU admission need emotional and pain care, flexible visiting modes, and early intervention to reduce delirium incidence.
