31011037|t|Management of Acute Stroke in the Older Person.
31011037|a|The majority of people who suffer a stroke are older adults. The last two decades have brought major progress in the diagnosis and management of stroke, which has led to significant reductions in mortality, long-term disability, and the need for institutional care. However, acute, interventional and preventative treatments have mostly been trialled in younger age groups. In this article we will provide an overview of the evidence for acute stroke treatments in relation to age, discuss special considerations in the older person, and contemplate patient choice, quality of life, and end-of-life-decisions.
