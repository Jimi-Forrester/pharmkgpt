36830791|t|Administration of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) to Induce Neural Differentiation of Dental Pulp Stem Cells (DPSC) Isolates.
36830791|a|The aging populations in many countries have developed many chronic illnesses and diseases, including chronic neurologic conditions such as Parkinson's and Azheimer's diseases. Many new lines of research and treatment are focusing on the potential for neurologic regeneration using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the rapidly growing field of regenerative medicine. This may include dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), which have recently been demonstrated to produce neuronal precursors. Based upon this evidence, the primary aim of this study was to determine if the growth factors used in MSC-based studies are sufficient to induce neuronal differentiation among DPSCs. Using an existing biorepository, n = 16 DPSC isolates were thawed and cultured for this study, which revealed several subpopulations of rapid-, intermediate-, and slowly dividing DPSCs. Administration of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were sufficient to induce differential changes in growth and viability mainly among some of the rapidly growing DPSCs (n = 4). These phenotypic changes included expression of neural differentiation markers including Sox1, Pax6 and NF-M, which were observed only among those DPSC isolates not expressing early odontoblast-specific biomarkers such as ALP and DSPP. Future studies will be needed to confirm if these methods are sufficient to induce consistent and reliable induction of DPSCs towards neuronal specific differentiation.
