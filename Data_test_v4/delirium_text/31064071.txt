31064071|t|Silymarin's Inhibition and Treatment Effects for Alzheimer's Disease.
31064071|a|As a longstanding problem, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has stymied researchers in the medical field with its increasing incidence and enormous treatment difficulty. Silymarin has always been valued by researchers for its good efficacy and safety in treating liver disease. Recent studies have shown that silymarin also has good pharmacological activity in the nervous system, especially for the treatment of AD. Silymarin can control the production of Abeta by inhibiting the precursor substance of Abeta (beta-amyloid precursor protein), and it can inhibit the polymerization of Abeta. Silymarin can also increase the acetylcholine content in the nervous system by inhibiting cholinesterase activity. At the same time, it also has the effect of resisting oxidative stress and the inflammatory response of the nervous system. These pharmacological activities contribute to the inhibition of the onset of AD. The good efficacy of silymarin on AD and its high safety and availability give it huge potential for the treatment of AD.
