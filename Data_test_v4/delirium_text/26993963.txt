26993963|t|(18)F-labeling syntheses and preclinical evaluation of functionalized nanoliposomes for Alzheimer's disease.
26993963|a|The aim of the present study was to synthesize functionalized (18)F-labeled NLs ((18)F-NLs) and evaluate their biological behavior in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using positron emission tomography (PET) and ex vivo brain autoradiography. (18)F-fluorine was introduced to (18)F-NLs either by using a core forming (18)F-lipid or by encapsulating a (18)F-tracer, (18)F-treg-curcumin inside the NLs. Phosphatidic acid (PA) and curcumin derivative (Curc) functionalized (18)F-NLs with or without additional mApoE functionalization were produced using thin film hydration. The biodistribution and beta-amyloid plaque-binding ability of (18)F-NLs were studied in wild type mice and AD mouse models using in vivo PET imaging and ex vivo brain autoradiography at 60min after (18)F-NL injection. Functionalized (18)F-NLs were successfully synthesized. The preclinical evaluation in mice showed that the functional group affected the biodistribution of (18)F-NLs. Further functionalization with mApoE increased the brain-to-blood ratio of (18)F-NLs but the overall brain uptake remained low with all functionalized (18)F-NLs. The liposomal encapsulation of (18)F-treg-curcumin was not successful and preclinical results of encapsulated (18)F-treg-curcumin and plain (18)F-treg-curcumin were identical. Although the studied functionalized (18)F-NLs were not suitable for PET imaging as such, the synthesis techniques introduced in this study can be utilized to modify the biological behavior of (18)F-labeled NLs.
