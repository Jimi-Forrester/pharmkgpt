36523847|t|MRI free water as a biomarker for cognitive performance: Validation in the MarkVCID consortium.
36523847|a|Introduction: To evaluate the clinical validity of free water (FW), a diffusion tensor imaging-based biomarker kit proposed by the MarkVCID consortium, by investigating the association between mean FW (mFW) and executive function. Methods: Baseline mFW was related to a baseline composite measure of executive function (EFC), adjusting for relevant covariates, in three MarkVCID sub-cohorts, and replicated in five, large, independent legacy cohorts. In addition, we tested whether baseline mFW predicted accelerated EFC score decline (mean follow-up time: 1.29 years). Results: Higher mFW was found to be associated with lower EFC scores in MarkVCID legacy and sub-cohorts (p-values < 0.05). In addition, higher baseline mFW was associated significantly with accelerated decline in EFC scores (p = 0.0026). Discussion: mFW is a sensitive biomarker of cognitive decline, providing a strong clinical rational for its use as a marker of white matter (WM) injury in multi-site observational studies and clinical trials of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID).
