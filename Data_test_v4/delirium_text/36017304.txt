36017304|t|Malignant Hypertension and the Role of Ophthalmologists: A Review Article.
36017304|a|Malignant hypertension (MHT) is a sudden and severe increase in systemic blood pressure (BP) associated with advanced bilateral retinopathy. It comes under a broader term, called hypertensive emergency, where an acute rise in BP results in end-organ damage. The condition usually requires hospital admission and intensive care management. Although there are lots of sophisticated machines and laboratory tests present to diagnose various organ damage, the role of ophthalmologists will still be at the top. A record of the acute rise of BP to a defining level and simple ophthalmoscopy with high clinical suspicion can save a patient's life and preserve target organ function by timely referral. So, every ophthalmologist should be aware of this dangerous condition. In this review, we have tried to compile all the current knowledge regarding malignant hypertension that an ophthalmologist may require in day-to-day practice.
