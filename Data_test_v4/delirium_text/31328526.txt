31328526|t|Size-Dependent Interaction of Amyloid beta Oligomers with Brain Total Lipid Extract Bilayer-Fibrillation Versus Membrane Destruction.
31328526|a|Amyloid beta, Abeta(1-42), is a component of senile plaques present in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients and one of the main suspects responsible for pathological consequences of the disease. Herein, we directly visualize the Abeta activity toward a brain-like model membrane and demonstrate that this activity strongly depends on the Abeta oligomer size. PeakForce quantitative nanomechanical mapping mode of atomic force microscopy imaging revealed that the interaction of large-size (LS) Abeta oligomers, corresponding to high-molecular-weight Abeta oligomers, with the brain total lipid extract (BTLE) membrane resulted in accelerated Abeta fibrillogenesis on the membrane surface. Importantly, the fibrillogenesis did not affect integrity of the membrane. In contrast, small-size (SS) Abeta oligomers, corresponding to low-molecular-weight Abeta oligomers, created pores and then disintegrated the BTLE membrane. Both forms of the Abeta oligomers changed nanomechanical properties of the membrane by decreasing its Young's modulus by ~45%. Our results demonstrated that both forms of Abeta oligomers induce the neurotoxic effect on the brain cells but their action toward the membrane differs significantly.
