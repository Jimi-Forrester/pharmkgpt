7824112|t|The CERAD experience, Part VIII: Neuroimaging-neuropathology correlates of temporal lobe changes in Alzheimer's disease.
7824112|a|We compared premortem neuroimaging findings with neuropathologic evidence of temporal lobe atrophy in 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) confirmed by autopsy. There were significant correlations between temporal horn enlargement observed by neuroimaging and hippocampal atrophy at autopsy, and between the overall cerebral atrophy severity on neuroimaging and scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination. This report confirms previous studies correlating temporal lobe atrophy on neuroimaging with a clinical diagnosis of AD, although more precise neuroimaging techniques are needed for use in multicenter studies of AD.
