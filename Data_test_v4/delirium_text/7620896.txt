7620896|a|The nucleus tuberalis lateralis (NTL) is located in the basolateral part of the hypothalamus and is only present as a well-delineated nucleus in human and higher primates. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), NTL neurons show strong early cytoskeletal alterations, as revealed by the antibody Alz-50, but practically no senile plaques or neurofibrillary tangles. To study whether the activity of NTL neurons decreases when cytoskeletal changes appear, i.e., during aging and in AD, we applied a polyclonal antibody raised against the medial cisternae of the Golgi apparatus (GA). The size of the GA and the cell profile of NTL neurons, two established parameters for neuronal activity, were measured by an image analysis system. No significant change in the size of the profiles of the GA or of the neurons was observed in this nucleus during aging or AD. Earlier studies have shown that there is no decrease in cell number in the NTL in AD. We conclude that in the NTL an early hallmark of AD, i.e., cytoskeletal changes as stained by Alz-50, does not correlate with decreased neuronal activity, as reflected by the size of the GA, nor with a decrease in cell number. In addition, we found that the very early occurring and abundant presence of lipofuscin in NTL neurons does not go together with decreased neuronal activity.
