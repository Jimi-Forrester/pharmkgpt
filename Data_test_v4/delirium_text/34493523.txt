34493523|t|Protocol for conducting scoping reviews to map implementation strategies in different care settings: focusing on evidence-based interventions for preselected phenomena in people with dementia.
34493523|a|INTRODUCTION: Various evidence-based interventions are available to improve the care of people with dementia in different care settings, many of which are not or are only partially implemented in routine care. Different implementation strategies have been developed to support the implementation of interventions in routine care; however, the implementation of complex interventions remains challenging. The aim of our reviews is to identify promising strategies for, significant facilitators of and barriers to the implementation of evidence-based interventions for very common dementia care phenomena: (A) behaviour that challenges supporting a person with dementia in long-term care, (B) delirium in acute care and (C) the postacute care needs of people with dementia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct one scoping review for each preselected dementia care phenomenon (A, B and C). For this, three literature searches will be carried out in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), CINAHL (via EBSCO) and PsycINFO (via EBSCO). Additionally, we will perform backward and forward citation tracking via reference lists and Google Scholar. Identified records will be independently screened by two reviewers (title/abstract and full text) using the defined inclusion criteria. We will include all study designs and publications in the German or English language. For the data analyses, we will conduct a deductive content analysis using two different analytical approaches: Expert Recommendations for Implementation Change and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Due to the nature of a review, ethical clearing is not required. We will disseminate our results in peer-reviewed journals, workshops with stakeholders, and (inter)national conferences.
