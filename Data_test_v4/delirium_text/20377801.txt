20377801|t|Delirium following acute myocardial infarction: incidence, clinical profiles, and predictors.
20377801|a|PURPOSE: To examine the incidence, clinical profile, and predictors of delirium following acute myocardial infarction (MI). DESIGN AND METHODS: The study sample included 212 consecutive patients with acute MI who were admitted to the coronary intensive care unit of a university hospital. FINDINGS: Delirium was found to occur in 5.7% of the patients. The predictors of delirium were advanced age, higher level of serum potassium at admission, and experience of cardiac arrest during MI. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Delirium is reasonably prevalent in patients with acute MI. We propose that patients with the risk factors that have been delineated in this study should be evaluated carefully.
