17533997|a|Support groups can provide a forum for socialization and learning for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of these groups based on participant feedback. A survey questionnaire was administered to 70 support group participants with Alzheimer's disease from 8 well-established groups across the United States. Participants reported on the educational value, positive socialization, and improved ability to cope with symptoms and to accept the diagnosis as a result of participating in a support group. These reported outcomes suggest the importance of creating more sensitive measures to better evaluate the effectiveness of support groups and other educational or social support programs for persons with dementia.
