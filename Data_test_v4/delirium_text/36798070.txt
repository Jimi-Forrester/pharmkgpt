36798070|a|According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hip and femoral neck fractures are common fractures seen in older adults. Lower extremity nerve blocks are a tool available for pain control in these patients. One type of block that can be used in this type of fracture is the fascia iliaca compartment block. Clinicians sometimes do not utilize these blocks despite having been shown to produce better pain relief than a standard regimen of intravenous medications. We present a case of a 76-year-old female patient who had inadequate pain relief from intravenous medications. We illustrate the utilization of a standardized approach to a fascia iliaca compartment block using point-of-care ultrasound in the setting of a femoral neck fracture.
