31723537|t|Fournier s Gangrene Under Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor Therapy as a Life-Threatening Adverse Event: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.
31723537|a|Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a relatively new class of oral antidiabetic drugs. The US FDA has recently published a new warning about the safety of SGLT2 inhibitor administration in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. There is an emerging evidence of an increased risk for developing Fournier s gangrene (FG; a life-threatening complication) while under SGLT2 therapy. However, there are only three case reports and a total of 55 patients reported by the FDA to date. Therefore, there is a lack of evidence-based treatment algorithms for clinicians. We present the case of a 39-year-old male patient with diabetes on oral dapagliflozin, metformin, and sitagliptin therapy who was admitted with FG to our hospital. Following emergency scrotal surgery, he had to be transferred to the intensive care unit due to respiratory and circulatory insufficiency. After a prolonged 27-day hospital stay with delirium, blood glucose imbalance, and five further surgical interventions, the patient was stabilized and discharged. Dapagliflozin was discontinued permanently. This case demonstrates the risks of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy and the importance of early discontinuation after the occurrence of severe adverse events such as FG. According to the evidence in the literature, deranged glucose levels before admission are a common risk factor. However, further studies are required to identify patients at risks for FG and to investigate a direct connection with SGLT2 inhibitors.
