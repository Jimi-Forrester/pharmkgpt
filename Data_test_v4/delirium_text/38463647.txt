38463647|t|Effect of Yoga on Quality of Life in Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis: A Randomized Control Trial.
38463647|a|Introduction: Yoga is emerging as one of the holistic approaches to respiratory diseases. The scope of yoga is expanding in communicable diseases with physical, mental, and societal benefits. Aim and Objective: The present study aims to evaluate the effect of integrated yoga as an adjuvant therapy to the National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) on assessing health-related Quality of Life (QoL) in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Setting and Design: A randomized controlled trail study was conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Methodology: The study screened 826 PTB patients; 72 patients were found suitable and agreed to participate. The PTB patients were randomly assigned to either a yoga group (n = 36) or a control group (n = 36) using the sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelope technique. The control group received standard-of-care treatment as per NTEP, and the yoga group practiced 45 min of integrated yoga for 8 weeks along with standard of care. The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to collect the data at baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention. Results: The results of within-group comparisons in both the groups showed that there was a significant improvement in physical (P < 0.01), psychological (P < 0.01), and social (P < 0.01), with P <= 0.05 being considered statistically significant except environmental domain. Between groups, analysis shows that in the preintervention, there was no difference between the yoga and control group as P > 0.05. After the yoga intervention, there was an enhancement in QoL scores with three domains except the environmental domain (P = 0.28). Conclusion: The study evidence supports the use of yoga as a complementary therapy for the NTEP in patients with PTB may improve their QoL.
