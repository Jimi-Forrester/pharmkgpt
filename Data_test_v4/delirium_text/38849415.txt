38849415|a|Speech-in-noise (SIN) perception is a primary complaint of individuals with audiometric hearing loss. SIN performance varies drastically, even among individuals with normal hearing. The present genome-wide association study (GWAS) investigated the genetic basis of SIN deficits in individuals with self-reported normal hearing in quiet situations. GWAS was performed on 279,911 individuals from the UB Biobank cohort, with 58,847 reporting SIN deficits despite reporting normal hearing in quiet. GWAS identified 996 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), achieving significance (p < 5*10-8) across four genomic loci. 720 SNPs across 21 loci achieved suggestive significance (p < 10-6). GWAS signals were enriched in brain tissues, such as the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, hippocampus, and inferior temporal cortex. Cochlear cell types revealed no significant association with SIN deficits. SIN deficits were associated with various health traits, including neuropsychiatric, sensory, cognitive, metabolic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory conditions. A replication analysis was conducted on 242 healthy young adults. Self-reported speech perception, hearing thresholds (0.25-16 kHz), and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (1-16 kHz) were utilized for the replication analysis. 73 SNPs were replicated with a self-reported speech perception measure. 211 SNPs were replicated with at least one and 66 with at least two audiological measures. 12 SNPs near or within MAPT, GRM3, and HLA-DQA1 were replicated for all audiological measures. The present study highlighted a polygenic architecture underlying SIN deficits in individuals with self-reported normal hearing.
