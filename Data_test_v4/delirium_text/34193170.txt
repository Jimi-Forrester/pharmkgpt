34193170|a|BACKGROUND: Cadmium (Cd) is a common heavy metal that mainly causes renal damage. There is a lack of research on the large-scale and systematic evaluation of the association between urinary Cd (U-Cd) and various effect biomarkers among Chinese residents. METHODS: Based on the establishment process of dietary Cd limit standards by European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the dose-response relationships between U-Cd and four biomarkers, beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG), N-acetyl-beta-glucosidase (NAG), microalbumin (mALB), and retinol binding Protein (RBP) were explored, respectively. Toxicokinetic model was used to derive the dietary Cd exposure limit for Chinese residents after critical U-Cd concentration was calculated. RESULTS: As the sensitive biomarkers of renal injury, beta2-MG and NAG were selected to estimate the 95% confidence interval lower limit of the U-Cd benchmark dose (BMDL5) to be 3.07 and 2.98 mug/g Cr, respectively. Dietary Cd exposure limit was calculated to be 0.28 mug/kg bw/day (16.8 mug/day, based on the body weight of 60 kg), which was lower than the average Chinese Cd exposure (30.6 mug/day) by the China National Nutrient and Health Survey. CONCLUSION: This study established an overall association between U-Cd and renal injury biomarkers, and explored the Chinese dietary Cd exposure limits, which helps improve Chinese Cd exposure risk assessment and provides a reference basis for formulating reasonable exposure standards.
