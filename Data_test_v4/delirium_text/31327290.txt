31327290|t|Cdk5: A main culprit in neurodegeneration.
31327290|a|Objectives: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer Diseases (AD), Parkinson Diseases (PD) are a huge public health problem. The elucidation of their pathophysiological mechanism is one of our greatest challenges. Hyperactive immune system contributes to the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. Methods: In this review article, we have highlighted the neurodegenerative role of CDK5 and its involvement in Amyloid precursor pathway via Beta secretase enzyme. Results:All the landmark research reports for CDK5 were considered for this review and its involvement in disrupted autophagy and hyper immune response is the key cause for neurodegeneration. Conclusion: In conclusion, the present review focus on the pathways associated with Cdk5 and its role in causing neurodegeneration.
