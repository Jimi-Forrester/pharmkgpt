37298571|a|Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is an enzyme crucially implicated in aberrations of various signaling pathways that underlie the development of different human pathologies, such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Its inhibition can prevent these pathogenetic events, thus providing a useful tool for the discovery of novel therapeutic agents. The search for allosteric PTP1B inhibitors can represent a successful strategy to identify drug-like candidates by offering the opportunity to overcome some issues related to catalytic site-directed inhibitors, which have so far hampered the development of drugs targeting this enzyme. In this context, trodusquemine (MSI-1436), a natural aminosterol that acts as a non-competitive PTP1B inhibitor, appears to be a milestone. Initially discovered as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, trodusquemine exhibited a variety of unexpected properties, ranging from antidiabetic and anti-obesity activities to effects useful to counteract cancer and neurodegeneration, which prompted its evaluation in several preclinical and clinical studies. In this review article, we provide an overview of the main findings regarding the activities and therapeutic potential of trodusquemine and their correlation with PTP1B inhibition. We also included some aminosterol analogues and related structure-activity relationships that could be useful for further studies aimed at the discovery of new allosteric PTP1B inhibitors.
