32921515|t|COVID-19 and the forgotten pandemic: follow-up of neurocognitive disorders during lockdown in Argentina.
32921515|a|INTRODUCTION: Health systems in numerous countries around the world are suffering a serious burden as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of this situation, the follow-up of such chronic diseases as dementia may be at risk. Similarly, neuropsychiatric complications related to lockdown measures may also be neglected; Argentina's lockdown has been the longest implemented in Latin America. This study aims to determine the frequency of the different types of medical consultations for neurocognitive disorders and the predictors for requiring consultation since the beginning of the lockdown. METHODS: We performed a descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study based on data collected through an online survey. RESULTS: Data were collected on 324 participants, with 165 (50.9%) having had at least one medical consultation. Consultations were held by telephone in 109 cases (33.6%), by e-mail in 62 (19.1%), by video conference in 30 (9.3%), and at the emergency department in 23 (7.1%). Predictors of requiring consultation were Clinical Dementia Rating scores >=1 (P<.001) and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (P=.017). Higher Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores were found in the group of respondents who did require medical consultation (P<.001), but no significant differences were found between groups for Zarit Burden Interview scores. CONCLUSION: We identified a high prevalence of behavioural disorders and caregiver burden during lockdown. Nevertheless, only 50% of respondents had sought medical consultation (by telephone or email in 52.7% of cases). Care of people with dementia must be emphasised, guaranteeing follow-up of these patients.
