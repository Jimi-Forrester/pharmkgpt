34393677|a|Not all APOE epsilon4 carriers who survive to advanced age develop Alzheimer's disease (AD); factors attenuating the risk of epsilon4 on AD may exist. Guided by the top epsilon4-attenuating signals from methylome-wide association analyses (N=572, epsilon4+ and epsilon4-) of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, we conducted a meta-analysis for pathological AD within the epsilon4+ subgroups (N=235) across four independent collections of brains. Cortical RNA-seq and microglial morphology measurements were used in functional analyses. Three out of the four significant CpG dinucleotides were captured by one principle component (PC1), which interacts with epsilon4 on AD, and is associated with expression of innate immune genes and activated microglia. In epsilon4 carriers, reduction in each unit of PC1 attenuated the odds of AD by 58% (OR=2.39, 95%CI=[1.64,3.46], P=7.08x10-6). An epigenomic factor associated with a reduced proportion of activated microglia (microglial epigenomic factor 1) appears to attenuate the risk of epsilon4 on AD.
