38840105|a|BACKGROUND: Worldwide, more than 125 million people are infected with Shigella each year and develop shigellosis. In our previous study, we provided evidence that Shigella sonnei infection triggers activation of the NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in macrophages. NLRP3 inflammasome is responsible for regulating the release of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 through the protease caspase-1. Researchers and biotech companies have shown great interest in developing inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome, recognizing it as a promising therapeutic target for several diseases. The leaves of Cinnamomum osmophloeum kaneh, an indigenous tree species in Taiwan, are rich in cinnamaldehyde (CA), a compound present in significant amounts. Our aim is to investigate how CA affects the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in S. sonnei-infected macrophages. METHODS: Macrophages were infected with S. sonnei, with or without CA. ELISA and Western blotting were employed to detect protein expression or phosphorylation levels. Flow cytometry was utilized to assess H2O2 production and mitochondrial damage. Fluorescent microscopy was used to detect cathepsin B activity and mitochondrial ROS production. Additionally, colony-forming units were employed to measure macrophage phagocytosis and bactericidal activity. RESULTS: CA inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome in S. sonnei-infected macrophages by suppressing caspase-1 activation and reducing IL-1beta and IL-18 expression. CA also inhibited pyroptosis by decreasing caspase-11 and Gasdermin D activation. Mechanistically, CA reduced lysosomal damage and enhanced autophagy, while leaving mitochondrial damage, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, and NF-kappaB activation unaffected. Furthermore, CA significantly boosted phagocytosis and the bactericidal activity of macrophages against S. sonnei, while reducing secretion of IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor following infection. CONCLUSION: CA shows promise as a nutraceutical for mitigating S. sonnei infection by diminishing inflammation and enhancing phagocytosis and the bactericidal activity of macrophages against S. sonnei.
