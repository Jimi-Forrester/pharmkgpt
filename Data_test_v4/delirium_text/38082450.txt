38082450|a|INTRODUCTION: Age-related blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, cerebromicrovascular senescence, and microvascular rarefaction substantially contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies established a causal link between age-related decline in circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), cerebromicrovascular dysfunction, and cognitive decline. The aim of our study was to determine the effect of IGF-1 signaling on senescence, BBB permeability, and vascular density in middle-age and old brains. METHODS: Accelerated endothelial senescence was assessed in senescence reporter mice (VE-Cadherin-CreERT2 /Igf1rfl/fl x p16-3MR) using flow cytometry. To determine the functional consequences of impaired IGF-1 input to cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells, BBB integrity and capillary density were studied in mice with endothelium-specific knockout of IGF1R (VE-Cadherin-CreERT2 /Igf1rfl/fl ) using intravital two-photon microscopy. RESULTS: In VE-Cadherin-CreERT2 /Igf1rfl/fl mice: (1) there was an increased presence of senescent endothelial cells; (2) cumulative permeability of the microvessels to fluorescent tracers of different molecular weights (0.3-40 kDa) is significantly increased, as compared to that of control mice, whereas decline in cortical capillary density does not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the notion that IGF-1 signaling plays a crucial role in preserving a youthful cerebromicrovascular endothelial phenotype and maintaining the integrity of the BBB.
