39538968|a|Lactic acid bacteria derived extracellular vesicles (LAB-EVs) are nano-sized and carry a variety of biological cargoes. LAB-EVs have proven to be potential mediators of intercellular communication, serving not only the parental bacteria but also the host cell in both physiology and pathology. LAB-EVs are therapeutically beneficial in various diseases through a cell-free strategy. Particularly, EVs secreted from probiotics can exert health-promoting effects on humans. Additionally, the excitement around LAB-EVs has extended to their use as nano-sized drug carriers, since they can traverse biological barriers. Nevertheless, significant challenges in terms of isolation, characterization, and safety must be addressed to ensure the clinical application of LAB-EVs. Therefore, this review emphasizes the isolation and purification methods of LAB-EVs. We also introduce the biogenesis, cargo sorting, and functions of LAB-EVs. The biological regulatory factors of LAB-EVs are summarized and discussed. Special attention is given to the interaction between LAB-EVs and the host, their ability to maintain intestinal homeostasis, and the immunity and inflammation they induce in diverse diseases. Furthermore, we summarize the characterization of LAB-EV cargoes by advanced analytical methods such as proteomics. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of LAB-EVs as a means of diagnosis and treatment in clinical translation. In conclusion, this review scrutinizes current knowledge and provides guidelines for proposing new perspectives for future research in the field of LAB-EVs.
