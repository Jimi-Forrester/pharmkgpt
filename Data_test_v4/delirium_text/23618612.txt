23618612|t|Delirium after cardiac surgery: have we overlooked obstructive sleep apnea?
23618612|a|Obstructive sleep apnea is common in patients with cardiovascular disease. It is well known that cardiac surgery is a risk factor for delirium. Researchers have shown that obstructive sleep apnea is an independent risk factor for the occurrence of delirium. In this manuscript we speculate on how obstructive sleep apnea may increase the risk of delirium in patients with cardiac surgery. If this is found to be confirmed, we would have another target through which we can decrease the risk of delirium in this population.
