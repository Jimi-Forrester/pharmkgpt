34754949|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite adult day services (ADS) being the most racially diverse home- and community-based service (HCBS), there is a paucity of research that has examined the impact of ADS on well-being measures among Black caregivers of people living with dementia. To address this gap, this study examined the association between the use of ADS and depressive symptoms among Black dementia caregivers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using baseline data from 2 behavioral intervention trials, Advancing Caregiver Training (n = 72) and Care of Persons with Dementia in their Environments (n = 63), we conducted ordinary least squares regression to examine the association between ADS use in the past 6 months and depressive symptoms (n = 135). The dependent variable, depressive symptoms, was assessed by the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. The independent variable was assessed by self-report of ADS use in the past 6 months. RESULTS: Nearly 36% of the sample used ADS in the past 6 months. After controlling for caregiver characteristics associated with depression (burden, social support, self-rated health, caregiving relationship status, years caregiving, religious/spiritual coping, and demographic characteristics), caregivers who utilized ADS had a lowered CES-D score (B = -1.97, p = .03) compared to those who did not use ADS. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Black dementia caregivers who utilized ADS had lower depressive symptoms compared to those who did not utilize ADS. ADS may be a critical HCBS that can provide relief to Black caregivers. Research is needed to examine additional benefits of ADS use among Black caregivers and the policy and programming needed to enhance access to ADS.
