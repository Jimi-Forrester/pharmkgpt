33898612|t|ERS International Congress 2020: highlights from the Respiratory Infections assembly.
33898612|a|In the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic year 2020, the 30th European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress took place for the first time in a fully virtual format. Despite the challenging nature of the task to create and deliver an online event of this size and scope, it turned out to be a great success, welcoming over 33 000 delegates to the specially designed online platform and offering more than 450 scientific and educational sessions. Somewhat predictably, this year's ERS International Congress dedicated a full day to the topic of COVID-19, highlighting that infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a respiratory disease that is particularly important this year. In this article, the Early Career Members of the Assembly 10 (Respiratory Infections and Tuberculosis) review some of the most interesting sessions including presentations and posters on respiratory infections and tuberculosis that were deemed as important.
