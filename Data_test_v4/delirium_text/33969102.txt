33969102|a|BACKGROUND: Giant cell tumors (GCT) are most commonly seen in the distal femur. These tumors are uncommon in the small bones of the hand and feet, and a very few cases have been reported. A giant cell tumor of the talus is rarely seen clinically and could be a challenge to physicians. CASE SUMMARY: We report a rare case of GCT of the talus in one patient who underwent a new reconstructive surgery technique using a three-dimensional (3D) printing talar prosthesis. The prosthesis shape was designed by tomographic image processing and segmentation using technology to match the intact side by mirror symmetry with 3D post-processing technologies. The patient recovered nearly full range of motion of the ankle after 6 mo. The visual analogue scale and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society scores were 1 and 89 points, respectively. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that 3D printing of a talar prosthesis is a beneficial option for GCT of the talus.
