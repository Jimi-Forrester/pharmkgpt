29944335|t|Stereoisomers of Schisandrin B Are Potent ATP Competitive GSK-3beta Inhibitors with Neuroprotective Effects against Alzheimer's Disease: Stereochemistry and Biological Activity.
29944335|a|Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) is a key enzyme in hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins and is a promising therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we reported, for the first time, that the stereoisomers of Schisandrin B (Sch B), (+)-1, (-)-1, (+)-2, and (-)-2, were potent GSK-3beta inhibitors. They were demonstrated to selectively target GSK-3beta in an orthosteric binding mode, with IC50 values of 340, 290, 80, and 70 nM, respectively. Further study showed that these stereoisomers can significantly increase the expression of p-GSK-3beta (Ser9) and decrease the expressions of p-GSK-3beta (Tyr216) and p-GSK-3beta (Tyr279). Finally, these compounds can alleviate the cell injury induced by Abeta, and the cognitive disorders in AD mice, especially (+)-2 and (-)-2. Collectively, the stereoisomers of Sch B, especially (+)-2 and (-)-2, were found to be potential selective ATP-competitive GSK-3beta inhibitors, which further affected their anti-AD effects. These promising findings explained the biological target of Sch B in AD, and bring a new understanding in the stereochemistry and bioactivities of Sch B.
