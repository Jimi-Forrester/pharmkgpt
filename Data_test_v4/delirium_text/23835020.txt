23835020|a|Targeting of the central nervous system (CNS) in order to treat disorders is actually challenging due to the necessity to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). This review aims to show how nanomedicine can propose new approach for the treatment and the diagnosis of CNS diseases focusing on Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a neurodegenerative disorder prevalent in the senile population. It is characterized by severe neuronal loss and proliferation of plaques composed of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) and Tau protein deposites. An imbalance between production and clearance leading to the aggregation of Abeta peptides especially in neurotoxic forms, may be the initiating factor in AD. The absence of an effective therapeutic approach nowadays could be, in part, due to the bad knowledge of AD physiopathology and the lack of early diagnosis. Many drawbacks such as poor bioavailability or limited BBB arising of tested molecules in the current or new therapeutic strategies explain their failure but can be resolved by the use of nanotechnology. Examples of recently published works using nanoparticles for improving diagnosis and therapy of AD are presented. Ideal nanocarriers for this aim must be able to pass through the BBB and to interact with an AD marker as soluble extracellular Abeta forms which are known as the most toxic ones. These first results, even if many ones were obtained in vitro, brought to light the potential of nanoparticles for this challenging issue.
