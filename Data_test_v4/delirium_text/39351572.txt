39351572|a|BACKGROUND: Radical resection of colon cancer under general anesthesia is one of the main treatment methods for this malignancy. However, due to the physiological characteristics of elderly patients, the safety of perioperative anesthesia needs special attention. As an alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist, dexmedetomidine (Dex) has attracted much attention from anesthesiologists due to its stabilizing effect on heart rate and blood pressure, inhibitory effect on inflammation, and sedative and analgesic effects. Its application in general anesthesia may have a positive impact on the quality of anesthesia and postoperative recovery in elderly patients undergoing radical resection of colon cancer. AIM: To investigate the anesthetic effects of Dex during radical surgery for colon cancer under general anesthesia in elderly patients. METHODS: A total of 165 colon cancer patients who underwent radical surgery for colon cancer under general anesthesia at Qingdao University Affiliated Haici Hospital, Qingdao, China were recruited and divided into two groups: A and B. In group A, Dex was administered 30 min before surgery, while group B received an equivalent amount of normal saline. The hemodynamic changes, pulmonary compliance, airway pressure, inflammatory factors, confusion assessment method scores, Ramsay Sedation-Agitation Scale scores, and cellular immune function indicators were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Group A showed less intraoperative hemodynamic fluctuations, better pulmonary compliance, and lower airway resistance compared with group B. Twelve hours after the surgery, the serum levels of TLR-2, TLR-4, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in group A were significantly lower than those of group B (P < 0.05). After extubation, the Ramsay Sedation-Agitation Scale score of group A patients was significantly higher than that of group B patients, indicating a higher level of sedation. The incidence of delirium was significantly lower in group A than in group B (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of Dex as an adjunct to general anesthesia for radical surgery in elderly patients with colon cancer results in better effectiveness of anesthesia.
