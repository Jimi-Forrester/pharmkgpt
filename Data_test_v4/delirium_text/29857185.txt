29857185|t|Secretome from SH-SY5Y APPSwe cells trigger time-dependent CHME3 microglia activation phenotypes, ultimately leading to miR-21 exosome shuttling.
29857185|a|Exosome-mediated intercellular communication has been increasingly recognized as having a broad impact on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Still, limited information exists regarding their "modus operandi", as it critically depends on exosomal cargo, environmental context and target cells. Therefore, a more thorough understanding of the role of exosomes from different cell types as mediators of neuroinflammation in AD context is a decisive step to open avenues for innovative and efficient therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that SH-SY5Y cells transfected with the Swedish mutant of APP695 (SHSwe) remarkably express increased inflammatory markers, combined with higher APP and Abeta1-40 production, when compared to naive SH-SY5Y (SH) cells. Although exerting an early clearance effect on extracellular APP and Abeta accumulation when in co-culture with SHSwe cells, human CHME3 microglia gradually lose such property, and express both pro-inflammatory (iNOS, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, MHC class II, IL-6) and pro-resolving genes (IL-10 and Arginase 1), while also evidence increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity. Interestingly, upregulation of inflammatory-associated miRNA (miR)-155, miR-146a and miR-124 by SHSwe secretome shows to be time-dependent and to inversely correlate with their respective targets (SOCS-1, IRAK1 and C/EBP-alpha). We report that microglia also internalize exosomes released from SHSwe cells, which are enriched in miR-155, miR-146a, miR-124, miR-21 and miR-125b and recapitulate the cells of origin. Furthermore, we show that SHSwe-derived exosomes are capable of inducing acute and delayed microglial upregulation of TNF-alpha, HMGB1 and S100B pro-inflammatory markers, from which only S100B is found on their derived exosomes. Most importantly, our data reveal that miR-21 is a consistent biomarker that is found not only in SHSwe cells and in their released exosomes, but also in the recipient CHME3 microglia and derived exosomes. This work contributes to the increased understanding of neuron-microglia communication and exosome-mediated neuroinflammation in AD, while highlights miR-21 as a promising biomarker/target for therapeutic intervention.
