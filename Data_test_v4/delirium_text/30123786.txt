30123786|t|Determination of Clinical Signs and Symptoms Predicting No Pelvic Fracture in Patients with Multiple Trauma.
30123786|a|BACKGROUND: Pelvic fracture (PF) is the second-most prevalent cause of mortality after brain trauma among multiple trauma patients. Our aim was to examine the reliability of suggestive criteria for having no PF (NPF) according to the common reported clinical signs and symptoms (CSSs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the current prospective study, 3527 patients with multiple trauma were recruited according to the guideline of emergency medicine. Information on age, gender, pelvic pain or tenderness, sacrum and coccyx pain or tenderness, the ability to active straight leg raising (SLR), and distracting injury was collected, and PF was examined by either X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan. RESULTS: The CSS sensitivity of NPF was 39.75% and the specificity was 100%. The no distracting injury was not significantly different according to the CSS criteria and results of X-ray and CT scan (P = 0.269); however, the difference of other criteria was significant (P < 0.0001). No pelvic pain or tenderness and the ability to active SLR considerably affected the prediction of NPF (P < 0.0001). No distracting injury can be omitted from the criteria without any effect on specificity, but with increased sensitivity (60.8% with three criteria vs. 39.7% with four criteria). CONCLUSION: According to our results, it can be said that due to the high predictive value of our suggestive criteria, it could be applicable as the important criteria for defecting NPF among patients with the possibility of PF. This approach can reduce the necessity of imaging in these patients which helps to reduce the health cost and hazards of X-ray used for imaging and exhaustion of medical devices.
