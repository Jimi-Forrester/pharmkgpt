35001893|t|Burden of Insomnia and Sleep Disturbances and the Impact of Sleep Treatments in Patients with Probable or Possible Alzheimer's Disease: A Structured Literature Review.
35001893|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances are frequent in Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To summarize the impact of sleep disturbances on AD patients and their caregivers and the effects of currently available sleep therapies. METHODS: Published studies (January 1985-March 2020) assessing the burden associated with insomnia/sleep disturbances in the AD population and insomnia treatment effects were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library and screened against inclusion criteria. RESULTS: 58 studies assessing patient and caregiver burden, institutionalization, and insomnia treatments in AD patients with sleep disturbances were identified. Sleep disturbances were associated with worse cognition, functional ability, and behavioral and neuropsychological functioning. Health status and quality of life of both patients and caregivers were reduced in the presence of sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances were also associated with institutionalization. Although significant associations between sleep problems and clinical outcomes were apparent, there was generally no control for other influencing factors (e.g., cognitive status). Bright light and behavioral therapies as well as drugs showed some promise in AD patients, but studies were primarily small and limited data were available, particularly in regard to the effect on associated clinical burden. CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances are a significant problem for AD patients and caregivers, associated with behavioral and psychological problems and cognitive decline. However, they remain poorly characterized and under-researched. As the global population is aging and AD is on thes rise, data from larger, prospective trials are required to fully understand the clinical correlates of sleep disturbances and the impact insomnia treatments can have.
