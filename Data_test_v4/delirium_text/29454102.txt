29454102|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. This pathological condition is characterized not only by Abeta and tau accumulation in the central nervous system (CNS), but also by inflammation, processes that can lead to neurodegeneration. Besides that, other factors may contribute to the development of AD, such as dyslipidemias. Changes in lipid levels can either influence the activity of enzymes related to the protein deposition that occurs in this pathological condition, or enhance the peripheral and CNS immune responses. Furthermore, cholesterol-associated genes are frequently associated with AD. Here, we extensively reviewed the literature and, based on the existing evidences, we suggest inflammation as an important link between dyslipidemias and AD.
