31636375|t|Saturated fatty acid is a principal cause of anxiety-like behavior in diet-induced obese rats in relation to serum lysophosphatidyl choline level.
31636375|a|BACKGROUND: Obesity is considered to be a risk factor for neurodegenerative- and psychiatric- diseases including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and depression. A high-lard diet is widely used to induce obesity in model animal experiments, which also leads to anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors. However, the contribution of dietary fat source to these abnormal behaviors in obesity is largely unknown. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with different types of high-fat (lard and olive oil) diet with high sucrose for more than 8 weeks. Anxiety-like behavior (open-field and social interaction tests) and cognitive function (Y-maze test) after the treatment were analyzed. The expression of mRNA related to neurotransmitter and nutrient transporters in the prefrontal cortex were determined using real-time PCR. Serum lipid species were determined using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Both high-fat/high-sucrose diets increased body weight (BW), adipose tissue, and serum leptin level. However, the high-lard/high-sucrose (HL/HS), but not high-olive oil/HS, diet induced anxiety-like behavior in open field and social interaction tests. BW and endocrine hormones such as leptin and insulin were not correlated to anxiety-like behavior. HL/HS diet induced an increase in glutamate transporter and a decrease of glutamate receptor mRNA expressions in the prefrontal cortex. Further, serum lysophosphatidyl choline conjugated with several fatty acids was decreased by HL/HS diet. LPC conjugated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was strongly correlated with anxiety-like behavior. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that lipid composition, rather than obesity per se, is a major cause of anxiety-like behavior in high-fat diet-induced obesity. Decreased levels of peripheral LPC conjugated with EPA and altered glutamate system in the prefrontal cortex might be involve in the pathophysiology of the behavioral change.
