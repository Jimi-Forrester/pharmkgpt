36399267|t|Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (hiPSC)-Derived Neurons and Glia for the Elucidation of Pathogenic Mechanisms in Alzheimer's Disease.
36399267|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder and a mechanistically complex disease. For the last decade, human models of AD using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have emerged as a powerful way to understand disease pathogenesis in relevant human cell types. In this review, we summarize the state of the field and how this technology can apply to studies of both familial and sporadic studies of AD. We discuss patient-derived iPSCs, genome editing, differentiation of neural cell types, and three-dimensional organoids, and speculate on the future of this type of work for increasing our understanding of, and improving therapeutic development for, this devastating disease.
