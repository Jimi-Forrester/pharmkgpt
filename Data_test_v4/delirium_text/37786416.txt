37786416|t|The role of intracerebral dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in sleep-wake cycles and general anesthesia.
37786416|a|Dopamine (DA), a monoamine neurotransmitter, is synthesized and released mainly by neurons in the ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta of the midbrain. DA and its receptors are essential for the regulation of arousal, movement, cognition, reward, and other neurobiological behaviors. Arousal, locomotion, cognition, reward, and other neurobiological functions are all regulated by dopamine and its receptors. Dopamine receptors can be divided into D1-like receptors (including D1 and D5) or D2-like receptors (containing D2, D3, and D4), with D1 and D2 receptors (D1Rs, and D2Rs) being the most important. Currently, studies indicated that D1Rs and D2Rs are tightly involved with the process of sleep-wake and general anesthesia, but the specific mechanism remains unclear. In this review, we compiled the most recent findings, mainly focusing on the structure, distribution, and signal pathway of D1Rs and D2Rs in the central nervous system, as well as the involvement of D1Rs and D2Rs in sleep-wake and general anesthesia. Thus, the investigations of the D1Rs and D2Rs will benefit not only better knowledge for how sleep-wake control works but also the mechanism of general anesthesia.
