34908690|a|Patients with systemic lupus erythematous that suffers from one or more of several neuropsychiatric symptoms represent a subcategory termed "neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus" (NPSLE). Different environmental factors, such as infection, stress, and ischemia, mediated by inflammatory cytokines, may damage the blood-brain barrier, further contributing to neuropsychiatric symptoms. Antiribosomal-P antibodies are specifically related to psychosis in NPSLE. Three patients of systemic lupus erythematosus who developed features of psychosis are presented and the condition is briefly discussed.
