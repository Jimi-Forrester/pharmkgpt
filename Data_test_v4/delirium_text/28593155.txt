28593155|a|BACKGROUND: The feasibility of single-port video-assisted thoracic surgery (SPVATS) for primary lung cancer is not well understood. In this study, we compared SP and multi-port (MP) VATS for the surgical treatment of patients with primary lung cancer. METHODS: Surgical treatment was performed in 181 patients with primary lung cancer at Inje University Haeundae Paik Hospital between June 2012 and December 2015. A propensity-matched analysis was used to compare the postoperative outcomes and to evaluate the comparative feasibility and safety of SPVATS and MPVATS. RESULTS: There were 37 patients in the SPVATS group and 67 patients in the MPVATS group. Propensity matching produced 32 pairs. The operation time (210 minutes versus 200 minutes, p=0.11), volume of the estimated blood loss (170 mL versus 160 mL, p=0.19), duration of chest tube drainage (5 days versus 6 days, p=0.66), and length of hospital stay (9 days versus 10 days, p=0.89) were similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: In our study, SPVATS for primary lung cancer was safe and feasible in well selected patients. A prospective, randomized study with a large group and long-term follow-up is necessary to evaluate the clinical feasibility and the advantages of SPVATS for primary lung cancer.
