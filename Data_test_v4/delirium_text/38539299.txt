38539299|a|Controlling preoperative anxiety is necessary in pediatric patients to avoid adverse effects such as emergence delirium, behavioral problems, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety prior to future procedures, and increased analgesic doses in the recovery room. Some patients, especially ones with behavioral issues, have a difficult time arriving at the hospital. Medications given at home can be helpful. We describe a case series of six patients who received pre-admission oral clonidine prior to arrival to the hospital. The patients were all able to enter the hospital without difficulty and the families reported less anxiety and more cooperation subjectively compared with previous experiences. Transient intraoperative hypotension was a side effect of oral clonidine, with no long-term sequelae.
