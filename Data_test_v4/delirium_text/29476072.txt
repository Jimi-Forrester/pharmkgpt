29476072|a|Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is an important factor leading to low back pain, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Compared with normal nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues, the expression of circ-GRB10 was downregulated in IDD. Furthermore, overexpression of circ-GRB10 inhibited NP cell apoptosis. circ-GRB10 could sequester miR-328-5p, which could potentially lead to the upregulation of target genes related to cell proliferation via the ErbB pathway. In conclusion, the present study revealed that circ-GRB10/miR-328-5p/ERBB2 signaling pathway is involved in IDD development, suggesting that circ-GRB10 might be a novel therapeutic target for IDD.
