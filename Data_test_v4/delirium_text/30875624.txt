30875624|t|Gastric sleeve surgery in hemodialysis: A case report.
30875624|a|INTRODUCTION: Morbid obesity in chronic kidney disease patients on hemodialysis limits access to renal transplantation. We report here a case of a surgical procedure for weight reduction in a hemodialysis patient and adjustment of dry weight through bioelectrical impedance. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old male with CKD on hemodialysis for 26 years. After 3 years on dialysis, he underwent a cadaveric kidney transplant. However, after 8 years of transplant, he loses the kidney graft and returns to dialysis treatment. The patient's BMI increased to 42 kg/m2 and he had difficult-to-control hypertension and severe sleep apnea. Behavioral, nutritional and pharmacologic measures were not sufficient to achieve an adequate weight control. Thus, a surgical procedure for weight reduction was considered. The patient underwent a laparoscopic gastric sleeve without any complications. Dry weight was adjusted through bioelectrical impedance before each hemodialysis session. The patient did not display hypotension, cramps, or fluid overload. After a 30 kg weight loss, the patient's BMI was 28.3 kg/m2, allowing registration on the kidney transplant waitlist. DISCUSSION: Obesity in CKD restricts access to kidney transplant waitlist. Bariatric surgery has proven to be safe and effective for sustained weight loss and it seems that the fact that a patient is dialysis dependent does not independently increase post-operatory complications. CONCLUSION: Surgical procedures for weight reduction in dialysis patients does not independently increase the risk for adverse outcomes after bariatric surgery. The estimation of DW through BIA is an effective method for avoiding complications generated by excessive or deficient ultrafiltration.
