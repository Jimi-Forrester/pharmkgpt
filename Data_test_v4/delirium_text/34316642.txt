34316642|a|INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease patients are usually characterized by body motor dysfunction due to dopaminergic reduction in the central nervous system. Freezing of gait is a motor disorder that affects certain Parkinson's disease patients. However, it is hypothesized that non-motor functions mediated by the cholinergic system are also involved in developing freezing of gait. Visual information processing speed, or inspection time is independent of the motor response, and can be used a reliable measure of the cholinergic system integrity. OBJECTIVE: Inspection time can be used to investigate whether Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait symptoms have a larger impairment in cholinergic mediated functions than those patients who have no freezing of gait symptoms and healthy controls. METHODS: The inspection time was determined by a simple length discrimination task. Twenty-two Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait, 25 Parkinson's disease patients without freezing of gait, and 25 aged matched healthy controls participated in the study. RESULTS: Based on the log values of IT score, Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait symptoms had statistically significant slower inspection times (mean of 1.793 ms) than Parkinson's disease patients without freezing of gait (mean of 1.655 ms) and healthy controls (mean of 1.523 ms). Inspection times for the Parkinson's disease patients without FOG symptoms were also significantly slower than healthy controls. CONCLUSION: The results of this study support the hypothesis that the cholinergic system integrity is affected more in Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait symptoms.
