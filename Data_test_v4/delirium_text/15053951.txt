15053951|a|Efforts to elucidate the pathomechanism of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders have yielded an increasing pile of hypotheses. When analyzing thousands of scientific papers, the involvement of the central secondary messenger, calcium, becomes apparent. Here, we demonstrate that disturbed calcium homeostasis might be a common underlying factor in brain pathologies. By targeting calcium, this new information promises to broaden our understanding of health and illness and the approaches we take to treating disease.
