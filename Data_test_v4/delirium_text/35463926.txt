35463926|t|Updated Review of the Evidence Supporting the Medical and Legal Use of NeuroQuant  and NeuroGage  in Patients With Traumatic Brain Injury.
35463926|a|Over 40 years of research have shown that traumatic brain injury affects brain volume. However, technical and practical limitations made it difficult to detect brain volume abnormalities in patients suffering from chronic effects of mild or moderate traumatic brain injury. This situation improved in 2006 with the FDA clearance of NeuroQuant , a commercially available, computer-automated software program for measuring MRI brain volume in human subjects. More recent strides were made with the introduction of NeuroGage , commercially available software that is based on NeuroQuant  and extends its utility in several ways. Studies using these and similar methods have found that most patients with chronic mild or moderate traumatic brain injury have brain volume abnormalities, and several of these studies found-surprisingly-more abnormal enlargement than atrophy. More generally, 102 peer-reviewed studies have supported the reliability and validity of NeuroQuant  and NeuroGage . Furthermore, this updated version of a previous review addresses whether NeuroQuant  and NeuroGage  meet the Daubert standard for admissibility in court. It concludes that NeuroQuant  and NeuroGage  meet the Daubert standard based on their reliability, validity, and objectivity. Due to the improvements in technology over the years, these brain volumetric techniques are practical and readily available for clinical or forensic use, and thus they are important tools for detecting signs of brain injury.
