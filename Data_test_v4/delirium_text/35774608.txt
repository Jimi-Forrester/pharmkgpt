35774608|t|The Role of Gut Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Perioperative Neurocognitive Dysfunction.
35774608|a|With the aging of the world population and advances in medical and health technology, more and more elderly patients are undergoing anesthesia and surgery, and perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction (PND) is receiving increasing attention. The latest definition of PND, published simultaneously in November 2018 in 6 leading journals in the field of anesthesiology, clarifies that PND includes preoperatively cognitive impairment, postoperative delirium, delayed neurocognitive recovery, and postoperative cognitive dysfunction and meets the diagnostic criteria for neurocognitive impairment in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -fifth edition (DSM-5). The time frame for PND includes preoperatively and within 12 months postoperatively. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota regulates central nervous function and behavior through the gut microbiota - gut - brain axis, but the role of the axis in the pathogenesis of PND remains unclear. Therefore, this article reviews the mechanism of the role of gut microbiota-gut-brain axis in PND, so as to help explore reasonable early treatment strategies.
