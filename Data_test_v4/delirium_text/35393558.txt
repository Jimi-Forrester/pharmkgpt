35393558|a|The microtubule-associated protein tau plays a central role in tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The exact molecular mechanisms underlying tau toxicity are unclear, but aging is irrefutably the biggest risk factor. This raises the question of how cellular senescence affects the function of tau as a microtubule regulator. Here we report that the proportion of tau that is proteolytically cleaved at the caspase-3 site (TauC3) doubles in the hippocampus of senescent mice. TauC3 is also elevated in AD patients. Through quantitative live-cell imaging, we show that TauC3 has a drastically reduced dynamics of its microtubule interaction. Single-molecule tracking of tau confirmed that TauC3 has a longer residence time on axonal microtubules. The reduced dynamics of the TauC3-microtubule interaction correlated with a decreased transport of mitochondria, a reduced processivity of APP-vesicle transport and an induction of region-specific dendritic atrophy in CA1 neurons of the hippocampus. The microtubule-targeting drug Epothilone D normalized the interaction of TauC3 with microtubules and modulated the transport of APP-vesicles dependent on the presence of overexpressed human tau. The results indicate a novel toxic gain of function, in which a post-translational modification of tau changes the dynamics of the tau-microtubule interaction and thus leads to axonal transport defects and neuronal degeneration. The data also introduce microtubule-targeting drugs as pharmacological modifiers of the tau-microtubule interaction with the potential to restore the physiological interaction of pathologically altered tau with microtubules.
