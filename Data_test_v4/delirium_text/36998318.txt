36998318|t|Contribution of clinical information to the predictive performance of plasma beta-amyloid levels for amyloid positron emission tomography positivity.
36998318|a|Background: Early detection of beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation, a major biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD), has become important. As fluid biomarkers, the accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta for predicting Abeta deposition on positron emission tomography (PET) has been extensively studied, and the development of plasma Abeta is beginning to receive increased attention recently. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether APOE genotypes, age, and cognitive status increase the predictive performance of plasma Abeta and CSF Abeta levels for Abeta PET positivity. Methods: We recruited 488 participants who underwent both plasma Abeta and Abeta PET studies (Cohort 1) and 217 participants who underwent both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta and Abeta PET studies (Cohort 2). Plasma and CSF samples were analyzed using ABtest-MS, an antibody-free liquid chromatography-differential mobility spectrometry-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry method and INNOTEST enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits, respectively. To evaluate the predictive performance of plasma Abeta and CSF Abeta, respectively, logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed. Results: When predicting Abeta PET status, both plasma Abeta42/40 ratio and CSF Abeta42 showed high accuracy (plasma Abeta area under the curve (AUC) 0.814; CSF Abeta AUC 0.848). In the plasma Abeta models, the AUC values were higher than plasma Abeta alone model, when the models were combined with either cognitive stage (p < 0.001) or APOE genotype (p = 0.011). On the other hand, there was no difference between the CSF Abeta models, when these variables were added. Conclusion: Plasma Abeta might be a useful predictor of Abeta deposition on PET status as much as CSF Abeta, particularly when considered with clinical information such as APOE genotype and cognitive stage.
