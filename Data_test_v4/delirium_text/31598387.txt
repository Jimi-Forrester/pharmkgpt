31598387|t|Interaction among inflammasome, autophagy and non-coding RNAs: new horizons for drug.
31598387|a|Autophagy and inflammasomes are shown to interact in various situations including infectious disease, cancer, diabetes and neurodegeneration. Since multiple layers of molecular regulators contribute to the interplay between autophagy and inflammasome activation, the detail of such interplay remains largely unknown. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which have been implicated in regulating an expanding list of cellular processes including immune defense against pathogens and inflammatory response in cancer and metabolic diseases, may join in the crosstalk between inflammasomes and autophagy in physiological or disease conditions. In this review, we summarize the latest research on the interlink among ncRNAs, inflammasomes and autophagy and discuss the emerging role of these three in multiple signaling transduction pathways involved in clinical conditions. By analyzing these intriguing interconnections, we hope to unveil the mechanism inter-regulating these multiple processes and ultimately discover potential drug targets for some refractory diseases.
