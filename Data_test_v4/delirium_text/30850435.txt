30850435|t|Current Status of Deep Brain Stimulation for Alzheimer's Disease: From Chance Observation to Clinical Trials.
30850435|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that results in significant memory impairment and cognitive decline. Current medical treatment is aimed at treating AD symptoms but does not alter the disease course. The use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of AD is in its nascent phase. Here, we describe the evolution of DBS as a potential treatment modality for AD, including previous and current trials, as well as the behavioral and histological preclinical data that help to better understand and inform future clinical trials. As such, a phase 3 clinical trial studying the effects of forniceal DBS for AD is currently underway.
