35639233|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare inherited disease portrayed with marked cognitive and motor decline owing to extensive neurodegeneration. NADPH oxidase is considered as an important contributor to the oxidative injury in several neurodegenerative disorders including HD. Thus, the present study explored the possible neuroprotective effects of diapocynin, a specific NADPH oxidase inhibitor, against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) model of HD in rats. METHODS: Animals received diapocynin (10 mg/kg/day, p.o), 30 min before 3-NP (10 mg/kg/day, i.p) over a period of 14 days. RESULTS: Diapocynin administration attenuated 3-NP-induced oxidative stress with significant increase in reduced glutathione, glutathione-S-transferase, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor striatal contents contrary to NADPH oxidase (NOX2; gp91phox subunit) diminished expression. Moreover, diapocynin mitigated 3-NP-associated neuroinflammation and glial activation with prominent downregulation of nuclear factor-Kbeta p65 and marked decrement of inducible nitric oxide synthase content in addition to decreased immunoreactivity of ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein; markers of microglial and astroglial activation, respectively. Treatment with diapocynin hindered 3-NP-induced apoptosis with prominent decrease in tumor suppressor protein and Bcl-2-associated X protein contents whereas the anti-apoptotic marker; B-cell lymphoma-2 content was noticeably increased. Diapocynin neuroprotective effects could be attributed to silent information regulator 1 upregulation which curbed 3-NP-associated hazards resulting in improved motor functions witnessed during open field, rotarod, and grip strength tests as well as attenuated 3-NP-associated histopathological derangements. CONCLUSION: The present findings indicated that diapocynin could serve as an auspicious nominee for HD management.
