34659996|t|Feasibility of Contrasting Brain Connectivity Patterns in Cognitive and Motor Cerebral Networks to Clinical Outcomes in Patients Surviving Acute Respiratory Failure: A Pilot Study.
34659996|a|BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of research regarding the feasibility and association of cerebral cortex function to patient outcomes after acute respiratory failure (ARF). PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility of functional connectivity measures and examine the association of functional connectivity to a multifaceted battery of outcomes in survivors of ARF. METHODS: Eight ARF patients (age:58+-3.7, ICU days:10.4+-8.6) completed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cognitive, physical-function, anxiety, depression, and driving simulator tests at one month post-hospital discharge. Pearson's correlations assessed the relationship between functional connectivity within the default mode network (FPN), sensorimotor network (SMN), and frontoparietal network (FPN) to outcomes. RESULTS: Low physical-function (r=0.75, p=0.03) and divided-attention (r=-0.86, p=0.03) during the driving simulator task correlated with low FPN connectivity. Low SMN connectivity demonstrated relationships to slower gait speed (r=0.82, p=0.01) and low short physical performance battery (SPPB) scores (r=0.81, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: fMRI is feasible to assess ARF patients' post-ICU limitations, as low post-ARF brain connectivity may be linked to low physical function, providing potential development of therapeutic interventions.
