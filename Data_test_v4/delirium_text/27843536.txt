27843536|t|Frontal assessment battery: A tool for screening minimal hepatic encephalopathy?
27843536|a|AIM: To apply the Frontal Assessment Battery to cirrhotic patients with or without overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) and controls. METHODS: The frontal assessment battery (FAB) was applied to 87 patients with liver cirrhosis (16 with and 71 without OHE) and 40 control subjects without cirrhosis treated at the alcohol and liver outpatient clinics and the gastroenterology ward of the Cassiano Antonio de Moraes University Hospital (Hospital Universitario Cassiano Antonio de Moraes - HUCAM), Espirito Santo, Brazil. RESULTS: The average FAB score was lower for the cirrhotic than for the non-cirrhotic patients (10.6 +- 3.67 vs 12.25 +- 2.72, P = 0.015). The FAB score was lower for the cirrhotic patients with OHE than for the patients without OHE (8.25 +- 4.55 vs 11.14 +- 3.25, P = 0.027). The total FAB score was lower for the cirrhotic patients without OHE than for the non-cirrhotic patients, although this difference was not significant (11.14 +- 3.25 vs 12.25 +- 2.72, P = 0.067). Nevertheless, the difference in the scores on the subtest that assessed the ability to inhibit a response previously conditioned to a stimulus was significant (1.72 +- 0.93 vs 2.2 +- 0.85, P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that the FAB is a promising tool for outpatient minimal HE screening and the assessment of HE severity.
