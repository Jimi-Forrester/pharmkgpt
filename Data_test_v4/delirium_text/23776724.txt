23776724|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most important neurodegenerative disorder. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) may all be involved in the development of vascular disease such as AD. The aim of this study is detection of seropositivity for anti-CCP antibody in AD patients. METHODS: In our study, 30 patients with AD and 29 healthy controls (age and-sex matched) were recruited. Homocysteine and anti-CCP was measured by spectrophotometrically and immunoassay. RESULTS: Mean +- SE anti-CCP was higher significantly between AD (13.6 +- 3) and healthy subjects (4.8 +- 0.2) (P = 0.006). In the patients, anti-CCP serum level was in high range (32.1%) of abnormal levels, but there was no significant difference in serum homocysteine in AD patients compared with controls. There is no correlation between anti-CCP and homocysteine levels in AD patients (P = 0.75), but between age and anti-CCP level observed a significantly correlation (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: It needs more studies to clarify confirmation the role of anti-CCP antibody production in AD patients.
