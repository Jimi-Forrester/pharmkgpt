22792751|a|The review is devoted to pharmacological effects and clinical effectiveness of one of the "oldest" neurocytoprotective drugs cerebrolysin. Experimental data that have revealed molecular mechanisms of the drug action as well as the results of clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of cerebrolysin in the treatment of acute and chronic brain ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, moderate and mild cognitive disorders are described in details. It has been concluded that the efficacy o this drug has been supported by fundamental research, using animal models and cell cultures, and multiple clinical trials in patients with different pathologies.
