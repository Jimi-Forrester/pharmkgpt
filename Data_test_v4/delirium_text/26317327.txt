26317327|a|Although the precise molecular factors linking amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been deciphered, interaction of Abeta with cellular membranes has an important role in the disease. However, most therapeutic strategies targeting Abeta have focused on interfering with Abeta self-assembly rather than with its membrane interactions. Here, we studied the impact of three toxicity inhibitors on membrane interactions of Abeta42, the longer form of Abeta, which is associated most strongly with AD. The inhibitors included the four-residue C-terminal fragment Abeta(39-42), the polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and the lysine-specific molecular tweezer, CLR01, all of which previously were shown to disrupt different steps in Abeta42 self-assembly. Biophysical experiments revealed that incubation of Abeta42 with each of the three modulators affected membrane interactions in a distinct manner. Interestingly, EGCG and CLR01 were found to have significant interaction with membranes themselves. However, membrane bilayer disruption was reduced when the compounds were preincubated with Abeta42, suggesting that binding of the assembly modulators to the peptide attenuated their membrane interactions. Importantly, our study reveals that even though the three tested compounds affect Abeta42 assembly differently, membrane interactions were significantly inhibited upon incubation of each compound with Abeta42, suggesting that preventing the interaction of Abeta42 with the membrane contributes substantially to inhibition of its toxicity by each compound. The data suggest that interference with membrane interactions is an important factor for Abeta42 toxicity inhibitors and should be taken into account in potential therapeutic strategies, in addition to disruption or remodeling of amyloid assembly.
