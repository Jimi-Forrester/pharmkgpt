36361733|a|The association between APOE genotypes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is partially mediated by LDL-cholesterol concentration but persists after adjusting for lipid levels and other cardiovascular risk factors. Data from the Aragon Workers Health Study (AWHS) (n = 4159) and the Lipid Unit at the Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet (HUMS) (n = 3705) were used to investigate the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and APOE genotype. Lipoprotein particle and GlycA concentrations were analyzed in a subsample from AWHS. APOE genotyping was carried out by the Sanger method in both cohorts. APOE4 carriers had significantly lower levels of CRP than APOE3 carriers. Furthermore, APOE4 carriers had cholesterol-enriched LDL particles compared to APOE2 carriers. APOE4 carriers also had higher concentrations of small, medium, and large LDL particles. CRP levels were not associated with lipoprotein particle number, size, or composition. GlycA levels were not associated with APOE genotypes. However, GlycA levels were significantly associated with the size and the amount of cholesterol contained in HDL, VLDL, and LDL particles. APOE genotype influences CRP concentration regardless of lipid profile. APOE2 carriers showed the highest CRP levels, followed by APOE3 and APOE4. A more atherogenic lipid profile, but not inflammatory markers could partly explain the higher CVD risk observed in APOE4 carriers.
