34436260|t|Enhancement of Emodin Production by Medium Optimization and KH2PO4 Supplementation in Submerged Fermentation of Marine-Derived Aspergillus favipes HN4-13.
34436260|a|Emodin is a widely distributed anthraquinone derivative with a variety of biological activities, one that can be efficiently produced by marine-derived fungus Aspergillus favipes HN4-13. However, its relatively low fermentation yield limits further development and pharmaceutical research work. In this study, Plaekett-Burman design and central composite design were adopted to optimize the fermentation conditions of A. favipes HN4-13. Optimal fermentation conditions in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask with 50 mL of medium were 59.3 g/L soluble starch, 10 g/L yeast extract paste, 30 g/L seawater salt, 1.04 g/L KH2PO4, 0.05 g/L MgSO4 7H2O, 0.01 g/L FeSO4 7H2O, seed culture 24 h, pH 5, inoculum size 18%, culture temperature 32  C, and shaking at 160 rpm/min for 7 days. The production of emodin could achieve 132.40 +- 3.09 mg/L, with no significant difference from the predicted value (132.47 mg/L). Furthermore, KH2PO4 supplementation strategy was employed to regulate the mycelial morphology, upregulate the transcriptional level of biosynthesis gene cluster, and enhance emodin production (185.56 +- 4.39 mg/L).
