31925635|t|Honey as the Potential Natural Source of Cholinesterase Inhibitors in Alzheimer's Disease.
31925635|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized, among others by abnormal levels of acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase in the brain. In this study, 47 types of Polish honeys were examined (using colorimetric method) as a source of acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. The highest potential for AChE inhibition was observed in the case of buckwheat honey (39.51% inhibition), while multi-floral honey showed the highest capacity for BChE inhibition (39.76%). Our study revealed that honeys can be a rich source of cholinesterase inhibitors and therefore may play a role in AD treatment.
