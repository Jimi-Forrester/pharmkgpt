28768713|t|A meta-analysis and review examining a possible role for oxidative stress and singlet oxygen in diverse diseases.
28768713|a|From kinetic data (k, T) we calculated the thermodynamic parameters for various processes (nucleation, elongation, fibrillization, etc.) of proteinaceous diseases that are related to the beta-amyloid protein (Alzheimer's), to tau protein (Alzheimer's, Pick's), to alpha-synuclein (Parkinson's), prion, amylin (type II diabetes), and to alpha-crystallin (cataract). Our calculations led to DeltaG  values that vary in the range 92.8-127 kJ mol-1 at 310 K. A value of ~10-30 kJ mol-1 is the activation energy for the diffusion of reactants, depending on the reaction and the medium. The energy needed for the excitation of O2 from the ground to the first excited state (1Deltag, singlet oxygen) is equal to 92 kJ mol-1 So, the DeltaG  is equal to the energy needed for the excitation of ground state oxygen to the singlet oxygen (1Deltag first excited) state. The similarity of the DeltaG  values is an indication that a common mechanism in the above disorders may be taking place. We attribute this common mechanism to the (same) role of the oxidative stress and specifically of singlet oxygen, (1Deltag), to the above-mentioned processes: excitation of ground state oxygen to the singlet oxygen, 1Deltag, state (92 kJ mol-1), and reaction of the empty pi* orbital with high electron density regions of biomolecules (~10-30 kJ mol-1 for their diffusion). The DeltaG  for cases of heat-induced cell killing (cancer) lie also in the above range at 310 K. The present paper is a review and meta-analysis of literature data referring to neurodegenerative and other disorders.
