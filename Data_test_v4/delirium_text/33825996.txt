33825996|t|Aggressive Behavior and Psychiatric Inpatients: a Narrative Review of the Literature with a Focus on the European Experience.
33825996|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We summarized peer-reviewed literature on aggressive episodes perpetrated by adult patients admitted to general hospital units, especially psychiatry or emergency services. We examined the main factors associated with aggressive behaviors in the hospital setting, with a special focus on the European experience. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of variables, including individual, historical, and contextual variables, are significant risk factors for aggression among hospitalized people. Drug abuse can be considered a trans-dimensional variable which deserves particular attention. Although mental health disorders represent a significant component in the risk of aggression, there are many factors including drug abuse, past history of physically aggressive behavior, childhood abuse, social and cultural patterns, relational factors, and contextual variables that can increase the risk of overt aggressive behavior in the general hospital. This review highlights the need to undertake initiatives aimed to enhance understanding, prevention, and management of violence in general hospital settings across Europe.
