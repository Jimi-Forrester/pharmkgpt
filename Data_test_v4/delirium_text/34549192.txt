34549192|a|Psychologic sequelae after critical illness, part of the postintensive care syndrome, significantly decrease quality of life. A robustly effective treatment intervention is currently lacking. Virtual reality has beneficial effects on several non-ICU-related psychologic disorders. The aim of this study was to explore patient-related determinants of ICU-specific virtual reality, such as the timing of patients' self-reported readiness to initiate virtual reality and the number of desired sessions and safety, and to explore the effects of ICU-specific virtual reality on mental health. DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized controlled feasibility study. SETTING: ICU at a university teaching hospital and a secondary care hospital in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. PATIENTS: Consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis or septic shock. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ICU-specific virtual reality (ICU-specific virtual reality group) or exposure to a nature virtual reality environment (control virtual reality group). MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Explorative outcomes were feasibility, in terms of patient-related determinants, and safety. The effects of ICU-specific virtual reality on the psychologic components of postintensive care syndrome and quality of life were additionally studied. Fifty patients (median age: 61 yr; 21 [42%] female) were included. Patients in the ICU-specific virtual reality group felt ready to initiate the virtual reality intervention 10 days (median, 95% range, 5-21 d) after ICU discharge, and one session (median, 95% range, 1-6) was desired. ICU-specific virtual reality patients experienced higher immersion, cybersickness scores were low, and no changes in vital signs were observed. They also reported reduced posttraumatic stress disorder and depression scores and better mental health from 2 days until 1 month after initial exposure (Short Form-12 Mental Component Scale: ICU-specific virtual reality, 57 [36-67] vs control virtual reality, 47 [26-63]; p < 0.01). Six months after exposure, this effect was still present for posttraumatic stress disorder and depression, but not for mental quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: ICU-specific virtual reality is a feasible and acceptable novel intervention that could be used during recovery from an episode of critical illness in the ICU. A future, adequately powered study should confirm whether virtual reality is able to improve mental health and quality of life.
