35028878|a|Initial development of artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) dates back to the mid-twentieth century. A growing awareness of the potential for AI, as well as increases in computational resources, research, and investment are rapidly advancing AI applications to medical imaging and, specifically, brain molecular imaging. AI/ML can improve imaging operations and decision making, and potentially perform tasks that are not readily possible by physicians, such as predicting disease prognosis, and identifying latent relationships from multi-modal clinical information. The number of applications of image-based AI algorithms, such as convolutional neural network (CNN), is increasing rapidly. The applications for brain molecular imaging (MI) include image denoising, PET and PET/MRI attenuation correction, image segmentation and lesion detection, parametric image formation, and the detection/diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and other brain disorders. When effectively used, AI will likely improve the quality of patient care, instead of replacing radiologists. A regulatory framework is being developed to facilitate AI adaptation for medical imaging.
