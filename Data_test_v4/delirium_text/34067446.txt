34067446|t|Implementation of an Automated Cerebrospinal Fluid Drainage System for Early Mobilization in Neurosurgical Patients.
34067446|a|BACKGROUND: Automated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage systems allow for the mobilization of patients with an external CSF drain. The aim of this study is to describe the implementation of an automated CSF drainage system in neurosurgical patients with external CSF drains. METHODS: A feasibility study was performed using an automated CSF drainage system (LiquoGuard 7, Moller Medical GmbH, Fulda, Germany) in adult neurosurgical patients treated with external lumbar or external ventricular drains between December 2017 and June 2020. Limited mobilization was allowed-patients were allowed to adjust their inclined beds, sit in chairs and walk under the supervision of a nurse or physical therapist. The primary outcome was the number of prematurely terminated drainage sessions. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were included. Drainage was terminated prematurely in eight (35%) patients. In three (13%) of these patients, drainage was terminated due to signs of hydrocephalus. Pressure-controlled drainage in patients with external lumbar drains (ELD) showed inaccurate pressure curves, which was solved by using volume-controlled drainage in ELD patients. CONCLUSION: The implementation of an automated CSF drainage system (LiquoGuard 7) for CSF drainage allows for early mobilization in a subset of patients with external CSF drains. External lumbar drains require volume-based drainage rather than differential pressure-dependent drainage.
