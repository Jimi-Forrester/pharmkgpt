26364275|t|Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of the Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Huperzine A as a Treatment for Cocaine Use Disorder.
26364275|a|BACKGROUND: Cholinergic transmission is altered by drugs of abuse and contributes to psychostimulant reinforcement. In particular, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, like huperzine A, may be effective as treatments for cocaine use disorder. METHODS: The current report describes results from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which participants (n=14-17/group) were randomized to huperzine A (0.4 or 0.8 mg) or placebo. Participants received randomized infusions of cocaine (0 and 40 mg, IV) on days 1 and 9. On day 10, participants received noncontingent, randomized infusions of cocaine (0 and 20mg, IV) before making 5 choices to receive additional infusions. RESULTS: Huperzine A was safe and well-tolerated and compared with placebo, treatment with huperzine A did not cause significant changes in any cocaine pharmacokinetic parameters (all P>.05). Time-course and peak effects analyses show that treatment with 0.4 mg of huperzine A significantly attenuated cocaine-induced increases of "Any Drug Effect," "High," "Stimulated," "Willing to Pay," and "Bad Effects" (all P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: The current study represents a significant contribution to the addiction field since it serves as the first published report on the safety and potential efficacy of huperzine A as a treatment for cocaine use disorder.
