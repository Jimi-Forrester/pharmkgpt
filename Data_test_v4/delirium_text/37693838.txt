37693838|a|To observe the effect of iliac fascia space block combined with esketamine intravenous general anesthesia in proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) of the elderly. Eighty elderly patients who underwent PFNA were randomly divided into experimental group and control group. In the experimental group, iliac fascial block combined with esketamine and propofol intravenous general anesthesia was used to keep spontaneous breathing. The control group used iliac fascia block combined with remifentanil and propofol intravenous general anesthesia to maintain spontaneous breathing. Record important indexes such as heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), visual analogue score (VAS) scores, etc. at different moment during the operation. Trial data showed that there were significant differences in HR, MAP, and SpO2 between the two groups at the beginning of operation, and there was no significant difference in VAS scores between the two groups at each moment after surgery, and there were significant differences in the number of vasopressor applications, length of hospital stay, and QoR-15 scores between the two groups, and there were significant differences in the incidence of total adverse reactions and the incidence of hypotension. The trial indicated that patients in the experimental group have more stable hemodynamics and lower stress response, which is conducive to rapid recovery after surgery.
