38383696|a|PURPOSE: The impact of psychological factors on the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in humans remains unclear. Mendelian randomization (MR) study is a novel approach aimed at unbiased detection of causal effects. Therefore, we conducted a two-sample MR to determine if there is a causal relationship between psychological distress (PD), participation in leisure/social activities of religious groups (LARG), and HCC. METHODS: The genetic summary data of exposures and outcome were retrieved from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We used PD and LARG as exposures and HCC as outcome. Five MR methods were used to investigate the causal relationship between PD, LARG, and HCC. The result of inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was deemed as principal result. Besides, we performed a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to verify the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The IVW results showed that PD [odds ratio (OR) 1.006, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.000-1.011, P = 0.033] and LARG (OR 0.994, 95% CI 0.988-1.000, P = 0.035) were causally associated with the incidence of HCC. Sensitivity analysis did not identify any bias in the results. CONCLUSION: PD turned out to be a mild risk factor for HCC. In contrast, LARG is a protective factor for HCC. Therefore, it is highly recommended that people with PD are seeking positive leisure activities such as participation in formal religious social activities, which may help them reduce the risk of HCC.
