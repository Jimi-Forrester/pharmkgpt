6639805|a|A 77-year-old, nonalcoholic man was admitted to the Omiya Red Cross Hospital with the complaint of fever and delirium state of two days' duration. Two months prior to admission he had had cough and sputum. Chest X-ray revealed honey comb lungs. Cultures of sputum revealed mycobacterium tuberculosis after eight weeks incubation. He had no liver disease in his past history. The patient appeared cachetic. His vital signs were as follows; temperature 38 degrees C, blood pressure 132/68 mmHg, with a pulse rate of 84/min. He was delirium and excited. Findings of the cranial, motor and sensory nerve examination were normal. Initial laboratory studies showed a serum sodium value of 133 mEq/l, potassium 4.5 mEq/l, chloride 98 mEq/l; a serum GOT value of 51 units, GPT 36 units; a total protein content of 7.8 g/dl and ESR rate of 87 mm/hr. Six days after admission, the patients' consciousness level began to stupor and nuchal rigidity was appeared. Spinal fluid examination revealed opening pressure 270 mm H2O, cell counts 720 (N 712, L 8)/cumm, sugar 57 mg/dl and protein 170 mg/dl. Spinal fluid cultures were positive in mycobacterium tuberculosis after eight weeks incubation. Laboratory studies showed a serum sodium value of 114 mEq/l, potassium 4.4 mEq/l, chloride 86 mEq/l, a serum osmorality (SeOs) 225 mOsm/l and urine osmorality (UOs) 958 mOsm/l.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
