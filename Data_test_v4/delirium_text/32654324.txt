32654324|t|The molecular etiology of Alzheimer's disease.
32654324|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing global healthcare epidemic. Owing to advances in technology, genome-scale studies of various layers of molecular information have been undertaken in recent years and robust variation in key loci have now been published and reproduced by others. This mini-symposium highlights four key areas of current research in the field of molecular biology in AD, including articles focused on large-scale genomic profiling, epigenetic research, integrative multi-omic approaches and how these can be appropriately modeled to address reverse causality. This mini-symposium provides a timely update on research focused on elucidating the molecular etiology of AD to date and highlights new methodological advances that could enable neuroscientists to identify novel therapeutic targets.
