30480106|t|Association of Hospital Admission Risk Profile Score with Mortality in Hospitalized Older Adults.
30480106|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association of the Hospital Admission Risk Profile (HARP) score with mortality after discharge in a population of hospitalized older adults. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized patients aged 70 years or older. MEASUREMENTS: Patient age at the time of admission, modified Folstein Mini-Mental Status Exam score, and self-reported instrumental activities of daily living 2 weeks prior to admission were used to calculate a HARP score. The primary outcome assessed was overall mortality up to 365 days after hospital discharge. Cox proportional hazard analyses evaluated the association between HARP score and mortality adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities associated with increased mortality. RESULTS: Of the 474 patients, 165 (34.8%) had a low HARP score, 177 (37.4%) had an intermediate, and 132 (27.8%) had a high score. HARP score was not associated with differences in 30-day readmission rates. High HARP score patients had higher mortality when compared to patients with low HARP scores at all time frames (30 days: 12.9% vs 1.8%, p < .05; 90 days: 19.7% vs 4.8%, p < .05; 365 days: 34.8% vs 16.9%, p < .05). In fully adjusted Cox proportional models, patients with high HARP scores had a 3.5 times higher odds of mortality when compared to low HARP score patients. CONCLUSION: The HARP score is a simple and easy to use instrument that identifies patients at increased risk for mortality after hospital discharge. Early identification of patients at increased risk for mortality has the potential to help guide treatment decisions following hospital discharge and provides additional information to providers and patients for shared decision making and may help in clarifying and achieving patient and family goals of care.
