36158579|t|Covalent fragment inhibits intramembrane proteolysis.
36158579|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious public health crisis with only one current modifying treatment. The reduction of amyloid load by targeting gamma-secretase (GS) has been a leading approach in AD drug discovery and development. Despite the focus on GS inhibition, multiple GS inhibitors (GSIs) have failed in clinical trials as a result of side effects including exacerbated cognitive decline. These side effects are largely attributable to inhibition of normal GS function. Standard enzyme inhibitors target catalytic or allosteric sites of the enzyme, including the active site presenilin, as previous GSIs did. To avoid issues observed from broad-spectrum GSIs we discovered that fragment 6H8 that covalently binds to the substrate of GS, the transmembrane domain of amyloid precursor protein (APPTM). Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy combined with MALDI-TOF-MS established 6H8 covalently binds to APPTM. 6H8 acts as a Michael acceptor and covalently links to the side chain amines of lysine residues, specifically targeting a cluster of C-terminal lysines K53-K55. Through this modification, 6H8 can inhibit intramembrane proteolysis of an archaeal homolog of presenilin (the active subunit of GS) via substrate binding with a 2-4 muM IC50, determined by a gel-based cleavage assay. 6H8, while too small to be an effective drug candidate, can be combined with a specific non-covalent partner and function as an effective covalent warhead of a targeted covalent inhibitor (TCI). The future development of the 6H8 fragment into the covalent warhead of a TCI is, to our knowledge, a novel approach to AD drug discovery.
