33725354|t|Therapeutic Strategies and Nano-Drug Delivery Applications in Management of Aging Alzheimer's Disease.
33725354|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which the death of brain cells causes memory loss and cognitive decline. Existing drugs only suppress symptoms or delay further deterioration but do not address the cause of the disease. In spite of screening numerous drug candidates against various molecular targets of AD, only a few candidates, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, are currently utilized as an effective clinical therapy. Currently, nano-based therapies can make a difference, providing new therapeutic options by helping drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain more effectively. The main aim of this review was to highlight advances in research on the development of nano-based therapeutics for improved treatment of AD.
