35192952|a|BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is mainly characterized by respiratory manifestations. Nevertheless, neurologic complications have been described, including delirium, which appears to be frequent, prolonged, and severe. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of two cohorts: patients with COVID-19 admitted to the infectious disease intensive care unit (ID-ICU) and patients admitted to the ID-ICU with other respiratory infections in 2018-2019. Outcomes were defined as the presence, duration, and severity of delirium. Doses of antipsychotics used to control delirium were converted to equivalents and used as delirium severity. Logistics regression models were used to correlate COVID-19 with the outcomes. RESULTS: Ninety-nine patients with COVID-19 and 40 patients without COVID-19 were included. The mean age of the COVID-19 cohort was 63 years, with a male predominance. Delirium developed in 42%, with a median duration of 3 days and an equivalent dose of olanzapine use of 10 mg/day. In univariate analysis, COVID-19 was not associated with the development or different duration of delirium when compared with patients without COVID-19. There was an association between COVID-19 and severity of delirium in a binary logistic regression model controlled to confounding variables. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is not associated with a higher prevalence or duration of delirium than in cohorts without COVID-19. However, it is associated with more severe forms of delirium.
