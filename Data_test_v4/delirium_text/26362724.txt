26362724|t|Amyloid beta: Walking on the dark side of the moon.
26362724|a|For some decades, amyloid beta (Abeta) has only been considered as a cytotoxic peptide, putative cause and marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Today, however, a considerable amount of evidence goes against the classical amyloid hypothesis and illustrates a new picture in which the Abeta loss of function, rather than its accumulation, has a pathogenic role in AD. In this concise review, we summarize some highlights of a collection of research pointing to the physiological function of Abeta and its role in the mechanisms of memory formation.
