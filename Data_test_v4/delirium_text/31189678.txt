31189678|t|Risk factors for predicting progression from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies.
31189678|a|INTRODUCTION: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often represents the earliest stage of Alzheimer's disease. There has been considerable research investigating specific risk factors regarding the progression from normal cognition to MCI. However, different studies have come to different conclusions on the impact of particular risk factors. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a meta-analysis of the risk factors that predict cognitive disruption in individuals based on associations with MCI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search seven electronic databases without time limit, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Wan Fang Database and China Biology Medicine. Two researchers will independently screen for eligibility and perform data extraction. Data were extracted from cohort studies meeting the inclusive criteria according to the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) methods. A third member of the research team will be contacted when a consensus cannot be reached. Any disagreement will be settled by consensus. The NOS will be used to assess the quality of the studies. All analyses were performed using Stata V.15.1. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: We will report this review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement. We will disseminate our findings through a publication in a peer-reviewed journal. This systematic review does not require ethical approval as no primary data are collected. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018109099.
