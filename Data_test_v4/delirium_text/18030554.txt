18030554|a|The major syndromes of mushroom poisoning can be divided by presentation timing: Early syndromes (symptom onset <6 hrs after ingestion) have little probability to cause organ damage. Epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea occur in most cases and treatment includes initial gastrointestinal decontamination with oral activated charcoal and fluid rehydration. In addition, an acute gastrointestinal syndrome can be combined with cholinergic toxicity, epileptiformic response or immuno-hemolytic anemia. Neurotoxic Syndromes may present as dysphoria, delirium, hallucinations or disulfiram-like reactions. Treatment is entirely supportive and if performed in hospital, the prognosis is good. Late syndromes (symptom onset >6 hrs after ingestion) are life-threatening due to liver- and renal failure. Patients who are jaundiced after an acute gastrointestinal episode, are suspected to be poisoned with Amatoxins. Patients with flank pain, hematuria, polyuria or oliguria in the absence of jaundice are suspected to have an intoxication with Cortinarius mushrooms. In both cases an intensive care management is indicated.
