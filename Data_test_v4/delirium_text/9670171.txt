9670171|t|Fortification of grain products with folate: should Britain follow the American example.
9670171|a|The fortification of all grain products with folate is mandatory in the USA from 1st January 1999. The decision has been prompted by research indicating that the risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, nervous system disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, and neural tube defects may be reduced by daily intake of folate higher than is currently normal in the American population. There is a debate on the adequacy of the level of folate mandated and on the limiting of fortification to grain products. Furthermore, there have been representations to the US Food and Drug Administration to include B12 in the fortification requirement. Would British health also benefit from such fortification?
