24038335|a|Recent investigations have rekindled interest in 8-hydroxyquinolines as therapeutic agents for cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders. Three new beta-cyclodextrin conjugates of 8-hydroxyquinolines and their copper(II) and zinc(II) complexes have been synthesized and characterized spectroscopically. In addition to improving aqueous solubility, due to the presence of the cyclodextrin moiety, the hybrid systems have interesting characteristics including antioxidant activity, and their copper(II) complexes are efficient superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimics. The ligands and their copper(II) complexes show low cytotoxicity, attributed to the presence of the cyclodextrin moiety. These compounds have potential as therapeutic agents in diseases related both to metal dyshomeostasis and oxidative stress.
