30918696|a|AIM: To explore the deliberation and enactment processes of nurses in relation to pain and other discomforts in the critically ill patients after the implementation of an analgosedation protocol. BACKGROUND: Nurses in intensive care units (ICU) face great challenges when managing pain and other discomforts and distinguishing between patients' needs for analgesics and sedatives. An analgosedation protocol favouring pain management, light sedation and early mobilization was implemented in a university hospital ICU in Norway in 2014. Changing sedation paradigms resulting in an increasing number of awake patients during critical illness is expected to affect nursing practice. DESIGN: Exploratory, single-unit study in a mixed adult ICU. METHODS: Data collection with participant observation and semi-structured interviews in sixteen clinical situations in 2014 and 2015. Thirteen experienced certified critical care nurses were included. Thematic content analysis was conducted. RESULTS: An overall theme "Having the compass-drawing the map" emerged from the analysis. The protocol or strategy of analgosedation appeared to provide a direction for treatment and care, although requiring extensive interpretation of needs and individualization of care, often in challenging situations. The overall theme was abstracted from three themes: "Interpreting a complex whole," "Balancing conflicting goals" and "Experiencing strain from acting across ideals." CONCLUSION: Nurses seem to attend adequately to patient pain, but the approach to discomforts other than pain appears unsystematic and haphazard. More explicit goals of care and strategies to handle discomfort as distinct from pain are needed. More research is needed to identify effective comfort measures for ICU patients.
