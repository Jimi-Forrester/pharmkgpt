39075990|a|The incidence of perioperative adverse events in children aged 0 to 15 years was 5.2%. Preoperative scientific and accurate anesthesia assessment is a crucial step in ensuring the safety of pediatric surgery. Perioperative risk prediction is a digital quantitative evaluation of the level of perioperative risk, which classifies the degree of danger. In order to further standardize the methods of anesthesia assessment and identify risk factors, Chinese Society of Anesthesiology organized experts in anesthesiology from children's specialty hospitals and general hospitals, along with statisticians from public health colleges, to jointly draft the "Chinese expert consensus on pediatric anesthesia assessment and perioperative risk prediction (2024 edition)".The anesthesia assessment includes history collection, physical examination, laboratory examination, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, difficult airway assessment, and identification and assessment of critically sick children. Perioperative risk prediction includes preoperative anxiety, perioperative respiratory adverse events, regurgitation and aspiration, emergence delirium, postoperative nausea and vomiting, postoperative ICU admission, postoperative acute kidney injury, perioperative mortality, and risk prediction for in-hospital mortality in children with congenital heart disease undergoing non-cardiac surgery.This consensus has formulated a total of 16 recommendations, aiming to promote anesthesiologists' familiarity with the content of pediatric anesthesia assessment, identify risk factors for adverse events during the perioperative period, and take targeted measures to reduce the occurrence of adverse events and improve the safety of children during the perioperative period.
