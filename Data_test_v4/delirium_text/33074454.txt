33074454|t|Epigenetic Changes and Its Intervention in Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases.
33074454|a|Epigenetic mechanisms involving the modulation of gene activity without modifying the DNA bases are reported to have lifelong effects on mature neurons in addition to their impact on synaptic plasticity and cognition. Histone methylation and acetylation are involved in synchronizing gene expression and protein function in neuronal cells. Studies have demonstrated in experimental models of neurodegenerative disorders that manipulations of these two mechanisms influence the susceptibility of neurons to degeneration and apoptosis. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the expression of presenilin 1 (PSEN1) is markedly increased due to decreased methylation at CpG sites, thus promoting the accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. In Parkinson's disease (PD), dysregulation of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) expression is presumed to occur via aberrant methylation at CpG sites, which controls the activation or suppression of protein expression. Mutant Huntingtin (mtHTT) alters the activity of histone acetyltransferases (HATs), causing the dysregulation of transcription observed in most Huntington's disease (HD) cases. Folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) are vital cofactors involved in DNA methylation modification; 5-azacytidine (AZA) is the most widely studied DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor, and dietary polyphenols are DNMT inhibitors in vitro. Drug intervention is believed to reverse the epigenetic mechanisms to serve as a regulator in neuronal diseases. Nevertheless, the biochemical effect of the drugs on brain function and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. This review focuses on further discussion of therapeutic targets, emphasizing the potential role of epigenetic factors including histone and DNA modifications in the diseases.
