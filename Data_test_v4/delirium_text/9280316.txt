9280316|t|Design of sensitive fluorogenic substrates for human cathepsin D.
9280316|a|Cathepsin D is a lysosomal aspartic proteinase that has been implicated in several pathological processes such as breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease. We designed and synthesized a number of quenched fluorogenic substrates with P2 variations in the series AcEE(EDANS)KPIXFFRLGK(DABCYL)E-NH2, where X=cysteine, methylcysteine, ethylcysteine, tert-butylcysteine, carboxymethylcysteine, methionine, valine or isoleucine. Most of the fluorogenic substrates exhibited greater k(cat)/Km ratios than the best cathepsin D substrates described so far. Differences in kinetic constants, which were rationalized using structure-based modeling, might make certain substrates useful for particular applications, such as active site titrations or initial velocity determination using a fluorescent plate reader.
