39015917|a|BACKGROUND: The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) was introduced late in China and is primarily used for investigating and evaluating health problems in older adults in outpatient and community settings. However, there are few reports on its application in hospitalized patients, especially older patients with diabetes and hypertension. AIM: To explore the nursing effect of CGA in hospitalized older patients with diabetes and hypertension. METHODS: We performed a retrospective single-center analysis of patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus and hypertension who were hospitalized and treated in the Jiangyin Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine between September 2020 and June 2022. Among the 80 patients included, 40 received CGA nursing interventions (study group), while the remaining 40 received routine nursing care (control group). The study group's comprehensive approach included creating personalized CGA profiles, multidisciplinary assessments, and targeted interventions in areas, such as nutrition, medication adherence, exercise, and mental health. However, the control group received standard nursing care, including general and medical history collection, fall prevention measures, and regular patient monitoring. After 6 months of nursing care implementation, we evaluated the effectiveness of the interventions, including assessments of blood glucose levels fasting blood glucose, 2-h postprandial blood glucose, and glycated hemoglobin, type A1c (HbA1c); blood pressure indicators such as diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP); quality of life as measured by the 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36) questionnaire; and treatment adherence. RESULTS: After 6 months, the nursing outcomes indicated that patients who underwent CGA nursing interventions experienced a significant decrease in blood glucose indicators, such as fasting blood glucose, 2-h postprandial blood glucose, and HbA1c, as well as blood pressure indicators, including DBP and SBP, compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Quality of life assessments, including physical health, emotion, physical function, overall health, and mental health, showed marked improvements compared to the control group (P < 0.05). In the study group, 38 patients adhered to the clinical treatment requirements, whereas only 32 in the control group adhered to the clinical treatment requirements. The probability of treatment adherence among patients receiving CGA nursing interventions was higher than that among patients receiving standard care (95% vs 80%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The CGA nursing intervention significantly improved glycemic control, blood pressure management, and quality of life in hospitalized older patients with diabetes and hypertension, compared to routine care.
