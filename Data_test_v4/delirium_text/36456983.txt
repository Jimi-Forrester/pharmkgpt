36456983|a|BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence reveals that music therapy appears to help patients with pain. However, there is a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Several studies indicate that leptin level has a crucial relationship with acute and chronic pain. Herein, we evaluated the effects of music stimulation and the potential roles of adipokines (leptin) in pain behaviors. METHODS: We used a tibial neuroma transposition (TNT) rat model to mimic neuroma pain. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of the three groups (n = 6):group 1 (GC), TNT with white noise; group 2(GM), TNT with music; and group 3(GH), TNT. White noise and music stimulation was given once a day following surgery until the end of the study (42nd day). Pain behavioral tests were carried out before surgery and on the 3rd, 10th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 35th, and 42nd days after surgery. At the end of the observation period, we analyzed the histological samples of blood, spinal cord, and prefrontal cortex to investigate the role of leptin in pain behaviors modulated by white noise and sound stimulation. RESULT: Music therapy might improve the pain of TNT rats. Music stimulation ameliorated paw withdrawal thermal latency (PWTL) from the 3rd day after the surgery while the mechanical pain was improved 21 days after the operation.Music stimulation also increased leptin expression in the spinal cord, prefrontal cortex.White noise had no obvious effect. CONCLUSION: Music therapy might improve the pain of TNT rats. Besides, music stimulation ameliorated TNT-induced pain behaviors and affected leptin expression.
