38412790|a|The evolutionarily conserved insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway plays a central role in aging and aging related diseases such as neurodegeneration diseases. Inhibition of insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway has been proposed as an effective way to extend lifespan and delay neurodegeneration diseases in different organisms. Cynaroside (Cyn), a flavonoid contained in many medical plants and in vegetables, had been shown to exhibit pharmacological properties such as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-oxidant effects. The study demonstrated that lifespan extension and neurodegeneration diseases improving could be achieved by targeting evolutionarily conserved insulin/IGF-1 pathway through using pharmacological interventions. Via using this approach in tractable model Caenorhabditis elegans, we found that 10 muM Cynaroside significantly promoted the healthy lifespan in wild-type animals. Furthermore, via genetic screen, we showed that Cynaroside acted on IGF-1-R /DAF-2, which was followed by the activation of transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO to extend the healthy lifespan. Intriguingly, Cynaroside also improved neurodegeneration diseases such as Alzheimer's and polyglutamine disease by suppressing insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. Our work suggests that Cynaroside may be a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of aging and neurodegeneration diseases.
