29213704|a|To evaluate the relationship of obesity, cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms in patients with high cardiovascular risk. METHODS: A sample of 93 patients aged 50 years or older was selected from the Center of Dyslipidemia and High Cardiovascular Risk from Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA). Patients with stroke were excluded. For cognitive evaluation, the MMSE (Mini Mental State Examination) was used. A score of 24 or less was considered as cognitive impairment, and for those who had 4 years or less of education, the cutoff point was 17. The GDS-15 (Geriatric Depression Scale) was also used, with the cutoff of 6 for presence of depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Obese patients showed lower mean MMSE scores compared to non-obese patients (p=0.0012). Additionally, for every one point increase in BMI above 30 there was a 27% increase in the chances of the patient having cognitive impairment. The obese patients presented 31% chance of having cognitive impairment compared with overweight subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings corroborated the association between obesity and cognitive impairment in high cardiovascular risk patients. This association however, was not observed for depressive symptoms.
