34569029|t|Impact of Pharmacotherapy on Insomnia in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
34569029|a|Insomnia is a pervasive sleep disorder affecting numerous patients across diverse demographical populations and comorbid disease states. Contributing factors are often a complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social components, requiring a multifaceted approach in terms of both diagnosis and management. In the setting of Alzheimer's disease, insomnia is an even more complicated issue, with a higher overall prevalence than in the general population, greater complexity of contributing etiologies, and differences in diagnosis (at times based on caregiver observation of sleep disruption rather than subjective complaints by the individual with the disorder), and requiring more discretion in terms of treatment, particularly in regard to adverse effect profile concerns. There also is growing evidence of the bidirectional nature of sleep disruption and Alzheimer's disease, with insomnia potentially contributing to disease progression, making the condition even more paramount to address. The objective of this review was to provide the clinician with an overview of treatment strategies that may have value in the treatment of disturbed sleep in Alzheimer's disease. Nonpharmacological approaches to treatment should be exhausted foremost; however, pharmacotherapy may be needed in certain clinical scenarios, which can be a challenge for clinicians given the paucity of evidence and guidelines for treatment in the subpopulation of Alzheimer's disease. Agents such as sedating antidepressants, melatonin, and site-specific gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists are often employed based on historical usage but are not necessarily supported by high-quality trials. Newer agents such as dual orexin receptor antagonists have demonstrated some promise but still need further evaluation.
