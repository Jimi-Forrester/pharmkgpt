It is considered the main killer in intensive care units. Sepsis associated-encephalopathy (SAE) is mostly caused by a sepsis-induced systemic inflammatory response. Studies report SAE in 14-63% of septic patients. Main SAE symptoms are not specific and usually include acute impairment of consciousness, delirium and/or coma, along with electroencephalogram (EEG) changes. For those who recover from sepsis and SAE, impaired cognitive function, mobility and quality of life are often observed months to years after hospital discharge, and there is no treatment available today to prevent that. Inflammation and oxidative stress are key players for the SAE pathophysiology. Gold nanoparticles have been demonstrated to own important anti-inflammatory properties. It was also reported 20 nm citrate-covered gold nanoparticles (cit-AuNP) reduce oxidative stress. In this context, we tested whether 20 nm cit-AuNP could alleviate the acute changes caused by sepsis in brain of mice, with focus on inflammation. Sepsis was induced in female C57BL/6 mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), 20 nm cit-AuNP or saline were intravenously (IV) injected 2 h after induction of sepsis and experiments performed 6 h after induction. Intravital microscopy was used for leukocyte and platelet adhesion study in brain, blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability carried out by Evans blue assay, cytokines measured by ELISA and real time PCR, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, and transcription factors, by western blotting. RESULTS: 20 nm cit-AuNP treatment reduced leukocyte and platelet adhesion to cerebral blood vessels, prevented BBB failure, reduced TNF- concentration in brain, and ICAM-1 expression both in circulating polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes and cerebral blood vessels of mice with sepsis. Furthermore, 20 nm cit-AuNP did not interfere with the antibiotic effect on the survival rate of mice with sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Cit-AuNP showed important anti-inflammatory properties in the brain of mice with sepsis, being a potential candidate to be used as adjuvant drug along with antibiotics in the treatment of sepsis to avoid SAE.
