28523294|t|Autophagy in aging and disease.
28523294|a|Autophagy is a catabolic degradation system used to destroy and recycle the unnecessary or damaged components of a cell. Autophagy is present at a basal level in all mammals and is regulated by some conditions, such as oxidative stress, starvation or hypoxia. In aged tissues, increased but also decreased expression of autophagy-specific proteins, Beclin 1, LC3, Atg5 and Atg7 has been reported. Likewise, it could be shown that the lifespan of yeast, nematodes and flies is prolonged by pharmacologically stimulated autophagy using exogenous administered spermidine. Autophagy is potentially implicated in acute lung injury and sepsis, two main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Finally, a quite recent study supports the hypothesis that autophagy might be useful in vascular disease prevention by stimulating cholesterol efflux, which leads to inhibition of necrotic core formation and lipid accumulation. Since autophagy is also implicated in neuro-protection, in Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease animal models and many others normal and pathological states, including immunity, diabetes mellitus, different kind of tumors, colorectal cancer, different inflammations, lung diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, autophagy is of interest to many biomedical researchers.
