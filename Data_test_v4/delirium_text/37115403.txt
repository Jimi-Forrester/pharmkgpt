37115403|a|Sevoflurane, commonly administered to children as anesthesia, often leads to emergence delirium (ED). Currently, a consensus is lacking among clinicians regarding pharmacological interventions to improve recovery. To determine an effective approach, we compared the effects of several drugs in lowering the incidence of ED after sevoflurane anesthesia in children.We searched online databases for relevant randomized controlled trials (59 studies selected; 5199 NMA-eligible participants) and performed a frequentist network meta-analysis (NMA). This study was registered on PROSPERO (number CRD: 42022329939).All included studies had a low to moderate risk of overall bias. The incidence of ED after sevoflurane anesthesia in children differed according to other drugs administered, and were ranked from high to low according to the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA).Sufentanil (91.2%) and dexmedetomidine (77.6%) were more likely to reduce the incidence (SUCRA value) of ED, whereas the placebo (6.5%), ramelteon (11.1%), and magnesium (18%) were less likely to reduce the incidence of ED. Remifentanil (89.3%) ranked first in shortening emergence time, followed by placebo (82.4%) and ketamine (69.7%). Placebo shortened extubation time, followed by remifentanil (66.5%) and alfentanil (61.4%).Sufentanil and remifentanil lowered sevoflurane-induced ED incidences among children and shortened the emergence time more effectively than other drugs. Most adjuvant drugs that are combined with sevoflurane either do not change or may even prolong extubation time. Further research and clinical trials are required to support and update these conclusions.
