35898686|t|Neuroglobin Is Involved in the Hypoxic Stress Response in the Brain.
35898686|a|Neuroglobin is an oxygen-binding heme protein expressed predominantly in the brain. Despite many years of research, the exact distribution and expression of neuroglobin in the neocortical development and under mild hypoxia stress still remain unclear. Therefore, we aim to explore the expression of neuroglobin during neocortex expansion and under mild hypoxia stress in vivo. We used Kunming mice to examine the expression of Ngb protein during neocortex expansion. In addition, we analyzed the density of Ngb-positive neural stem cells using the Image-Pro PLUS (v.6) computer software program (Media Cybernetics, Inc.). Our data indicated that the density of the neuroglobin-positive neurons in mice cerebral cortex displayed a downward trend after birth compared with high expression of neuroglobin in a prenatal period. Similarly, we identified that neurons were capable of ascending neuroglobin levels in response to mild hypoxic stress compared with the no intervention group. These findings suggest that neuroglobin behaves as a compensatory protein regulating oxygen provision in the process of neocortical development or under physiological hypoxia, further contributing to the discovery of novel therapeutic methods for neurological disorders, which is clinically important.
