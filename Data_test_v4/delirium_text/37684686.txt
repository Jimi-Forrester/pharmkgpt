37684686|a|BACKGROUND: Familial pancreatic cancer touches families through a genetic susceptibility to developing this neoplasia. Genetic susceptibility is assessed via family history, genetic testing, or both. Individuals with two or more first-degree relatives or three or more relatives of any degree diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are considered at elevated risk. Following a diagnosis of familial pancreatic cancer, patients and families face uncertainty and anxiety about the future. Psychosocial effects of a pancreatic cancer diagnosis on families include fear, concerns about personal health, and how lifestyle may impact the risk of developing pancreatic cancer. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old male was diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma stage IIB, T3, N1, M0. A genetic referral was made due to a history of multiple cases of pancreatic cancer within the patient's family. Genetic testing revealed the patient had a pathogenic variant in the ATM gene that is associated with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer development. The patient's one adult child was offered testing due to the autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance for this variant. The adult child was found to have the same pathogenic variant. She expressed fear for her future and her child's future health and longevity. Discussing a case study allows us to capture the multi-faceted relationship between the disease, the affected individuals, and their families. Examining the psychosocial stresses and concerns when there is a pancreatic cancer diagnosis in the family is essential to provide holistic care to patients and families. CONCLUSIONS: The psychosocial effects of FPC may be overwhelming for patients and families. Healthcare providers can offer education, support, and referrals to appropriate services to help families cope through stages of evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of FPC.
