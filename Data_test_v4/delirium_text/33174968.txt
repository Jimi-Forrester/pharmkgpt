METHODS: One hundred thirty-five older adults were assessed using medical history and physical examination. Twelve validated gerontological instruments were administered to assess delirium, nutritional status, risk for falls, risk for pressure injury, dementia, cognitive losses, depression, and level of dependence in daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Nursing diagnoses were identified and validated by experienced, doctorally-prepared nurses. The association between the presence of a nursing diagnosis and the level of dependence was assessed by a test for trend in proportions. The Kruskal-Wallis hypothesis test was used to investigate the association between the number of nursing diagnoses and the level of dependence of the elderly. RESULTS: Most older adults were at risk for malnutrition, at high risk for falls, cognitively impaired, totally dependent for daily living and activities of daily living. In addition, they had very mild dementia and most did not have risk for pressure injuries. Depression was noted among those with dementia, but was absent in those without dementia. A total of 52 nursing diagnoses were validated. Of these, 11 were associated with the level of dependence in daily living. CONCLUSION: These results can be reproduced in other skilled nursing facilities for older adults, and these may allow the planning of interventions to alleviate etiologies and signs/symptoms of nursing diagnoses, rather than simply directing care toward a general category of dependence. Therefore, guaranteeing individualized nursing care to meet the specific needs of each resident.
