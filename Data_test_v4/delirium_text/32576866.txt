32576866|t|Focal white matter disruptions along the cingulum tract explain cognitive decline in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).
32576866|a|White matter abnormalities of the human brain are implicated in typical aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, our understanding of how fine-grained changes in microstructural properties along white matter tracts are associated with memory and cognitive decline in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment remains elusive. We quantified tract profiles with a newer method that can reliably measure fine-grained changes in white matter properties along the tracts using advanced multi-shell diffusion magnetic resonance imaging in 25 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 23 matched healthy controls (HC). While the changes in tract profiles were parallel across aMCI and HC, we found a significant focal shift in the profile at specific locations along major tracts sub-serving memory in aMCI. Particularly, our findings depict white matter alterations at specific locations on the right cingulum cingulate, the right cingulum hippocampus and anterior corpus callosum (CC) in aMCI compared to HC. Notably, focal changes in white matter tract properties along the cingulum tract predicted memory and cognitive functioning in aMCI. The results suggest that white matter disruptions at specific locations of the cingulum bundle may be a hallmark for the early prediction of Alzheimer's disease and a predictor of cognitive decline in aMCI.
