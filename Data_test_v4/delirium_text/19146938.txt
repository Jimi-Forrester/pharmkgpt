19146938|a|AIM OF THIS STUDY: Aim of the present study is to clarify the effects of yokukansan (TJ-54) on learning and non-cognitive disturbances in the Tg2576 mouse expressing the human form of the APP695SWE (APP-Tg mice), which is considered to be an animal model of Alzheimer's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Powdered diets containing 0.5 and 1.0% TJ-54 were given to the mice for 10 months (from 5 to 15 months old). The Morris water-maze test, elevated plus-maze test, and open-field test were performed for evaluation of learning and non-cognitive disturbances. RESULTS: Treatment with 1.0% TJ-54 for 5 months shortened the time it took for APP-Tg positive (+) mice to reach the platform in the Morris water-maze test. In the elevated plus-maze test, treatment with 1.0% TJ-54 for 2 months significantly reduced the increased number of entries and the time spent in open arms observed in APP-Tg(+) mice. In an open-field test, treatment of 1.0% TJ-54 for 9 months significantly suppressed the increase in locomotion observed in APP-Tg(+) mice. CONCLUSION: These results suggest the possibility that TJ-54 ameliorates learning deficits and non-cognitive defects including a decrease in the anxiety (or disinhibition) and an increase in locomotor activity (hyperactivity) observed in APP-Tg(+) mice.
