36593043|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of neurodegenerative disorder in elderly individuals worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that periodontal diseases are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and an association between periodontitis and amyloid-beta deposition in elderly individuals has been demonstrated. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of systemic administration of Porphyromonas gingivalis-derived lipopolysaccharide (PG-LPS) on neprilysin expression in the hippocampus of adult and senescence-accelerated mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PG-LPS diluted in saline was intraperitoneally administered to male C57BL/6J and senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice at a dose of 5 mg/kg every 3 days for 3 months. Both C57BL/6J and SAMP8 mice administered saline without PG-LPS comprised the control group. The mRNA expression levels of neprilysin and interleukin (IL)-10 were evaluated using the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The protein levels of neprilysin were assessed using western blotting. Sections of the brain tissues were immunohistochemically stained. RESULTS: The serum IL-10 concentration significantly increased in both mouse strains after stimulation with PG-LPS. Neprilysin expression at both mRNA and protein levels was significantly lower in the SAMP8 PG-LPS group than those in the SAMP8 control group; however, they did not differ in PG-LPS-treated or non-treated C57BL/6J mice. Additionally, the immunofluorescence intensity of neprilysin in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in PG-LPS-treated SAMP8 mice was significantly lower than that in control SAMP8 mice. CONCLUSION: Porphyromonas gingivalis may reduce the expression of neprilysin in elderly individuals and thus increase amyloid-beta deposition.
