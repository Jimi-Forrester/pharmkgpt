39443898|t|Improvement in pain by using lidocaine combined with esketamine in elderly patients receiving local anaesthesia for percutaneous kyphoplasty: a randomized controlled study.
39443898|a|BACKGROUND: Elderly patients often experience severe pain during percutaneous kyphoplasty under local anaesthesia. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of lidocaine combined with esketamine on pain improvement in elderly patients receiving local anaesthesia via percutaneous kyphoplasty. METHODS: This prospective, randomized comparative trial was conducted on 66 elderly patients, aged 60-80 years, with an American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade of I-III, I-III and a BMI of 18.5-25 kg/m2, who underwent single-level lumbar percutaneous kyphoplasty under local anaesthesia. Patients were divided into two equal groups (33 per group). Group LE received 200 mg of 1% lidocaine and 25 mg of esketamine (total volume of 20 ml), and Group L received 200 mg of 1% lidocaine (total volume of 20 ml). Patient characteristics, surgery, VAS scores, MAP, HR, MOAA/S scores, patient satisfaction and related adverse reactions were compared for the groups. The VAS scores during and after surgery were considered the primary outcome. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in the VAS score between the two groups at the following time points: channel establishment by the puncture needle, balloon dilation, bone cement injection and postoperative period (P < 0.05). The VAS score decreased in the LE group, but the MAP and HR were more stable, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The difference in the MOAA/S score between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05), and the MOAA/S score in the LE group decreased. The patient satisfaction level in the LE group was 100% and 48.48% in the L group (P < 0.05). There were no related complications or adverse reactions in either group. CONCLUSION: The application of lidocaine combined with esketamine in local episcopal percutaneous vertebral kyphoplasty in elderly patients not only provides an effective analgesic effect but also improves surgical safety and patient comfort, which has important clinical value in promoting the optimization of surgical anaesthesia management in elderly patients.
