36770645|t|Quinazolinones, the Winning Horse in Drug Discovery.
36770645|a|Quinazolines are nitrogen-containing heterocycles that consist of a benzene ring fused with a pyrimidine ring. Quinazolinones, oxidized quinazolines, are promising compounds with a wide range of biological activities. In the pharmaceutical field, quinazolinones are the building blocks of more than 150 naturally occurring alkaloids isolated from different plants, microorganisms, and animals. Scientists give a continuous interest in this moiety due to their stability and relatively easy methods for preparation. Their lipophilicity is another reason for this interest as it helps quinazolinones in penetration through the blood-brain barrier which makes them suitable for targeting different central nervous system diseases. Various modifications to the substitutions around the quinazolinone system changed their biological activity significantly due to changes in their physicochemical properties. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of quinazolinone revealed that positions 2, 6, and 8 of the ring systems are significant for different pharmacological activities. In addition, it has been suggested that the addition of different heterocyclic moieties at position 3 could increase activity. In this review, we will highlight the chemical properties of quinazolinones, including their chemical reactions and different methods for their preparation. Moreover, we will try to modify some of the old SAR studies according to their updated biological activities in the last twelve years.
