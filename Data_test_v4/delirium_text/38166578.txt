38166578|a|Pu-zhi-hui-ling decoction (PZHLD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its chemical composition has not been reported. In this study, we aimed to establish a mass spectrometry (MS) analysis method for rapid classification and identification of the chemical constituents in PZHLD. The sample was analysed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS). The chemical constituents of PZHLD were identified based on accurate MS data, fragmentation characteristics of MS/MS, and reference information described in the literature. A total of 123 chemical constituents were identified. In addition, we summarised the fragmentation pathways of the chemical constituents in PZHLD. Our finding might lay the foundation for the further pharmacodynamic study and clinical application of PZHLD.
