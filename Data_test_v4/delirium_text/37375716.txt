37375716|t|Beyond Seasoning-The Role of Herbs and Spices in Rheumatic Diseases.
37375716|a|Although we have witnessed remarkable progress in understanding the biological mechanisms that lead to the development of rheumatic diseases (RDs), remission is still not achieved in a substantial proportion of patients with the available pharmacological treatment. As a consequence, patients are increasingly looking for complementary adjuvant therapies, including dietary interventions. Herbs and spices have a long historical use, across various cultures worldwide, for both culinary and medicinal purposes. The interest in herbs and spices, beyond their seasoning properties, has dramatically grown in many immune-mediated diseases, including in RDs. Increasing evidence highlights their richness in bioactive molecules, such as sulfur-containing compounds, tannins, alkaloids, phenolic diterpenes, and vitamins, as well as their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumorigenic, and anticarcinogenic properties. Cinnamon, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and saffron are the most popular spices used in RDs and will be explored throughout this manuscript. With this paper, we intend to provide an updated review of the mechanisms whereby herbs and spices may be of interest in RDs, including through gut microbiota modulation, as well as summarize human studies investigating their effects in Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, and Fibromyalgia.
