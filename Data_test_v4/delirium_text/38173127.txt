38173127|t|Dysregulation of extracellular vesicle protein cargo in female myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome cases and sedentary controls in response to maximal exercise.
38173127|a|In healthy individuals, physical exercise improves cardiovascular health and muscle strength, alleviates fatigue and reduces the risk of chronic diseases. Although exercise is suggested as a lifestyle intervention to manage various chronic illnesses, it negatively affects people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), who suffer from exercise intolerance. We hypothesized that altered extracellular vesicle (EV) signalling in ME/CFS patients after an exercise challenge may contribute to their prolonged and exacerbated negative response to exertion (post-exertional malaise). EVs were isolated by size exclusion chromatography from the plasma of 18 female ME/CFS patients and 17 age- and BMI-matched female sedentary controls at three time points: before, 15 min, and 24 h after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test. EVs were characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis and their protein cargo was quantified using Tandem Mass Tag-based (TMT) proteomics. The results show that exercise affects the EV proteome in ME/CFS patients differently than in healthy individuals and that changes in EV proteins after exercise are strongly correlated with symptom severity in ME/CFS. Differentially abundant proteins in ME/CFS patients versus controls were involved in many pathways and systems, including coagulation processes, muscle contraction (both smooth and skeletal muscle), cytoskeletal proteins, the immune system and brain signalling.
