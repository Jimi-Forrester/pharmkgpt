35946188|t|Cotard's syndrome in the postoperative period following head and neck cancer surgery - A case report.
35946188|a|Major head and neck surgery is a known factor for postoperative delirium; however, Cotard's syndrome (CS) has been rarely reported following head and neck surgery. We report a case of a 51-year-old man who underwent surgery for carcinoma right buccal mucosa and developed agitation and nihilistic delusion after extubation. The patient had a preexisting psychiatric history which is often reported as a risk factor for CS. Of interest, though is that this condition subsided as quickly as it emerged with only supportive counselling and brief pharmacotherapy.
