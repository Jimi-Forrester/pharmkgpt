34849925|t|Association Between Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Dementia: A Longitudinal Cohort Study.
34849925|a|BACKGROUND: The association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and dementia remains uncertain. We aim to investigate whether IBD is associated with higher dementia risk. METHODS: Using multivariable Cox regression models, we analyzed the onset of all-cause dementia among 497,775 participants, including 5778 IBD patients in the UK Biobank as primary analysis. In secondary analysis, we further examined the difference in brain structure and cognitive function changes between IBD and non-IBD individuals. The diagnosis of IBD and dementia was confirmed with combination of primary care data, hospital inpatient data, death registry, and self-report data. Brain structure was measured by brain MRI as anatomic and tissue-specific volumes; cognitive function was tested in terms of reaction, visual episodic memory, verbal-numerical reasoning, and prospective memory. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 11.58 years, 100 and 6709 incident all-cause dementia with or without IBD were documented, respectively. In multivariable Cox regression model, hazard ratio for incident dementia among IBD patients was 1.14 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94-1.39; P=.182) comparing with non-IBD participants; no statistically significant difference was observed in their brain MRI measures of anatomic and tissue-specific volumes, whereas IBD patients had a significantly increased reaction time (beta=12.32; 95% CI, 1.97, 22.67; P = .020). Results of subgroup and sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study does not support a significant association between IBD and dementia. Further studies with better design and longer follow-up are needed to elucidate the association.
