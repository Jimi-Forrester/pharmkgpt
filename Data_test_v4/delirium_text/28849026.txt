28849026|t|The effect of Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoction on simulated weightlessness-induced muscle atrophy and its mechanisms.
28849026|a|Microgravity has been previously demonstrated to induce skeletal muscle atrophy, loss of muscle force and disorders in myogenesis and metabolism. Current pharmacological strategies exhibit poor efficacy. Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoction (BZ) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine decoction used for myasthenia gravis. In the present study, its effect on unloading induced muscle atrophy was investigated. The mousetail suspension model was used to simulate weightlessness induced muscle atrophy. The results indicated that BZ could significantly protect muscles from simulated weightlessness-induced atrophy. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, drugCIPHER-CS methods were introduced to predict its potential targets, significantly enriched pathways and biological processes. The results demonstrated that the calcium signaling pathway, citrate cycle, biosynthetic and lipid metabolic process are affected by BZ. Among the targets, nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) is one of the most important proteins involved in myogenesis and metabolism. The results indicated that BZ significantly downregulated NCoR 1 expression, and further induced muscle differentiation and metabolism by regulating NCoR1-associated gene expression in vivo and in vitro. In summary, the present study indicated that may be effective in combating weightlessness-induced muscle atrophy. Combined with bioinformatics, the underlying mechanism for this decoction was investigated, which provided an improved understanding of this decoction.
