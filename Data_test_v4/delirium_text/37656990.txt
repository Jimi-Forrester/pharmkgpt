37656990|a|Stroke results in local neural disconnection and brain-wide neuronal network dysfunction leading to neurological deficits. Beyond the hyper-acute phase of ischemic stroke, there is no clinically-approved pharmacological treatment that alleviates sensorimotor impairments. Functional recovery after stroke involves the formation of new or alternative neuronal circuits including existing neural connections. The type-5 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR5) has been shown to modulate brain plasticity and function, and is a therapeutic target in neurological diseases outside of stroke. We investigated whether mGluR5 influences functional recovery and network reorganization rodent models of focal ischemia. Using multiple behavioral tests we observed that treatment with negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of mGluR5 (MTEP, fenobam, and AFQ056) for 12 days, starting 2 or 10 days after stroke, restored lost sensorimotor functions, without diminishing infarct size. Recovery was evident within hours after initiation of treatment and progressed over the subsequent 12 days. Recovery was prevented by activation of mGluR5 with the positive allosteric modulator VU0360172, and accelerated in mGluR5 KO mice compared to wild-type mice. After stroke, multisensory stimulation by enriched environments (EE) enhanced recovery, a result prevented by VU0360172, implying a role of mGluR5 in EE-mediated recovery. Additionally, MTEP treatment in conjunction with EE housing provided an additive recovery enhancement compared to either MTEP or EE alone. Using optical intrinsic signal imaging, we observed brain-wide disruptions in resting-state functional connectivity after stroke that were prevented by mGluR5 inhibition in distinct areas of contralesional sensorimotor and bilateral visual cortices. The levels of mGluR5 protein in mice and in tissue samples of stroke patients were unchanged after stroke. We conclude that neuronal circuitry subserving sensorimotor function after stroke is depressed by a mGluR5-dependent maladaptive plasticity mechanism that can be restored by mGluR5 inhibition. Post-acute stroke treatment with mGluR5 NAMs combined with rehabilitative training may represent a novel post-acute stroke therapy.
