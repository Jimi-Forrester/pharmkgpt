38389637|t|Incidence of Cardiovascular Instability in Patients With Guillain-Barre Syndrome: A Retrospective Study.
38389637|a|Introduction Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disease affecting radicles and peripheral nerves resulting in acute flaccid paralysis. Respiratory failure, autonomic dysfunction, and secondary complications such as pneumonia, and venous thromboembolism are the major causes of death and disability in GBS. Cardiovascular complications play a major role in the prognosis of GBS patients. The aim is to determine the incidence of cardiovascular instability in GBS patients and to see if there are any specific risk groups associated with the development of cardiovascular instability. Methodology This is a retrospective descriptive study conducted in a tertiary care center in South India. Data on 50 consecutive GBS patients were collected from hospital records including case sheets, death summaries, and discharge summaries. Patients with evidence of sepsis, blood loss, heavy alcohol consumption, and chronic liver disease were excluded from the study. Baseline demographic data, symptom onset to admission time, baseline Erasmus Guillain-Barre Syndrome Respiratory Insufficiency Score (EGRIS), and baseline liver function tests were documented. The presence of heart rate and blood pressure fluctuations was noted from the records. Frequency data were calculated from the categorical variables. Analysis of non-parametric variables by chi-square test was done using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0 (Released 2017; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). Results Cardiovascular instability was present in 15 (30%) patients in the study population. It was present in all patients (100%) who require mechanical ventilation. The incidence of cardiovascular instability was higher in patients who had lesser onset to admission times (41.9% vs 10.5%; p=0.019), EGRIS>=4 (40.6% vs 11.1%; p=0.029), and lower cranial nerve involvement (40% vs 6.7%; p=0.018). Conclusion Of patients with GBS, 30% developed cardiovascular instability during their disease course. Patients with lesser onset to admission times, EGRIS >=4, and those with lower cranial nerve involvement had a greater incidence of cardiovascular instability.
