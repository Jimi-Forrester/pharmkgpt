1739605|t|Imaging of neurodegenerative diseases.
1739605|a|Neuroimaging of degenerative brain disorders has continued to advance, primarily with MR imaging, single-photon emission CT, and positron emission tomography. Information gained from these morphologic and functional imaging studies provides insight into the pathologic and pathophysiologic changes associated with these diseases. Recent papers relating to various neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementias, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related dementia, Pick's disease, Huntington's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and others are reviewed and discussed.
