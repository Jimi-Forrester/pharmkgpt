35745227|t|The Role of Nutritional Factors in the Modulation of the Composition of the Gut Microbiota in People with Autoimmune Diabetes.
35745227|a|Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a disease marked by oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and the presence of autoantibodies. The gut microbiota has been shown to be involved in the alleviation of oxidative stress and inflammation as well as strengthening immunity, thus its' possible involvement in the pathogenesis of T1DM has been highlighted. The goal of the present study is to analyze information on the relationship between the structure of the intestinal microbiome and the occurrence of T1DM. The modification of the intestinal microbiota can increase the proportion of SCFA-producing bacteria, which could in turn be effective in the prevention and/or treatment of T1DM. The increased daily intake of soluble and non-soluble fibers, as well as the inclusion of pro-biotics, prebiotics, herbs, spices, and teas that are sources of phytobiotics, in the diet, could be important in improving the composition and activity of the microbiota and thus in the prevention of metabolic disorders. Understanding how the microbiota interacts with immune cells to create immune tolerance could enable the development of new therapeutic strategies for T1DM and improve the quality of life of people with T1DM.
