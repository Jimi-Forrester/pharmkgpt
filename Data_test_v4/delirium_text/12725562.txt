12725562|a|The effect of a kampo medicine, Ninjin-yoei-to (NYT; Ren-shen-yang-rong-tang in Chinese) on nerve growth factor (NGF) secretion from the cultured rat astrocytes was examined in vitro. When rat embryo astrocytes were cultured in the presence of NYT for 24 h, the amount of NGF in the medium was significantly increased in a dose dependent manner. Among 14 kinds of component herbs in NYT, the roots of Polygala tenuifolia and roots of Panax ginseng extracts increased NGF levels from the astrocytes. Saponin fraction from the roots of P. tenuifolia enhanced the production of NGF, however phenolic glycoside fraction showed no effect. Onjisaponins A, B, E, F and G as major saponins of the root of P. tenuifolia strongly increased the NGF level, whereas ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1 did not affect the NGF level. Onjisaponin F also induced ChAT mRNA level in rat basal forebrain cells. These results indicate the possibility that NYT and/or onjisaponins in P. tenuifolia may have potential therapeutic effects for the treatment of Alzheimer disease patients.
