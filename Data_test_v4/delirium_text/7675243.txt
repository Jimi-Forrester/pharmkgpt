7675243|t|Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele frequency is not increased in progressive supranuclear palsy.
7675243|a|We examined apolipoprotein E (ApoE) immunoreactivity and allele frequency in 12 autopsied cases of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by diffuse neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation without beta-amyloid deposits. In spite of the ApoE immunoreactivity associated with NFTs, in PSP the ApoE allele frequency was comparable with that of age-matched normal controls. This suggests that in Alzheimer's disease the increased frequency of ApoE epsilon 4 does not influence neurofibrillary degeneration, but is probably linked to beta-amyloid deposition.
