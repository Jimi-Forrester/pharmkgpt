33682017|t|Prevalence and Factors Associated with Cumulative Anticholinergic Burden Among Older Long-Stay Nursing Home Residents with Overactive Bladder.
33682017|a|BACKGROUND: Overactive bladder (OAB), the primary cause of urinary incontinence in nursing homes, is commonly treated with anticholinergic medications; however, the elderly population is vulnerable to the adverse effects associated with anticholinergic burden. Given the relatively high prevalence of OAB among nursing home residents, it is important to understand the magnitude of anticholinergic burden in this population. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the prevalence of cumulative anticholinergic burden among long-stay nursing home (LSNH) residents with OAB; and (2) identify the factors associated with varying levels of cumulative anticholinergic burden. METHODS: This was a retrospective, cohort study using Minimum Data Set-linked Medicare claims data. Anticholinergic burden was determined based on the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden scale and patient-specific dosing using defined daily dose. The Andersen Behavioral Model framework was used to identify the predisposing, enabling, and need factors associated with levels of anticholinergic burden. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to determine the factors associated with levels of anticholinergic burden. RESULTS: A total of 123,308 LSNH residents with OAB were identified; 87.2% had some degree of anticholinergic burden and 27.3% had high cumulative burden. Multiple factors were associated with higher levels of burden, including younger age, female sex, and non-Hispanic White ethnicity (predisposing factors); dual eligibility, Southern geographic region, and rural residence (enabling factors); and a number of comorbidities and concomitant medications (need factors). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a high level of anticholinergic burden among LSNH residents. Multiple factors were associated with a high level of burden. There is a need to optimize the use of anticholinergics due to their significant safety concerns in the LSNH setting.
