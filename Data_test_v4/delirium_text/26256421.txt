26256421|t|The protective effects and underlying mechanism of an anti-oligomeric Abeta42 single-chain variable fragment antibody.
26256421|a|Oligomeric Abeta42 aggregates have been identified as one of the major neurotoxic components of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunotherapy targeted against these Abeta42 aggregates has been proposed as an appropriate therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD. Here, we report an anti-oligomeric Abeta42 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody, named MO6, obtained from the human antibody library of a healthy donor. ScFv MO6 specifically recognized and bound to the oligomeric Abeta42 (Abeta42 oligomers and immature protofibrils; 18-37 kDa), and reduced their levels mainly by blocking their formation, although scFv MO6 also induced disaggregation of Abeta42 aggregates. More importantly, scFv MO6 ameliorated or attenuated Abeta42-induced cytotoxicity and increased cell viability by up to 33%. Furthermore, scFv MO6 efficiently passed through an in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model with a delivery efficiency of 66% after 60 min post-administration. ScFv MO6 is a monovalent antibody with an affinity constant (KD) of 5.2x10(-6) M for Abeta42 oligomers. Molecular docking simulations of Abeta42 to scFv MO6 revealed that the approach and specific binding of scFv MO6 to oligomeric Abeta42 aggregates was achieved by conformational recognition and directed induction, which resulted in a more dynamic adaptation of Abeta42 to scFv MO6, occurring mainly in the N-terminal (3-4), middle (12-19) and C-terminal (34-42) regions of Abeta42. This binding mode of scFv MO6 to Abeta42 explains its protective effects against oligomeric Abeta42. Our findings may be applied for the design of a smaller antibody specific for Abeta42 oligermers.
