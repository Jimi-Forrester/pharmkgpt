36568664|a|Background: Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM), is a highly fatal fungal infection of the central nervous system (CNS), affecting not only immunocompromised patients, but also apparently immunocompetent patients. CM is mainly caused by Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans), while viral hepatitis B (HBV) tends to be a rare inducement. According to the literature, the most common cerebral area affected by CM was frontal lobe, while infratentorial lesions were rare, especially those complicated with cerebellar infarction. Methods: This study capitally analyzed the clinical data of an elderly female suffering from infratentorial CM complicated with cerebellar infarction, with a history of chronic HBV. Results: The patient suffered from the symptoms of dizziness, insanity, low-grade fever, and high cranial pressure throughout the course of the disease. Her MRI findings were hydrocephalus and infratentorial lesions, including bilateral cerebellums and meningeal enhancement. The pathogene was Cryptococcus revealed by both the cytology and ink stain of cerebrospinal fluid, and was confirmed to be C. neoformans by the Next generation sequencing (NGS). After 12 days of intravenous amphotericin B (AMB) treatment, the patient developed oliguria, and 3 days after the termination of AMB treatment, the renal function recovered. Brain MRI reexamination after the treatment showed that the diffused lesions in the cerebellum were significantly decreased, and acute infarction occurred on the left cerebellum although it was asymptomatic. The patient took fluconazole 400mg per day after discharge, without complaints during the follow-up two months later. Conclusion: C. neoformans infection may be a possible pathogeny in chronic HBV patients with meningoencephalitis. Cerebellar infarction might be a complication of CM, therefore MRI is supposed to be re-examined during antifungal therapy. Additionally, monitoring renal function plays a vital role after AMB treatment, and renal function may recover after termination.
