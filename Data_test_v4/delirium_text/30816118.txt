30816118|a|With increasing prevalence, chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a global health problem. Due to the retention of uremic toxins, electrolytes and water, and the resultant metabolic disturbances, CKD affects several organs, including the nervous system. Thus, CKD patients suffer from several neurological complications, including dementia, cognitive impairment, motor abnormalities, depression, and mood and sleep disturbances. However, the mechanisms underlying the neurological complications are least elucidated. We have recently reported a highly reproducible mice model of CKD induced by high adenine diet, which exhibited psychomotor behavioral abnormalities and blood-brain barrier disruption. In the present study, using the mice model, we have investigated psycho-motor and cognitive behaviour, and the neurochemical and histopathological alterations in brain relevant to the observed behavioural abnormalities. The results demonstrate global loss of Acetylcholinesterase activity, and decrease in neuronal arborisation and dendritic spine density in discrete brain regions, of the CKD mice. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunctions were found in specific brain regions of the mice, which have been regarded as the underlying causes of the observed neurochemical and histopathological alterations. Thus, the present study is of immense importance, and has therapeutic implications in the management of CKD-associated neurological complications.
