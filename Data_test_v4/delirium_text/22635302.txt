22635302|t|The forensic and legal implications of water, wet, or fry.
22635302|a|Embalming fluid applied to marijuana cigars or cigarettes, with or without the addition of phencyclidine (PCP), has several names, such as water, wet, illy, and fry. Individuals who commit crimes under the influence of this substance are often violent and may appear psychotic, with symptoms resembling schizophrenia or delirium. Currently, there are no case reports or case law involving the use of this substance. Wet may impair one's competency to stand trial (CST). The authors present a composite case of a man who abused wet for three years and had been sober for three months when he presented for a CST evaluation. The authors posit that individuals who use wet may raise settled (fixed) insanity or defenses of not guilty by reason of insanity in the future.
