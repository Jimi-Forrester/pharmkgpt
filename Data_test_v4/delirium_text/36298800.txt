36298800|t|Amino Acid Substitution within Seven-Octapeptide Repeat Insertions in the Prion Protein Gene Associated with Short-Term Course.
36298800|a|The majority of seven-octapeptide repeat insertion (7-OPRI) carriers exhibit relatively early onset and a slowly progressive course. We have presented three cases of 7-OPRI, including two that are rapidly progressing, and compared the clinical and ancillary characteristics of the short-term and long-term disease course, as well as factors that influence disease course. The clinical and ancillary features of three new 7-OPRI patients in a Chinese pedigree were analyzed. Global data on 7-OPRI cases were then collected by reviewing the literature, and the cases were grouped according to clinical duration as per the WHO sCJD criteria, with a two-year cut-off. A Chinese pedigree has a glycine-to-glutamate substitution within the 7-OPRI insertion, which enhances the hydrophilicity of the prion protein. Two cases in this pedigree had a short disease course (consistent with the typical clinical and ancillary features of sCJD). In addition, the members of this pedigree had a later onset (p < 0.001) and shorter disease course (p < 0.001) compared to previously reported 7-OPRI cases with 129 cis-M and a similar age of onset and disease course to that of cases with 129 cis-V. The 7-OPRI cases with a shorter clinical course (n = 4) had a later onset (p = 0.021), higher rate of hyperintensity on MRI (p = 0.029) and higher frequency of 129 cis-V (p = 0.066) compared to those with a longer clinical course (n = 13). The clinical presentation of 7-OPRI is significantly heterogeneous. Codon 129 cis-V and amino acid substitution within repeat insertions are possible contributors to the short-term disease course of 7-OPRI.
