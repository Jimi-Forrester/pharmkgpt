39276492|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) represent a hallmark of numerous incapacitating and untreatable conditions, the incidence of which is escalating swiftly, exemplified by Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. There is an urgent necessity to create pharmaceuticals that exhibit high efficacy and minimal toxicity in order to address these debilitating diseases. The structural complexity and diversity of natural products confer upon them a broad spectrum of biological activities, thereby significantly contributing to the history of drug discovery. Nevertheless, natural products present challenges in drug discovery, including time-consuming separation processes, low content, low bioavailability, and other related issues. To address these challenges, numerous analogs of natural products have been synthesized. This methodology enables the rapid synthesis of analogs of natural products with the potential to serve as lead compounds for drug development, thereby paving the way for the discovery of novel pharmaceuticals. This paper provides a summary of 127 synthetic analogues featuring various natural product structures, including flavonoids, alkaloids, coumarins, phenylpropanoids, terpenoids, polyphenols, and amides. The compounds are categorized based on their efficacy in treating various diseases. Furthermore, this article delves into the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of certain analogues, offering a thorough point of reference for the systematic development of pharmaceuticals aimed at addressing neurodegenerative conditions.
