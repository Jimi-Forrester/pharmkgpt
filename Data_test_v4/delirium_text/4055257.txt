4055257|t|Empirical study on an inpatient psychogeriatric unit: diagnostic complexities.
4055257|a|Retrospective analysis of the phenomenology and the diagnostic process of 112 consecutive psychogeriatric admissions revealed the majority (61%) were suffering from affective illness. In 53 percent, the reason for admission was depression and 8 percent were in the manic phase of a bipolar disorder. Dementia was diagnosed in 32 percent, with a third of these patients having an associated depression. The remaining 7 percent had a schizophrenic or paranoid disorder. Ninety-two patients (82%) were found to have at least one coexisting medical and/or neurological disorder(s) requiring early intervention. Associated acute organic brain syndromes were common (18%) and often difficult to diagnose. The AOBS was at times the only sign of an underlying active medical condition. The diagnosis of this condition often required serial observations for fluctuations in mental status accompanied by appropriate laboratory investigations. These findings underscore the complexity of the diagnostic process in psychogeriatric patients suffering from concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders. High index of awareness is recommended for the need to search for coexisting delirium, which may be masked at times by the major psychiatric disorder.
