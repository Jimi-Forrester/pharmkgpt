31591393|t|Correction: Oxidation of KCNB1 potassium channels triggers apoptotic integrin signaling in the brain.
31591393|a|Since the publication of this article the authors have noted that there were two typos that could have caused confusion to the readers:1) References to "integrin alpha chain V" should have been "integrin alpha 5". These appear in the Abstract and the first paragraph of the Results section.2) In the Results section under the header "Integrins activate Fyn tyrosine kinases" and the legend of Figure 6a, "tyr530" should be replaced with "tyr416".3) In the the legend of Figure 6b, "pSrc" with should be replaced with "pFyn".
