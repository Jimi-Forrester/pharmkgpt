29328972|t|Establishment of TUSMi003-A, an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line from a 62-year old Chinese Han patient with Alzheimer's disease with ApoE3/4 genetic background.
29328972|a|A 62-year old Chinese Han Alzheimer's disease (AD) female patient with ApoE3/4 genetic background donated her Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The non-integrating episomal vector system was used to reprogrammed PBMCs with the human OKSM transcription factors. The pluripotency of transgene-free iPSCs was confirmed by immunocytochemistry for pluripotency markers and by the ability of the iPSCs to differentiate spontaneously into 3 germ layers in vitro. In addition, the iPSC line displayed a normal karyotype. Our model might offer a good platform to further study the pathological mechanisms, to identify early biomarkers, and also for drug testing studies in AD.
