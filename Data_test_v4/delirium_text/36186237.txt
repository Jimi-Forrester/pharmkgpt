36186237|a|Although the use of dexmedetomidine is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in the adult population for monitored anesthesia care and sedation during mechanical ventilation, clinical experience suggests the potential application of dexmedetomidine in the palliative care arena. The medication can provide sedation with lower risk of delirium, control or minimize the adverse effects of other medications, and augment analgesia from opioids. We conducted a computerized bibliographic search of the literature regarding dexmedetomidine use for the treatment of pain and provision of sedation during palliative and hospice care in adult and pediatric patients. The objective was to provide a general descriptive account of the physiologic effects of dexmedetomidine and review its potential applications in the field of palliative and hospice care in adult and pediatric patients. The sedative and analgesic effects of dexmedetomidine have been well studied in animal and human models. Published experience from both single case reports and small case series has demonstrated the potential therapeutic applications of dexmedetomidine in palliative and hospice care. In addition to intravenous administration, case reports have demonstrated its successful use by both the intranasal and subcutaneous routes. Although these experiences have suggested its safety and efficacy, larger series and additional clinical experience with prospective comparison to other agents are needed to further define its efficacy and role in palliative and hospice care.
