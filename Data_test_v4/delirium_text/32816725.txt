32816725|t|Identification of Small-Molecule Inhibitors Targeting Porphyromonas gingivalis Interspecies Adherence and Determination of Their In Vitro and In Vivo Efficacies.
32816725|a|Porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the primary causative agents of periodontal disease and initially colonizes the oral cavity by adhering to commensal streptococci. Adherence requires the interaction of a minor fimbrial protein (Mfa1) of P. gingivalis with streptococcal antigen I/II (AgI/II). Our previous work identified an AgI/II peptide that potently inhibited adherence and significantly reduced P. gingivalis virulence in vivo, suggesting that this interaction represents a potential target for drug discovery. To develop targeted small-molecule inhibitors of this protein-protein interaction, we performed a virtual screen of the ZINC databases to identify compounds that exhibit structural similarity with the two functional motifs (NITVK and VQDLL) of the AgI/II peptide. Thirty three compounds were tested for in vitro inhibition of P. gingivalis adherence and the three most potent compounds, namely, N7, N17, and V8, were selected for further analysis. The in vivo efficacy of these compounds was evaluated in a murine model of periodontitis. Treatment of mice with each of the compounds significantly reduced maxillary alveolar bone resorption in infected animals. Finally, a series of cytotoxicity tests were performed against human and murine cell lines. Compounds N17 and V8 exhibited no significant cytotoxic activity toward any of the cell lines, whereas compound N7 was cytotoxic at the highest concentrations that were tested (20 and 40 muM). These results identify compounds N17 and V8 as potential lead compounds that will facilitate the design of more potent therapeutic agents that may function to limit or prevent P. gingivalis colonization of the oral cavity.
