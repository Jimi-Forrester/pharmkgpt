28580167|t|Sequential EMT-MET induces neuronal conversion through Sox2.
28580167|a|Direct neuronal conversion can be achieved with combinations of small-molecule compounds and growth factors. Here, by studying the first or induction phase of the neuronal conversion induced by defined 5C medium, we show that the Sox2-mediated switch from early epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to late mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) within a high proliferation context is essential and sufficient for the conversion from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to TuJ+ cells. At the early stage, insulin and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced cell proliferation, early EMT, the up-regulation of Stat3 and Sox2, and the subsequent activation of neuron projection. Up-regulated Sox2 then induced MET and directed cells towards a neuronal fate at the late stage. Inhibiting either stage of this sequential EMT-MET impaired the conversion. In addition, Sox2 could replace sequential EMT-MET to induce a similar conversion within a high proliferation context, and its functions were confirmed with other neuronal conversion protocols and MEFs reprogramming. Therefore, the critical roles of the sequential EMT-MET were implicated in direct cell fate conversion in addition to reprogramming, embryonic development and cancer progression.
