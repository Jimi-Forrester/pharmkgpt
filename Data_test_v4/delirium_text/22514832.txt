22514832|t|Substance Abuse Among Older Adults
22514832|a|This TIP, <i>Substance Abuse Among Older Adults, </i>presents treatment providers with much-needed information about a population that is underdiagnosed and underserved. Substance abuse, particularly of alcohol and prescription drugs, often goes undetected among adults over 60 in part due to societal reasons - older adults tend to be ashamed about drinking or drug problems and see them as a moral failing. Providers, for their part, may confuse symptoms of substance use disorders with age-related changes. Because so much of older adults' substance abuse is never even identified, this TIP is aimed at not only substance abuse treatment providers but also primary care clinicians, social workers, senior center staff, and anyone else who has regular contact with older adults. The TIP discusses the relationship between aging and substance abuse and offers guidance on identifying, screening, and assessing not only substance abuse but also disorders such as dementia and delirium that can mask or mimic an alcohol or prescription drug problem. Practical accommodations to treatment for older adults and a discussion of how to assess outcomes and treat within a managed care context round out the document.
