35203497|t|Modeling Alzheimer's Disease in Caenorhabditis elegans.
35203497|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia. After decades of research, we know the importance of the accumulation of protein aggregates such as beta-amyloid peptide and phosphorylated tau. We also know that mutations in certain proteins generate early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), and many other genes modulate the disease in its sporadic form. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathology are still unclear. Because of ethical limitations, we need to use animal models to investigate these processes. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has received considerable attention in the last 25 years, since the first AD models overexpressing Abeta peptide were described. We review here the main results obtained using this model to study AD. We include works studying the basic molecular mechanisms of the disease, as well as those searching for new therapeutic targets. Although this model also has important limitations, the ability of this nematode to generate knock-out or overexpression models of any gene, single or combined, and to carry out toxicity, recovery or survival studies in short timeframes with many individuals and at low cost is difficult to overcome. We can predict that its use as a model for various diseases will certainly continue to increase.
