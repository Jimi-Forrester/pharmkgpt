37337520|t|Risk Factors and Prognosis in Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis Patients with Disturbance of Consciousness.
37337520|a|Purpose: Disturbance of consciousness is common in patients with severe anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. However, little is known about it. This study aimed to analyze the clinical manifestations and prognostic factors of anti-NMDAR encephalitis with disturbance of consciousness. Methods: In this retrospective study, the clinical features, treatment results, and long-term outcomes of anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients with disturbance of consciousness were analyzed, and multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the factors affecting their prognosis. Results: In the group with disturbance of consciousness, the incidences of seizures, involuntary movements, pulmonary infection, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), abnormal cerebrospinal fluid index, plasma exchange, and immunosuppressive therapy were higher than those in the group without disturbance of consciousness (all P<0.05). During the follow-up period (median: 36 months, range: 12-78 months), the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score, the maximum mRS score during hospitalization, the mRS score at discharge, and the mRS score at 12 months after discharge were higher in the disturbance of consciousness group (all P < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in long-term outcomes and recurrence between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that mechanical ventilation, elevated IgG index, and delayed immunotherapy were independent risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis with disturbance of consciousness at 12 months (odds ratio: 22.591, 39.868, 1.195). The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of mechanical ventilation, elevated IgG index, and delayed immunotherapy was 0.971 (95% CI=0.934-1.000, P<0.001). Conclusion: Mechanical ventilation, elevated IgG index, and delayed immunotherapy may be the influencing factors of poor prognosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients with disturbance of consciousness. Although their condition is relatively serious, most patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis with disturbance of consciousness will achieve favorable long-term outcomes after long-term treatment.
