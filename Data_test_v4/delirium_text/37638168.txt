37638168|t|Red emitting carbon dots: surface modifications and bioapplications.
37638168|a|Quantum dots (QDs), and carbon quantum dots (CDs) in particular, have received significant attention for their special characteristics. These particles, on the scale of several nanometers, are often produced using simple and green methods, with naturally occurring organic precursors. In addition to facile production methods, CDs present advantageous applications in the field of medicine, primarily for bioimaging, antibacterial and therapeutics. Also, CDs present great potential for surface modification through methods like doping or material mixing during synthesis. However, the bulk of current literature focuses on CDs emitting in the blue wavelengths which are not very suitable for biological applications. Red emitting CDs are therefore of additional interest due to their brightness, photostability, novelty and deeper tissue penetration. In this review article, red CDs, their methods of production, and their biological applications for translational research are explored in depth, with emphasis on the effects of surface modifications and doping.
