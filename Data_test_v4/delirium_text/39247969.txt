39247969|a|Recently, amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaOs) have been studied as the primary pathogenic substances in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our previous study revealed that the Abeta expression level is closely related to ARC progression. Here, we demonstrated that the accumulation of AbetaOs in the lens epithelium of age-related cataract (ARC) patients increased during ARC progression and that this alteration was consistent with the changes in mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and cellular apoptosis. In vitro, human lens epithelial cells (HLECs) treated with AbetaOs exhibited Ca2+ dyshomeostasis, impaired mitochondrial function, elevated oxidative stress levels, and increased apoptosis. Moreover, the proapoptotic effect of AbetaOs was alleviated after the uptake of mitochondrial Ca2+ was inhibited. These results establish that AbetaOs may promote HLEC apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, thus preliminarily revealing the possible association between the accumulation of AbetaOs and other pathological processes in ARC.
