33245459|a|BACKGROUND: At present, viral diseases become major concern for the world. SARS-CoV2 and SFTS viruses are deadly in nature, and there is a need for developing best treatments for them. Modern in silico approaches were found to be very handy in determining putative drug molecules. In this study, we analyze interaction of beta-sesquiphellandrene (compound belongs to ginger) with spike protein (Sp) and membrane glycoprotein polyprotein (MPp). RESULTS: Our molecular docking and simulation study reveals the perfect binding pocket of Sp and MPp holding beta-sesquiphellandrene (bS). Binding energies for MPp-bS and Sp-bS were found to be - 9.5 kcal/mol and - 10.3 kcal/mol respectively. RMSD and RMSF values for docked complexes were found to be in selectable range, i.e., 1 to 3 A and 1 to 8 A respectively. Modern computational tools were used here to make this investigation fast and effective. Further, ADME analysis reveals the therapeutic validations for beta-sesquiphellandrene to act as a useful pharmacoactive compound. Beta-sesquiphellandrene provides not only inhibitory effect on spike protein of SARS-CoV2 but also similar inhibitory effects on membrane glycoprotein polyprotein complex of SFTS virus, which hampers the pathological initiation of the diseases caused by both the viruses, i.e., COVID-19 and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. CONCLUSION: This method of computational analysis was found to be rapid and effective, and opens new doors in the domain of in silico drug discovery. Beta-sesquiphellandrene can be used as effective medicine to control these harmful pathogens after wet lab validations.
