26262201|t|Development and Usability Evaluation of the Mobile Delirium Assessment App Based on Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU).
26262201|a|Delirium is a common complication among patients in ICU settings. The accuracy of using the assessment tool CAM-ICU to detect delirium is relatively low during routine practice among bedside nurses. The aim of this study is to develop a mobile application (app) to detect delirium in early stage and to test its usability among ICU nurses. The app was developed with Java and installed on a mobile device. A questionnaire was created based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) measuring their response to the four domains of TAM: perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), attitudes towards usage (ATU) and behavioral intention to use (BIU). One hundred and two ICU nurses completed the survey. The result indicated that the app we developed has easy to use interfaces and is easier to use compared to the regular CAM-ICU.
