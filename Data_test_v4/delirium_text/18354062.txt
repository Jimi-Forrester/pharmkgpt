18354062|t|Misdiagnosed delirium in patient referrals to a university-based hospital psychiatry department.
18354062|a|The authors examined the factors associated with referral errors in which the presence of delirium was ostensibly not recognized by medical staff personnel. Medical records of 541 university-hospital patients consecutively referred for psychiatric consultation were scrutinized for extant delirium. The data indicated that a greater likelihood of a missed diagnosis was associated with younger age; referrals outside of family practice service; orientation as to person, place, and time; and a history of bipolar affective disorder or psychosis. The ramifications of failure to diagnose existing delirium include increased morbidity and mortality, longer length of hospital stay, and increased healthcare costs.
