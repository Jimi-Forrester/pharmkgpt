27826142|t|MiRNA expression profiles in the brains of mice infected with scrapie agents 139A, ME7 and S15.
27826142|a|MicroRNA (miRNA) is a class of non-coding endogenous small-molecule single-stranded RNA that regulates complementary mRNA through degradation or translation of the mRNA targets. Usually, miRNAs show remarkable cell and tissues specificity. Recently, alterations in a set of miRNAs in the brains of patients with certain neurodegenerative diseases, including prion diseases, have been reported. In this study, using deep sequencing technology, miRNA expression profiles in the brains of mice infected with scrapie agents 139A, ME7 and S15 at a terminal stage were comparatively analysed. In total, 57, 94 and 135 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in the pooled brain samples of 139A-, ME7- and S15-infected mice, respectively, compared with the brains of age-matched normal controls. Among them, 22 were commonly increased and 14 were commonly decreased in the brains of all three infected models. In addition, a reduction in the expression of two novel miRNAs was also commonly observed. Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription analysis of six randomly selected commonly increased and decreased miRNAs in the brains of the three infected mouse models, as well as the two novel miRNAs, verified that the expression patterns were comparable to the deep sequencing data. KEGG analysis of the differentially expressed miRNAs revealed the involvement of similar pathways in all three types of infected animals. Comprehensive analysis of these miRNA profiles not only provides useful clues for understanding prion biology but also is beneficial in the search for possible diagnostic marker(s) for prion diseases.
