32301109|t|Region- and neuronal-subtype-specific expression of Na,K-ATPase alpha and beta subunit isoforms in the mouse brain.
32301109|a|Na,K-ATPase is a ubiquitous molecule contributing to the asymmetrical distribution of Na+ and K+ ions across the plasma membrane and maintenance of the membrane potential, a prerequisite of neuronal activity. Na,K-ATPase comprises three subunits (alpha, beta, and FXYD). The alpha subunit has four isoforms in mice, with three of them (alpha1, alpha2, and alpha3) expressed in the brain. However, the functional and biological significances of the different brain isoforms remain to be fully elucidated. Recent studies have revealed the association of Atp1a3, a gene encoding alpha3 subunit, with neurological disorders. To map the cellular distributions of the alpha subunit isoforms and their coexpression patterns, we evaluated the mRNA expression of Atp1a1, Atp1a2, and Atp1a3 by in situ hybridization in the mouse brain. Atp1a1 and Atp1a3 were expressed in neurons, whereas Atp1a2 was almost exclusively expressed in glial cells. Most neurons coexpressed Atp1a1 and Atp1a3, with highly heterogeneous expression levels across the brain regions and neuronal subtypes. We identified parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, and retrosplenial cortex as an example of a neuronal subtype expressing low Atp1a1 and high Atp1a3. The expression of Atp1b isoforms was also heterogeneous across brain regions and cellular subtypes. The PV-expressing neurons expressed a high level of Atp1b1 and a low level of Atp1b2 and Atp1b3. These findings provide basic information on the region- and neuronal-subtype-dependent expression of Na,K-ATPase alpha and beta subunit isoforms, as well as a rationale for the selective involvement of neurons expressing high levels of Atp1a3 in neurological disorders.
