25774490|t|Multifaceted strategy for the synthesis of diverse 2,2'-bithiophene derivatives.
25774490|a|New catalytically or high pressure activated reactions and routes, including coupling, double bond migration in allylic systems, and various types of cycloaddition and dihydroamination have been used for the synthesis of novel bithiophene derivatives. Thanks to the abovementioned reactions and routes combined with non-catalytic ones, new acetylene, butadiyne, isoxazole, 1,2,3-triazole, pyrrole, benzene, and fluoranthene derivatives with one, two or six bithiophenyl moieties have been obtained. Basic sources of crucial substrates which include bithiophene motif for catalytic reactions were 2,2'-bithiophene, gaseous acetylene and 1,3-butadiyne.
