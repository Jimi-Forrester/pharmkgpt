33800685|t|Imaging Biomarkers for Monitoring the Inflammatory Redox Landscape in the Brain.
33800685|a|Inflammation is one key process in driving cellular redox homeostasis toward oxidative stress, which perpetuates inflammation. In the brain, this interplay results in a vicious cycle of cell death, the loss of neurons, and leakage of the blood-brain barrier. Hence, the neuroinflammatory response fuels the development of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. Interrogation of the interplay between inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell death in neurological tissue in vivo is very challenging. The complexity of the underlying biological process and the fragility of the brain limit our understanding of the cause and the adequate diagnostics of neuroinflammatory diseases. In recent years, advancements in the development of molecular imaging agents addressed this limitation and enabled imaging of biomarkers of neuroinflammation in the brain. Notable redox biomarkers for imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) tracers are the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) and monoamine oxygenase B (MAO-B). These findings and achievements offer the opportunity for novel diagnostic applications and therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes experimental as well as established pharmaceutical and biotechnological tools for imaging the inflammatory redox landscape in the brain, and provides a glimpse into future applications.
