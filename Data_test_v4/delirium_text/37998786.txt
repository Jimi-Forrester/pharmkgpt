37998786|t|Emergence of Antibiotic-Resistant Porphyromonas gingivalis in United States Periodontitis Patients.
37998786|a|Antibiotic resistance patterns of the major human periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis were assessed over a 20-year period in the United States. Subgingival P. gingivalis was cultured pre-treatment from 2193 severe periodontitis patients during three time periods: 1999-2000 (936 patients), 2009-2010 (685 patients), and 2019-2020 (572 patients). The clinical isolates were tested for in vitro resistance to 4 mg/L for clindamycin and doxycycline, 8 mg/L for amoxicillin, and 16 mg/L for metronidazole, with a post hoc combination of data for metronidazole plus amoxicillin. Clindamycin-resistant P. gingivalis was significantly more prevalent in 2009-2010 (9.1% of patients) and 2019-2020 (9.3%; 15-fold increase) as compared to 1999-2000 (0.6%). P. gingivalis resistance to amoxicillin also significantly increased from 0.1% of patients in 1999-2000 to 1.3% in 2009-2010 and 2.8% (28-fold increase) in 2019-2020. P. gingivalis resistance to metronidazole, metronidazole plus amoxicillin, and doxycycline was low (<=0.5% prevalence), and statistically unchanged, over the 20-year period. These findings are the first to reveal marked increases over 20 years in clindamycin-resistant and amoxicillin-resistant P. gingivalis in United States periodontitis patients. Increased antibiotic resistance of P. gingivalis and other periodontitis-associated bacteria threatens the efficacy of periodontal antimicrobial chemotherapy.
