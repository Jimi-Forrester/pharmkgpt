24942517|t|[Formula: see text]evidence of neuropsychological dysfunction in Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: case report.
24942517|a|Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a potentially life-threatening critical illness affecting multiple organ systems including the peripheral and central nervous system. This case report involves a young man who was diagnosed with SJS/TEN at age 16 and underwent neuropsychological assessment at age 21. Results indicate a diffuse pattern of cerebral compromise and represent a decline from premorbid level of functioning. The etiology of the cognitive impairment in this patient is likely multifactorial with possible pathophysiologic mechanisms including hypoxemia, metabolic acid-base perturbations, hyperglycemia, and delirium, as well as sepsis and inflammation.
