39186131|a|BACKGROUND: Nurses play an important role in the prevention and management of delirium episodes. However, some studies have reported that not all interventions recommended are applied due to time and resource constraints, resulting in patients receiving less care than required because other patients and/or interventions are prioritised. The concept of prioritization is part of the broader concept of decision-making as the ability to choose between two or more alternatives to ensure patient safety. Understanding the reasons influencing the prioritization process in patients at risk or with delirium may inform interventions to prevent and/or minimise the unfinished nursing care. AIM: The purpose of this study was to explore the reasons that inform the prioritisation process among nurses when they are challenged to make decisions for patients at risk and with delirium. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative study performed according to the COnsolidated criteria for Reporting guidelines, in 2021. An intentional sample of nurses working full-time with older patients in medical, geriatric, and post-acute care facilities affiliated with the National Health System was involved. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and narratives thematic analysed. RESULTS: A total of 56 nurses (55.4% in internal medicine, 26.8% in geriatrics and 17.8% in post-acute/intermediate care) participated with an average age of 31.6 years. The reasons informing the prioritisation process while providing preventive or managerial interventions towards a patient at risk of or with delirium are set at three levels: (1) unit level, as reasons belong to the inadequacy of the 'Environment', the 'Human Resources', and the 'Organisation and Work Processes', (2) nurse's level, as issues in 'Competencies' and 'Attitudes' possessed, and (3) patient level, due to the 'Multidimensional Frailty'. CONCLUSION: Nurses caring for patients at risk of and with delirium face several challenges in providing care. To prioritise preventive and managerial interventions, it is essential to implement multilevel and multifaced organizational and educational strategies.
