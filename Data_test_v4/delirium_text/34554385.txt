34554385|t|Mediation of the APOE associations with Alzheimer's and coronary heart diseases through body mass index and lipids.
34554385|a|The APOE epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 polymorphism is associated with multiple non-Mendelian traits, including high- (HDL-C) and low- (LDL-C) density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, body mass index (BMI), coronary heart disease (CHD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lipids and BMI are risk factors for AD and CHD. Causal connections between the epsilon2 and epsilon4 alleles and these traits remain, however, poorly understood. We leverage comprehensive analyses of longitudinal data from four studies to examine potentially causal heterogeneous connections between these alleles, lipids, BMI, and diseases. We emphasize mutual mediation roles of lipids and BMI in their associations with the epsilon2 and epsilon4 alleles and their mediation roles in the associations of these alleles with AD and CHD. We confirmed previously reported significant univariate associations of these alleles with each trait, except CHD. We found, however, that most of the univariate- and mediation-analysis associations were affected by antagonistic heterogeneity/mediation. The mutual mediation analysis identified the associations of the APOE alleles with LDL-C as the least heterogeneous. The epsilon2 and epsilon4 alleles were associated with CHD through lipids, led by beneficial (betaIE =  - 0.071, pIE = 2.28 x 10-10) and adverse (betaIE = 0.019, pIE = 7.37 x 10-6) associations, respectively, through LDL-C. Both these alleles were adversely associated with CHD through triglycerides. For AD, only BMI partially mediated the adverse association of the epsilon4 allele with AD (betaIE = 0.016, pIE = 2.09 x 10-2). Our results suggest different roles of BMI and lipids in the AD and CHD pathogeneses. More comprehensive studies of causal connections between genetic variants and non-Mendelian traits are required as they can be critically affected by heterogeneous antagonistic relationships.
