39751989|a|BACKGROUND: The presence of frailty is common in people with Parkinson's disease, as is cognitive dysfunction. Previous research on frailty has focused on the physical aspects of the pathology. AIMS: To analyze the relationship between frailty and cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease and to know which disease characteristics are associated with frailty. METHODS: An observational, correlational and cross-sectional study was conducted. Participants were recruited from a Home Rehabilitation Service and two Parkinson's Associations. An individualized assessment was carried out by means of a structured interview. Frailty was assessed with the Fried scale and cognitive function with the Mini Mental State Examination and the Parkinson's Disease Cognitive Rating Scale. RESULTS: 90 patients were recruited, 60% men, with a mean age of 73.50 (6.71) years. Frailty was associated with age and disease severity (p < 0.05). Frail patients presented worse cognitive performance relative to pre-frail and robust patients. A negative correlation (coefficient - 0.503) was observed between frailty and measures of patients' cognitive function (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: The coexistence of frailty and cognitive impairment should be assessed, as PD patients with both conditions are more vulnerable and have a higher chance of experiencing adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Frail patients with Parkinson's disease present an impairment of cognitive functions dependent on cortical and subcortical regions, being these regions more preserved in the case of robust. The development of programs for early detection of frailty and cognitive function in these patients is necessary to implement strategic intervention plans focused on reversing frailty and cognitive impairment.
