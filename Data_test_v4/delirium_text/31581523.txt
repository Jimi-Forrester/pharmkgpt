31581523|t|A Prospective Study Evaluating the Effects of a Nutritional Supplement Intervention on Cognition, Mood States, and Mental Performance in Video Gamers.
31581523|a|Cognitive function is critical for successful prolonged performance in eSports. This double-blind placebo-controlled study examined the effect of an inositol-enhanced arginine silicate oral supplement on cognitive performance and energy in eSports athletes. Sixty healthy men and women who spent 5 or more hours a week playing video games were randomly assigned to take supplement or placebo for 7 days. On day 1 and 7, before and 15 min after dosing, subjects completed the Trail Making Test (TMT), Parts A and B; Stroop Test; and Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire, and then played a video game for 60 min. Immediately after, cognitive tests were repeated. Self-reported energy levels increased, anger decreased, and TMT-B test errors decreased in the supplement group compared to placebo (p < 0.05). Fatigue, TMT-B time, and TMT B-A score improved in the supplement group compared to baseline (p < 0.05). After 60 min of gaming, supplementation decreased Stroop Test errors and TMT-A time (p < 0.05). Adverse events were minimal and not different between groups. These data appear to support the use of the studies product (nooLVL ) in eSports gamers looking to improve their accuracy, decision making, and reaction time during gaming.
