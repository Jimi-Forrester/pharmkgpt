21962304|t|Integrating outcome benefit into anesthetic design: the promise of steroids and statins.
21962304|a|Steroids and statins may facilitate the integration of anesthetic design with clinical outcome. Although steroids clearly benefit adult cardiac surgical patents, the evidence is weaker in pediatric cardiac surgery. Current large randomized trials of steroids likely will determine the future role of steroids in adult cardiac surgery. In the intensive care unit, steroid therapy is indicated in septic shock that is refractory to fluid and pressor therapy. Recent data, however, indicate that liberal steroid therapy for sepsis may have adverse outcome consequences. A 2nd concern in the intensive care unit is acute adrenal suppression secondary to bolus etomidate therapy because it may be deleterious in patients with septic shock. Possible clinical solutions include alternative induction agents, concomitant steroid therapy, and recent etomidate derivatives. Statins also reduce mortality and atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. Furthermore, they slow the progression of rheumatic valvular stenosis, an important consideration in the developing world. Statins also may reduce delirium, stroke, and acute renal injury after cardiac surgery, but further randomized trials are required before definitive recommendations can be formulated. Statins are essential in vascular surgery because they reduce mortality, myocardial ischemia, and acute renal injury. As a result, they have been recommended highly for outcome enhancement in recent perioperative guidelines. Although they may improve survival in sepsis, further investigation is indicated to define their therapeutic role.
