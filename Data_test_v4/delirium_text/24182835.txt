24182835|a|OBJECTIVE: This study retrospectively investigated the effect of dexmedetomidine on outcomes of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. DESIGN: Retrospective investigation. SETTING: Patients from a single tertiary medical center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 724 patients undergoing CABG surgery met the inclusion criteria and were categorized into 2 groups: 345 in the dexmedetomidine group (DEX) and 379 in the nondexmedetomidine group (Non-DEX). INTERVENTIONS: Perioperative dexmedetomidine was used as an intravenous infusion (0.24 to 0.6 microg/kg/hour) initiated after cardiopulmonary bypass and continued for less than 24 hours postoperatively in the intensive care unit. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Major outcome measures of this study were in-hospital, 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality, delirium and major adverse cardiocerebral events. Perioperative dexmedetomidine infusion was associated with significant reductions in in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortalities, compared with the patients who did not received dexmedetomidine. In-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortalities were 1.5% and 4.0% (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.332; 95% CI, 0.155 to 0.708; p = 0.0044), 2.0% and 4.5% (adjusted OR, 0.487; 95% CI, 0.253 to 0.985; p = 0.0305), and 3.2% and 6.9% (adjusted OR 0.421; 95% CI, 0.247 to 0.718, p = 0.0015), respectively. Perioperative dexmedetomidine infusion was associated with a reduced risk of delirium from 7.9% to 4.6% (adjusted OR, 0.431; 95% CI, 0.265-0.701; p = 0.0007). CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine infusion during CABG surgery was more likely to achieve improved in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year survival rates, and a significantly lower incidence of delirium.
