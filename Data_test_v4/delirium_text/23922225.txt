23922225|t|beta-amyloid and ATP-induced diffusional trapping of astrocyte and neuronal metabotropic glutamate type-5 receptors.
23922225|a|beta-Amyloid (Abeta) oligomers initiate synaptotoxicity following their interaction with the plasma membrane. Several proteins including metabotropic glutamate type 5 receptors (mGluR5s) contribute to this process. We observed an overexpression of mGluR5s in reactive astrocytes surrounding Abeta plaques in brain sections from an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. In a simplified cell culture system, using immunocytochemistry and single molecule imaging, we demonstrated a rapid binding of Abeta oligomers on the plasma membrane of astrocytes. The resulting aggregates of Abeta oligomers led to the diffusional trapping and clustering of mGluR5s. Further, Abeta oligomers induced an increase in ATP release following activation of astroglial mGluR5s by its agonist. ATP slowed mGluR5s diffusion in astrocytes as well as in neurons co-cultured with astrocytes. This effect, which is purinergic receptor-dependent, was not observed in pure neuronal cultures. Thus, Abeta oligomer- and mGluR5-dependent ATP release by astrocytes may contribute to the overall deleterious effect of mGluR5s in Alzheimer's disease. GLIA 2013;61:1673-1686.
