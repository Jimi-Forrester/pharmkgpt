35690813|t|Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of PATH FOR timely transfer of geriatric HIP fracture patients from hospital to rehabilitation to home (PATH4HIP): a protocol for a mixed method study.
35690813|a|BACKGROUND: Hip fractures in older adults are significant contributors to severe functional decline and disability as well as hospitalization and increased health care costs. Research shows that timely referral to geriatric rehabilitation leads to better patient outcomes. Currently, a wide variability in the timing, the frequency, and the choice of appropriate setting for rehabilitation of hip fracture patients exists. AIM: Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of PATH4HIP, a pathway intervention for timely transfer of post-operative geriatric hip fracture patients from hospital to rehabilitation to home. METHODS: This is a single-arm, pragmatic feasibility study to measure reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of PATH4HIP, a pathway for post-operative hip fracture patients from a large academic health science center to a geriatric rehabilitation service in Ottawa, Canada. During a 6-month period, all hip fracture patients, 65 years of age or older who have undergone surgery and have met the eligibility criteria (n = 96), will be transferred to the geriatric rehabilitation service no later than post-operative day 6. Patients (n = 10-12) and clinicians who are working on the orthopedic team (n = 10-12) and on the geriatric rehabilitation service (n = 10-12) will be invited to participate in an interview to share their feedback on the intervention's feasibility and acceptability and to provide suggestions to improve PATH4HIP. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize results of the quantitative data and content analysis will be used to analyze the qualitative data. The study will be open for recruitment from January to July 2022. DISCUSSION: If feasible, PATH4HIP will result in the reduction of the post-operative acute care length of stay to less than or equal to 6 days, while having no detrimental effect on rehabilitation outcomes such as functional gains, or discharge destination.
