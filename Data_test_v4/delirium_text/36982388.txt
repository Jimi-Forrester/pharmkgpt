36982388|t|Dietary Supplementation of Microbial Dextran and Inulin Exerts Hypocholesterolemic Effects and Modulates Gut Microbiota in BALB/c Mice Models.
36982388|a|Microbial exopolysaccharides (EPSs), having great structural diversity, have gained tremendous interest for their prebiotic effects. In the present study, mice models were used to investigate if microbial dextran and inulin-type EPSs could also play role in the modulation of microbiomics and metabolomics by improving certain biochemical parameters, such as blood cholesterol and glucose levels and weight gain. Feeding the mice for 21 days on EPS-supplemented feed resulted in only 7.6 +- 0.8% weight gain in the inulin-fed mice group, while the dextran-fed group also showed a low weight gain trend as compared to the control group. Blood glucose levels of the dextran- and inulin-fed groups did not change significantly in comparison with the control where it increased by 22 +- 5%. Moreover, the dextran and inulin exerted pronounced hypocholesterolemic effects by reducing the serum cholesterol levels by 23% and 13%, respectively. The control group was found to be mainly populated with Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus gallinarum, Mammaliicoccus lentus and Klebsiella aerogenes. The colonization of E. faecalis was inhibited by 59-65% while the intestinal release of Escherichia fergusonii was increased by 85-95% in the EPS-supplemented groups, respectively, along with the complete inhibition of growth of other enteropathogens. Additionally, higher populations of lactic acid bacteria were detected in the intestine of EPS-fed mice as compared to controls.
