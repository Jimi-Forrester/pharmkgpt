32134994|a|A fundamental question in herpes simplex virus (HSV) pathogenesis is the consequence of viral reactivation to the neuron. Evidence supporting both post-reactivation survival and demise is published. The exceedingly rare nature of this event at the neuronal level in the sensory ganglion has limited direct examination of this important question. In this study, an in-depth in vivo analysis of the resolution of reactivation was undertaken. Latently infected C57BL/6 mice were induced to reactivate in vivo by hyperthermic stress. Infectious virus was detected in a high percentage (60-80%) of the trigeminal ganglia from these mice at 20 hours post-reactivation stimulus, but declined by 48 hours post-stimulus (0-13%). With increasing time post-reactivation stimulus, the percentage of reactivating neurons surrounded by a cellular cuff increased, which correlated with a decrease in detectable infectious virus and number of viral protein positive neurons. Importantly, in addition to intact viral protein positive neurons, fragmented viral protein positive neurons morphologically consistent with apoptotic bodies and containing cleaved caspase-3 were detected. The frequency of this phenotype increased through time post-reactivation. These fragmented neurons were surrounded by Iba1+ cells, consistent with phagocytic removal of dead neurons. Evidence of neuronal destruction post-reactivation prompted re-examination of the previously reported non-cytolytic role of T cells in controlling reactivation. Latently infected mice were treated with anti-CD4/CD8 antibodies prior to induced reactivation. Neither infectious virus titers nor neuronal fragmentation were altered. In contrast, when viral DNA replication was blocked during reactivation, fragmentation was not observed even though viral proteins were expressed. Our data demonstrate that at least a portion of reactivating neurons are destroyed. Although no evidence for direct T cell mediated antigen recognition in this process was apparent, inhibition of viral DNA replication blocked neuronal fragmentation. These unexpected findings raise new questions about the resolution of HSV reactivation in the host nervous system.
