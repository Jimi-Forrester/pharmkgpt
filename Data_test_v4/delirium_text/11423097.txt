11423097|a|Overproduction of the peptide amyloid beta (A beta) is a critical event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Systemic administration of 3 M1-selective muscarinic agonists, AF102B, AF150S and AF267B, decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A beta concentrations; levels of CSF secreted beta-APP were not significantly altered. Rabbits treated for 5 days with s.c. injections of each drug (2 mg/kg/day) had levels of CSF A beta which were between 55 and 71% of control for A beta 1-40 and between 59 and 84% of control for A beta 1--42.
