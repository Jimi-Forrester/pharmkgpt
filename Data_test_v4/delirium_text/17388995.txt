17388995|t|Cognitive and behavioural predictors of progression rates in Alzheimer's disease.
17388995|a|Cognitive and functional decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may show different, yet correlated, rates of progression. Over a 2-year period we investigated the predictive role of neuropsychological and behavioural variables on the cognitive and functional decline of 43 patients with AD. Slow and fast decliners were defined on the basis of cognitive and functional indexes of disease progression. We found that cognitive decline was predicted by diffuse cognitive impairment and functional progression by visuospatial deficits. Psychotic symptoms predicted faster disease progression in both cognitive and functional dimensions.
