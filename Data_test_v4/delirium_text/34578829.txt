34578829|t|Trehalose Reduces Nerve Injury Induced Nociception in Mice but Negatively Affects Alertness.
34578829|a|Trehalose, a sugar from fungi, mimics starvation due to a block of glucose transport and induces Transcription Factor EB- mediated autophagy, likely supported by the upregulation of progranulin. The pro-autophagy effects help to remove pathological proteins and thereby prevent neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Enhancing autophagy also contributes to the resolution of neuropathic pain in mice. Therefore, we here assessed the effects of continuous trehalose administration via drinking water using the mouse Spared Nerve Injury model of neuropathic pain. Trehalose had no effect on drinking, feeding, voluntary wheel running, motor coordination, locomotion, and open field, elevated plus maze, and Barnes Maze behavior, showing that it was well tolerated. However, trehalose reduced nerve injury-evoked nociceptive mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity as compared to vehicle. Trehalose had no effect on calcium currents in primary somatosensory neurons, pointing to central mechanisms of the antinociceptive effects. In IntelliCages, trehalose-treated mice showed reduced activity, in particular, a low frequency of nosepokes, which was associated with a reduced proportion of correct trials and flat learning curves in place preference learning tasks. Mice failed to switch corner preferences and stuck to spontaneously preferred corners. The behavior in IntelliCages is suggestive of sedative effects as a "side effect" of a continuous protracted trehalose treatment, leading to impairment of learning flexibility. Hence, trehalose diet supplements might reduce chronic pain but likely at the expense of alertness.
