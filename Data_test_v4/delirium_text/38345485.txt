38345485|a|OBJECTIVES: This study compared adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and those without diabetes (ND) from East London in terms of sociodemographic characteristics, oral health behaviors, dietary practices, and alcohol and tobacco-related habits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 182 participants (n = 91 for each group) were recruited and requested to complete the validated questionnaire with 33 items. RESULTS: Results showed that the mean +- SD age was 61 +- 11.7 in the T2DM, while 51 +- 11.2 in the ND group. The mean +- SD age at T2DM diagnosis was 43 +- 10. There was a significant gender difference, with more males in the T2DM group (67.7%) and more females in the ND group (64.8%). Asian-British (38.4%) were significantly high in the T2DM group when compared to other ethnicities. 92.3% of T2DM participants were significantly more likely to use medications in comparison to the ND group (29.7%). The T2DM participants' personal statements on general health were fair (34%) and good (46.2%) when compared with the ND group (15.4% and 59.3%, respectively). The majority of T2DM and ND participants (98%) lacked dental insurance. In the T2DM group, 31.8% were receiving benefits, and 39.5% were retired, while 46% of the ND group were full-time employees. Tooth brushing twice a day was slightly less common in T2DM (68%) when compared to the ND group (78%). Nearly half of the participants in both groups failed to carry out interdental cleaning (T2DM = 52%; ND = 47%), and 38.5% of the T2DM group used mouthwash occasionally, while 30% of the ND group had it twice daily. There was a weak association between chewing paan and annual income in ND participants (r = .90, p = .49). There were significant differences in the presence of removable prostheses, juice, and sweetened juice consumptions between the two groups (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Within the confines of this study, being male, Asian British, retired due to disability, polypharmacy, and the presence of removable prostheses were all significant factors for T2DM.
