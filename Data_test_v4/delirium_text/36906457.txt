36906457|t|Beyond the amyloid cascade: An update of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.
36906457|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multi-etiology disease. The biological system of AD is associated with multidomain genetic, molecular, cellular, and network brain dysfunctions, interacting with central and peripheral immunity. These dysfunctions have been primarily conceptualized according to the assumption that amyloid deposition in the brain, whether from a stochastic or a genetic accident, is the upstream pathological change. However, the arborescence of AD pathological changes suggests that a single amyloid pathway might be too restrictive or inconsistent with a cascading effect. In this review, we discuss the recent human studies of late-onset AD pathophysiology in an attempt to establish a general updated view focusing on the early stages. Several factors highlight heterogenous multi-cellular pathological changes in AD, which seem to work in a self-amplifying manner with amyloid and tau pathologies. Neuroinflammation has an increasing importance as a major pathological driver, and perhaps as a convergent biological basis of aging, genetic, lifestyle and environmental risk factors.
