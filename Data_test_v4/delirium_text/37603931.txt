37603931|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is preceded by years of silent pathological change. Our objective was to examine the associations between modifiable dementia risk factors, cognition, and plasma phosphorylated p-tau 181, a hallmark biomarker of AD in a large-scale community cohort. Participants (n = 738, mean age 65.41 years) from the Island Study Linking Ageing and Neurodegenerative Disease responded to online assessments collecting demographics, adherence to dementia risk factors and cognitive function, and provided a blood sample for analysis. We found less education was significantly associated with lower cognitive scores. Modifiable dementia risk factors were not associated with plasma p-tau 181. Further, we did not observe any significant relationships between plasma p-tau 181 and cognition. Nonmodifiable factors such as age, education, sex, and apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 displayed significant associations with cognition and plasma p-tau 181. In a cognitively healthy community cohort of Tasmanian Australians, we did not observe any associations between modifiable risk factors for dementia and plasma p-tau 181. Nonmodifiable risk factors were associated with both cognition and plasma p-tau. This contributes to a growing body of evidence investigating confounding factors in the interpretation of blood-based biomarkers for dementia.
