36724611|a|Neuronal apoptosis has been found to have a pivotal role in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Berberine (BBR), a potent antioxidant, occurs in plants such as Berberis, Phellodendron chinense, and Hydrastis canadensis. In this study, a neuronal apoptotic model was established in vitro using HT22 cells induced by Abeta25-35 to explore whether BBR contributes to protecting neurons against Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity, as well as its potential mechanisms. BBR was applied to HT22 cells for 1 h prior to exposing the cells to Abeta25-35 for 24 h. A CCK-8 assay was utilized to assess cell viability, and Annexin V - fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide and Hoechst 33342 fluorescence staining were used to measure the rate of cell apoptosis. Existing scientific literature was also reviewed to further determine the effects of BBR on ROS production and mitochondrial function in HT22 cells. Furthermore, the expressions of proteins, including cytochrome C, cleaved caspase-3, p-p65, p65, and Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant axis were assessed by Western blotting. The data indicated that BBR markedly improved cell viability, inhibited apoptosis and intracellular ROS levels, improved mitochondrial membrane potentials, decreased the rate of p-p65/p65, cytochrome C, and cleaved caspase-3, and intensified the activity of Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidants in HT22 cells. Overall, the findings indicated that BBR provides a certain level of neuroprotectiveness in HT22 cells exposed to Abeta25-35 via relieving oxidative stress, as well as by restraining the mitochondrial pathway of cellular apoptosis. In addition, the restraint of NF-kappaB activity and sensitization of the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant axis, which together are intimately involved in the neuroprotection of BBR, may be possible mechanisms accounting for its effectiveness against Abeta25-35in vitro.
