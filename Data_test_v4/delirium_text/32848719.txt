32848719|t|CYP2D6 Genotype-Based Dose Recommendations for Risperidone in Asian People.
32848719|a|The aim of this study was to provide dose recommendations for risperidone in Asian people based on cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 genotype. First, we investigated the influence of CYP2D6 polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Then, we performed a search for studies covering the relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters of risperidone and CYP2D6 genotype. Pooled pharmacokinetic parameters were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model. Lastly, we calculated the dose adjustment for risperidone based on CYP2D6 genotype for white and Asian people. Significant differences between the extensive metabolizer and intermediate metabolizer groups were observed for dose-adjusted risperidone level, 9-hydroxyrisperidone level, and risperidone/9-hydroxyrisperidone ratio, but not for the total active moiety. Meta-analysis showed that significant differences were observed among the four phenotype groups, including steady state concentration, peak risperidone concentration, and the area under the curve, using the Kruskal-Wallis test. No differences were found in oral clearance. For risperidone, dose recommendations for poor and ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 for Asians were different compared to that for white people for poor metabolizers (dose adjustment around 45% for white people, while for Asians the risperidone dose should be reduced by 26%). For ultrarapid metabolizers, risperidone dose should be increased by about 33% for white people and 30% for Asians. This was a first attempt to apply pharmacogenetics to suggest dose-regimens for Asian people; further research to replicate and extend these findings is recommended.
