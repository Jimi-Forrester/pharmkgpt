39364738|a|Adipose tissue engraftment has become a promising strategy in the field of regenerative surgery; however, there are notable challenges associated with it, such as resorption of 50-90% of the transplanted fat or cyst formation due to fat necrosis after fat transplantation. Therefore, identifying novel materials or methods to improve the engraftment efficiency is crucial. The present study investigated the effects of nervonic acid (NA), a monounsaturated very long-chain fatty acid, on adipogenesis and fat transplantation, as well as its underlying mechanisms. To assess this, NA was used to treat cells during adipogenesis in vitro, and the expression levels of markers, including PPARgamma and CEBPalpha, and signaling molecules were detected through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. In addition, NA was mixed with fat grafts in in vivo fat transplantation, followed by analysis through Oil Red O staining, hematoxylin & eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. It was demonstrated that NA treatment accelerated adipogenesis through activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway and inhibition of Wnt signaling. NA treatment enriched the expression of Akt/mTOR signaling-related genes, and increased the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and fat differentiation in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Additionally, NA effectively improved the outcome of adipose tissue engraftment in mice. Treatment of grafts with NA at transplantation reduced the resorption of transplanted fat and increased the proportion of perilipin-1+ adipocytes with a lower portion of vacuoles in mice. Moreover, the NA-treated group exhibited a reduced pro-inflammatory response and had more CD31+ vessel structures, which were relatively evenly distributed among viable adipocytes, facilitating successful engraftment. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that NA may not only stimulate adipogenesis by regulating signaling pathways in human MSCs, but could improve the outcome of fat transplantation by reducing inflammation and stimulating angiogenesis. It was thus hypothesized that NA could serve as an adjuvant strategy to enhance fat engraftment in regenerative surgery.
