37168444|t|Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy for Huntington Disease: A Meta-Analysis.
37168444|a|Objective: Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy has been explored in Huntington disease (HD) as a potential therapeutic approach; however, a complete synthesis of these results is lacking. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of MSCs on HD. Method: Eligible studies published before November 2022 were screened from Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and Cochrane in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. ClinicalTrial.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were also searched for registered clinical trials. The outcomes in rodent studies evaluated included morphological changes (striatal volume and ventricular volume), motor function (rotarod test, wire hang test, grip strength test, limb-clasping test, apomorphine-induced rotation test, and neuromuscular electromyography activity), cognition (Morris water maze test), and body weight. Result: The initial search returned 362 records, of which 15 studies incorporating 346 HD rodents were eligible for meta-analysis. Larger striatal and smaller ventricular volumes were observed in MSC-treated animals compared to controls. MSCs transplanted before the occurrence of motor dysfunction rescued the motor incoordination of HD. Among different MSC sources, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were the most investigated cells and were effective in improving motor coordination. MSC therapy improved muscle strength, neuromuscular electromyography activity, cortex-related motor function, and striatum-related motor function, while cognition was not changed. The body weight of male HD rodents increased after MSC transplantation, while that of females was not affected. Conclusion: Meta-analysis showed a positive effect of MSCs on HD rodents overall, as reflected in morphological changes, motor coordination, muscle strength, neuromuscular electromyography activity, cortex-related motor function, and striatum-related motor function, while cognition was not changed by MSC therapy.
