38396950|t|Factor H's Control of Complement Activation Emerges as a Significant and Promising Therapeutic Target for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.
38396950|a|The complement is a component of the innate immune system designed to fight infections and tissue- or age-related damages. Complement activation creates an inflammatory microenvironment, which enhances cell death. Excessive complement inflammatory activity has been linked to alterations in the structure and functions of the blood-brain barrier, contributing to a poor prognosis for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the AD preclinical phase, individuals are often clinically asymptomatic despite evidence of AD neuropathology coupled with heightened inflammation. Considering the involvement of the complement system in the risk of developing AD, we hypothesize that inhibiting complement activation could reduce this inflammatory period observed even before clinical signs, thereby slowing down the onset/progression of AD. To validate our hypothesis, we injected complement inhibitor factor H into the brain of APP/PS1 AD mice at early or late stages of this pathology. Our results showed that the injection of factor H had effects on both the onset and progression of AD by reducing proinflammatory IL6, TNF-alpha, IL1beta, MAC and amyloid beta levels. This reduction was associated with an increase in VGLUT1 and Psd95 synaptic transmission in the hippocampal region, leading to an improvement in cognitive functions. This study invites a reconsideration of factor H's therapeutic potential for AD treatment.
