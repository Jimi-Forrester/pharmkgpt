39227030|t|A combined tropical medicine and psychiatry approach to patients with possible delusional infestation.
39227030|a|BACKGROUND: Delusional infestation (DI) is a well-recognized delusional disorder presenting as the persisting belief of being infested. Combined clinics have been run by dermatology and psychiatry in a small number of centres. In this article we focus on our Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust clinic hosted at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, UK, where we run a specialist clinic for DI. METHODS: We describe the specific set-up and approach of our clinic as a guide for clinicians working in specialties likely to see patients with DI (including tropical medicine, infectious diseases and dermatology) who may either want to set up similar clinics or be better equipped to manage DI patients promptly within existing practice. RESULTS: We describe the details of the clinic's approach. Between 2018 and 2023, the service saw 208 patients, of which 82.7% could be assessed and 55.7% had DI. The female:male ratio was 2:1. CONCLUSION: Interdisciplinary combined clinics with medical and psychiatry consultants working together offer an approach to managing this rare, challenging and high-consequence condition.
