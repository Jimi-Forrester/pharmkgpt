31541786|a|Soft material fabricated with DNA origami or peptide cross-linking technique may be promising theranostic platforms in the future; however, their naturally occurring counterparts, such as the peptide aggregates in the neurodegenerative diseases, constitute an increasingly burdensome issue of public health. Thus, a design of artificial peptide nano-network biosensor is conceived, in an attempt to combat the natural pathological peptides, by mimicking their pathogenesis process. Specifically, periphery platelet can secrete A-beta and induce its cross-linking & aggregation to form a surface peptide nano-network, resulting in large numbers of poly-tyrosine strands being covalently trapped in the network to serve as an efficient signal amplifier, through the electrochemical oxidation of tyrosine. This method is sensitive and quantitative in the range of normal and pathological periphery platelet distribution and can effectively discriminate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients based on the detected potential neurodegenerative activity of platelet. These results may point to some future perspective of this method in the early screening of AD.
