33487891|t|Awake ECMO and mobilizing patients on ECMO.
33487891|a|Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a lifesaving technology in critically ill patients who present with cardiac/pulmonary/combined cardiopulmonary failure. These patients are the sickest of all patients in any critical care unit and will invariably have a prolonged course and rehabilitation. Spontaneous breathing and early mobilization can reduce the intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness, improve functional recovery, and reduce superadded infections and length of stay in the hospital, thus decreasing the cost of treatment. In low socioeconomic countries, there is an associated challenge of the availability of specially trained personnel necessary to manage patients on ECMO. Managing and ambulating an awake patient on ECMO is very labour-intensive and poses various challenges. Every ECMO program should aim to develop goals, methods, and protocols to this end. These can be derived from best practices worldwide by suitably adapting to available personnel and equipment. In this review, we aim to highlight the advantages and associated challenges of awake ECMO and describe protocols to aid safe ambulation and physiotherapy for ECMO patients.
