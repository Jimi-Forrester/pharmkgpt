37464822|a|BACKGROUND: Nanoscience and nanotechnology have resulted in the continuous development of new nanomaterials with remarkable properties that make them appealing for pharmaceutical applications. The biocompatibility of metallic nanoparticles is of increasing interest for research scientists currently working towards developing novel nano-based medicines, industrial chemicals, and antigens. There is also a particular interest in using them to counter mutations that up-regulate inflammation enhancers to produce a range of inflammation-related pathologies. AIM: The following review discusses the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of metallic bioconjugated (silver, gold, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and selenium) nanoparticles. The current study focuses on nanoparticle manufacturing technologies and the inflammatory response. METHODOLOGY: A thorough search was conducted in several databases, including Scopus, Embase, Cochrane, and PubMed. The search terms used included: Alzheimer's disease, mechanism of action, neuroinflammation, the reaction of Mast cells to stress and neuroinflammation. The study included all publications published in English. RESULTS: Green-synthesised nanoparticles can suppress the NF-B and cyclooxygenase-2 pathways, preventing the production of proinflammatory cytokines and ROS scavenging mechanisms. Metallic nanoparticles with anti-inflammatory properties, such as stability and specific targeting, have been briefly discussed. CONCLUSION: The current research focuses on metallic nanoparticles employed as anti-inflammatory medication molecules, although nanoparticles have applications in various areas (medicine, chemical engineering, and agriculture). Nanoparticles have a large surface-to-volume ratio, which can help them to penetrate cell membranes, and because of their solid ligand-binding capabilities, nanoparticles have been used in the medical treatment of inflammatory pathologies.
