2443230|t|Psychosocial aspects of cancer in the elderly.
2443230|a|Patients often present for evaluation of a suspicious cancer symptom after a delay. They appear to tolerate cancer treatment as well as younger patients, and, in studies comparing them on psychosocial parameters of adaptation, they appear to adjust better than younger patients. Attention to pre-existing social problems or psychiatric disorder (eg, alcoholism or depression) is necessary when physicians start treatment for cancer. Elderly patients have a greater tendency to develop delirium; cautious use of psychotropic medications is indicated. Management of the older patient during active treatment, palliative and terminal care, and when a remission is accomplished is both challenging and rewarding.
