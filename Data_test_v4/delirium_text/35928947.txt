35928947|t|Immobilization of Superoxide Dismutase in Mesoporous Silica and its Applications in Strengthening the Lifespan and Healthspan of Caenorhabditis elegans.
35928947|a|Senescence is a major inductive factor of aging-related diseases in connection with an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, it is important to maintain ROS at an appropriate level to keep homeostasis in organisms. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a vital enzyme in defending against oxidative damage in vivo. Because of the defects in the direct application of SOD and SOD mimics, mounting delivery systems have been developed for the efficient applications of SOD to realize antioxidant treatment. Among these systems, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have been widely studied because of various advantages such as desirable stability, low toxicity, and adjustable particle sizes. Herein, SOD was immobilized on MSNs using a physical absorption strategy to construct the nanosystem SOD@MSN. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) was selected as the model organism for the subsequent antioxidant and anti-aging studies. The research results suggested the nanosystem could not only be effectively internalized by C. elegans but could also protect the nematode against external stress, thus extending the lifespan and healthspan of C. elegans. Therefore, SOD@MSN could be applied as a promising medicine in anti-aging therapeutics.
