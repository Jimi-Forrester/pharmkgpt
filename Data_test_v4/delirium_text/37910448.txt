37910448|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium, an acute confusional state highlighted by inattention, has been reported to occur in 10 to 50% of COVID-19 patients. People hospitalized with COVID-19 have been noted to present with or develop delirium and neurocognitive disorders. Caring for patients with delirium is associated with more burden for nurses, clinicians, and caregivers. Using information in Electronic Health Record (EHR) data to recognize delirium and possibly COVID-19 could lead to earlier treatment of the underlying viral infection and improve outcomes in clinical and healthcare systems cost per patient. Clinical data repositories can further support rapid discovery through cohort identification tools, such as the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) tool. OBJECTIVE: The specific aim of this research was to investigate delirium in hospitalized older adults as a possible presenting symptom in COVID-19 using a data repository to identify neurocognitive disorders with a novel group of ICD-10 codes. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed data from two catchment areas with different demographics. The first catchment area (seven counties in the North-Central Florida) is predominantly rural while the second catchment area (one county in North Florida) is predominantly urban. The i2b2 data repository was queried for COVID-19 patients admitted to inpatient units via ED within the health center during the period between 01-APR-2020 and 01-APR-2022. COVID-19 patients were identified by having a positive result of a COVID-19 lab test or having a diagnosis U07.1. We identified neurocognitive disorders as delirium or encephalopathy, using ICD-10 codes. RESULTS: Slightly less than one-third of COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with a co-occurring neurocognitive disorder. A neurocognitive disorder was present on admission (PoA) for 15.8% of all COVID-19 patients admitted through the ED. Among patients with both COVID-19 and a neurocognitive disorder, 56.9% were 65 years or older, a significantly higher proportion than those with no neurocognitive disorder. The proportion of patients younger than 65 years was significantly higher among patients diagnosed with encephalopathy only compared with patients diagnosed with delirium only and both delirium and encephalopathy. Most COVID-19 patients admitted through the ED during our study period were admitted during the Delta variant peak. CONCLUSIONS: The data collected demonstrated that an increased number of older patients with neurocognitive disorder present on admission were infected with COVID-19. Knowing that delirium increases the staffing, nursing care needs, hospital resources used, and the length of stay as previously noted, identifying delirium early may benefit hospital administration when planning for newly anticipated COVID-19 surges. A robust and accessible data repository, such as the one used in this study, can provide invaluable support to clinicians and clinical administrators in such resource reallocation and clinical decision-making.
