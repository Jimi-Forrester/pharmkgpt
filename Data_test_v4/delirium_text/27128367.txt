27128367|a|This work was performed to test our hypothesis that angiotensin-(1-7) can ameliorate cognitive impairment and cerebrovascular reactivity in 5XFAD mice, a useful model of Alzheimer's disease. 5XFAD mice received intracerebroventricular infusion of (1) vehicle, (2) angiotensin-(1-7), or (3) angiotensin-(1-7)+A779, a specific Mas receptor antagonist, for 4 weeks. Angiotensin-(1-7), through Mas receptor, significantly ameliorated cognitive impairment in 5XFAD mice. As estimated by acetazolamide-induced increase in cerebral blood flow, angiotensin-(1-7), through Mas receptor, enhanced cerebrovascular reactivity in 5XFAD mice. In conclusion, angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis improves cognitive function and cerebrovascular function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
