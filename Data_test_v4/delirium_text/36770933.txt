36770933|t|Autoxidation Kinetics of Tetrahydrobiopterin-Giving Quinonoid Dihydrobiopterin the Consideration It Deserves.
36770933|a|In humans, tetrahydrobiopterin (H4Bip) is the cofactor of several essential hydroxylation reactions which dysfunction cause very serious diseases at any age. Hence, the determination of pterins in biological media is of outmost importance in the diagnosis and monitoring of H4Bip deficiency. More than half a century after the discovery of the physiological role of H4Bip and the recent advent of gene therapy for dopamine and serotonin disorders linked to H4Bip deficiency, the quantification of quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (qH2Bip), the transient intermediate of H4Bip, has not been considered yet. This is mainly due to its short half-life, which goes from 0.9 to 5 min according to previous studies. Based on our recent disclosure of the specific MS/MS transition of qH2Bip, here, we developed an efficient HPLC-MS/MS method to achieve the separation of qH2Bip from H4Bip and other oxidation products in less than 3.5 min. The application of this method to the investigation of H4Bip autoxidation kinetics clearly shows that qH2Bip's half-life is much longer than previously reported, and mostly longer than that of H4Bip, irrespective of the considered experimental conditions. These findings definitely confirm that an accurate method of H4Bip analysis should include the quantification of qH2Bip.
