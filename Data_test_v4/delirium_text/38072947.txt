38072947|a|BACKGROUND: The regulation of dose-dependent biological effects induced by biodegradation is a challenge for the production of biodegradable bone-substitute materials, especially biodegradable zinc (Zn) -based materials. Cytotoxicity caused by excess local Zn ions (Zn2+) from degradation is one of the factors limiting the wide application of Zn implants. Given that previous studies have revealed that delayed degradation of Zn materials by surface modification does not reduce cytotoxicity; in the present study, we explore whether preventing the entry of excess Zn2+ into cells may can reduce local Zn toxicity by applying Psoralen (PRL) to Zn implants and assessing its ability to regulate intracellular Zn2+ concentrations. METHODS: The effects of different concentrations of Zn2+ on cellular activity and cytotoxicity were investigated; briefly, we identified natural compounds that regulate Zn transporters, thereby regulating the concentrations of intracellular Zn2+, and applied them to Zn materials. Of these materials, PRL, a natural, tricyclic, coumarin-like aromatic compound that promotes the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts and enhances osteogenic activity, was loaded onto the surface of a Zn material using peptides and chitosan (CS), and the surface characteristics, electrochemical properties, and activity of the modified Zn material were evaluated. In addition, the ability of Zn + CS/pPRL implants to promote bone formation and accelerate large-scale bone defect repairs was assessed both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We determined that 180 microM Zn2+ significantly induced pre-osteoblast cytotoxicity, and a 23-fold increase in Zrt- and Irt-like protein 4 (ZIP4) expression. We also found that PRL dynamically regulates the expression of ZIP4 in response to Zn2+ concentration. To address the problem of cytotoxicity caused by excessive Zn2+ in local Zn implants, PRL was loaded onto the surface of Zn implants in vivo using peptides and CS, which dynamically regulated ZIP4 levels, maintained the balance of intracellular Zn2+ concentrations, and enhanced the osteogenic activity of Zn implants. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the importance of Zn2+ concentration when using Zn materials to promote bone formation and introduces a natural active ingredient, PRL, that can regulate intracellular Zn2+ levels, and thus may be clinically applicable to Zn implants for the treatment of critical bone defects.
