33137152|a|Ceramides, a type of sphingolipid, are cell membrane components and lipid mediators that modulate a variety of cell functions. In plants, ceramides are mostly present in a glucosylated glucosylceramide (GlcCer) form. We previously showed that oral administration of konjac-derived GlcCer to a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease reduced brain amyloid-beta and amyloid plaques. Dietary plant GlcCer compounds are absorbed as ceramides, but it is unclear whether they can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Herein, we evaluated the BBB permeability of synthetic plant-type ceramides (4, 8-sphingadienine, d18:2) using mouse and BBB cell culture models, and found that they could permeate the BBB both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, administrated ceramides were partially metabolized to other sphingolipid species, namely sphingomyelin (SM) and GlcCer, while crossing the BBB. Thus, plant ceramides can cross the BBB, suggesting that ceramides and their metabolites might affect brain functions.
