36295626|t|Visual Hallucinations following Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting: A Prospective Study.
36295626|a|Background and Objectives: After major heart surgery, some patients report visual hallucinations that cannot be attributed to psychosis or delirium. This study aimed to investigate the hallucination incidence in patients after coronary artery bypass grafting with (on-pump) and without (off-pump) extracorporeal circulation. Materials and Methods: A total of 184 consecutive patients listed for elective on- or off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting were prospectively enrolled into the study. Preoperative baseline investigations 24-48 h before surgery (t0) and postoperative follow-up 24-48 h (t1) and 5-6 days (t2) after surgery included cognitive testing and a clinical visual acuity test (Landolt rings). Patients reporting visual hallucinations were interviewed using a structured survey to record the type, timing, duration, and frequency of their hallucinations. All the patients received a neurological examination and cranial magnetic resonance imaging if indicated. Results: Of the patients in the sample, 155 patients underwent on-pump bypass surgery, and 29 patients received off-pump surgery. Of these, 25 patients in the on-pump group, but none in the off-pump group, reported transient visual hallucinations (p = 0.020), which could not be attributed to stroke, delirium, psychosis, migraine, or severely impaired vision. Significant correlations were observed for the occurrence of visual hallucinations and the amount of nicotine consumption and aortic clamp/extracorporeal circulation time. Conclusions: Transient visual hallucinations occur in a noticeable proportion of patients after on-pump heart surgery. Knowledge of the phenomenon's benignity is important for patients to prevent anxiety and uncertainty and for treating physicians to avoid unnecessary medication and drug-induced delirium.
