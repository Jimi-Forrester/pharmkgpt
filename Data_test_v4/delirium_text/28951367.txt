28951367|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the protective effect of butylphthalide in a cell model of Alzheimer's disease(AD) induced by Abeta25-35 in Neuro 2a (N2a) cells. METHODS: N2a cells were divided into AD group, butylphthalide (NBP) group and control group. AD cell model was established by adding 20 micromol/L Abeta25-35 to cultured N2a cells. The cells in NBP group were treated with 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 micromol/L NBP 4 h prior to treatment with 20 micromol/L Abeta25-35. The cell viability were determined by MTT assay, the cell apoptotic rate were detected by AnnexinV-FITC flow cytometry, and the cell morphological changes were observed under inverted phase contrast microscope. The expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA were determined by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Compared with those in the control group, the number of adherent cells was significantly decreased, neurite structures were reduced, and the cell viability was decreased, while the apoptotic rate and expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA were increased in AD group (P<0.05). Compared with that in AD group, the number of adherent cells was increased in NBP group and the cell morphology was similar to the normal control cells. The cell viability of N2a cells was increased in NBP group with decreased apoptotic rate and expression of TNF-alphaand IL-1beta mRNA (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Butylphthalide can protect against AD in the cell model induced by Abeta25-35 possibly by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory cytokines.
