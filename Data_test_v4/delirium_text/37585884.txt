37585884|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to correlate oral and general health in frail and non-frail older adults. METHODS: This observational study included 52 older adults, of whom 35 were frail (Frail Group), and 17 were non-frail (Non-Frail Group), according to Fried's self-reported test addressing oral health variables, number of systemic diseases, and medications in use. The geriatric oral health assessment index was used to assess the oral hygiene of the groups. RESULTS: The number of preserved teeth in dentulous older adults was significantly higher in the Non-Frail Group (p=0.048). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in the use of dental prostheses or in the detection of soft tissue lesions. Overall, 74.3% of the Frail Group had a "bad" geriatric oral health index score, which significantly differed from that of the Non-Frail Group (p=0.045). The numbers of systemic diseases and medicines used were higher in the Frail Group than in the Non-Frail Group (p<0.001), demonstrating the pathophysiological characteristics of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in frailty syndrome. CONCLUSION: The results showed a clear correlation between oral and general health conditions and frailty syndrome.
