35145662|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep quality refers to a sense of being refreshed and rested after waking up from sleep. Postoperative patients were vulnerable to poor sleep quality due to having different contributing factors. The prevalence of poor sleep quality among postsurgical patients was left undisclosed in our study setting. Knowing the prevalence and contributing factors for poor sleep quality helps us to develop a strategic plan for prevention and management. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A multicenter cross-sectional study design was conducted on 424 postsurgical patients who were selected by a systematic random sampling method. Data was collected using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index by a face-to-face interview. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 25. For categorical data, a chi-square test was done. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed to determine whether each of the independent variables is associated with the outcome variable. RESULT: Based on this study result, the prevalence of poor sleep quality was 64.9%. Among the factors included in this study, variables which had an association with poor postoperative sleep quality were age range 25-54 years (AOR = 15.13), male gender (AOR = 4.81), educational level of secondary school (AOR = 6.29), patient income less than 2500 birr (AOR = 3.77), anxiety (AOR = 2.53), depression(AOR = 22.8), light exposure(AOR = 19.60), poor social support (AOR = 1.98), being emergency surgery (AOR = 2.46) and having a history of moderate to severe pain (AOR = 38.18, (95% CI). CONCLUSION: Poor sleep quality among adult post-surgical patients was significantly high in Amhara regional comprehensive referral hospitals. Therefore; Clinicians need to prioritize postoperative sleep quality assessment and needs to minimize factors inducing postoperative sleep disturbances.
