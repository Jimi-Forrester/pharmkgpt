35714473|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disorder that leads to dementia i.e., progressive memory loss accompanied with worsening of thinking ability of an individual. The cause of AD is not fully understood but it progresses with age where brain cells gradually die over time. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), currently 50 million people worldwide are affected by dementia and 60-70% of the cases belong to AD. Cumulative research over the past few decades have shown that molecules that act at a single target possess limited efficacy since these investigational drugs are not able to act against complex pathologies and thus do not provide permanent cure. Designing of multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs) appears to be more beneficial and a rational approach to treat chronic complex diseases including neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, MTDLs are being extensively researched by the medicinal chemists for the development of drugs for the treatment of various multifactorial diseases. Indole is one of the privileged scaffolds which is considered as an essential mediator between the gut-brain axis because of its neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, beta-amyloid anti-aggregation and antioxidant activities. Herein, we have reviewed the potential of some indole-hybrids acting at multiple targets in the pathogenesis of AD. We have reviewed research articles from the year 2014-2021 from various scientific databases and highlighted the synthetic strategies, mechanisms of neuroprotection, toxicity, structure activity relationships and molecular docking studies of various indole-hybrid derivatives. This literature review of published data on indole derivatives indicated that developing indole hybrids have improved the pharmacokinetic profile with lower toxicity, provided synergistic effect, helped to develop more potent compounds and prevented drug-drug interactions. It is evident that this class of compounds have potential to inhibit multiple enzymes targets involved in the pathogenesis of AD and therefore indole hybrids as MTDLs may play an important role in the development of anti-AD molecules.
