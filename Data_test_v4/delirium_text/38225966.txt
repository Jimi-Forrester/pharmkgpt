38225966|t|Effects of Virtual Reality Physical and Cognitive Training Intervention On Cognitive Abilities of Elders with Mild Cognitive Impairment.
38225966|a|Background: Virtual reality (VR) technology has become increasingly used for assessment and intervention in the neuroscience field. Objective: We aimed to investigate the effects of a VR Training System, named VRADA (VR Exercise App for Dementia and Alzheimer's Patients), on the cognitive functioning of older people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: In this intervention study, 122 older adults with MCI were randomly assigned to five groups (the VRADA group (n = 28), a bike group (n = 11), a physical exercise group (n = 24), a mixed group (physical and cognitive exercise) (n = 31), and a non-contact control group (n = 28). The VRADA group underwent 32 physical and cognitive training sessions, performed 2 or 3 times weekly for 12 weeks in the VR environment. All participants had detailed neuropsychological assessments before and after intervention. Results: A series of linear regression models revealed that the VRADA group showed improvement or no deterioration in cognitive decline in global cognitive function (MMSE), verbal memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test and WAIS forward test), and executive functions, mental flexibility (Trail Making Test B). Conclusions: This interventionstudy indicates that the VRADA system improves the cognitive function of elders with MCI.
