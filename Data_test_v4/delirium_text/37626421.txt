37626421|t|Translation dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases: a focus on ALS.
37626421|a|RNA translation is tightly controlled in eukaryotic cells to regulate gene expression and maintain proteome homeostasis. RNA binding proteins, translation factors, and cell signaling pathways all modulate the translation process. Defective translation is involved in multiple neurological diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and poses a major public health challenge worldwide. Over the past few years, tremendous advances have been made in the understanding of the genetics and pathogenesis of ALS. Dysfunction of RNA metabolisms, including RNA translation, has been closely associated with ALS. Here, we first introduce the general mechanisms of translational regulation under physiological and stress conditions and review well-known examples of translation defects in neurodegenerative diseases. We then focus on ALS-linked genes and discuss the recent progress on how translation is affected by various mutant genes and the repeat expansion-mediated non-canonical translation in ALS.
