38919441|a|Background and Aims: Squint surgery is a risk factor for postoperative vomiting (POV) in children. This study was designed to compare the incidence of POV in children undergoing strabismus surgery under balanced anesthesia with sevoflurane versus intravenous anesthesia with propofol. Material and Methods: In this prospective randomized controlled study conducted in a tertiary care ophthalmology hospital, 70 ASA I-II children aged 1-12 years undergoing strabismus surgery were randomized to two groups -Group S (sevoflurane-based anesthesia) and Group P (propofol-based anesthesia) for maintenance. The surgical details, intraoperative hemodynamic parameters, recovery characteristics, and emergence delirium were recorded. Any episode of postoperative vomiting in the 0-2 hours, 2-6 hours, and 6-24 hours period was noted. Rescue antiemetic was administered if there was more than one episode of vomiting. Results: Both the groups were similar with respect to demographic and surgical details. The average duration of surgery was 118.2 +- 41.88 min in group S and 137.32 +- 39.09 min in group P (P = .05). Four children in group S (11.4%) and one child in group P (2.9%) had POV in the first 24 hours but this was not statistically significant (P = .36). The median time to discharge from post anesthesia care unit was significantly less (P = .02) in the P group (50 min) than in the S group (60 min). Conclusion: Propofol-based anesthesia does not offer advantage over sevoflurane, in reducing POV after squint surgery, when dual prophylaxis with dexamethasone and ondansetron is administered. It, however, reduces the duration of stay in the post anesthesia care unit.
