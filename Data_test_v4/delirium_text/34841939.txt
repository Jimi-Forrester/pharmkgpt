34841939|t|Five-Year Outcomes After Implementing a Pain, Agitation, and Delirium Protocol in a Mixed Intensive Care Unit.
34841939|a|Objective: Assess for continued improvements in patient outcomes after updating our institutional sedation and analgesia protocol to include recommendations from the 2013 Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) Pain, Agitation, and Delirium (PAD) guidelines. Methods: Retrospective before-and-after study in a mixed medical/surgical intensive care unit (ICU) at an academic medical center. Mechanically ventilated adults admitted from September 1, 2011 through August 31, 2012 (pre-implementation) and October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2017 (post-implementation) were included. Measurements included number of mechanically ventilated patients, APACHE IV scores, age, type of patient (medical or surgical), admission diagnosis, ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, ventilator days, number of self-extubations, ICU mortality, ICU standardized mortality ratio, hospital mortality, hospital standardized mortality ratio, medication data including as needed (PRN) analgesic and sedative use, and analgesic and sedative infusions, and institutional savings. Results: Ventilator days (Pre-PAD = 4.0 vs. Year 5 post = 3.2, P < .0001), ICU LOS (Pre-PAD = 4.8 days vs. Year 5 post = 4.1 days, P = .0004) and hospital LOS (Pre-PAD = 14 days vs. Year 5 post = 12 days, P < .0001) decreased after protocol implementation. Hospital standardized mortality ratio (Pre-PAD = 0.69 vs. Year 5 post = 0.66) remained constant; while, APACHE IV scores (Pre-PAD = 77 vs. Year 5 post = 89, P < .0001) and number of intubated patients (Pre-PAD = 1146 vs. Year 5 post = 1468) increased over the study period. Using the decreased ICU and hospital LOS estimates, it is projected the institution saved $4.3 million over the 5 years since implementation. Conclusions: Implementation of an updated PAD protocol in a mixed medical/surgical ICU was associated with a significant decrease in ventilator time, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS without a change in the standardized mortality ratio over a five-year period. These favorable outcomes are associated with a significant cost savings for the institution.
