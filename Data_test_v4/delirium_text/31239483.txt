31239483|t|The Functional Mammalian CRES (Cystatin-Related Epididymal Spermatogenic) Amyloid is Antiparallel beta-Sheet Rich and Forms a Metastable Oligomer During Assembly.
31239483|a|An amyloid matrix composed of several family 2 cystatins, including the reproductive cystatin CRES, is an integral structure in the mouse epididymal lumen and has proposed functions in sperm maturation and protection. Understanding how CRES amyloid assembles in vitro may provide clues on how the epididymal amyloid matrix forms in vivo. We therefore purified full-length CRES under nondenaturing conditions and followed its aggregation from monomer to amyloid under conditions that may approximate those in the epididymal lumen. CRES transitioned into a metastable oligomer that was resistant to aggregation and only over extended time formed higher-ordered amyloids. High protein concentrations facilitated oligomer assembly and also were required to maintain the metastable state since following dilution the oligomer was no longer detected. Similar to other amyloid precursors, the formation of CRES amyloids correlated with a loss of alpha-helix and a gain of beta-sheet content. However, CRES is unique in that its amyloids are rich in antiparallel beta-sheets instead of the more common parallel beta-sheets. Taken together, our studies suggest that early metastable oligomers may serve as building blocks for functional amyloid assembly and further reveal that antiparallel beta-sheet-rich amyloids can be functional forms.
