15374219|t|Clinical subtypes of Alzheimer's disease.
15374219|a|The authors summarize the data of 60 patients of the Memory Clinic of the National Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology between 6 January 1992 and 6 June 1994 where the probable Alzheimer's disease (NINCDS-ADRDA) was diagnosed. It was examined whether it was possible to isolate homogenous subtypes based on clinical data. Interesting differences of tendency level could be demonstrated in the groups formed on the basis of data published in the literature. Differences of statistical significance level were as follows: occurrence of depression in the groups created on the basis of the patient age at the time of onset of the disease (early-late onset), and of alexia and autotopagnosia in the groups created on the basis of progression rate (slow - quick). The absence of epileptic seizures is extremely interesting. The authors' final conclusion is the following: the clinical symptoms unfortunately do not give sufficient possibility to form homogenous subtypes in the general frame of Alzheimer's disease.
