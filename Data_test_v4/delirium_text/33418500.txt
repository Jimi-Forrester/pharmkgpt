33418500|t|Transcription factor EB regulates cardiovascular homeostasis.
33418500|a|Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death and a major cause of disability globally. Transcription factor EB (TFEB), as a member of the microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) family, has been demonstrated to be a master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. Emerging studies suggest that TFEB regulates homeostasis in the cardiovascular system and shows beneficial effects on CVDs, including atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysm, postischemic angiogenesis, and cardiotoxicity, constituting a promising molecular target for the prevention and treatment of these diseases. Post-translational modifications regulate TFEB nuclear translocation and its transcriptional activity. Therapeutic strategies have been pursued to enhance TFEB activity and facilitate TFEB beneficial effects on CVDs. The elucidation of TFEB function and the precise underlying mechanisms will accelerate drug development and potential applications of TFEB drugs in the treatment of human diseases.
