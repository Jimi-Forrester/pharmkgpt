31213740|a|INTRODUCTION: Ingestion of acidic or alkaline substances and its long-term effects on digestive system indicates is a common health problem worldwide. To identify the root causes of injuries, standard data collection is required. AIM: The present study was conducted to determine the data requirements for the establishment of information management system for poisoning with acidic and alkaline substances in Iran. METHODS: This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study conducted in 2017. First, we attended at the hospitals affiliated to Iran, Tehran and Shahid Beheshti universities of medical sciences, which had poisoning wards; we studied all forms, reports and medical records of people who had been poisoned by acidic or alkaline substances. In the next step, a comprehensive literature review was carried out to retrieve related resources. Data were collected using data extraction form and Delphi method was used to survey them. Validity of the questionnaire was evaluated through content validity and its reliability checked by the test-retest method and Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS: A minimum data set (MDS) of alkaline and acid poisoning divided into two categories: administrative with three classes including 35 data elements, and clinical with 6 classes including 145 data elements. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive and uniform data elements about alkaline and acid poisoning was not available in Iran. Development of a MDS resulted in standardization and effective management of the data through providing uniform and comprehensive data elements for alkaline and acid poisoning and comparability of information in various levels and made effective decision-making and policy-making possible.
