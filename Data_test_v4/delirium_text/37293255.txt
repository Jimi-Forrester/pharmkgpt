37293255|a|Physical symptoms with normal clinical examinations have been reported without detectable structural or biochemical abnormalities in the comorbidity of somatic symptom disorder and major depressive disorder. This association can have a debilitating effect on their academic and social performance. This case report is about a 13-year-old Afghani immigrant boy with no previous psychiatric history who developed severe body pain leading to a disability during the COVID-19 lockdown and social isolation. During further evaluation, all his clinical examinations were normal, and the diagnosis of major depressive disorder and somatic symptom disorder was confirmed. Cognitive behavioral therapy includes cognitive therapy, changing lifestyle, and a motivational support method. Medical treatment with olanzapine, fluvoxamine, and gabapentin was started. During follow-up, there was improvement in the patient's mood, and the patient began to walk and communicate. It is important to suspect an association of somatic symptom disorder and major depressive disorder in patients with severe body pain and multiemotional factors. Psychiatrists should keep in mind that emotional factors can play a significant role in causing and maintaining physical symptoms.
