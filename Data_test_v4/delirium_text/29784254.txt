29784254|t|Evidence-Based Practice in Perianesthesia Nursing: Application of the American Geriatrics Society Clinical Practice Guideline for Postoperative Delirium in Older Adults.
29784254|a|Delirium is a pervasive and dangerous syndrome for older adults in the perianesthesia setting, occurring in up to 60% of surgical cases. The American Geriatrics Society performed a systematic review to develop recommendations for the prevention and management of postoperative delirium in older adults. The recommendations emphasize nonpharmacologic interventions with a strong focus on reducing the use of psychoactive medication. Perianesthesia nurses can serve as leaders in translating these recommendations into evidence-based practice at the bedside for older adults.
