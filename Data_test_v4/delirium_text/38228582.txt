38228582|a|Are lipid droplets (LDs) necessary to maintain the viability of brain tumour cells as they move to new nutrient-poor environments? In turn, could cancers be targeted by attacking what you might think of as the cancer cells' picnic basket? Lipid metabolism reprogramming, represented by increased lipid uptake, activation of de novo lipogenesis and increased lipid storage, is a newly identified hallmark of cancers. Recently, the presence of lipid droplets has been detected in several types of cancers, such as metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic and breast. LDs are storage organelles that provide a source of nutrients which may drive metastasis in different tumours. Currently, several roles of LDs have been posited in various tumours. This perspective aims to review and discuss the currently understood role of LDs in brain tumours.
