37770616|a|The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of diabetic retinopathy (DR) on longitudinal morphological changes in AMD-associated type 1 macular neovascularization using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). We enrolled fifty treatment-naive eyes with a diagnosis of exudative AMD and type 1 MNV. Twenty of 50 eyes were affected by mild DR. En face OCT angiography were examined for the MNV lesion area (mm2), the MNV flow area (mm2), the central macular thickness (CMT) and the BCVA. The OCTA acquisition was performed at the following visits: (i) before the loading phase (LP) of intravitreal injection of aflibercept (T1), and (ii) 1 month after the last intravitreal injection of loading phase comprising 3 monthly injections (T2). All morpho-functional parameters showed a significantly change at T2 compared to T1 values in both groups. Furthermore, we found a greater MNV area reduction after LP in eyes without DR (P = 0.023). With regard to the remaining parameters, no significant changes were found between two groups (P > 0.05). Our analysis revealed a less MNV area reduction after loading dose of anti-VEGF therapy in eyes affected by diabetic retinopathy.
