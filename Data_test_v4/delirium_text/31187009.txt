31187009|t|Delusional Parasitosis in a Patient with Alcohol-induced Psychotic Disorder.
31187009|a|Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder is a rare complication of chronic alcohol abuse following abrupt alcohol cessation that is characterized by visual, auditory, or tactile hallucinations paired with intact orientation and stable vital signs, distinguishing the condition from delirium tremens and psychotic disorders. The condition, first termed alcoholic hallucinosis, has been described in medical literature for over a century, however, its nosologic classification and psychopathologic characteristics are less well-documented. One such case of alcohol-induced psychotic disorder with multimodal hallucinations of four months duration is described here.
