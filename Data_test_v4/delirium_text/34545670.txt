34545670|a|Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) affect protein function/dysfunction, playing important roles in the occurrence and development of tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease. PTM detection is significant and still challenging due to the requirements of high sensitivity to identify the subtle structural differences between modifications. Herein, in terms of the unique geometry of the aerolysin (AeL) nanopore, we elaborately engineered a T232K AeL nanopore to detect the acetylation and phosphorylation of Tau segment (Pep). By replacing neutral threonine (T) with positively charged lysine (K) at the 232 sites, the T232K and K238 rings of this engineered T232K AeL nanopore corporately work together to enhance electrostatic trapping of the acetylated and phosphorylated Tau peptides. Translocation speed of the monophosphorylated Pep-P was decelerated by up to 46 folds compared to the wild-type (WT) AeL nanopore. The prolonged residences within the T232K AeL nanopore enabled to simultaneously identify the monoacetylated Pep-Ac, monophosphorylated Pep-P, di-modified Pep-P-Ac and non-modified Pep. The tremendous potential is demonstrated for PTM sensing by manipulating non-covalent interactions between nanopores and single analytes.
