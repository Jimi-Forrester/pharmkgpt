34754192|a|OBJECTIVE: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) triggers an inflammatory cascade that damages brain tissues and worsens functional outcome. S100A12 functions to promote brain inflammation. We aimed to investigate the relationship between serum S100A12 levels and functional outcome in ICH patients. METHODS: Serum S100A12 levels were measured in 101 ICH patients hospitalized within 24 h after symptom onset. Poor functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale of 3 or greater at 3 months after stroke. Early neurologic deterioration was defined as an increase of >=4 points in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or death at 24 hours from symptoms onset. RESULTS: High serum S100A12 levels were independently correlated with NIHSS score (t = 5.384, P < 0.001), hematoma volume (t = 4.221, P < 0.001) and serum C-reactive protein levels (t = 5.068, P < 0.001). Serum S100A12 levels were substantially higher in patients with a poor outcome (median, 66.5 versus 37.7 ng/mL; P < 0.001) or early neurological deterioration (median, 76.5 versus 40.1 ng/mL; P < 0.001) than in the other remainders, independently predicted a poor outcome (odds ratio, 1.035; 95% confidence interval, 1.007-1.064; P = 0.015) and early neurologic deterioration (odds ratio,1.032; 95% confidence interval, 1.003-1.060; P = 0.027), and significantly discriminated a poor outcome (area under curve, 0.794; 95% confidence interval, 0.702-0.868) and early neurologic deterioration (area under curve, 0.760; 95% confidence interval, 0.664-0.839) under receiver operating characteristic curve. CONCLUSION: High serum S100A12 levels at admission are highly associated with the extent of inflammatory response, severity, a poor functional outcome and early neurologic deterioration in ICH patients, substantializing serum S100A12 as a promising prognostic biomarker for ICH.
