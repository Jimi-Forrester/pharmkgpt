39620847|t|Care Partner Burden and Support Services in Dementia.
39620847|a|OBJECTIVE: Informal care partners are essential to the care of people living with dementia, but they often experience significant burden and receive minimal training, support, and resources. This article provides an overview of care partner experiences, factors contributing to burden, and methods for reducing burden of caregiving in dementia. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: The US Department of Health and Human Services National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and the World Health Organization Global Action Plan for dementia have identified support for dementia care partners as a top priority for research and policy in recognition of care partners' instrumental but underresourced role in dementia care. The psychological, financial, social, and physical costs of caregiving, particularly without necessary knowledge, skills, and resources, can lead to care partner burden. Reassuringly, multicomponent interventions can mitigate burden and other negative consequences of caregiving, especially when they are theoretically grounded, inclusive, and culturally relevant. ESSENTIAL POINTS: Health care providers play a vital role in the early identification of care partner burden through brief, regular assessments. With earlier identification and subsequent intervention (eg, education, skills-based training, local and national resources), the experience of burden and negative health outcomes can be mitigated and quality of life for people living with dementia and their care partners can be improved.
