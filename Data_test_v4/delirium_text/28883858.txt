28883858|t|Association between low thyroid-stimulating hormone, posterior cortical atrophy and nitro-oxidative stress in elderly patients with cognitive dysfunction.
28883858|a|INTRODUCTION: Cortical atrophy is known to be a valuable sign of cognitive decline. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), posterior cortical atrophy (Koedam score - KS) and nitro-oxidative stress in elderly patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A study (SG) and a control group (CG), each subdivided by gender, were investigated. Subjects older than 59 years with low serum TSH level and with mild cognitive impairment were included in the SG. The CG was formed by subjects free of significant cortical atrophy and free or thyroid dysfunction. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE), Koedam score on cranial magnetic resonance imaging, and blood parameters (TSH, FT4, and nitric oxide - NOx) were assessed. RESULTS: Subjects in the study group had fewer years of education above the 8th grade compared with the control group (p < 0.0001). A significantly higher percentage of subjects in the study group had a Koedam score of 2 or 3 compared with controls, who had in the majority of cases a Koedam score of zero (p < 0.02). Significantly higher NOx levels were observed when study groups of both genders were compared with corresponding controls (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed with regard to FT4 (p > 0.70). Nitric oxide was found to be significantly associated with TSH (p < 0.03) and KS (p < 0.002) when the whole study group was considered as well as when just the non-smoker study group was investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed an association between subclinical thyroid hypofunction, nitro-oxidative stress, and posterior cortical atrophy as an early stage of global atrophy.
