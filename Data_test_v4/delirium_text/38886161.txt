38886161|t|Understanding epileptogenesis from molecules to network alteration.
38886161|a|Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent seizures. Following an initial insult, a latent period precedes the onset of spontaneous seizures, a process referred to as epileptogenesis. This period plays a critical role in halting the progression toward epilepsy before the onset of abnormal molecular and network alterations. In this study, the fundamental concepts of epileptogenesis as well as the associated molecular and cellular targets are reviewed.
