8051988|t|CDP-choline-induced blood histamine changes in Alzheimer's disease.
8051988|a|Histamine (HA) is a known neurotransmitter with a wide spectrum of biological actions at the central and peripheral levels. Recently, it has been found that HA is involved in the regulation of immune cell function, acting as an immunomodulator. A hyperactivation in the histaminergic system has been demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), including increased levels of HA in brain, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients. In addition, changes in phospholipid metabolism and neuroimmune function have been reported in AD. CDP-choline (cytidine-5-diphosphate-choline) participates in the phospholipid metabolism pathway incorporating free choline into phosphatidyl-choline and choline plasmalogens in several tissues, including the central nervous system. In this study we have measured the concentration of HA in blood from patients with early-onset AD (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD) under treatment with CDP-choline (1000 mg p.o. x30 days). HA was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorometric detection. CDP-choline reduced the basal levels of blood HA in both EOAD and LOAD by 2-fold. The reduction in blood HA content was observed 2 h after CDP-choline administration and gradually progressed for 30 days of treatment. These results confirm the potential immunogenic effects of CDP-choline and also that an excess of HA might influence some etiopathogenic events in AD.
