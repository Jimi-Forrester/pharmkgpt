37130528|t|Listening with an Ageing Brain - a Cognitive Challenge.
37130528|a|Hearing impairment has been recently identified as a major modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline in later life and has been becoming of increasing scientific interest. Sensory and cognitive decline are connected by complex bottom-up and top-down processes, a sharp distinction between sensation, perception, and cognition is impossible. This review provides a comprehensive overview on the effects of healthy and pathological aging on auditory as well as cognitive functioning on speech perception and comprehension, as well as specific auditory deficits in the 2 most common neurodegenerative diseases in old age: Alzheimer disease and Parkinson syndrome. Hypotheses linking hearing loss to cognitive decline are discussed, and current knowledge on the effect of hearing rehabilitation on cognitive functioning is presented. This article provides an overview of the complex relationship between hearing and cognition in old age.
