35742400|t|A Telehealth-Based Cognitive-Adaptive Training (e-OTCAT) to Prevent Cancer and Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment in Women with Breast Cancer: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.
35742400|a|BACKGROUND: Many women with breast cancer experience a great number of side effects, such as cognitive impairment, during and after chemotherapy that reduces their quality of life. Currently, research focusing on the use of non-pharmacological, and specifically telehealth interventions to prevent or mitigate them has been insufficient. METHODS: This protocol describes a randomized controlled trial aimed at studying the preventive effects of a videoconferenced cognitive-adaptive training (e-OTCAT) program (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04783402). A number of 98 eligible participants will be randomized to one of the following groups: (a) the experimental group receiving the e-OTCAT program during 12 consecutive weeks since the beginning of chemotherapy; and (b) the control group receiving and educational handbook and usual care. The primary outcome will be the cognitive function. Secondary measures will be psychological distress, fatigue, sleep disturbance, quality of life and occupational performance. The time-points for these measures will be placed at baseline, after 12 weeks and six months of post-randomization. CONCLUSION: This trial may support the inclusion of multidimensional interventions through a telehealth approach in a worldwide growing population suffering from breast cancer, emphasizing the prevention of cognitive impairment as one of the side effects of cancer and its treatments.
