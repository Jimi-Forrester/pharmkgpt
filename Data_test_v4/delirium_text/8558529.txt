8558529|a|A series of novel N-(4-pyridinyl)-1H-indol-1-amines and other heteroaryl analogs was synthesized and evaluated in tests to determine potential utility for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. From these compounds, N-propyl-N-(4-pyridinyl)-1H-indol-1-amine (besipirdine, 4c) was selected for clinical development based on in-depth biological evaluation. In addition to cholinomimetic properties based initially on in vitro inhibition of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding, in vivo reversal of scopolamine-induced behavioral deficits, and subsequently on other results, 4c also displayed enhancement of adrenergic mechanisms as evidenced in vitro by inhibition of [3H] clonidine binding and synaptosomal biogenic amine uptake, and in vivo by reversal of tetrabenazine-induced ptosis. The synthesis, structure-activity relationships for this series, and the biological profile of 4c are reported.
