24059319|t|Genomic linkage between Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes.
24059319|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major health concern that affects nearly every society worldwide. The disease is an irreversible, progressive and age-related neurodegenerative disorder. It is characterized by impaired cognitive function and the diffuse deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The causes of AD and the underlying mechanisms that trigger the onset of the disease are still a matter of debate. Several epidemiological studies have shown that the development of AD is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). In this review, we provide evidence for the link between T2D and AD, highlighting the critical role of insulin in the pathogenesis of these diseases, and we provide information on the genes that might be involved in the interplay between these two disorders. New insight into the complex biology of AD is necessary for the early diagnosis of the disease, the development of novel drug therapies and the prevention of these health issues.
