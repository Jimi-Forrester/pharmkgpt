11186601|t|Elevated plasma neopterin levels in Alzheimer disease.
11186601|a|We assessed plasma neopterin level as a marker of inflammation in Alzheimer disease (AD). Plasma neopterin levels were higher in 51 patients with AD (9.3 +/- 5.9 ng/mL) than in 38 age-matched control subjects (6.3 +/- 2.6 ng/ml, p = 0.002). There was no correlation between neopterin levels and Mini-Mental State Examination score or duration of disease; there was a weak association between neopterin level and age (r = 0.26, p = 0.02). Although measurement of plasma neopterin levels is not useful for diagnosis, this assay may provide guidance for the development of anti-inflammatory treatment strategies for AD.
