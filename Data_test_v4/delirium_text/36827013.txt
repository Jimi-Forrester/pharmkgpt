36827013|t|Social disparities in pain management provision in stage IV lung cancer: A national registry analysis.
36827013|a|A strong association exists between pain and lung cancer (LC). Focusing on the disparities in pain referral in LC patients, we are aiming to characterize the prevalence and patterns of referrals to pain management (PM) in Stage IV non-small-cell LC (NSLC) and small-cell LC (SCLC). We sampled the National Cancer Database for de novo stage IV LC (2004-2016). We analyzed trends of pain referral using the Cochran-Armitage test. Chi-squared statistics were used to identify the sociodemographic and clinico-pathologic determinants of referral to PM, and significant variables (P < .05) were included in one multivariable regression model predicting the likelihood of pain referral. A total N = 17,620 (3.1%) of NSLC and N = 4305 (2.9%) SCLC patients were referred to PM. A significant increase in referrals was observed between 2004 and 2016 (NSLC: 1.7%-4.1%, P < .001; SCLC: 1.6%-4.2%, P < .001). Patient and disease factors played a significant role in likelihood of referral in both groups. Demographic factors such as gender, age, and facility type played a role in the likelihood of pain referrals, highlighting the gap and need for multidisciplinary PM in patients with LC. Despite an increase in the proportion of referrals to PM issued for terminal stage LC, the overall proportion remains low. To ensure better of quality of life for patients, oncologists need to be made aware of existent disparities and implicit biases.
