25354680|a|In recent years there has been enormous interest in researching oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are derived from the metabolism of oxygen as by-products of cell respiration, and are continuously produced in all aerobic organisms. Oxidative stress occurs as a consequence of an imbalance between ROS production and the available antioxidant defence against them. Nowadays, a variety of diseases and degenerative processes such as cancer, Alzheimer's and autoimmune diseases are mediated by oxidative stress. Heat stress was suggested to be an environmental factor responsible for stimulating ROS production because of similarities in responses observed following heat stress compared with that occurring following exposure to oxidative stress. This manuscript describes the main mitochondrial sources of ROS and the antioxidant defences involved to prevent oxidative damage in all the mitochondrial compartments. It also deals with discussions concerning the cytotoxic effect of heat stress, mitochondrial heat-induced alterations, as well as heat shock protein (HSP) expression as a defence mechanism.
