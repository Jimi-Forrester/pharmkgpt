33976578|t|Electrophysiological Evaluation in Identifying Unique Sleep Features Among Anti-LGI1 Encephalitis Patients During Active and Recovery Phase.
33976578|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to illustrate the electrophysiological features of sleep disturbances in patients with anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (anti-LGI1) encephalitis in both active and recovery stages. METHODS: Retrospectively filed video electroencephalogram (VEEG) and polysomnography (PSG) data in 24 patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis were analyzed in comparison with that in 20 individuals without sleep disorders as control group. RESULTS: Sleep efficiency (SE) and total sleep time involving REM and NREM sleep were significantly decreased in patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis during the active stage compared to that during the recovery stage and in the control group. Imbalanced sleep structure was found, demonstrated by elevated N1, decreased N3 and REM components, as well as abnormal N2 structure characterized with significantly lower spindle duration and density during the active stage. These findings were independent of the presence of nocturnal episodic events or sleep hyperkinetic movements (HMs). HMs were present in 11/23 patients throughout NREM and REM sleep (nonspecific in sleep stages) during the active stage. During the recovery stage, SE and sleep structures were dramatically improved, including the percentage of N3 and REM sleep, spindle duration and density. Ten of 11 patients with HMs were followed up. HMs were totally remitted in 3 patients and still persistent in 1, while evolved into REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in 4 with comorbid periodic limb movement syndrome (PLMS) in 3/4, and only PLMS in 2. CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances were remarkable and intrinsic features in active anti-LGI1 encephalitis, marked by overall disruptions of both NREM and REM sleep, as well as the presence of HMs, which tend to evolve into RBD or PLMS during the recovery stage. Long-term follow-up with PSG is needed, especially for those patients with severe sleep disturbances during the active phase.
