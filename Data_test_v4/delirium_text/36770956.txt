36770956|t|The Study of a Novel Paeoniflorin-Converting Enzyme from Cunninghamella blakesleeana.
36770956|a|Paeoniflorin is a glycoside compound found in Paeonia lactiflora Pall that is used in traditional herbal medicine and shows various protective effects on the cardio-cerebral vascular system. It has been reported that the pharmacological effects of paeoniflorin might be generated by its metabolites. However, the bioavailability of paeoniflorin by oral administration is low, which greatly limits its clinical application. In this paper, a paeoniflorin-converting enzyme gene (G6046, GenBank accession numbers: OP856858) from Cunninghamella blakesleeana (AS 3.970) was identified by comparative analysis between MS analysis and transcriptomics. The expression, purification, enzyme activity, and structure of the conversion products produced by this paeoniflorin-converting enzyme were studied. The optimal conditions for the enzymatic activity were found to be pH 9, 45  C, resulting in a specific enzyme activity of 14.56 U/mg. The products were separated and purified by high-performance counter-current chromatography (HPCCC). Two main components were isolated and identified, 2-amino-2-p-hydroxymethyl-methyl alcohol-benzoate (tirs-benzoate) and 1-benzoyloxy-2,3-propanediol (1-benzoyloxypropane-2,3-diol), via UPLC-Q-TOF-MS and NMR. Additionally, paeoniflorin demonstrated the ability to metabolize into benzoic acid via G6046 enzyme, which might exert antidepressant effects through the blood-brain barrier into the brain.
