38500929|t|Indian Consensus on the Role of Amitriptyline in Migraine Prophylaxis.
38500929|a|Migraine is a globally prevalent neurological disorder. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, has shown potential as a prophylactic treatment for migraine; however, its role as a first-line medication has been debated. A modified Delphi method was used to develop consensus statements on migraine and its management. The literature review identified knowledge gaps, and two survey rounds were conducted among a panel of experts. Consensus was reached for 12 out of 23 initial survey questions, whereas no consensus was reached for four questions after the deliberation in the second round. The results showed that migraine is highly prevalent among women aged 15-35 years in India. Amitriptyline is an effective monotherapy for prophylactic migraine management, with a recommended initial dose of 5-10 mg. A gradual titration over six months achieves optimal results. Amitriptyline is also safe for managing catamenial migraine and can be used at lower doses during pregnancy to alleviate symptoms. The outcomes of this study emphasize that amitriptyline should be considered as a primary prophylactic treatment for migraine because of its efficacy and safety. The evidence-based consensus achieved is intended to serve as guidance for healthcare practitioners in India, and it is anticipated that such adoption will lead to improvement in patient outcomes and an enhancement in the quality of life for those affected by migraines.
