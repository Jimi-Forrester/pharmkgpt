23707992|t|Statins and venous thromboembolic disease prophylaxis.
23707992|a|Statins have dramatically improved the treatment of hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease through its inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. Although its main effect has long been known, much is yet to be understood about the wide and varied pleiotropic properties of statins. Some studies have demonstrated that statins contain antiplatelet, antithrombotic, antiinflammatory, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties independent of their ability to lower plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. More recently, statins have been used in novel ways in the treatment of Alzheimer disease, sepsis, pneumonia, and bacteremia. In 2000, it was first suggested that statins could decrease the incidence of venous thromboembolisms (VTEs). A recent publication showed that not only do statins lower the incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, but they do so in a dose-dependent manner. Although there is certainly strong evidence demonstrating that statins do indeed lower VTEs, the mechanism is not understood. Possible hypotheses include their antiinflammatory and antithrombotic properties. With only one randomized clinical trial available, further studies must be conducted before routinely recommending statins for prophylaxis of VTEs.
