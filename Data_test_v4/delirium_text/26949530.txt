26949530|a|INTRODUCTION: Jejunoileal diverticulosis (JID) is a rare condition associated with nonspecific symptoms, consisting of acquired false diverticula. It frequently co-exists with colonic diverticulosis. Diagnosis is usually made incidentally or after complications. These include hemorrhage, obstruction and diverticulitis, with or without perforation. PRESENTATION OF CASE: 81-year-old man presented with a painful abdominal mass in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), diffuse abdominal discomfort and fever. Abdominal examination confirmed a well-defined mass in the RLQ without rebound tenderness. Laboratory analysis revealed elevated inflammatory markers and CT scan showed a cavitated lesion with an air-fluid level in the RLQ, without evidence of intraperitoneal free air or fluid. Admitted for conservative treatment, failure to improve led to laparotomy on the 6th day of hospitalization, with identification of jejunoileal diverticulosis complicated with diverticulitis and walled-off perforation. We performed segmental enterectomy. DISCUSSION: The incidence of JID is estimated at 0.2-7% and it is usually diagnosed in the sixth/seventh decade of life. From a diagnostic perspective, JID is a challenging disorder, without reliable diagnostic tests. Diverticulitis is the most common complication. Perforation generally causes only localized peritonitis, as involved diverticula are often walled off by the surrounding mesentery. In selected cases, medical therapy may suffice. For all other patients prompt laparotomy with segmental intestinal resection is the treatment of choice. CONCLUSION: JID remains under diagnosed. When it presents as an acute complication it may require immediate surgical intervention. In an elderly person, especially with known gastrointestinal diverticulosis, one must have a high index of suspicion for perforation.
