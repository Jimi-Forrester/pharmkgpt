38549795|t|Electrochemical sensing of B-complex vitamins: current challenges and future prospects with microfluidic integration.
38549795|a|Vitamins are crucial micronutrients found in limited quantities in food, living organisms, and soil. Since most vitamins are not produced within the human body, a lack of these essential nutrients can result in various physiological disorders. Analyzing vitamins typically involves costly, time-consuming methods, requiring skilled personnel, automated equipment, and dedicated laboratory setups. The pressing need is for the development of efficient, portable, and user-friendly detection techniques that are cost-effective, addressing the challenges associated with traditional analytical approaches. In recent years, electrochemical sensors and electrochemical microfluidic devices have garnered prominence owing to their remarkable sensitivity, quick analysis, cost-effectiveness, and facile fabrication procedures. Electrochemical sensing and microfluidics are two distinct fields that are often integrated to create powerful and versatile sensing devices. The connection between them leverages the advantages of both fields to create highly efficient, miniaturized, and portable analytical systems. This interdisciplinary approach has led to the development of innovative devices with broad applications in various scientific, medical, and environmental domains. This review begins by outlining the importance of vitamins in human nutrition and health and emphasizing the need for precise and reliable sensing techniques. Owing to the limited literature available on electrochemical detection of vitamin B complexes, this review offers an in-depth analysis of modern electrochemical sensing of water-soluble vitamins, focusing on B1, B2, B6, B9, and B12. The challenges faced by researchers are addressed, including selectivity, sensitivity, interference, matrix effects, and calibration, while also exploring promising prospects such as nanomaterial integration, miniaturization, microfluidics-based IoTs, and innovative sensor designs.
