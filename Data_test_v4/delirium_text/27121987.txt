27121987|a|KEY POINTS: Hyperfibrinogenaemia (HFg) results in vascular remodelling, and fibrinogen (Fg) and amyloid beta (Abeta) complex formation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. However, the interconnection of these effects, their mechanisms and implications in cerebrovascular diseases are not known. Using a mouse model of HFg, we showed that at an elevated blood level, Fg increases cerebrovascular permeability via mainly caveolar protein transcytosis. This enhances deposition of Fg in subendothelial matrix and interstitium making the immobilized Fg a readily accessible substrate for binding Abeta and cellular prion protein (PrPC ), the protein that is thought to have a greater effect on memory than Abeta. We showed that enhanced formation of Fg-Abeta and Fg-PrPC complexes are associated with reduction in short-term memory. The present study delineates a new mechanistic pathway for vasculo-neuronal dysfunctions found in inflammatory cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases associated with an elevated blood level of Fg. ABSTRACT: Many cardiovascular diseases are associated with inflammation and as such are accompanied by an increased blood level of fibrinogen (Fg). Besides its well-known prothrombotic effects Fg seems to have other destructive roles in developing microvascular dysfunction that include changes in vascular reactivity and permeability. Increased permeability of brain microvessels has the most profound effects as it may lead to cerebrovascular remodelling and result in memory reduction. The goal of the present study was to define mechanisms of cerebrovascular permeability and associated reduction in memory induced by elevated blood content of Fg. Genetically modified, transgenic hyperfibrinogenic (HFg) mice were used to study cerebrovascular transcellular and paracellular permeability in vivo. The extent of caveolar formation and the role of caveolin-1 signalling were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot (WB) analysis in brain samples from experimental animals. Formation of Fg complexes with amyloid beta (Abeta) and with cellular prion protein (PrPC ) were also assessed with IHC and WB analysis. Short-term memory of mice was assessed by novel object recognition and Y-maze tests. Caveolar protein transcytosis was found to have a prevailing role in overall increased cerebrovascular permeability in HFg mice. These results were associated with enhanced formation of caveolae. Increased formation of Fg-PrPC and Fg-Abeta complexes were correlated with reduction in short-term memory in HFg mice. Using the model of hyperfibrinogenaemia, the present study shows a novel mechanistic pathway of inflammation-induced and Fg-mediated reduction in short-term memory.
