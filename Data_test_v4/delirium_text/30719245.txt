30719245|t|Tau Pathology of Alzheimer Disease: Possible Role of Sleep Deprivation.
30719245|a|Sleep deprivation is a common complaint in modern societies. Insufficient sleep has increased the risk of catching neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Several studies have indicated that restricted sleep increases the level of deposition of beta-amyloid and formation of neurofibrillary tangles, the major brain microstructural hallmarks for Alzheimer disease. The mechanisms by which sleep deprivation affects the pathology of Alzheimer disease has not yet been fully and definitively identified. However, risk factors like apolipoprotein E risk alleles, kinases and phosphatases dysregulation, reactive oxygen species, endoplasmic reticulum damages, glymphatic system dysfunctions and orexinergic system inefficacy have been identified as the most important factors which mediates between the two conditions. In this review, these factors are briefly discussed.
