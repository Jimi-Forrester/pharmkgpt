37959773|a|The primary objective of this study was to elucidate the chemical composition, antioxidant properties, and antiproliferative activities of Eclipta prostrata extracts. Two flavonoids, 3'-O-methylorobol and apigenin 7-sulfate, were isolated from the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract of E. prostrata. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents of the E. prostrata extracts, as well as their overall antioxidant activities as measured using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and reducing power assays, were investigated. The E. prostrata EtOAc extract exhibited significantly greater antioxidant activities in both assays and higher phenol and flavonoid contents than the other extracts. The potential antiproliferative properties of the E. prostrata extracts and isolated compounds were investigated in vitro against the AGS, A549, and HT-29 cancer cell lines and the normal human HEK-293 cell line using the MTT assay. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining analysis and quantitative real-time PCR were used to assess AGS cell apoptosis. At a concentration of 100 microg/mL, the EtOAc extract of E. prostrata reduced AGS cell viability and proliferation by inducing apoptosis through the alteration of gene expression in the apoptotic cascade. These results highlight E. prostrata as a promising source of anticancer compounds.
