39403540|t|Mapping the research trends and hotspots in vascular aging from 2003-2023: A bibliometric analysis.
39403540|a|From the molecular to the cellular to the tissue level, vascular aging is regulated by a complex network involving numerous mechanisms and diseases, and our knowledge of any one level is incomplete and biased. To date, due to the diversity and complexity of the influencing factors, no international standard has been established. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to analyze the global research trends and potential hotspots related to vascular aging. We extracted the relevant publications between January 2003 and December 2023 from the Web of Science Core Collection. VOSviewer and CiteSpace software were used to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the authors, countries, institutions, and journals in the field of vascular aging. The total number of publications on vascular aging between January 2003 and December 2023 was 1044, showing a steady increase. The United States and the University of Oklahoma published the highest number of research papers in the field. Ungvari Zoltan from the University of Oklahoma was the most productive author (47 papers) on vascular aging, specializing in endothelial cell failure, microcirculation, and aging. Burst detection of keywords revealed that endothelial dysfunction and vascular smooth muscle cells had the highest burst strength, suggesting that these are the current research hot spots in vascular aging research. In conclusion, senescence-associated secretory phenotype, reactive oxygen species, genetic instability, and an imbalance of protein homeostasis, trigger an inflammatory response that affects vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cell function, ultimately leading to vascular aging. This research provides insights into recent advances and preventive strategies in the field of vascular aging.
