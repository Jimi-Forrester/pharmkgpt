35515819|t|A fluorescent and colorimetric probe based on naphthalene diimide and its high sensitivity towards copper ions when used as test strips.
35515819|a|Herein, a red fluorescent and colorimetric probe (NDI-Py) based on naphthalene diimide was designed and synthesized, which exhibited rapid response, high sensitivity and selectivity towards copper ions, and the detection limit was as low as 0.97 muM in solution. Furthermore, NDI-Py demonstrated a strong red emission in the aggregated state because of its non-planar structure. Thus, it can act as a test strip to conveniently monitor copper ions with the detection limit as low as 2.0 muM.
