11439695|t|Novel functional assay for proteases and modulators. Application in beta-secretase studies.
11439695|a|Proteases play a critical role in many cellular functions and have been an attractive therapeutic target due to their involvement in a number of disease processes. One prominent example is the secretases responsible for the generation of amyloid beta peptide, which is believed to be central for the development of Alzheimer's disease. It is therefore desirable to identify and characterize these proteases. We have developed a novel functional approach for identification of proteases and modulators by coupling the protease activity to caspase-mediated apoptosis. Here we show the proof of principle for this approach using beta-secretase as an example. We provide data showing that 1. A modified caspase-3 containing beta-secretase cleavage site induces apoptosis in 293T cells. 2. The modified caspase-3 induced apoptosis is correlated with the susceptibility of beta-secretase recognition sequence to beta-secretase. 3. In vivo beta-secretase competitors BACE2 and BACE2(D110A) prevent the modified caspase-3 induced cell death. Therefore, this approach can be a useful tool in studies of proteolytic cleavage provided only that the protease recognition sequence is known.
