29643882|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy of nerve growth factor (NGF) in combination with oxiracetam and single use of oxiracetam in the treatment of hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage. METHODS: One hundred and forty patients with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage who were admitted to the hospital from July 2015 to September 2016 were selected as research subjects and randomly divided into a treatment group which was treated by NGF in combination with oxiracetam and a control group which was treated by oxiracetam only. The clinical efficacy was observed, and the death of both groups was recorded. RESULTS: The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and limbs muscle force of both groups improved after treatment, and the improvement of the treatment was superior to that of the control group, suggesting a significant difference (P<0.05). The reduction of serum inflammatory factor level of the treatment group was much larger than that of the control group after treatment, and the difference had statistical significance (P<0.05). The survival analysis suggested that the survival rates of the two groups had a statistically significant difference (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: NGF in combination with oxiracetam is significantly effective in treating hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage as it can apparently recover neurologic impairment and limbs muscle force. The therapy has important clinical application values.
