38820374|a|BACKGROUND: New sleep-inducing drugs (eg, ramelteon, suvorexant, and lemborexant) have been shown to prevent delirium in high-risk groups. However, no single study has simultaneously evaluated the delirium-preventing effects of all novel sleep-inducing drugs in hospitalized patients. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the relationship between sleep-inducing drugs and delirium prevention in patients hospitalized in general medical-surgical settings for nonpsychiatric conditions who underwent liaison interventions for insomnia. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients treated in general medical-surgical settings for nonpsychiatric conditions with consultation-liaison psychiatry consult for insomnia. Delirium was diagnosed by fully certified psychiatrists using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 th edition. The following items were retrospectively examined from medical records as factors related to delirium development: type of sleep-inducing drugs, age, sex, and delirium risk factors. The risk factors of delirium development were calculated using adjusted odds ratios (aORs) via multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the 710 patients analyzed, 257 (36.2%) developed delirium. Suvorexant (aOR, 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.94; P = 0.02) and lemborexant (aOR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.14-0.39; P < 0.0001) significantly reduced the risk of developing delirium. Benzodiazepines (aOR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.15-3.13; P = 0.01) significantly increased this risk. Ramelteon (aOR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.84-2.01; P = 0.24) and Z-drugs (aOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.81-1.98; P = 0.30) were not significantly associated with delirium development. CONCLUSIONS: The use of suvorexant and lemborexant may prevent delirium in patients with a wide range of medical conditions.
