35225828|t|Perception and Knowledge of Mercury by Occupationally Exposed Health Care Personnel.
35225828|a|Thermometers and baumanometers frequently contain mercury, a toxic heavy metal. Inadequate management of this substance can constitute an occupational hazard by exposing health care professionals to health risks including memory loss, psychosomatic symptoms, fatigue, and other signs of cognitive dysfunction as reported in several studies. PURPOSE: To assess Mexico's health care professionals' health and mercury-related knowledge and risk perception and to explore the measurement properties of a questionnaire assessing that level of knowledge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mixed methodology. A quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted to measure health care professionals' knowledge of mercury and to validate an instrument using a Rasch analysis in 160 professionals. A qualitative study involving in-depth interviews was conducted to identify participants' risk perception for mercury exposure. RESULTS: The total knowledge of mercury was 19.0 +- 2.0 on a scale of 0 to 28 points. The scores for medical specialists were significantly (P < .001) higher, ranging between 20.0 +- 2.05 and 23.0 +- 1.63. In general, the level of risk perception for mercury exposure was low. The questionnaire presented a reasonable fit to the Rasch model (good item fit with a Bonferroni-adjusted P = .000714). The response categories of three items were collapsed, and two pairs of items were bundled into two super items. CONCLUSION: The levels of the knowledge of the health and safety risks and risk perception for mercury exposure in the Mexican health care professionals evaluated were low. Health care professionals should receive comprehensive training in the safe use and health risks of mercury.
