36500526|t|Risk Assessment of Coffee Cherry (Cascara) Fruit Products for Flour Replacement and Other Alternative Food Uses.
36500526|a|Coffee bean harvesting incurs various by-products known for their long traditional use. However, they often still end up being a waste instead of being used to their full potential. On the European market, coffee cherry (cascara) products are not yet common, and a novel food approval for beverages made from coffee cherry pulp was issued only recently. In this article, exposure and risk assessment of various products such as juice, jam, jelly, puree, and flour made from coffee cherry pulp and husk are reviewed. Since caffeine in particular, as a bioactive ingredient, is considered a limiting factor, safe intake will be derived for different age groups, showing that even adolescents could consume limited quantities without adverse health effects. Moreover, the composition can be influenced by harvesting methods and processing steps. Most interestingly, dried and powdered coffee cherry can substitute the flour in bakery products by up to 15% without losing baking properties and sensory qualities. In particular, this use as a partial flour substitute is a possible approach to counteract rising grain prices, transport costs, and disrupted supply chains, which are caused by the Russia-Ukraine war and changing climatic conditions. Thus, the supply of affordable staple foods could be partially ensured for the inhabitants of countries that depend on imported wheat and cultivate coffee locally by harvesting both beans and by-products.
