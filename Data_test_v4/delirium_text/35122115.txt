35122115|t|The listed, delisted, and sustainability of therapeutic medicines for dementia patients: the study is specific to South Korea.
35122115|a|The Dementia Management Act (DMA) came into effect on August 4, 2011, in South Korea. Diagnosis and medication were rapidly performed for dementia in a short time. We investigated the cardiac effects of increased drug prescription following DMA. We observed a correlation between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and anti-AD drug (AAD) groups from 2010 to 2019 on the National Health Insurance System (NHIS) of South Korea. This study investigated the increase and decrease in deaths of AD patients with AAD. We analysed the mortality per 100,000 population with the R2 Calculator. Moreover, we made the up or down datum line for the simple decision on the listed, delisted, and sustainable drug examined by a linear equation and R2. We observed that life expectancy was diminished by AAD in Sorokdo National Hospital. In the NHIS, donepezil and rivastigmine increased the number of deaths decided on R2 > 0.75. Memantine was sustainable. We could not decide on galantamine because it is one of the other groups. We made a straightforward decision-maker of delisted, listed, or sustainable criteria based on mortality and datum line.
