33787792|t|Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of delirium in an oncological hospital service: an integrative review.
33787792|a|OBJECTIVES: to analyze the production of scientific articles about the pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of delirium in adult hospitalized cancer patients. METHODS: integrative review whose sample was obtained from the databases Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Web of Science, and from the portals Biblioteca Virtual em Saude, and PubMed. RESULTS: among the ten studies analyzed, 80% described exclusively the pharmacological management, especially with regard to the use of haloperidol; 20% mentioned, superficially, non-pharmacological interventions/actions (educational actions) associated to pharmacological management, and adjusting them could result in the diminution and control of psychomotor agitation, contributing for the safety and comfort of the patient. CONCLUSIONS: there are few studies addressing pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions/actions to manage delirium. As a result, it is essential to develop studies focused on increasing and advancing scientific knowledge with regard to the theme, especially in the national context.
