32886484|a|In this paper, the benzo-cracking approach was applied to the potent sigma1 (sigma1) receptor antagonist 1 to afford the less conformationally constrained 1,3-dioxane derivatives 2 and 3. To evaluate the effect of the increase in the distance between the two hydrophobic structural elements that flank the basic function, the cis and trans diastereomers of 4 and 5 were also prepared and studied. Compounds 2 and 3 showed affinity values at the sigma1 receptor significantly higher than that of the lead compound 1. In particular, 3 displayed unprecedented selectivity over the sigma2 receptor, the phencyclidine site of the NMDA receptor, and opioid receptor subtypes, as well as over the dopamine transporter. Docking results supported the structure-activity relationship studies. Due to its interesting biological profile, derivative 3, selected for an in vivo study in a validated preclinical model of binge eating, was able to counteract the overeating of palatable food only in binging rats, without affecting palatable food intake in the control group and anxiety-like and depression-related behaviors in female rats. This result strengthened the involvement of the sigma1 receptor in the compulsive-like eating behavior and supported the sigma1 receptor as a promising target for the management of eating disorders.
