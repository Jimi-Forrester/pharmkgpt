37561584|a|Biological aging can be described as accumulative, prolonged metabolic stress, and is the major risk factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, we identified and described a quinone reductase 2 (QR2) pathway in the brain, in which QR2 acts as a removable memory constraint and metabolic buffer within neurons. QR2 becomes over-expressed with age, and is possibly a novel contributing factor to age-related metabolic stress and cognitive deficit. We found that in human cells, genetic removal of QR2 produces a shift in the proteome opposing that found in AD brains, while simultaneously reducing oxidative stress. We therefore created highly specific QR2 inhibitors (QR2i's), enabling evaluation of chronic QR2 inhibition as a novel way to reduce biological-age related metabolic stress and cognitive decline. QR2i's replicated results obtained by genetic removal of QR2 while local QR2i microinjection improved hippocampal and cortical dependent learning in rats and mice. Continuous consumption of QR2i's in drinking-water improved cognition and reduced pathology in the brains of AD-model mice (5xFAD), with a noticeable between-sex effect on treatment duration. These results demonstrate the importance of QR2 activity- and pathway function in the healthy and neurodegenerative brain, and the great therapeutic potential of QR2i's as first-in-class drugs.
