28664797|a|Delirium is a disturbance of attention and cognition that cannot be explained by pre-existing neurocognitive disorders. It can have serious consequences, including falls, increased mortality, longer hospital stays and an increased risk of long-term cognitive impairment. Delirium may be present on admission to hospital but, where it is not, nurses should identify people at risk.
