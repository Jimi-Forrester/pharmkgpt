36401257|a|BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation-mediated microglia polarization is a major process in various central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to the inflammatory signals as well as to microglia polarization in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced neuroinflammation. Ascorbic acid 6-palmitate (L-AP) has been broadly used as a dietary antioxidant in foods and demonstrated a strong inhibitory effect on 5-LOX; however, the specific anti-inflammation mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects and possible mechanisms of L-AP on LPS-induced neuroinflammation in BV-2 cells. METHODS: Immortalized murine microglia cell line BV-2 cells were employed to assess the effect of L-AP to modulate microglia M1/M2 polarization in vivo, and the molecular mechanism was evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. Molecular docking was used to predict the binding activity of L-AP with protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK). RESULTS: L-AP at 62.5 microM significantly modulated LPS-induced microglia M1/M2 polarization (increases of interleukin (IL)-10 and arginase-1 (Arg-1) transcriptions) independent of cell growth. Besides, L-AP at 62.5 microM significantly down-regulated glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding homologous protein (CHOP) mRNA levels. Similar data were shown in the tunicamycin (TM) induced ER stress cells model. Moreover, the protective effect of L-AP on TM-induced microglia M1/M2 polarization was similar to that of 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA), the ER stress inhibitor. Molecular docking results indicated L-AP might directly bind with PERK, with a binding affinity of -7.7 kcal/mol. A further study unveiled that L-AP notably inhibited LPS-induced PERK/ eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (elf2alpha) activation. CONCLUSION: Together, this study revealed that L-AP possessed its effect on the reconstruction of microglia M1/M2 polarization balance in LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells via modulating PERK/elF2alpha mediated ER stress.
