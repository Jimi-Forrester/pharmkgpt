38829108|t|Biomarker Identification for Gender Specificity of Alzheimer's Disease Based on the Glial Transcriptome Profiles.
38829108|a|Many sex-specific biomarkers have been recently revealed in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, cerebral glial cells were rarely reported. This study analyzed 220,095 single-nuclei transcriptomes from the frontal cortex of thirty-three AD individuals in the GEO database. Sex-specific Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were identified in glial cells, including 243 in astrocytes, 1,154 in microglia, and 572 in oligodendrocytes. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation analyses and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses revealed functional concentration in synaptic, neural, and hormone-related pathways. Protein-protein interaction network (PPI) identified MT3, CALM2, DLG2, KCND2, PAKACB, CAMK2D, and NLGN4Y in astrocytes, TREM2, FOS, APOE, APP, and NLGN4Y in microglia, and GRIN2A, ITPR2, GNAS, and NLGN4Y in oligodendrocytes as key genes. NLGN4Y was the only gene shared by the three glia and was identified as the biomarker for the gender specificity of AD. Gene-transcription factor (TF)-miRNA coregulatory network identified key regulators for NLGN4Y and its target TCMs. Ecklonia kurome Okam (Kunbu) and Herba Ephedrae (Mahuang) were identified, and the effects of the active ingredients on AD were displayed. Finally, enrichment analysis of Kunbu and Mahuang suggested that they might act as therapeutic candidates for gender specificity of AD.
