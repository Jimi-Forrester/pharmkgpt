33086557|t|Increased Pro-Thrombotic Platelet Activity Associated with Thrombin/PAR1-Dependent Pathway Disorder in Patients with Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.
33086557|a|Epidemiological studies confirm the high risk of ischemic events in multiple sclerosis (MS) that are associated with increased pro-thrombotic activity of blood platelets. The most potent physiological platelet agonist is thrombin, which activates platelets via cleavage of specific protease-activated receptors (PARs). Our current study is aimed to determine the potential genetics and proteomic abnormalities of PAR1 in both platelets and megakaryocytes, which may have thromboembolic consequences in the course of MS. The obtained results were correlated with the expression level of platelet and megakaryocyte transcripts for APOA1 and A2M genes encoding atherosclerosis biomarkers: apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) and alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha2M), respectively. Moreover, PAR1 functionality in MS platelets was assessed by flow cytometry, determining the level of platelet-platelet and platelet-leukocyte aggregates, platelet microparticles and surface expression of P-selectin. As a PAR1 agonist, the synthetic TRAP-6 peptide was used, which made it possible to achieve platelet activation in whole blood without triggering clotting. Comparative analyses showed an elevated level of platelet activation markers in the blood of MS patients compared to controls. The mRNA expression of gene coding alpha2M was upregulated, whilst ApoA1 was down-regulated, both in platelets and megakaryocytes from MS patients. Furthermore, we observed an increase in both mRNA expression and surface density of PAR1 in platelets and megakaryocytes in MS compared to controls. Both the level of platelet activation markers and PAR1 expression showed a high correlation with the expression of transcripts for APOA1 and A2M genes.
