36585740|t|Roles of extracellular vesicles in periodontal homeostasis and their therapeutic potential.
36585740|a|Periodontal tissue is a highly dynamic and frequently stimulated area where homeostasis is easily destroyed, leading to proinflammatory periodontal diseases. Bacteria-bacteria and cell-bacteria interactions play pivotal roles in periodontal homeostasis and disease progression. Several reviews have comprehensively summarized the roles of bacteria and stem cells in periodontal homeostasis. However, they did not describe the roles of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from bacteria and cells. As communication mediators evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to eukaryotic cells, EVs secreted by bacteria or cells can mediate interactions between bacteria and their hosts, thereby offering great promise for the maintenance of periodontal homeostasis. This review offers an overview of EV biogenesis, the effects of EVs on periodontal homeostasis, and recent advances in EV-based periodontal regenerative strategies. Specifically, we document the pathogenic roles of bacteria-derived EVs (BEVs) in periodontal dyshomeostasis, focusing on plaque biofilm formation, immune evasion, inflammatory pathway activation and tissue destruction. Moreover, we summarize recent advancements in cell-derived EVs (CEVs) in periodontal homeostasis, emphasizing the multifunctional biological effects of CEVs on periodontal tissue regeneration. Finally, we discuss future challenges and practical perspectives for the clinical translation of EV-based therapies for periodontitis.
