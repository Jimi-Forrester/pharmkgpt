39658871|t|Haddon matrix model: Application to workplace violence in a hospital setting.
39658871|a|The aim of this study was to identify hospital-based workplace violence (WPV) risk factors with the Haddon Matrix Model (HMM) to determine its potential utility to conceptualize multiple risks for WPV events. This descriptive study utilized two independent convenience samples Data from behavioral emergencies (2014-2015) for patient violence (N = 192) and from health care staff (N = 380) 12-month violence survey responses (2015) in a Midwestern academic hospital were analyzed. Logistic regression examined patient features associated with physical violence. Survey questions pertained to employee, environment, and cultural factors associated with WPV; responses were examined with Chi-square and two-sample t-tests. Violence risk factors populated the 4 Haddon Matrix domains at pre-event time frames as Host (worker)-age/demographics, Agent (patient)-age/gender, Physical Environment-door/window structure, and Social Environment-worker safety. Risks at event time frames populated for Agent-behavior/delirium, and Physical Environment-event medication/patient identification. The Haddon Matrix identification of hospital violence risks indicates its utility as a comprehensive approach to workplace violence.
