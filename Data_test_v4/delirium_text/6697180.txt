6697180|t|The occurrence of large acetylcholinesterase-containing neurons in human neostriatum as disclosed in normal and Alzheimer-diseased brains.
6697180|a|The human neostriatum was found to contain large neurons (maximum diameter: 30-40 microns) that stain intensely for acetylcholinesterase (AChE). These neurons are few in number, representing less than 5% of the total striatal neuronal population, and appear uniformly scattered throughout the caudate nucleus and putamen. They are morphologically similar to the AChE-containing neurons disclosed in the striatum of rat, cat and monkey after AChE inhibitor (DFP) pretreatment. In Alzheimer-diseased brains the number, morphological characteristics, and staining intensity of the striatal AChE neurons were found to be unaltered despite a marked loss of AChE cells in the adjoining nucleus basalis. These findings suggest that large intrinsic cholinergic neurons exist in human neostriatum and that these elements, in contrast to those of nucleus basalis, are not affected in Alzheimer's disease.
