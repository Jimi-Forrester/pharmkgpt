31008469|a|The following article discusses the possibility of applying a rehabilitation strategy known as Errorless Learning (EL) in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). The authors present the issue in the context of the knowledge on the effectiveness of administering neuropsychological interventions in patients with AD. The history of the EL method development is presented as well as techniques used in its domain. The novelty of the EL methodological approach is shown. It is emphasized that EL, in contrast with the majority of neuropsychological rehabilitation strategies, has a relatively reliable theoretical basis. The remaining part of the work focuses on reviewing empirical findings concerning the effectiveness of employing Errorless Learning in rehabilitation of individuals suffering from AD, which are available in the professional literature. Factors affecting it, such as rehabilitation session organization, frequency of participants' advancements testing and a type of practiced material, are discussed. The effectiveness of EL is compared with the results of other neuropsychological rehabilitation methods. The authors of this article find that the EL strategy may increase cognitive training effectiveness and is a useful option in neuropsychological rehabilitation of patients suffering from moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease.
