38489184|t|Polyamine Dysregulation and Nucleolar Disruption in Alzheimer's Disease.
38489184|a|A hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease etiology is proposed describing how cellular stress induces excessive polyamine synthesis and recycling which can disrupt nucleoli. Polyamines are essential in nucleolar functions, such as RNA folding and ribonucleoprotein assembly. Changes in the nucleolar pool of anionic RNA and cationic polyamines acting as counterions can cause significant nucleolar dynamics. Polyamine synthesis reduces S-adenosylmethionine which, at low levels, triggers tau phosphorylation. Also, polyamine recycling reduces acetyl-CoA needed for acetylcholine, which is low in Alzheimer's disease. Extraordinary nucleolar expansion and/or contraction can disrupt epigenetic control in peri-nucleolar chromatin, such as chromosome 14 with the presenilin-1 gene; chromosome 21 with the amyloid precursor protein gene; chromosome 17 with the tau gene; chromosome 19 with the APOE4 gene; and the inactive X chromosome (Xi; aka "nucleolar satellite") with normally silent spermine synthase (polyamine synthesis) and spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase (polyamine recycling) alleles. Chromosomes 17, 19 and the Xi have high concentrations of Alu elements which can be transcribed by RNA polymerase III if positioned nucleosomes are displaced from the Alu elements. A sudden flood of Alu RNA transcripts can competitively bind nucleolin which is usually bound to Alu sequences in structural RNAs that stabilize the nucleolar heterochromatic shell. This Alu competition leads to loss of nucleolar integrity with leaking of nucleolar polyamines that cause aggregation of phosphorylated tau. The hypothesis was developed with key word searches (e.g., PubMed) using relevant terms (e.g., Alzheimer's, lupus, nucleolin) based on a systems biology approach and exploring autoimmune disease tautology, gaining synergistic insights from other diseases.
