38336908|a|In this study, the efficacy of the promising iron-based polymeric inorganic coagulant (POFC) was assessed for the reduction of eutrophication effect (freshwater toxicity) and the microbial loads from wastewater. Toxicity assessment for POFC was conducted on mice and skin cell lines. The results confirm the lower toxicity level of POFC. The POFC showed excellent antibacterial efficacy against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, it demonstrated a remarkable effectiveness against black fungus such as Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus oryzae. Additionally, POFC showed antiviral effectiveness against the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus as well as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). POFC-based treatment gives excellent removal percentages for phosphate, and phosphorus at doses below 60 ppm with a low produced sludge volume that leads to 84% decrease in the rate of eutrophication and freshwater toxicity. At a POFC concentration of 60 ppm, remarkable reduction rates for total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and E. coli were achieved. After POFC-based coagulation, the produced sludge retains a lower bacterial density due to the antibacterial activity of POFC. Furthermore, it revealed that the observed removal efficiencies for fungi and yeasts in the produced sludge reached 85% at a POFC dose of 60 ppm. Overall, our research indicates that POFC has potential for application in pre-treatment of wastewater and serves as an antimicrobial agent.
