33525689|t|An Exploratory Study of the Relationships Between Diesel Engine Exhaust Particle Inhalation, Pulmonary Inflammation and Anxious Behavior.
33525689|a|Recent technical developments brought negative side effects such as air pollution and large-scale fires, increasingly exposing people to diesel engine exhaust particles (DEP). Testing how DEP inhalation triggers pathophysiology in animal models could be useful in determining how it affects humans. To this end, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pulmonary exposure to DEP for seven consecutive days in experimental male C5BL6/N mice. Twenty-four C5BL6/N mice were treated with one of the three test materials: distilled water for control, a low DEP exposure (5 mg/kg), or a high DEP exposure (15 mg/kg). Exposure to DEP induced decreased body weight; however, it gradually increased pulmonary weight in a DEP-dose-dependent manner. DEP exposure significantly elevated soot accumulation in the lungs, with the alteration of pulmonary homeostasis. It also elevated infiltrated immune cells, thus significantly increasing inflammatory cytokine mRNA and protein production in the lungs and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, respectively. Pulmonary DEP exposure also altered behavioral responses in the open field test (OFT). Low exposure elevated moving distance and speed, while significantly decreasing the number of trials to enter the central zone. Different concentrations of DEP resulted in different behavioral changes; however, while anxiety levels increased, their degree was independent of DEP concentrations. Results suggest that DEP exposure may possess pro-inflammatory responses in the lungs and trigger anxiety.
