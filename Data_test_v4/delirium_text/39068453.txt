39068453|a|Copper is an important metal micronutrient, required for the balanced growth and normal physiological functions of human organism. Copper-related toxicity and dysbalanced metabolism were associated with the disruption of intracellular respiration and the development of various diseases, including cancer. Notably, copper-induced cell death was defined as cuproptosis which was also observed in malignant cells, representing an attractive anti-cancer instrument. Excess of intracellular copper leads to the aggregation of lipoylation proteins and toxic stress, ultimately resulting in the activation of cell death. Differential expression of cuproptosis-related genes was detected in normal and malignant tissues. Cuproptosis-related genes were also linked to the regulation of oxidative stress, immune cell responses, and composition of tumor microenvironment. Activation of cuproptosis was associated with increased expression of redox-metabolism-regulating genes, such as ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), lipoic acid synthetase (LIAS), lipoyltransferase 1 (LIPT1), dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD), drolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (DLAT), pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit alpha 1 (PDHA1), and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit beta (PDHB)). Accordingly, copper-activated network was suggested as an attractive target in cancer therapy. Mechanisms of cuproptosis and regulation of cuproptosis-related genes in different cancers and tumor microenvironment are discussed in this study. The analysis of current findings indicates that therapeutic regulation of copper signaling, and activation of cuproptosis-related targets may provide an effective tool for the improvement of immunotherapy regimens.
