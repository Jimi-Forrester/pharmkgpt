9104754|a|Volumes of medial and lateral temporal lobe structures were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 11 patients with late-life onset schizophrenia (LOS), 18 normal elderly controls and 12 patients with moderate cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) who had no non-cognitive symptoms. While both patient groups had smaller volumes of several medial temporal regions (e.g. entorhinal cortex, left hippocampus), schizophrenics had significantly smaller anterior superior temporal gyri (STG) than normal controls, but AD patients did not. We have previously demonstrated anterior STG volume to be reduced in early life onset schizophrenia.
