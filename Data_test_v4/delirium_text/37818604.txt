Pathological aging of the nervous system results in a series of neurodegenerative diseases and can cause disability and death in the elderly. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the prevention and treatment of nervous system aging.

At the same time, the active ingredients, research models, action mechanisms and curative effects of these five common Chinese herbal medicines were reviewed. From the five common Chinese herbal medicines reviewed in this paper, many encouraging effects of Chinese herbal medicines on treating nervous system aging and related diseases were revealed and more potent herbs would be explored with the help of the proposed possible mechanisms.
