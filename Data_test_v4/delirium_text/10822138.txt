10822138|a|Epidemiological studies indicate that oestrogen improves memory and may delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in postmenopausal women. Furthermore, evidence from experimental studies suggests beneficial effects of oestrogen on several pathogenic mechanisms implicated in AD. We have therefore measured the levels of oestradiol and testosterone in control and AD brains. The results show that in control brain, oestradiol levels are 3.5 fold higher in females than males, though testosterone levels are equivalent. In AD, oestradiol levels were not significantly increased compared to those in control brain, while testosterone levels were unaffected in AD. The results do not support the hypothesis that a lack of oestrogen is a contributory factor in AD.
