39483560|a|Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder marked by persistent hyperglycemia, which significantly impacts vascular health. This review comprehensively analyzes the neurovascular complications associated with DM, focusing on retinal and brain lesions. Diabetes is categorized into type 1 DM, type 2 DM, and gestational DM, each presenting unique challenges and risks. The condition accelerates vascular damage through mechanisms such as endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress, leading to severe microvascular complications. Diabetic retinopathy is a primary concern, with its progression from non-proliferative to proliferative stages potentially resulting in vision loss. Concurrently, diabetes contributes to neurovascular damage in the brain, increasing the risk of cognitive decline and cerebrovascular events. This review examines the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these complications, evaluates current diagnostic and management strategies, and highlights recent advancements in imaging technologies and therapeutic approaches. Integrating these insights is crucial for improving early detection, treatment, and management of diabetes-related neurovascular issues. Future research should focus on innovative preventive measures and therapeutic interventions to mitigate the long-term impact of diabetes on vascular health. By enhancing our understanding of these complex interactions, this review aims to contribute to better clinical practices and improved patient outcomes in diabetes care.
