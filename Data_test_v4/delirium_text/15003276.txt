15003276|t|The E318G substitution in PSEN1 gene is not connected with Alzheimer's disease in a large Polish cohort.
15003276|a|Mutations in the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene are known to cause nearly 50% of early-onset, familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases. To determine whether E318G mutation is related causally to AD in the Polish population E318G mutation frequency was assessed using PCR-RFLP method in a total of 659 subjects: 256 AD patients, 210 healthy, age-matched control subjects, 100 Parkinson's disease patients and 93 centenarians. When the mutation frequencies were compared to healthy controls, no significant differences between the groups were found. It could be concluded that E318G mutation is not related causally to AD in the Polish population, either as a risk factor or a disease causing mutation.
