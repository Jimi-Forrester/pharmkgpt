38066118|a|Traditional remedies using natural ingredients have been handed down over generations, providing collective information for the development of modern therapeutics. These natural products have a long history of safe consumption with curative effects but lack of scientific-based evidence hinders the mass production of new remedies containing active ingredients with particular medicinal properties. This research investigated the phenolic profiles and biochemical properties of 29 herbal ingredients identified in two traditional Thai remedies, Prasachandaeng (PSCD) and Chantaharuethai (CHRT), and their effectiveness in combating chronic diseases. These two traditional remedies are used to reduce fever but some ingredients have been previously reported to possess other health-related properties. Statistical analysis by TOPSIS indicated that Biancaea sappan (L.) Tod. extract exhibited the highest overall closeness coefficient (C) score analyzed from all variables including total phenolic contents, antioxidant potentials, and enzyme inhibitions. Bouea macrophylla Griff. extract showed potential as an effective agent against diabetes through inhibition of two carbohydrate degrading enzymes, alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase, while Dischidia major (Vahl) Merr. showed strong properties as an anti-angiotensin-converting enzyme, leading to the control of hypertension. Dracaena cochinchinensis (Lour.) S.C. Chen effectively controlled the progression of Alzheimer's disease through the inhibition of cholinergic and beta-amyloid formation enzymes. These results can be used as preliminary data for the development of new remedies to prevent or treat particular chronic diseases.
