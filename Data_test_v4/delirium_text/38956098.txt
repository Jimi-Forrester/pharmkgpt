38956098|t|Heavy metal concentrations and clinical symptoms in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia related to cigarette smoking.
38956098|a|In our study, blood concentrations of lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and cadmium (Cd) and urine concentrations of thallium (Tl) were measured together with related symptoms of heavy metal poisoning in cigarette smoking volunteers diagnosed with schizophrenia, in cigarette smokers not diagnosed with schizophrenia, and in the control group of non-smokers and not diagnosed with schizophrenia volunteers. Our study was performed on 171 volunteers divided into the following subgroups: patients diagnosed with schizophrenia with at least 1 year of continuous cigarette smoking experience (56 participants), cigarette smokers not diagnosed with schizophrenia with at least one year of continuous smoking experience (58), and control group (not diagnosed with schizophrenia and non-smoking volunteers) (57). Smoking durations of cigarette smokers diagnosed with schizophrenia and cigarette smokers not diagnosed with schizophrenia are not similar (p = 0.431). Blood Pb, As, and Cd concentrations and urine Tl concentrations were the highest in the subgroup of cigarette smokers not diagnosed with schizophrenia, followed by the subgroup of cigarette smokers diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the control group. Only blood Pb concentrations were significantly higher (probability value p < 0.05) in the group of cigarette smokers not diagnosed with schizophrenia (5.16 mug/dL), comparing to the group of cigarette smokers diagnosed with schizophrenia (3.83 mug/dL) and to the control group (3.43 mug/dL). Blood Cd and As concentrations and urine Tl concentrations were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in cigarette smokers not diagnosed with schizophrenia than in the control group. The results revealed a statistically significant positive correlation (p < 0.001) in the cigarette smokers in the schizophrenia diagnosed group between blood Pb, blood As, and urine Tl concentrations and the duration of cigarette smoking.
