20387302|t|Role of progranulin as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease.
20387302|a|Serum or plasma progranulin (GRN) is a highly accurate of GRN-related frontotemporal lobar degeneration, which is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the GRN gene. Both null mutations and missense mutations in GRN have also been observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Here, the evidence for a role of circulating GRN as a biochemical biomarker in neurodegeneration is reviewed, with a specific focus on its relevance in Alzheimer's disease. We conclude that circulating GRN is a promising, nonintrusive biomarker that warrants screening in both patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type and people with mild cognitive impairment; specifically for, but not limited to, those that have a positive family history of neurodegenerative disease. Once a cure for GRN-related neurodegeneration becomes available, this biomarker will be an important tool in the effort to personalize treatment of dementia.
