9248871|a|Sixty-six patients (47 men, 19 women, mean age 65 years) with delirium were treated with mianserin (10-60 mg/day) or haloperidol (2-6 mg/day) at Kurume University Hospital. The clinical effects of these drugs were compared before and after treatment using the Delirium Rating Scale. At the same time, blood was sampled to analyse plasma mianserin, free-3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl(ethylene)glycol (MHPG) and homovanillic acid concentrations. Marked improvement after 1 week was observed in 69.4% of patients undergoing mianserin treatment, and in 70.6% of those receiving haloperidol. A statistically significant difference in the clinical effects of these drugs was not observed. Although improvement in the delirious state and a decrease in the plasma free-MHPG concentration were observed after drug administration, the plasma free-homovanillic acid concentration showed no significant change. The higher plasma free-MHPG concentration in the delirious state suggests the existence of a preparatory state whereby noradrenaline metabolism is involved in the appearance of the abnormal behaviour associated with delirium. These data suggest that free-MHPG concentrations could potentially be used as a predictor of delirium.
