37424964|t|CenTauR: Toward a universal scale and masks for standardizing tau imaging studies.
37424964|a|INTRODUCTION: Recently, an increasing number of tau tracers have become available. There is a need to standardize quantitative tau measures across tracers, supporting a universal scale. We developed several cortical tau masks and applied them to generate a tau imaging universal scale. METHOD: One thousand forty-five participants underwent tau scans with either 18F-flortaucipir, 18F-MK6240, 18F-PI2620, 18F-PM-PBB3, 18F-GTP1, or 18F-RO948. The universal mask was generated from cognitively unimpaired amyloid beta (Abeta)- subjects and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with Abeta+. Four additional regional cortical masks were defined within the constraints of the universal mask. A universal scale, the CenTauRz, was constructed. RESULTS: None of the regions known to display off-target signal were included in the masks. The CenTauRz allows robust discrimination between low and high levels of tau deposits. DISCUSSION: We constructed several tau-specific cortical masks for the AD continuum and a universal standard scale designed to capture the location and degree of abnormality that can be applied across tracers and across centers. The masks are freely available at https://www.gaain.org/centaur-project.
