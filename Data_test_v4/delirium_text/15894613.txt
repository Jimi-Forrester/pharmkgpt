15894613|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (AbetaP) that accumulates in the Alzheimer's diseased brain is derived from proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by means of beta- and gamma-secretases. The beta-secretase APP cleaving enzyme (BACE), which generates the N terminus of AbetaP, has become a target of intense research aimed at blocking the enzyme activity, thus reducing AbetaP and, subsequently, plaque formation. The search for specific inhibitors of beta-secretase activity as a possible treatment for Alzheimer's disease intensified with the discovery that BACE may be involved in processing other non-APP substrates. The presence of the APP-BACE complex in early endosomes highlights the cell surface as a potential therapeutic target, suggesting that interference in APP-BACE interaction at the cell surface may affect amyloid-beta production. We present here a unique approach to inhibit AbetaP production by means of antibodies against the beta-secretase cleavage site of APP. These antibodies were found to bind human APP overexpressed by CHO cells, and the formed immunocomplex was visualized in the early endosomes. Indeed, blocking of the beta-secretase site by these antibodies interfered with BACE activity and inhibited both intracellular and extracellular AbetaP formation in these cells.
