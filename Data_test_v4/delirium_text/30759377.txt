30759377|a|Non-cell-autonomous effects on neuronal cells are considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases but have yet to be mechanistically proven. In this issue of Stem Cell Reports, di Domenico et al. provide direct evidence that alpha-synuclein transferred from astrocytes exerts non-cell-autonomous neuronal dysfunction on dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD).
