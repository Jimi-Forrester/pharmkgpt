37478895|t|Acute Antipsychotic Use and Presence of Dysphagia Among Older Veterans With Heart Failure.
37478895|a|OBJECTIVE: Examine whether new antipsychotic (AP) exposure is associated with dysphagia in hospitalized patients with heart failure (HF). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: AP-naive Veterans hospitalized with HF and subsequently discharged to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) between October 1, 2010, and November 30, 2019. METHODS: We linked Veterans Health Administration (VHA) electronic medical records with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) Minimum Data Set (MDS) version 3.0 assessments and CMS claims. The exposure variable was administration of >=1 dose of a typical or atypical AP during hospitalization. Our main outcome measure was dysphagia presence defined by (1) inpatient dysphagia diagnosis codes and (2) the SNF admission MDS 3.0 swallowing-related items to examine post-acute care dysphagia status. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used for risk adjustment. RESULTS: The analytic cohort consisted of 29,591 Veterans (mean age 78.5 +- 10.0 years; female 2.9%; n = 865). Acute APs were administered to 9.9% (n = 2941). Those receiving APs had differences in prior dementia [37.1%, n = 1091, vs 22.3%, n = 5942; standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.33] and hospital delirium diagnoses (7.7%, n = 227 vs 2.8%, n = 754; SMD = 0.22). Acute AP exposure was associated with nearly double the risk for hospital dysphagia diagnosis codes [adjusted (adj.) relative risk (RR) 1.9, 95% CI 1.8, 2.1]. At the SNF admission MDS assessment, acute AP administration during hospitalization was associated with an increased dysphagia risk (adj. RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0, 1.5) both in the oral (adj. RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2, 2.0) and pharyngeal phases (adj. RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0, 1.7). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In this retrospective study, AP medication exposure was associated with increased dysphagia coding and MDS assessment. Considering other adverse effects, acute AP should be cautiously administered during hospitalization, particularly in those with dementia. Swallowing function is critical to hydration, nutrition, and medical management of HF; therefore, when acute APs are initiated, a swallow evaluation should be considered.
