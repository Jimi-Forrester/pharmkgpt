34611142|t|Targeting the miRNA-155/TNFSF10 network restrains inflammatory response in the retina in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
34611142|a|Age-related disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) share common features such as amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein accumulation. Retinal deposition of Abeta aggregates in AMD patients has suggested a potential link between AMD and AD. In the present study, we analyzed the expression pattern of a focused set of miRNAs, previously found to be involved in both AD and AMD, in the retina of a triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) at different time-points. Several miRNAs were differentially expressed in the retina of 3xTg-AD mice, compared to the retina of age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. In particular, bioinformatic analysis revealed that miR-155 had a central role in miRNA-gene network stability, regulating several pathways, including apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways modulated by TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TNFSF10). We showed that chronic treatment of 3xTg-AD mice with an anti-TNFSF10 monoclonal antibody was able to inhibit the retinal expression of miR-155, which inversely correlated with the expression of its molecular target SOCS-1. Moreover, the fine-tuned mechanism related to TNFSF10 immunoneutralization was tightly linked to modulation of TNFSF10 itself and its death receptor TNFRSF10B, along with cytokine production by microglia, reactive gliosis, and specific AD-related neuropathological hallmarks (i.e., Abeta deposition and Tau phosphorylation) in the retina of 3xTg-AD mice. In conclusion, immunoneutralization of TNFSF10 significantly preserved the retinal tissue in 3xTg-AD mice, suggesting its potential therapeutic application in retinal degenerative disorders.
