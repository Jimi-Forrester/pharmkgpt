11103681|a|Frontotemporal neurodegeneration can cause three typical clinical syndromes: frontotemporal dementia (FTD), primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and semantic dementia (SD). In the present paper we review these syndromes, highlighting FTD. Four case examples are presented. At the early stage of FTD changes of personality and social conduct are prominent, whereas cognitive functions are relatively well preserved. Since the usual dementia tests are not sufficiently sensitive to disclose non-cognitive symptoms, clinical diagnosis as well as differentiation from non-organic psychiatric disorders can be difficult. Detailed history, thorough clinical examination, and neuropsychological testing are required to establish the diagnosis. EEG and functional brain imaging may be helpful. The choice of therapeutic options for FTD is extremely limited. Medications may be used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. There is little experience with non-pharmacologic behaviour modification and milieu treatment approaches. The problems that FTD imposes on caregivers are dissimilar to those arising from Alzheimer's disease. Families receive little or no support so that early nursing home admission of patients is common.
