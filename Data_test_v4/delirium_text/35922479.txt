35922479|t|The economic imperatives for technology enabled wellness centered healthcare.
35922479|a|A 2020 World Health Organization report underscored the impact of rising healthcare spending globally and questioned the long-term economic sustainability of current funding models. Increases in costs associated with care of late-stage irreversible diseases and the increasing prevalence of debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, coupled with increases in life expectancy are likely to overload the healthcare systems in many nations within the next decade if not addressed. One option for sustainability of the healthcare system is a change in emphasis from illness to wellness centered care. An attractive model is the P4 (Predictive, Preventative, Personalized and Participatory) medicine approach. Recent advances in connected health technology can help accelerate this transition; they offer prediction, diagnosis, and monitoring of health-related parameters. We explain how to integrate such technologies with conventional approaches and guide public health policy toward wellness-based care models and strategies to relieve the escalating economic burdens of managed care.
