35950950|t|Characterizing Lewy Pathology in 231 Essential Tremor Brains From the Essential Tremor Centralized Brain Repository.
35950950|a|The Essential Tremor Centralized Brain Repository is the largest repository of prospectively collected essential tremor (ET) brains (n = 231). Hence, we are uniquely poised to address several questions: What proportion of ET cases has Lewy pathology (LP)? What is the nature of that pathology and how does it relate to other comorbidities? Each brain had a complete neuropathological assessment, including alpha-synuclein immunostaining. We created a 10-category classification scheme to fully encapsulate the patterns of LP observed. Four metrics of cerebellar pathology were also quantified. Mean age at death = 89.0 +- 6.4 years. Fifty-eight (25.1%) had LP and 46 (19.9%) had early to late stages of Parkinson disease (PD). LP was very heterogeneous. Of 58 cases with LP, 14 (24.1%) clinically developed possible PD or PD after a latency of 5 or more years. There was a similar degree of cerebellar pathology in ET cases both with and without LP. In summary, 1 in 4 ET cases had LP-a proportion that seems higher than expected based on studies among control populations. Heterogeneous LP likely reflects clinical associations between ET and PD, and ET with Alzheimer disease-type neuropathology. These data further our understanding of ET and its relatedness to other degenerative diseases.
