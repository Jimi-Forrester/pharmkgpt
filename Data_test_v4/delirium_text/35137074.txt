35137074|t|Relationship Between Adipokines, Cognition, and Brain Structures in Old Age Depending on Obesity.
35137074|a|BACKGROUND: Adipokines such as leptin and adiponectin are associated with cognitive function. Although adiposity crucially affects adipokine levels, it remains unclear whether the relationship between adipokines and cognition is influenced by obesity. METHODS: We enrolled 171 participants and divided them into participants with obesity and without obesity to explore the effect of obesity on the relationship between adipokines and cognition. In addition to plasma levels of leptin and adiponectin, multidomain cognitive functions and brain structures were assessed using neuropsychological testing and magnetic resonance imaging. Association between levels of these adipokines and Alzheimer's disease (AD) was then assessed by logistic regression. RESULTS: We found that cognitive function was negatively associated with leptin levels and leptin-to-adiponectin ratio (LAR). Such correlations between leptin and cognitive domains were prominent in participants with obesity but were not observed in those without obesity. Leptin levels were associated with lower hippocampal volumes in participants with obesity. A significant interaction of leptin and obesity was found mostly in the medial temporal lobe. Both leptin and LAR were positively associated with insulin resistance and inflammation markers in all participants. Of note, LAR was associated with a higher risk of AD after adjusting for demographic variables, Apolipoprotein E genotype, and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity might be a factor that determines how adipokines affect brain structure and cognition. Leptin resistance might influence the relationship between adipokines and cognition. In addition, LAR rather than each adipokine levels alone may be a better indicator of AD risk in older adults with metabolic stress.
