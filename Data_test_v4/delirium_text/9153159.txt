9153159|a|As a result of advances in the understanding of neurodegenerative mechanism in Alzheimer's disease, several strategies for the development of disease-modifying treatment are being investigated. Nerve growth factor and other neurotrophins may improve neuronal survival, although targeted delivery remains an obstacle. Modulation of protein processing has the potential to decrease the formation of plaques and tangles. Pharmacologic reduction of oxidative stress and destructive inflammation may slow the rate of neurodegeneration. Continued research into basic mechanisms, along with therapeutic trials of promising drugs, are improving the likelihood that it will soon be possible to slow the progression of this disease.
