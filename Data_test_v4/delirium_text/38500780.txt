38500780|a|Objectives: To ascertain the prevalence and predictors of sleep disorders and poor sleep quality among older adults with Diabetes (DM) in India, and to assess the relationship between sleep quality and DM. Methods: Data was utilized from the nationally representative Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (Wave-1, 2017-18), with a total sample of 66606 older adults (>=45 years) selected for the study. Sleep problems and sleep quality score were assessed using an adaptation based on the Jenkins Sleep Scale. Multivariate linear and logistic regressions were conducted to determine the effect of sociodemographic and clinical factors on sleep quality. Mediation analysis (Karlson-Holm-Breen) was done to assess the direct and indirect effects of independent variables on the sleep quality scores. Further, Propensity score matching (PSM) was done to assess the impact of diabetes on sleep problems. Results: The prevalence of DM was 12.34% (n = 8564, 95% CI: 11.54, 13.20) among whom 24.38% (95% CI: 21.38, 27.65) reported sleep problems. On adjusted analysis, sleep problems were significantly associated with increasing education, higher wealth quintile, lack of physical activity, and multimorbidity. Mediation analysis showed adherence to anti-diabetes medication improved sleep quality (aB = -0.28 (95% CI: -0.54, -0.02)), while comorbidities worsened sleep quality (aB = 0.79 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.92)). Analysis from PSM indicated that DM was associated with a 6.2% higher chance of sleep problems. Conclusions: Poor sleep quality is present in nearly one in four individuals diagnosed with DM in India and linked with certain adverse social determinants. Focused interventions to improve assessment and treatment of sleep problems in resource-limited primary care settings require prioritization.
