37019248|a|The gene encoding proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and its protein product have been widely studied for their role in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. PCSK9 increases the rate of metabolic degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptors, preventing the diffusion of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from plasma into cells and contributes to high lipoprotein-bound cholesterol levels in the plasma. While most research has focused on the regulation and disease relevance of PCSK9 to the cardiovascular system and lipid metabolism, there is a growing body of evidence that PCSK9 plays a crucial role in pathogenic processes in other organ systems, including the central nervous system. PCSK9's impact on the brain is not yet fully understood, though several recent studies have sought to illuminate its impact on various neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, as well as its connection with ischemic stroke. Cerebral PCSK9 expression is low but is highly upregulated during disease states. Among others, PCSK9 is known to play a role in neurogenesis, neural cell differentiation, central LDL receptor metabolism, neural cell apoptosis, neuroinflammation, Alzheimer's Disease, Alcohol Use Disorder, and stroke. The PCSK9 gene contains several polymorphisms, including both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations which profoundly impact normal PCSK9 signaling and cholesterol metabolism. Gain-of-function mutations lead to persistent hypercholesterolemia and poor health outcomes, while loss-of-function mutations generally lead to hypocholesterolemia and may serve as a protective factor against diseases of the liver, cardiovascular system, and central nervous system. Recent genomic studies have sought to identify the end-organ effects of such mutations and continue to identify evidence of a much broader role for PCSK9 in extrahepatic organ systems. Despite this, there remain large gaps in our understanding of PCSK9, its regulation, and its effects on disease risk outside the liver. This review, which incorporates data from a wide range of scientific disciplines and experimental paradigms, is intended to describe PCSK9's role in the central nervous system as it relates to cerebral disease and neuropsychiatric disorders, and to examine the clinical potential of PCSK9 inhibitors and genetic variation in the PCSK9 gene on disease outcomes, including neurological and neuropsychiatric disease.
