34127023|a|BACKGROUND: Despite the steady improvements in survival and operative safety, postoperative complications still remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, less is known on the impact of postoperative complications on health-related quality of life (QoL). The main objective of our study was to investigate the impact of postoperative complications on long-term QoL and survival after CABG surgery. METHODS: Data of 508 patients, who underwent isolated CABG was prospectively collected. The RAND-36 Health Survey (RAND-36) was used to evaluate patients' QoL status preoperatively, 1 year and 12 years after the surgery. Predefined postoperative complications were reported during primary and secondary hospital stay. QoL and survival analysis were performed primarily on three patient groups: patients with and without complications and patients with major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). RESULTS: In total 205(40%) of 508 patients had at least one postoperative complication and 73 (14%) experienced MACCE. Patients' thirty-day, 1-year and 10-year survival rates were, 99, 98, 84% without complications, 97, 95, 72% with complications, and 90, 89, 64% with MACCE, respectively (log-rank p < 0.001). Patients without complications showed significant(p < 0.05) improvements in seven and patients with complications in five out of eight RAND-36 QoL dimensions. All patient groups showed significant improvements in RAND-36 summary scores compared with preoperative values. Patients with complications and especially with MACCE had more profound decline in their RAND-36 summary scores while patients without complications maintained their health status best. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the constant deterioration, both patients with and without complications showed improvements even 12 years after CABG compared with preoperative state. Postoperative complications and especially MACCE were associated with impaired long-term QoL.
