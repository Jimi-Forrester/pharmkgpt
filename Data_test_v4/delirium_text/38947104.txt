38947104|a|Neuroinflammation, toxic protein aggregation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction are key pathways in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Targeting these mechanisms with antioxidants, anti-inflammatory compounds, and inhibitors of Abeta formation and aggregation is crucial for treatment. Marine algae are rich sources of bioactive compounds, including carbohydrates, phenolics, fatty acids, phycobiliproteins, carotenoids, fatty acids, and vitamins. In recent years, they have attracted interest from the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries due to their exceptional biological activities, which include anti-inflammation, antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-apoptosis properties. Multiple lines of evidence have unveiled the potential neuroprotective effects of these multifunctional algal compounds for application in treating and managing AD. This article will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of bioactive compounds derived from algae based on in vitro and in vivo models of neuroinflammation and AD. We will also discuss their potential as disease-modifying and symptomatic treatment strategies for AD.
