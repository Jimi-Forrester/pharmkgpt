30874383|a|Objective: To explore the effectiveness of nano-hydroxyapatite/polyamide-66 (n-HA/PA66) Cage in interbody fusion for degenerative lumbar scoliosis. Methods: A retrospective analysis was designed and conducted for 43 patients, who underwent posterior decompression and n-HA/PA66 Cage interbody fusion with correction of deformity between January 2013 and June 2016. Eighteen cases were single-level fusion (single-level group) and 25 cases were double-level fusion (double-level group). There was no significant difference in gender, age, body mass index, direction of convex, degree of apical rotation, fusion level, the number of osteoporotic patients, pre-operative intervertebral height of fusion segments, coronal Cobb angle, visual analogue score (VAS), and modified Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) between 2 groups ( P>0.05). The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, hospital stay, and complications of the operation were recorded. Modified ODI, VAS score, and MacNab criteria were adopted to assess clinical outcomes. Radiographic indexes, including intervertebral height of fusion segments, coronal Cobb angle, disc insertion depth, and the bone graft fusion rate, were also evaluated. Results: There was no significant difference in operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, and hospital stay between 2 groups ( P>0.05). All patients were followed up 18-62 months (mean, 30.9 months). Wound complications, postoperative delirium, and Cage retropulsion occurred in 4 cases (2 cases in single-level group, 2 cases in double-level group), 1 case of single-level group, and 1 case of double-level group, respectively. The intervertebral height of fusion segments after operation significantly improved compared with preoperative ones in both groups ( P<0.05). At last follow-up, the intervertebral height in double-level group was superior to which in single-level group ( P<0.05). The coronal Cobb angles after operation significantly improved compared with preoperative ones ( P<0.05), and no significant difference was found between 2 groups at each time point ( P>0.05). The disc insertion depth showed no significant difference between different time points after operation in 2 groups ( P>0.05) and between 2 groups at each time point after operation ( P>0.05). Bony fusion was obtained in all patients at last follow-up. The VAS score and modified ODI after operation in both groups were superior to those before operation ( P<0.05). The VAS score in double-level group was higher than that in single-level group ( P<0.05) at last follow-up, and no significant difference was found in VAS score and modified ODI between 2 groups at other time points ( P>0.05). According to the MacNab criteria, the excellent and good rates at last follow-up were 94.4% and 84.0% in single-level group and double-level group, respectively. Conclusion: The n-HA/PA66 Cage can effectively restore and maintain the disc height of fusion segment, normal sequence, and biomechanical stability of the spine, and gain favorable effectivenss for degenerative lumbar scoliosis. And double-level fusion is superior to single-level fusion in maintaining disc height of fusion segment.
