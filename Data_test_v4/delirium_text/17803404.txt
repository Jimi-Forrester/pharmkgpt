17803404|t|Initial experiences with subcutaneous recombinant human hyaluronidase.
17803404|a|We report here our retrospective observations on the use of recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) for the facilitation of subcutaneous hydration and drug infusion. Thirty-two patients were treated with rHuPH20 in a hospice setting over a 6-month period. Of these, 26 received this agent to enhance hypodermoclysis with standard hydration fluids for symptom control of delirium, myoclonus and mild to moderate dehydration. Flow rates up to 500 mL/hr were attained without difficulty. Electrolyte replacement in hydration fluid was achieved without incident in 5 patients receiving potassium and in 1 patient receiving both potassium and magnesium. In addition to use for hydration, 6 patients received recombinant human hyaluronidase to enhance subcutaneous infusion of 9 medications, primarily because the medication dosage required subcutaneous flow rates greater than the standard 3 mL/hr. There were no significant adverse events. Induration at the infusion site occurred in 1 patient receiving hydration and higher than expected serum lidocaine concentration was observed in another patient. Based on our positive initial experience with recombinant human hyaluronidase, there is interest in expanding its use in our facility in both the inpatient and outpatient settings.
