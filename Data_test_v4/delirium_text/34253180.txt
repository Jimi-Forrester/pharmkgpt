34253180|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is an important determinant in health care. In the acute hospital setting cognition has a strong impact on treatment and care. Cognitive impairment can negatively affect diagnostics and treatment success. However, little is known about the individual situation and specific risks of people with cognitive impairments during hospital stays. The aim of the present research is to describe and analyze the treatment needs of people with cognitive impairments in acute hospital care. METHODS: The analyses use baseline data of the ongoing multisite, longitudinal, randomized controlled intervention trial intersec-CM (Supporting elderly people with cognitive impairment during and after hospital stays with Intersectoral Care Management), which recruited 402 participants at baseline. We assessed sociodemographic aspects, cognitive status, functional status, frailty, comorbidities, level of impairment, formal diagnosis of dementia, geriatric diagnoses, delirium, depression, pharmacological treatment, utilization of health care services and health care related needs. RESULTS: The sample under examination had been on average mildly cognitively impaired (MMSE M = 22.3) and had a mild to moderate functional impairment (Barthel Index M = 50.4; HABAM M = 19.1). The Edmonton Frail Scale showed a mean of 7.4 and half of the patients (52.3%) had been assigned a care level. About 46.9% had a geriatric diagnosis, 3.0% had a diagnosis of dementia. According to DSM-V 19.2% of the patients had at least one main symptom of depression. The mean number of regularly taken drugs per patient was 8.2. Utilization of health care services prior to the hospital stay was rather low. On average, the sample showed 4.38 care related needs in general, of which 0.60 needs were unaddressed at the time of assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Descriptive analyses highlight an in-depth insight into impairments and different care needs of people with cognitive impairments. The results emphasize the need for gender-specific analyses as well as an increased attention to the heterogeneity of needs of people with cognitive impairments related to specific wards, settings and regions where they are admitted. Our results indicate also that people with cognitive impairments represent a high proportion of older patients in acute hospital care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The intersec-CM trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT03359408 ).
