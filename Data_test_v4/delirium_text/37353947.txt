37353947|a|AIM: We aimed to assess the effects of cerebral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activation on the glymphatic system and whether this effect was therapeutic for traumatic brain injury (TBI). METHODS: Immunofluorescence was employed to evaluate glymphatic system function. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, microvascular basement membrane, and tight junction expression were assessed using Evans blue extravasation, immunofluorescence, and western blot. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess axonal damage. Neuronal apoptosis was evaluated using Nissl staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and western blot. Cognitive function was assessed using behavioral tests. RESULTS: Cerebral GLP-1R activation restored glymphatic transport following TBI, alleviating BBB disruption and neuronal apoptosis, thereby improving cognitive function following TBI. Glymphatic function suppression by treatment using aquaporin 4 inhibitor TGN-020 abolished the protective effect of the GLP-1R agonist against cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: Cerebral GLP-1R activation can effectively ameliorate neuropathological changes and cognitive impairment following TBI; the underlying mechanism could involve the repair of the glymphatic system damaged by TBI.
