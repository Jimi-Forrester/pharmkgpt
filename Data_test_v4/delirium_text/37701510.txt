37701510|a|Atypical antipsychotic drugs are nowadays the mainstay of treatment of schizophrenia due to their lesser extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) as adverse effects. However, these drugs have different profiles of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Here, the objective of this study was to analyze the probability, occurrences, and more significant involvement of various risk factors. A prospective observational study was carried out on a patient with schizophrenia who has prescribed atypical antipsychotic drugs for their treatment. The probability of the ADR was analyzed by using the Naranjo causality assessment scale. While Glasgow antipsychotic Side effect Scale (GASS) was used to estimate the severity of side effects. Statistical software for social science (SPSS) ver 25; was used for different descriptive statistics and chi-square analysis. A total of 140 patients were included in the study of which the majority (58.57 %) was male. However, atypical antipsychotic drugs were primarily prescribed to the patient as mono therapy (81.43 %). Interestingly, COVID-19 infections were reported as positive in 39.29 % of total patients. Probability assessment of ADRs revealed that most (55 %) were "Probable". Subsequently, the GASS score was evaluated for severity, the majority (55.71 %) were reported as "Mild". The statistically significant association between gender and severity of side effects & duration of illness and severity of side effects were found (P>0.5).The Present study aids in knowing the risk factors and improving the management practices of ADR, thereby improving the guidelines in terms of safe clinical approaches for psychiatric patients.
