37509038|t|A Mild Dose of Aspirin Promotes Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Working Memory in Experimental Ageing Mice.
37509038|a|Aspirin has been reported to prevent memory decline in the elderly population. Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus has been recognized as an underlying basis of learning and memory. This study investigated the effect of aspirin on spatial memory in correlation with the regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis and microglia in the brains of ageing experimental mice. Results from the novel object recognition (NOR) test, Morris water maze (MWM), and cued radial arm maze (cued RAM) revealed that aspirin treatment enhances working memory in experimental mice. Further, the co-immunohistochemical assessments on the brain sections indicated an increased number of doublecortin (DCX)-positive immature neurons and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)/neuronal nuclei (NeuN) double-positive newly generated neurons in the hippocampi of mice in the aspirin-treated group compared to the control group. Moreover, a reduced number of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule (Iba)-1-positive microglial cells was evident in the hippocampus of aspirin-treated animals. Recently, enhanced activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in circulation has been identified as an indicative biomarker of dementia. The biochemical assessment in the blood of aspirin-treated mice showed decreased activity of AChE in comparison with that of the control group. Results from this study revealed that aspirin facilitates hippocampal neurogenesis which might be linked to enhanced working memory.
