33383658|t|Neuronal Metabolism and Neuroprotection: Neuroprotective Effect of Fingolimod on Menadione-Induced Mitochondrial Damage.
33383658|a|Imbalance in the oxidative status in neurons, along with mitochondrial damage, are common characteristics in some neurodegenerative diseases. The maintenance in energy production is crucial to face and recover from oxidative damage, and the preservation of different sources of energy production is essential to preserve neuronal function. Fingolimod phosphate is a drug with neuroprotective and antioxidant actions, used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. This work was performed in a model of oxidative damage on neuronal cell cultures exposed to menadione in the presence or absence of fingolimod phosphate. We studied the mitochondrial function, antioxidant enzymes, protein nitrosylation, and several pathways related with glucose metabolism and glycolytic and pentose phosphate in neuronal cells cultures. Our results showed that menadione produces a decrease in mitochondrial function, an imbalance in antioxidant enzymes, and an increase in nitrosylated proteins with a decrease in glycolysis and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. All these effects were counteracted when fingolimod phosphate was present in the incubation media. These effects were mediated, at least in part, by the interaction of this drug with its specific S1P receptors. These actions would make this drug a potential tool in the treatment of neurodegenerative processes, either to slow progression or alleviate symptoms.
