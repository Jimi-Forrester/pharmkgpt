28607377|a|Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive retinal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular deposits known as drusen. A major constituent of drusen deposits are Alzheimer disease-associated amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides. To understand the etiology of Abeta proteostasis in AMD, we delivered recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding Abeta42 and Abeta40 peptides fused to BRI2 protein by intraocular injection in C57BL/6J mice. Endogenous protease cleavage of such constructs leads to production of secreted Abeta42 and Abeta40 respectively. We demonstrate that overexpression of secreted Abeta40 or Abeta42 resulted in dramatic induction of drusen-like deposits by 2 months' post-injection. These drusen-like deposits were immunopositive for Abeta and complement proteins but did not stain for conventional amyloid dyes, such as Thioflavin S. Both injected cohorts showed gliosis and degenerative changes, though ERG responses were minimally affected. Intriguingly, simultaneous overexpression of BRI-Abeta40 or BRI-Abeta42 together resulted in dose-dependent and cumulative changes reminiscent of AMD type pathology - drusen-like deposits, severe reduction in ERG responses, photoreceptor cell loss and gliosis. Here, we have established a physiological model of Abeta containing deposits in wild-type mice that recapitulates major retinal pathophysiological features of AMD and will be instrumental in mechanistic understanding and development of therapeutic strategies against AMD.
