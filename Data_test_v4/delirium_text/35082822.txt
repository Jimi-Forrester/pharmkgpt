35082822|t|A Survey of Dementia Knowledge and Recognition of Dementia Prevention and Practice in Healthy Older Adults.
35082822|a|AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the level of dementia knowledge and behaviors recognized as dementia-preventive and the practice thereof among healthy older adults who are highly motivated to engage in activities. METHODS: The participants were older adults registered at the Silver Human Resource Center of city A, and participants anonymously filled questionnaires through the aggregation method in January 2020. RESULTS: The analysis included 78 participants (the effective response rate was 49.7%). All participants were aware of at least 4 dementia-preventive behaviors, and about 80% of all participants practiced at least 1 preventive behavior. Approximately 20% of participants were not practicing preventive behaviors at all. The elderly aged 65 to 74 years had more knowledge about dementia and more types of behavior perceived as dementia-preventive than the elderly aged 75 years and older. There was no significant correlation between the level of dementia knowledge and the number of types of dementia-preventive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy older adults were aware of numerous behaviors for dementia prevention, and most older adults practiced preventive behaviors. In contrast, even with a high amount of knowledge about dementia, a small number of healthy older adults did not translate this knowledge into preventative behavioral practices. High levels of dementia knowledge do not translate into preventive behavioral practices.
