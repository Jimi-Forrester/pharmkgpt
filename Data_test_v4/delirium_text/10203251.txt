10203251|t|Frequency of HLA-A and B alleles in early and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
10203251|a|The frequency of various allele types of the class I Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes HLA-A and HLA-B were compared between pathologically confirmed groups of late and early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a control group. DNA was extracted from frozen brain tissue and the highly polymorphic second and third exons of the HLA-A and HLA-B genes were independently PCR amplified using specific primers. Individual allele types were identified using sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. The results showed that the main frequency differences occurred between the late-onset AD and the control group however none of these reached statistical significance.
