35563476|t|Physiological and Pathological Roles of the Cytohesin Family in Neurons.
35563476|a|The cytohesin proteins, consisting of four closely related members (cytohesins-1, -2, -3, and -4), are a subfamily of the Sec7 domain-containing guanine nucleotide exchange factors for ADP ribosylation factors (Arfs), which are critical regulators of membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Recent advances in molecular biological techniques and the development of a specific pharmacological inhibitor for cytohesins, SecinH3, have revealed the functional involvement of the cytohesin-Arf pathway in diverse neuronal functions from the formation of axons and dendrites, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic vesicle recycling, to pathophysiological processes including chronic pain and neurotoxicity induced by proteins related to neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we review the physiological and pathological roles of the cytohesin-Arf pathway in neurons and discuss the future directions of this research field.
