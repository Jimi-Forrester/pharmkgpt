35736946|a|Nicotine-exposed animal models exhibit neurobehavioral changes linked to impaired synaptic plasticity. Previous studies highlighted alterations in neurotransmitter levels following nicotine exposure. Vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT1) and vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (VGAT) are essential for the transport and release of glutamate and GABA, respectively, from presynaptic neurons into synapses. In our work, an e-cigarette device was used to deliver vapor containing nicotine to C57BL/6J mice for four weeks. Novel object recognition, locomotion, and Y-maze tests were performed to investigate the behavioral parameters. Protein studies were conducted to study the hippocampal expression of VGLUT1, VGAT, and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) as well as brain cytokine markers. Long-term memory and locomotion tests revealed that e-cigarette aerosols containing nicotine modulated recognition memory and motor behaviors. We found that vapor exposure increased VGLUT1 expression and decreased VGAT expression in the hippocampus. No alterations were found in PSD95 expression. We observed that vapor-containing nicotine exposure altered certain brain cytokines such as IFNbeta-1 and MCP-5. Our work provides evidence of an association between neurobehavioral changes and altered hippocampal VGLUT1 and VGAT expression in mice exposed to e-cigarette vapors containing nicotine. Such exposure was also associated with altered neurobehaviors, which might affect neurodegenerative diseases.
