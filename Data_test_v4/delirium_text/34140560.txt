34140560|t|Association between ankle brachial index and development of postoperative intensive care unit delirium in patients with peripheral arterial disease.
34140560|a|Patients with vascular diseases are prone to developing postoperative delirium (POD). Ankle brachial index (ABI) is a non-invasive clinical indicator of lower-extremities peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and has been identified as an indicator of cognitive impairment. We investigated the association between ABI and POD. 683 PAD patients who underwent elective leg arterial bypass surgery between October 1998 and August 2019 were collected for retrospective analysis. Demographic information, comorbidities, preoperative ABI and the Rutherford classification within one month prior to surgery were obtained. POD was assessed using the Confusion assessment method -intensive care unit. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis were used to assess the association between ABI and POD. The mean value of ABI was significantly lower in patients with POD than it was those without POD. Older age, more medical comorbidities, longer length of surgery, decreased ABI, and higher Rutherford class were all significantly associated with POD. The area under ROC (0.74) revealed that ABI below 0.35 was associated with development of POD. Lower preoperative ABI was associated with POD in PAD patients who underwent arterial bypass surgery.
