34830687|t|Association between Serum Lipid Parameters and Cognitive Performance in Older Adults.
34830687|a|(1) Background: Previous studies have suggested the association between lipid profiles and cognitive function in older adults. However, they generated inconsistent results. We aim to determine the relationship between lipid profiles and cognitive performance in older adults. (2) Methods: We used the 2011-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. This study included 2215 participants who were aged more than 60 years old and free of coronary heart disease or stroke. Lipid profiles included total cholesterol (TC), low density lipid cholesterol (LDL), high density lipid cholesterol (HDL), and triglyceride (TG). Cognitive function was assessed using the digit symbol substitution test (DSST). (3) Results: Positive correlations of DSST were observed with TC (r = 0.111; p < 0.0001), HDL (r = 0.127; p < 0.0001), and LDL (r = 0.107; p = 0.0005). However, there was no significant relationship between TG and DSST. A one-unit increase in HDL was associated with an increase in DSST score (beta coefficient: 0.036; p = 0.018); but the association was not significant for LDL, TG, and TC.&nbsp;In the categorical analysis,&nbsp;the high HDL group had a higher DSST score than the low HDL group (beta = 3.113; p < 0.0001) and the low TG group was more likely to show a lower DSST score than the high TC group (beta = -1.837; p = 0.0461). However, LDL and TC showed no statistically significant associations.&nbsp;Moreover,&nbsp;HDL was only associated with a 0.701 times increased risk of cognitive impairment (95% CI = 0.523-0.938) in the logistic regression analysis. (4) Conclusions: Higher blood concentrations of HDL levels were positively associated with DSST scores in older adults. We suggest that the high levels of HDL may be a protective factor against cognitive impairment.
