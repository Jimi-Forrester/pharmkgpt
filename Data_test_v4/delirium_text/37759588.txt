37759588|a|The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a vital component of many inflammatory responses. Here, we intended to investigate the involvement of NLRP3 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) and explore its mechanisms. For the first time, we validated elevated NLRP3 expression in the renal tissues of S-AKI patients by immunohistochemistry analysis. Through LPS injection in both wild-type and Nlrp3-/- mice, a S-AKI model was developed. It was found that LPS-induced kidney injury, including an abnormal morphology in a histological examination, abnormal renal function in a laboratory examination, and an increase in the expression of AKI biomarkers, was dramatically reversed in Nlrp3-deficient mice. Nlrp3 deletion alleviated renal inflammation, as evidenced by the suppression of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. A combinative analysis of RNA sequencing and the FerrDb V2 database showed that Nlrp3 knockout regulated multiple metabolism pathways and ferroptosis in LPS-induced S-AKI. Further qPCR coupled with Prussian blue staining demonstrated that Nlrp3 knockout inhibited murine renal ferroptosis, indicating a novel mechanism involving S-AKI pathogenesis by NLRP3. Altogether, the aforementioned findings suggest that Nlrp3 deficiency alleviates LPS-induced S-AKI by reducing renal inflammation and ferroptosis. Our data highlight that NLRP3 is a potential therapeutic target for S-AKI.
