38706716|a|Introduction: Advances in digital technologies for health research enable opportunities for digital phenotyping of individuals in research and clinical settings. Beyond providing opportunities for advanced data analytics with data science and machine learning approaches, digital technologies offer solutions to several of the existing barriers in research practice that have resulted in biased samples. Methods: A participant-driven, precision brain health monitoring digital platform has been introduced to two longitudinal cohort studies, the Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (BU ADRC) and the Bogalusa Heart Study (BHS). The platform was developed with prioritization of digital data in native format, multiple OS, validity of derived metrics, feasibility and usability. A platform including nine remote technologies and three staff-guided digital assessments has been introduced in the BU ADRC population, including a multimodal smartphone application also introduced to the BHS population. Participants select which technologies they would like to use and can manipulate their personal platform and schedule over time. Results: Participants from the BU ADRC are using an average of 5.9 technologies to date, providing strong evidence for the usability of numerous digital technologies in older adult populations. Broad phenotyping of both cohorts is ongoing, with the collection of data spanning cognitive testing, sleep, physical activity, speech, motor activity, cardiovascular health, mood, gait, balance, and more. Several challenges in digital phenotyping implementation in the BU ADRC and the BHS have arisen, and the protocol has been revised and optimized to minimize participant burden while sustaining participant contact and support. Discussion: The importance of digital data in its native format, near real-time data access, passive participant engagement, and availability of technologies across OS has been supported by the pattern of participant technology use and adherence across cohorts. The precision brain health monitoring platform will be iteratively adjusted and improved over time. The pragmatic study design enables multimodal digital phenotyping of distinct clinically characterized cohorts in both rural and urban U.S. settings.
