39062993|t|Morphogenetic Designs, and Disease Models in Central Nervous System Organoids.
39062993|a|Since the emergence of the first cerebral organoid (CO) in 2013, advancements have transformed central nervous system (CNS) research. Initial efforts focused on studying the morphogenesis of COs and creating reproducible models. Numerous methodologies have been proposed, enabling the design of the brain organoid to represent specific regions and spinal cord structures. CNS organoids now facilitate the study of a wide range of CNS diseases, from infections to tumors, which were previously difficult to investigate. We summarize the major advancements in CNS organoids, concerning morphogenetic designs and disease models. We examine the development of fabrication procedures and how these advancements have enabled the generation of region-specific brain organoids and spinal cord models. We highlight the application of these organoids in studying various CNS diseases, demonstrating the versatility and potential of organoid models in advancing our understanding of complex conditions. We discuss the current challenges in the field, including issues related to reproducibility, scalability, and the accurate recapitulation of the in vivo environment. We provide an outlook on prospective studies and future directions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art CNS organoid research, highlighting key developments, current challenges, and prospects in the field.
