36128740|t|Landscapes of synchronous multiple primary cancers detected by next-generation sequencing.
36128740|a|An increase in the detection rate of multiple primary cancers has been accompanied with declining cancer death rates over the past few decades. However, synchronous multiple primary tumors have gradually increased, and the molecular mechanisms involved in the synchronous occurrence of multiple primary cancers of different origins are unclear. To investigate these mechanisms, we sequenced cancer tissues by FoundationOne CDx. Data were annotated with annovar, and we then performed pathway enrichment analysis. A total of 109 genes that were mutated in all samples were clustered into different diseases, biological processes, and molecular functions. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the P53 and PKB signaling pathways may be relevant to the occurrence of synchronous multiple primary cancers. In summary, patients with a concordance of mutations in pathogenetic genes may have a higher risk of developing a second cancer. Our research may provide a basis for the development of individualized treatments for synchronous multiple primary cancers.
