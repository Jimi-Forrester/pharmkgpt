37227581|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the association between pain and cognitive decline or impairment have yielded mixed results, while studies from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) or specifically on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are scarce. Thus, we investigated the association between pain and MCI in LMICs and quantified the extent to which perceived stress, sleep/energy problems, and mobility limitations explain the pain/MCI relationship. METHODS: Data analysis of cross-sectional data from six LMICs from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) were performed. MCI was based on the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association criteria. "Overall in the last 30 days, how much of bodily aches or pain did you have?" was the question utilized to assess pain. Associations were examined by multivariable logistic regression analysis and meta-analysis. RESULTS: Data on 32,715 individuals aged 50 years and over were analysed [mean (SD) age 62.1 (15.6) years; 51.7% females]. In the overall sample, compared to no pain, mild, moderate, and severe/extreme pain were dose-dependently associated with 1.36 (95% CI = 1.18-1.55), 2.15 (95% CI = 1.77-2.62), and 3.01 (95% CI = 2.36-3.85) times higher odds for MCI, respectively. Mediation analysis showed that perceived stress, sleep/energy problems, and mobility limitations explained 10.4%, 30.6%, and 51.5% of the association between severe/extreme pain and MCI. CONCLUSIONS: Among middle-aged to older adults from six LMICs, pain was associated with MCI dose-dependently, and sleep problems and mobility limitations were identified as potential mediators. These findings raise the possibility of pain as a modifiable risk factor for developing MCI.
