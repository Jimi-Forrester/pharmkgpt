9253062|a|For some patients, a chronic disability occurs suddenly, such as when it is the result of an accident or a stroke. For others, the development of a disability is a gradual process, the result of a disease process such as multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease. Regardless of whether a person becomes disabled slowly or gradually, a variety of psychological dynamics are involved. Because a loss has occurred, all disabled patients experience grief and go through denial, depression and the struggle for reintegration. It is essential that the radiology staff carefully assess each patient's feelings and encourage him or her to take control of life. Disabled people do not need to remain in the grieving stage forever. They can learn to adjust and adapt, and the radiologic technologist can help by providing support and encouragement. If the technologist knows what to expect and understands how to react, even the briefest encounter in the radiology department can have a positive effect on the patient's adjustment.
