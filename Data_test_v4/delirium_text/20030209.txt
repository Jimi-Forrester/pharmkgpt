20030209|a|The TDP-43 proteinopathies: Toward understanding of the molecular pathogenesis. TAR DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein was identified as a major component of ubiquitin-positive inclusions in FTLD and ALS, and the concept of TDP-43 proteinopathies was proposed. Immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses using multiple anti-phosphorylated TDP-43 antibodies revealed that hyperphosphorylated 18-26 kDa C-terminal fragments in addition to the full-length TDP-43 are major constituents of inclusions in FTLD-U and ALS. Recent discovery of mutations in the TDP-43 gene in familial and sporadic ALS, indicating that abnormality of TDP-43 protein cause neurodegeneration. It also strongly suggests that aggregation of TDP-43 or the process is responsible for neurodegeneration in FTLD-U and ALS. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of aggregation of TDP-43, we have established two cellular models for intracellular aggregates of TDP-43 similar to those in brains of TDP-43 proteinopathies patients. The first consists of SH-SY5Y cells expressing mutant TDP-43 that lacks both the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and residues 187-192 (deltaNLS & 187-192). The second model consists of SH-SY5Y cells expressing an aggregation-prone TDP-43 C-terminal fragment as a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fusion. In these cells, round structures positive for both anti-pS409/410 and anti-Ub are observed. These results suggest that intracellular localization of TDP-43, truncation of TDP-43 and proteasomal dysfunction of cells may be involved in the pathological process of TDP-43 proteinopathies. We also found that two small compounds that have been reported to be beneficial in phase II clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease, inhibited the formation of TDP-43 aggregates in these two cellular models, suggesting that these compounds may be effective for the treatment of ALS and FTLD-U.
