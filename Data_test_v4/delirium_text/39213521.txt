39213521|t|Repurposing Anakinra for Alzheimer's Disease: The In Vitro and In Vivo Effects of Anakinra on LPS- and AC-Induced Neuroinflammation.
39213521|a|Alzheimer's disease is a significant global health issue, and studies suggest that neuroinflammation plays a vital role in the advancement of this disease. In this study, anakinra has been shown to display a time- and concentration-dependent antineuroinflammatory effect. In the in vitro studies, it diminished the gene expressions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) synthase 2 stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Anakinra also reduced the LPS-induced production of NO and reactive oxygen species. Thus, the hypertrophic state of LPS-activated BV2 microglial cells was reversed by anakinra. Furthermore, acrylamide (ACR)-induced activation of nuclear transcription factor-kappaB, TNF-alpha, and interleukin-1beta was downregulated, while cAMP response element binding protein and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression levels were markedly enhanced in ACR-treated zebrafish larvae. It was also observed that anakinra improved the uncoordinated swimming behaviors in ACR-exposed zebrafish larvae. Overall, anakinra demonstrated potential antineuroinflammatory and antioxidative effects.
