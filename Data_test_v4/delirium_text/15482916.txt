15482916|t|Discovery and SAR of 2-aminothiazole inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 5/p25 as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
15482916|a|High-throughput screening with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5)/p25 led to the discovery of N-(5-isopropyl-thiazol-2-yl)isobutyramide (1). This compound is an equipotent inhibitor of cdk5 and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2)/cyclin E (IC(50)=ca. 320nM). Parallel and directed synthesis techniques were utilized to explore the SAR of this series. Up to 60-fold improvements in potency at cdk5 and 12-fold selectivity over cdk2 were achieved.
