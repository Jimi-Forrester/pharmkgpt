28024995|a|INTRODUCTION: Recent literature proposes that amyloid beta (Abeta) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) synergism accelerates biomarker abnormalities in controls. Yet, it remains to be answered whether this synergism is the driving force behind Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia. METHODS: We stratified 314 mild cognitive impairment individuals using [18F]florbetapir positron emission tomography Abeta imaging and cerebrospinal fluid p-tau. Regression and voxel-based logistic regression models with interaction terms evaluated 2-year changes in cognition and clinical status as a function of baseline biomarkers. RESULTS: We found that the synergism between [18F]florbetapir and p-tau, rather than their additive effects, was associated with the cognitive decline and progression to AD. Furthermore, voxel-based analysis revealed that temporal and inferior parietal were the regions where the synergism determined an increased likelihood of developing AD. DISCUSSION: Together, the present results support that progression to AD dementia is driven by the synergistic rather than a mere additive effect between Abeta and p-tau proteins.
