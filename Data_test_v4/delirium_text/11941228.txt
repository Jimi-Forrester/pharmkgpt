11941228|t|Post-ECT Delirium.
11941228|a|A confusional state accompanied by restlessness is a frequent occurrence at the end of an induced seizure in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Delirium, which usually lasts <1 h, occurs in up to 12% of patients. It is most frequent during the initial treatments of a series. The occurrence of delirium in one treatment is not a harbinger of its reappearance in later treatments. Usually gentle reassurance is sufficient to help the patient, but some instances warrant the administration of diazepam, midazolam, a barbiturate, or droperidol.
