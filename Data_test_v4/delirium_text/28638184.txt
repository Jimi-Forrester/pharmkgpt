28638184|t|An analysis of factors influencing drinking relapse among patients with alcohol-induced psychiatric and behavioral disorders.
28638184|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with alcohol-induced psychiatric and behavioral disorders have higher drinking relapse rates after treatment when compared to those without these disorders. AIM: To investigate factors influencing drinking relapse among patients with alcohol-induced psychiatric and behavioral disorders and provide guidance for rehabilitative intervention for those being treated for substance use disorders. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned into either the study group or the control group. We used Chi-square test to analyze their general demographics, drinking history, and hospitalizations. Factors influencing the relapse were analyzed by logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The univariate analysis showed that factors included ethnicity, level of education, occupation, marital status, duration of psychiatric symptoms and deception about alcohol use; multivariate analysis showed that marital status, duration of psychiatric symptoms, and deception about alcohol use were correlated with relapse among patients with psychiatric and behavioral disorders. CONCLUSIONS: For patients who were single, psychiatric symptoms were more likely to occur between the first and fifth year of alcohol consumption, and those who were deceptive about their alcohol use were more likely to have a relapse than those who were not.
