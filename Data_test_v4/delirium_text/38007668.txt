38007668|t|Sleep Quality and Cognitive Decline Across the Adult Age Range: Findings from the Maastricht Aging Study (MAAS).
38007668|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances have been linked with cognitive decline and a higher risk of dementia. However, there is a lack of studies with sufficient follow-up duration, a detailed neuropsychological assessment and adequate control of main confounders. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between self-reported sleep quality and cognitive decline over 12 years in cognitively healthy individuals from the general population. METHODS: We used data from the Maastricht Aging Study (MAAS), a Dutch population-based prospective cohort study of 1,823 community-dwelling adults aged 24 to 82 years at baseline. Cognitive performance was measured at baseline, 6 and 12 years on verbal memory, executive functions, and information processing speed. Sleep quality was assessed at baseline using the sleep subscale score of the 90-item Symptom Checklist (SCL-90). Additional modifiable dementia risk factors were summarized in the LIfestyle for BRAin health (LIBRA) risk score. Weighted linear mixed models tested the association between continuous scores and tertiles of subjective sleep quality and change in cognitive performances over time. Models were adjusted for age, gender, educational level, LIBRA, and use of hypnotic (sleep) medication. RESULTS: Worse sleep quality was associated with faster decline in processing speed. At older age (>=65 years), it was also associated with faster decline in verbal memory. Association were independent of other modifiable dementia risk factors and use of hypnotic medication. Directionally similar but non-significant associations were found between worse sleep quality and executive functions. CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study across the adult age range, poor self-reported sleep was associated with accelerated cognitive decline.
