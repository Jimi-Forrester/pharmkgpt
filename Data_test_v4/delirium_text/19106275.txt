19106275|t|100 years after Alzheimer: contemporary neurology practice assessment of referrals for dementia.
19106275|a|BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dementia is placing an increased burden on specialists. METHODS: Canadian neurologists responded to a structured questionnaire to assess reasons for referral and services provided as well as to compare the neurologists' perceptions of their practice characteristics against cases seen over a 3-month period. RESULTS: The audit confirmed the participants' perception that family practitioners are the main referral source (358/453, 79%). Sixty-two percent of patients had undergone clinical investigation for dementia prior to being seen by the neurologist; 39% (177/453) were on pharmacotherapy at the time of referral, 68% were initiated on pharmacotherapy by the neurologist. A fifth of the referrals did not meet clinical criteria for dementia, which may be directly related to the prevalence of prior workup that did not include mental status testing. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologists currently treat patients referred for dementia who may already have been adequately evaluated and treated by primary care providers.
