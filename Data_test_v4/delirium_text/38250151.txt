38250151|a|Osteosarcoma is an extremely aggressive bone cancer with poor prognosis. Nepsilon-(1-Carboxymethyl)-L-lysine (CML), an advanced glycation end product (AGE), can link to cancer progression, tumorigenesis and metastasis, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The role of CML in osteosarcoma progression is still unclear. We hypothesized that CML could promote migration, invasion, and stemness in osteosarcoma cells. CML and its receptor (RAGE; receptor for AGE) were higher expressed at advanced stages in human osteosarcoma tissues. In mouse models, which streptozotocin was administered to induce CML accumulation in the body, the subcutaneous tumor growth was not affected, but the tumor metastasis using tail vein injection model was enhanced. In cell models (MG63 and U2OS cells), CML enhanced tumor sphere formation and acquisition of cancer stem cell characteristics, induced migration and invasion abilities, as well as triggered the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process, which were associated with RAGE expression and activation of downstream signaling pathways, especially the ERK/NFkappaB pathway. RAGE inhibition elicited CML-induced cell migration, invasion, and stemness through RAGE-mediated ERK/NFkappaB pathway. These results revealed a crucial role for CML in driving stemness and metastasis in osteosarcoma. These findings uncover a potential CML/RAGE connection and mechanism to osteosarcoma progression and set the stage for further investigation.
