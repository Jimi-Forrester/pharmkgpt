35895572|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In addition to the pulmonary manifestations, COVID-19 patients may present a wide range of neurological disorders as extrapulmonary presentations. In this view, several studies have recently documented the worsening of neurological symptoms within COVID-19 morbidity in patients previously diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Moreover, several cases have also been reported in which the patients presented parkinsonian features after initial COVID-19 symptoms. These data raise a major concern about the possibility of communication between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the initiation and/or worsening of NDs. In this review, we have collected compelling evidence suggesting SARS-CoV-2, as an environmental factor, may be capable of developing NDs. In this respect, the possible links between SARS-CoV-2 infection and molecular pathways related to most NDs and the pathophysiological mechanisms of the NDs such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis will be explained.
