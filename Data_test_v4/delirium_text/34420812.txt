34420812|t|Neuromonitoring and Neurocognitive Outcomes in Cardiac Surgery: A Narrative Review.
34420812|a|Neurocognitive dysfunction after cardiac surgery can present with diverse clinical phenotypes, which include postoperative delirium, postoperative cognitive dysfunction, and stroke, and it presents a significant healthcare burden for both patients and providers. Neurologic monitoring during cardiac surgery includes several modalities assessing cerebral perfusion and oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy, transcranial Doppler and jugular venous bulb saturation monitoring) and those that measure cerebral function (processed and unprocessed electroencephalogram), reflecting an absence of a single, definitive neuromonitor. This narrative review briefly describes the technologic basis of these neuromonitoring modalities, before exploring their use in clinical practice, both as tools to predict neurocognitive dysfunction, and with a bundle of interventions designed to optimize cerebral oxygen supply, with the aim of reducing postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction following cardiac surgery.
