32372046|t|The Influence of Listening to Music on Adults with Left-behind Experience Revealed by EEG-based Connectivity.
32372046|a|The human brain has a close relationship with music. Music-induced structural and functional brain changes have been demonstrated in the healthy adult. In the present study, adults with left-behind experience (ALB) were divided into two groups. The experimental group (ALB-E) took part in the music therapy experiment with three stages, including before listening to music (pre-stage), initially listening to music (mid-stage) and after listening to music (post-stage). The control group (ALB-C) did not participate in music therapy. Scalp resting-state EEGs of ALB were recorded during the three stages. We found no significant frequency change in the ALB-C group. In the ALB-E group, only the theta power spectrum was significantly different at all stages. The topographical distributions of the theta power spectrum represented change in trends from the frontal regions to the occipital regions. The result of Granger causal analysis (GCA), based on theta frequency, showed a stronger information flow from the middle frontal gyrus to the middle temporal gyrus (MFG   MTG) in the left hemisphere at the pre-stage compared to the post-stage. Additionally, the experimental group showed a weaker information flow from inferior gyrus to superior temporal gyrus (IFG   STG) in the right hemisphere at post-test stage compared to the ALB-C group. Our results demonstrate that listening to music can play a positive role on improving negative feelings for individuals with left behind experience.
