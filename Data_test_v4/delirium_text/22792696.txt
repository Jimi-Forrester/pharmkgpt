22792696|a|Thousands of patients fall on hospital wards each year, leading to potentially devastating consequences for them and their families. Falls among inpatients usually arise from a complex combination of risk factors, including dementia, delirium, incontinence and medication. This article discusses the FallSafe project that aimed to reduce falls in inpatient settings. The results suggested a 25 per cent reduction in falls on average across the wards involved. The project also had a positive effect on patients and staff. A case study of a staff nurse involved in leading the project on her ward and the care bundle that comprised the project intervention are explored.
