34441000|t|Care of Geriatric Patients with Lumbar Spine, Pelvic, and Acetabular Fractures before and after Certification as a Geriatric Trauma Center DGU : A Retrospective Cohort Study.
34441000|a|Background: More than 750,000 fragility fractures occur in Germany every year, with an expected increase in the following years. Interdisciplinary care pathways for geriatric patients are increasingly established to improve the treatment process and outcome, but there has been only limited evaluation of their use. Objectives: This study aimed to compare patient care before and after the implementation of a geriatric trauma center (GTC) in conformity with the German Society for Trauma Surgery (DGU ). Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective single-center cohort study, including 361 patients >70 years old with lumbar spine, pelvic, and acetabular fractures, admitted between January 2012 and September 2019. Patients were divided into a usual care cohort (UC, n = 137) before implementation and an ortho-geriatric care cohort (OGC, n = 224) after implementation of the GTC DGU . We recorded and compared demographic data, fracture type, geriatric assessment and management, therapy, complications, and various clinical parameters, e.g., length of stay, time to surgery, hours admitted to ICU, and change in walking ability. Results: The geriatric assessment revealed significant geriatric co-morbidities and a need for geriatric intervention in 75% of the patients. With orthogeriatric co-management, a significant increase in the detection of urological complications (UC: 25.5% vs. OGC: 37.5%; p = 0.021), earlier postoperative mobilization (UC: 57.1% vs. OGC: 86.3%; p < 0.001), an increased prescription of anti-osteoporotic treatment at discharge (UC: 13.1% vs. OGC: 46.8%; p < 0.001), and lower rates of revision surgery (UC: 5.8% vs. OGC: 3.1%; p = 0.012) could be seen. Conclusions: Our results emphasize the improvement in patient care and clinical outcome by implementing a GTC DGU  and provide opportunities for future improvement in ortho-geriatric patient care.
