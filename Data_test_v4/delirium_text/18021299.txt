18021299|a|The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1beta is up-regulated in microglial cells surrounding amyloid plaques, leading to the hypothesis that IL-1beta is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. However, we unexpectedly found that IL-1beta significantly enhanced alpha-cleavage, indicated by increases in sAPPalpha and C83, but reduced beta-cleavage, indicated by decreases in sAPPbeta and Abeta40/42, in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. IL-1beta did not significantly alter the mRNA levels of BACE1, ADAM-9, and ADAM-10, but up-regulated that of TACE by threefold. The proform and mature form of TACE protein were also significantly up-regulated. A TACE inhibitor (TAPI-2) concomitantly reversed the IL-1beta-dependent increase in sAPPalpha and decrease in sAPPbeta, suggesting that APP consumption in the alpha-cleavage pathway reduced its consumption in the beta-cleavage pathway. IL-1Ra, a physiological antagonist for the IL-1 receptor, reversed the effects of IL-1beta, suggesting that the IL-1beta-dependent up-regulation of alpha-cleavage is mediated by the IL-1 receptor. IL-1beta also induced this concomitant increase in alpha-cleavage and decrease in beta-cleavage in mouse primary cultured neurons. Taken together we conclude that IL-1beta is an anti-amyloidogenic factor, and that enhancement of its signaling or inhibition of IL-1Ra activity could represent potential therapeutic strategies against Alzheimer's disease.
