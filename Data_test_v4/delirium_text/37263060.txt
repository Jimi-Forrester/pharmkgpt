37263060|t|Vitamin C: From nutrition to oxygen sensing and epigenetics.
37263060|a|Vitamin C is unbeatable - at least when it comes to sales. Of all the vitamin preparations, those containing vitamin C sell best. This is surprising because vitamin C deficiency is extremely rare. Nevertheless, there is still controversy about whether the additional intake of vitamin C supplements is essential for our health. In this context, the possible additional benefit is in most cases merely reduced to the known effect as an antioxidant. However, new findings in recent years on the mechanisms of oxygen-sensing and epigenetic control underpin the multifaceted role of vitamin C in a biological context and have therefore renewed interest in it. In the present article, therefore, known facts are linked to these new key data. In addition, available clinical data on vitamin C use of cancer therapy are summarized.
