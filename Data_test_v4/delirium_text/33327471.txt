33327471|t|Surgical Diseases in North Korea: An Overview of North Korean Medical Journals.
33327471|a|Information regarding surgical diseases in North Korea is not fully reported despite their clear clinical significance. The current study aimed to indirectly assess the contemporary research trends and medical infrastructure related to surgical diseases in North Korea. We analyzed and categorized articles from the journal Surgery that were published during the Kim Jong-un era (2012-2018). The framework for categorization was primarily based on disease entities, surgical specialty, and research methodology. A total of 1792 articles in 28 issues were included in the current study. The frequency of detailed surgical cases and their associated characteristics based on their specialty were investigated. The types of medical imaging techniques and anesthetics that were commonly utilized in clinical fields in North Korea were also evaluated. A large proportion of essential surgeries were covered, with the exception of those for congenital diseases; however, a lack of surgical techniques and infrastructure was revealed. Going forward, further evaluation of the surgical system and a greater focus on non-communicable diseases in North Korea are needed.
