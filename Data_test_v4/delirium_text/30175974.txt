30175974|t|Assessing Mild Behavioral Impairment with the Mild Behavioral Impairment-Checklist in People with Mild Cognitive Impairment.
30175974|a|BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are non-cognitive, behavioral, or psychiatric symptoms, common in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and associated with a higher risk of dementia. Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) is a validated diagnostic entity, that describes the emergence of later life NPS in pre-dementia states. The Mild Behavioral Impairment Checklist (MBI-C) is the first measure developed to assess MBI. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of MBI in people with MCI and to study the score distribution, sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic utility of the MBI-C, and its correlations with neuropsychological tests. METHODS: One hundred eleven MCI participants were evaluated with the Questionnaire for Subjective Memory Complaints (QSMC), Mini-Mental State Examination, Cambridge Cognitive Assessment-Revised, Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q), Geriatric Depression Scale-15 items (GDS-15), Lawton and Brody Index, and the MBI-C, which was administered by phone to participants' informants. Descriptive, logistic regression, ROC curve, and bivariate correlations analyses were performed. RESULTS: MBI diagnosis prevalence was 14.2%. The total MBI-C score differentiated people with MBI at a cutoff-point of 6.5, optimizing sensitivity and specificity. MBI-C total score correlated positively with NPI-Q, QSMC, GDS-15, and Lawton and Brody Index. CONCLUSION: The total MBI-C score, obtained by phone administration, is sensitive for detecting MBI in people with MCI. The MBI-C scores indicated that MCI participants had subtle NPS that were correlated to their subjective memory complaints reported by informants, depressive symptoms, and negatively with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Further research should be done to clarify the predictive role of NPS in MCI for incident dementia.
