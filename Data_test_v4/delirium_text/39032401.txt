39032401|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes a major global health issue, characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment, for which no curative treatment is currently available. Current therapeutic approaches are focused on symptom management, highlighting the critical need for disease-modifying therapy. The hallmark pathology of AD involves the aggregation and accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain. Consequently, drug discovery efforts in recent decades have centered on the Abeta aggregation cascade, which includes the transition of monomeric Abeta peptides into toxic oligomers and, ultimately, mature fibrils. Historically, anti-Abeta strategies focused on the clearance of amyloid fibrils using monoclonal antibodies. However, substantial evidence has highlighted the critical role of Abeta oligomers (AbetaOs) in AD pathogenesis. Soluble AbetaOs are now recognized as more toxic than fibrils, directly contributing to synaptic impairment, neuronal damage, and the onset of AD. Targeting AbetaOs has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach to mitigate cognitive decline in AD. Natural products (NPs) have demonstrated promise against AbetaO neurotoxicity through various mechanisms, including preventing AbetaO formation, enhancing clearance mechanisms, or converting AbetaOs into non-toxic species. Understanding the mechanisms by which anti-AbetaO NPs operate is useful for developing disease-modifying treatments for AD. In this review, we explore the role of NPs in mitigating AbetaO neurotoxicity for AD drug discovery, summarizing key evidence from biophysical methods, cellular assays, and animal models. By discussing how NPs modulate AbetaO neurotoxicity across various experimental systems, we aim to provide valuable insights into novel therapeutic strategies targeting AbetaOs in AD.
