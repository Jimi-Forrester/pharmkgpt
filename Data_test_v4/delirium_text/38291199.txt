38291199|a|This study investigates the potential of ellagic acid (EA), a phytochemical with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, in managing perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND). PND, which represents a spectrum of cognitive impairments often faced by elderly patients, is principally linked to surgical and anesthesia procedures, and heavily impacted by oxidative stress in the hippocampus and microglia-induced neuroinflammation. Employing an aged mice model subjected to abdominal surgery, we delve into EA's ability to counteract postoperative oxidative stress and cerebral inflammation by engaging the Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) pathway. Our findings revealed that administering EA orally notably alleviated post-surgical cognitive decline in older mice, a fact that was manifested in improved performance during maze tests. This enhancement in the behavioral performance of the EA-treated mice corresponded with the rejuvenation of IGF-1 signaling, a decrease in oxidative stress markers in the hippocampus (like MDA and carbonylated protein), and an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and CAT. Alongside these, we observed a decrease in microglia-driven neuroinflammation in the hippocampus, thus underscoring the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory roles of EA. Interestingly, when EA was given in conjunction with an IGF1R inhibitor, these benefits were annulled, accentuating the pivotal role that the IGF-1 pathway plays in the neuroprotective potential of EA. Hence, EA could serve as a potent candidate for safeguarding against PND in older patients by curbing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation through the activation of the IGF-1 pathway.
