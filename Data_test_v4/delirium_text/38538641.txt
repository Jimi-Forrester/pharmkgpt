38538641|a|Major depressive disorder (MDD) is accompanied by activated neuro-immune pathways, increased physiosomatic and chronic fatigue-fibromyalgia (FF) symptoms. The most severe MDD phenotype, namely major dysmood disorder (MDMD), is associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and negative life events (NLEs) which induce cytokines/chemokines/growth factors. To delineate the impact of ACE + NLEs on physiosomatic and FF symptoms in first episode (FE)-MDMD, and examine whether these effects are mediated by immune profiles. ACEs, NLEs, physiosomatic and FF symptoms, and 48 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors were measured in 64 FE-MDMD patients and 32 normal controls. Physiosomatic, FF and gastro-intestinal symptoms belong to the same factor as depression, anxiety, melancholia, and insomnia. The first factor extracted from these seven domains is labeled the physio-affective phenome of depression. A part (59.0%) of the variance in physiosomatic symptoms is explained by the independent effects of interleukin (IL)-16 and IL-8 (positively), CCL3 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (inversely correlated). A part (46.5%) of the variance in physiosomatic (59.0%) symptoms is explained by the independent effects of interleukin (IL)-16, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (positively) and combined activities of negative immunoregulatory cytokines (inversely associated). Partial least squares analysis shows that ACE + NLEs exert a substantial influence on the physio-affective phenome which are partly mediated by an immune network composed of interleukin-16, CCL27, TRAIL, macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and stem cell growth factor. The physiosomatic and FF symptoms of FE-MDMD are partly caused by immune-associated neurotoxicity due to T helper (Th)-1 polarization and M1 macrophage activation and relative lowered compensatory immunoregulatory protection.
