29379655|t|Genetic Variants in CSMD1 Gene Are Associated with Cognitive Performance in Normal Elderly Population.
29379655|a|Recently, genetic markers rs10503253 and rs2616984 in the CUB and Sushi multiple domains-1 (CSMD1) gene have been reported to be associated with schizophrenia and cognitive functions in genome-wide association studies. We examined the associations of the above SNPs with cognitive performance evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tool in a cohort of the normal elderly from the Russian population. Significant association of rs2616984 genotypes with the MoCA scores was found using nonparametric analysis. No association of rs10503253 with MoCA scores was observed using both parametric and nonparametric statistics. Significant combined effect of two-locus CSMD1 genotypes on MoCA scores was demonstrated by median test. Allele "A" and genotype "AA" of rs2616984 were significantly associated with the lower MoCA scores in comparison of 1st and 4th quartiles of MoCA total score distribution. The results suggest that genetic variants in CSMD1 gene are likely a part of genetic component of cognitive performance in the elderly.
