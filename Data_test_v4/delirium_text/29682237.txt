29682237|t|Recognizing Late Onset Frontotemporal Dementia with the DAPHNE scale: A case report.
29682237|a|Frontotemporal dementias are classically described as early onset dementias with personality and behavioral changes, however, late onset forms can also be found. Considering the paucity of information about late onset behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and its challenging diagnosis, we present a case report of an 85-year-old woman with behavioral changes and slow progression to dementia who was first diagnosed as having bipolar disorder and then Alzheimer's disease. The Daphne scale provided a structured means to improve clinical diagnosis, also supported by characteristic features on MRI and SPECT, while CSF biomarkers ruled out atypical Alzheimer's disease.
