25375679|a|Despite patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were reported of revealing gait disorders and balance problems, there is still lack of objective quantitative measurement of gait patterns and balance capability of AD patients. Based on an inertial-sensor-based wearable device, this paper develops gait and balance analyzing algorithms to obtain quantitative measurements and explores the essential indicators from the measurements for AD diagnosis. The gait analyzing algorithm is composed of stride detection followed by gait cycle decomposition so that gait parameters are developed from the decomposed gait details. On the other hand, the balance is measured by the sway speed in anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions of the projection path of body's center of mass (COM). These devised gait and balance parameters were explored on twenty-one AD patients and fifty healthy controls (HCs). Special evaluation procedure including single-task and dual-task walking experiments for observing the cognitive function and attention is also devised for the comparison of AD and HC groups. Experimental results show that the wearable instrument with the designed gait and balance analyzing system is a promising tool for automatically analyzing gait information and balance ability, serving as assistant indicators for early diagnosis of AD.
