31057246|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Not all patients with dementia are the same, and Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) helps in staging dementia. Ophthalmologists usually prefer general anesthesia (GA) for cataract surgery in patients with dementia. We evaluated the impact of "Choosing Wisely" initiative on anesthesia options for cataract surgery in patients with dementia undergoing cataract surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of electronic perioperative database was performed over a 4-year period of patients with a specific diagnosis of dementia undergoing cataract surgery, after the introduction of the "Choosing Wisely" based on preoperative GDS assessment. Preferred method by the listing ophthalmologist, changes in anesthesia modality based on GDS, and the occurrence of intraoperative events were analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six patients with dementia underwent cataract surgery over a 4-year period. The mean patient age was 78 years, 73.5% female, and 55% ASA physical status III. GA was administered for GDS stage 6-7, and regional anesthesia (RA) for GDS stages 1-5. Surgery was uneventful under RA in 64% of the patients (87 out of 136), and 2% (3 patients) originally deemed suitable for RA were converted to GA. CONCLUSIONS: The authors found a reduced requirement for GA when "Choosing Wisely' initiative was used based on the GDS stage.
