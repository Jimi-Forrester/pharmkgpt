32977472|t|Natural Agents Targeting Mitochondria in Cancer.
32977472|a|Mitochondria are the key energy provider to highly proliferating cancer cells, and are subsequently considered one of the critical targets in cancer therapeutics. Several compounds have been studied for their mitochondria-targeting ability in cancer cells. These studies' outcomes have led to the invention of "mitocans", a category of drug known to precisely target the cancer cells' mitochondria. Based upon their mode of action, mitocans have been divided into eight classes. To date, different synthetic compounds have been suggested to be potential mitocans, but unfortunately, they are observed to exert adverse effects. Many studies have been published justifying the medicinal significance of large numbers of natural agents for their mitochondria-targeting ability and anticancer activities with minimal or no side effects. However, these natural agents have never been critically analyzed for their mitochondria-targeting activity. This review aims to evaluate the various natural agents affecting mitochondria and categorize them in different classes. Henceforth, our study may further support the potential mitocan behavior of various natural agents and highlight their significance in formulating novel potential anticancer therapeutics.
