37373554|a|Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may show mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The mechanisms involved remain unclear. The plasma concentrations of several cytokines and chemokines were measured in 71 NAFLD patients (20 with and 51 without MCI) and 61 controls. Characterization and activation of leukocyte populations and CD4+ sub-populations were carried out and analyzed by flow cytometry. We analyzed the cytokines released from CD4+ cell cultures and the mRNA expression of transcription factors and receptors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The appearance of MCI in NAFLD patients was associated with increased activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes, mainly of the Th17 subtype, increased plasma levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17A, IL-23, IL-21, IL-22, IL-6, INF-gamma, and IL-13, and higher expression of the CCR2 receptor. Constitutive expression of IL-17 was found in cultures of CD4+ cells from MCI patients, reflecting Th17 activation. High IL-13 plasma levels were predictive of MCI and could reflect a compensatory anti-inflammatory response to the increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This study identified some specific alterations of the immune system associated with the appearance of neurological alterations in MCI patients with NAFLD that could be the basis to improve and restore cognitive functions and quality of life in these patients.
