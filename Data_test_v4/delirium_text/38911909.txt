38911909|a|Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a group of neurodegenerative diseases that are typically caused by a monogenetic mutation, leading to development of disordered movement symptoms such as dystonia, hyperreflexia, etc. Brain iron accumulation can be diagnosed through MRI imaging and is hypothesized to be the cause of oxidative stress, leading to the degeneration of brain tissue. There are four main types of NBIA: pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN), mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration (MKAN), and beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN). There are no causative therapies for these diseases, but iron chelators have been shown to have potential toward treating NBIA. Three chelators are investigated in this Review: deferoxamine (DFO), desferasirox (DFS), and deferiprone (DFP). DFO has been investigated to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD); however, dose-related toxicity in these studies, as well as in PKAN studies, have shown that the drug still requires more development before it can be applied toward NBIA cases. Iron chelation therapies other than the ones currently in clinical use have not yet reached clinical studies, but they may possess characteristics that would allow them to access the brain in ways that current chelators cannot. Intranasal formulations are an attractive dosage form to study for chelation therapy, as this method of delivery can bypass the blood-brain barrier and access the CNS. Gene therapy differs from iron chelation therapy as it is a causal treatment of the disease, whereas iron chelators only target the disease progression of NBIA. Because the pathophysiology of NBIA diseases is still unclear, future courses of action should be focused on causative treatment; however, iron chelation therapy is the current best course of action.
