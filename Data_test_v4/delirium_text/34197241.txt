34197241|t|A retrospective observational study on the types of anaesthesia in hip fracture surgery.
34197241|a|BACKGROUND: There is no specific recommendation regarding the type of anaesthesia in hip fracture surgery. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to examine the current local anaesthetic practice (general anaesthesia versus regional anaesthesia (RA)) in hip fracture surgery and to analyse their associations with perioperative outcomes. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective observational study of hip fracture patients from April to December 2017 was undertaken. Patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes were analysed against the types of anaesthesia using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve out of 154 patients (72.7%) had a general anaesthesia. Patients from residential care facilities were more likely to receive general anaesthesia (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.1, 7.4; P = 0.03). There was no significant association between type of anaesthesia and specific postoperative outcomes; however, patients with postoperative delirium and hypotension were more likely to have received general anaesthesia [OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 0.68, 4.38; P = 0.25] and [OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 0.67, 4.04; P = 0.27] respectively). Subgroup analysis showed increased length of stay with patients who underwent general anaesthesia (OR = 1.26, 95% CI:1.04, 1.54; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Regional anaesthesia may be considered in patients without contraindications in view of increased risk of postoperative delirium and hypotension, and longer length of stay with general anaesthesia. A larger prospective study is needed to confirm these findings.
