3971435|a|A diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in persons at the age of 75-89 years is rarely established by clinician as well as by pathologist without aimed attention. As usual it is mixed up with cerebral arteriosclerosis or marasmus senilis. More than 10 drusen were found in a low-magnification field [400X] in hippocampal cortex and in area 21 and 39 according to Brodman of 19 persons in a group of 26 autopsies. Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on this commonly used limitation was quite frequent, then.
