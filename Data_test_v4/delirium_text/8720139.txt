8720139|t|Dephosphorylation of fetal-tau and paired helical filaments-tau by protein phosphatases 1 and 2A and calcineurin.
8720139|a|We have reported that many sites of tau in fetal brain (fetal-tau) as well as in paired helical filaments (PHF-tau) are phosphorylated. In the present study, we used site-specific antibodies and peptide mapping to examine protein phosphatases involved in dephosphorylation of fetal-tau and PHF-tau. Immunoblot analysis and electrophoretic mobility showed that protein phosphatases 1 and 2A and calcineurin could dephosphorylate fetal-tau and PHF-tau. Phosphoserines 199, 202, 396, and 413 and phosphothreonine 231, numbered according to the longest human tau isoform, were dephosphorylated, as shown by the immunoblot analysis. Phosphoserine 422 was dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2A and calcineurin, but not by protein phosphatase 1. Peptide mapping with Achromobacter lyticus protease 1 showed that phosphoserines 199, 202, 235, and 396 and phosphothreonine 231 were dephosphorylated by protein phosphatases. Fetal-tau was more rapidly dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2A and calcineurin than PHF-tau. Interestingly, PHF-tau which had not been solubilized with guanidine HCl was little dephosphorylated by protein phosphatases. Thus, PHF-tau in neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease brain is likely to be resistant to dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases.
