35450131|t|The Legacy of the TTASAAN Report-Premature Conclusions and Forgotten Promises: A Review of Policy and Practice Part I.
35450131|a|Brain perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans were initially developed in 1970's. A key radiopharmaceutical, hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO), was originally approved in 1988, but was unstable. As a result, the quality of SPECT images varied greatly based on technique until 1993, when a method of stabilizing HMPAO was developed. In addition, most SPECT perfusion studies pre-1996 were performed on single-head gamma cameras. In 1996, the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology (TTASAAN) issued a report regarding the use of SPECT in the evaluation of neurological disorders. Although the TTASAAN report was published in January 1996, it was approved for publication in October 1994. Consequently, the reported brain SPECT studies relied upon to derive the conclusions of the TTASAAN report largely pre-date the introduction of stabilized HMPAO. While only 12% of the studies on traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the TTASAAN report utilized stable tracers and multi-head cameras, 69 subsequent studies with more than 23,000 subjects describe the utility of perfusion SPECT scans in the evaluation of TBI. Similarly, dementia SPECT imaging has improved. Modern SPECT utilizing multi-headed gamma cameras and quantitative analysis has a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 89% for the diagnosis of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease-comparable to fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Advances also have occurred in seizure neuroimaging. Lastly, developments in SPECT imaging of neurotoxicity and neuropsychiatric disorders have been striking. At the 25-year anniversary of the publication of the TTASAAN report, it is time to re-examine the utility of perfusion SPECT brain imaging. Herein, we review studies cited by the TTASAAN report vs. current brain SPECT imaging research literature for the major indications addressed in the report, as well as for emerging indications. In Part II, we elaborate technical aspects of SPECT neuroimaging and discuss scan interpretation for the clinician.
