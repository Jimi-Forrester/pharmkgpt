31258916|t|Pilot study: an intensive care unit sleep promotion protocol.
31258916|a|Purpose: Disturbances, such as in-room activity and sound, are significant sources of sleep disruption among critically ill patients. These factors are potentially modifiable. We tested the impact of an intensive care unit (ICU) sleep promotion protocol on overnight in-room disturbance. Methods: Our protocol restricted non-urgent bedside care from 00:00 to 03:59. Patients were assigned to usual care (n=30) or the sleep protocol (n=26). The primary outcomes were measures of in-room activity, sound and light. These three types of disturbance were compared between arms during a baseline time block (20:00-23:59) and a rest time block (00:00-03:59). We assessed the sleep protocol effect with generalised linear models. Results: Usual care and sleep protocol patients had equivalent levels of in-room activity, sound and light during the baseline time block (20:00-23:59). In contrast, during the rest time block (00:00-03:59), the sleep protocol arm had 32% fewer room entries (rate ratio (RR) 0.68, p=0.001) and 9.1 fewer minutes of in-room activity (p=0.0002). Also, the length of time between room entrances increased from 26.4 to 45.8 min (p=0.0004). The sleep protocol arm also had lower sound during the rest time block. Mean A-weighted sound was 2.5 decibels lower (p=0.02), and there were 36% fewer peaks (RR 0.64, p=0.02). Light levels were highly variable and not changed by the sleep protocol. Conclusions: Sleep promotion protocols can improve in-room activity and sound. This provides a better sleep opportunity and may, therefore, improve ICU sleep. Trial registration number: 1112009428.
