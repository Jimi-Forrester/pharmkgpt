38568008|t|How ATP suppresses the fibrillation of amyloid peptides: analysis of the free-energy contributions.
38568008|a|Recent experiments have revealed that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) suppresses the fibrillation of amyloid peptides - a process closely linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Apart from the adsorption of ATP onto amyloid peptides, the molecular understanding is still limited, leaving the underlying mechanism for the fibrillation suppression by ATP largely unclear, especially in regards to the molecular energetics. Here we provide an explanation at the molecular scale by quantifying the free energies using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the changes of the free energies due to the addition of ATP lead to a significant equilibrium shift towards monomeric peptides in agreement with experiments. Despite ATP being a highly charged species, the decomposition of the free energies reveals that the van der Waals interactions with the peptide are decisive in determining the relative stabilization of the monomeric state. While the phosphate moiety exhibits strong electrostatic interactions, the compensation by the water solvent results in a minor, overall Coulomb contribution. Our quantitative analysis of the free energies identifies which intermolecular interactions are responsible for the suppression of the amyloid fibril formation by ATP and offers a promising method to analyze the roles of similarly complex cosolvents in aggregation processes.
