36349522|t|Anomalies in neurovascular coupling during early diabetes: A review.
36349522|a|Diabetic retinopathy is the most feared complication for those with diabetes. Although visible vascular pathology traditionally defines the management of this condition, it is now recognised that a range of cellular changes occur in the retina from an early stage of diabetes. One of the most significant functional changes that occurs in those with diabetes is a loss of vasoregulation in response to changes in neural activity. There are several retinal cell types that are critical for mediating so-called neurovascular coupling, including Muller cells, microglia and pericytes. Although there is a great deal of evidence that suggests that Muller cells are integral to regulating the vasculature, they only modulate part of the vascular tree, highlighting the complexity of vasoregulation within the retina. Recent studies suggest that retinal immune cells, microglia, play an important role in mediating vasoconstriction. Importantly, retinal microglia contact both the vasculature and neural synapses and induce vasoconstriction in response to neurally expressed chemokines such as fractalkine. This microglial-dependent regulation occurs via the vasomediator angiotensinogen. Diabetes alters the way microglia regulate the retinal vasculature, by increasing angiotensinogen expression, causing capillary vasoconstriction and contributing to a loss of vascular reactivity to physiological signals. This article summarises recent studies showing changes in vascular regulation during diabetes, the potential mechanisms by which this occurs and the significance of these early changes to the progression of diabetic retinopathy.
