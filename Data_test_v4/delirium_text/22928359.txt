22928359|a|Nutritional patterns affect significantly man's body at each age. The elderly--with their eating habits and diseases they have overcome--often require specific dietary intervention. A proper and well-balanced diet is an important element of lifestyle that may become a factor facilitating the so-called healthy, successful ageing and delay the development of noninfectious, chronic metabolic diseases that are in majority of cases diagnosed in elder people. Neurodegenerative diseases have been classified amongst chronic diseases yet with still controversial etiology. Nevertheless, it is speculated that some nutritional factors, including the appropriate intake of B-group vitamins, antioxidative vitamins and polyunsaturated fatty acids, are likely to play a significant role in their prevention and therapy. A diet rich in vegetables and fruits, whole-meal bread, milk and dairy products as well as containing fish, plant oils and nuts provides all indispensable nutrients. The appropriate merging of these food products into dishes--widely described in literature as the Mediterranean diet--facilitates leading a long life in health.
