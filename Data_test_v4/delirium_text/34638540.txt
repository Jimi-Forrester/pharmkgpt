34638540|t|Improvement Effects of Myelophil on Symptoms of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in a Reserpine-Induced Mouse Model.
34638540|a|Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is associated with various symptoms, such as depression, pain, and fatigue. To date, the pathological mechanisms and therapeutics remain uncertain. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of myelophil (MYP), composed of Astragali Radix and Salviaemiltiorrhizae Radix, on depression, pain, and fatigue behaviors and its underlying mechanisms. Reserpine (2 mg/kg for 10 days, intraperitoneally) induced depression, pain, and fatigue behaviors in mice. MYP treatment (100 mg/kg for 10 days, intragastrically) significantly improved depression behaviors, mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity, and fatigue behavior. MYP treatment regulated the expression of c-Fos, 5-HT1A/B receptors, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) in the brain, especially in the motor cortex, hippocampus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. MYP treatment decreased ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) expression in the hippocampus and increased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and the levels of dopamine and serotonin in the striatum. MYP treatment altered inflammatory and anti-oxidative-related mRNA expression in the spleen and liver. In conclusion, MYP was effective in recovering major symptoms of ME/CFS and was associated with the regulation of dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways and TGF-beta expression in the brain, as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant mechanisms in internal organs.
