34519476|a|Protein citrullination (deimination of arginine residue) is a well-known biomarker of inflammation. Elevated protein citrullination has been shown to colocalize with extracellular amyloid plaques in postmortem AD patient brains. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides which aggregate and accumulate in the plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have sequential N-terminal truncations and multiple post-translational modifications (PTM) such as isomerization, pyroglutamate formation, phosphorylation, nitration, and dityrosine cross-linking. However, no conclusive biochemical evidence exists whether citrullinated Abeta is present in AD brains. In this study, using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we have identified citrullination of Abeta in sporadic and familial AD brains by characterizing the tandem mass spectra of endogenous N-truncated citrullinated Abeta peptides. Our quantitative estimations demonstrate that ~ 35% of pyroglutamate3-Abeta pool was citrullinated in plaques in the sporadic AD temporal cortex and ~ 22% in the detergent-insoluble frontal cortex fractions. Similarly, hypercitrullinated pyroglutamate3-Abeta (~ 30%) was observed in both the detergent-soluble as well as insoluble Abeta pool in familial AD cases. Our results indicate that a common mechanism for citrullination of Abeta exists in both the sporadic and familial AD. We establish that citrullination of Abeta is a remarkably common PTM, closely associated with pyroglutamate3-Abeta formation and its accumulation in AD. This may have implications for Abeta toxicity, autoantigenicity of Abeta, and may be relevant for the design of diagnostic assays and therapeutic targeting.
