39036132|t|A Case Report of Myxedema Coma in the Setting of Normal Thyroid Stimulating Hormone.
39036132|a|Myxedema coma (MC) is a potentially fatal complication of hypothyroidism, with a high mortality rate. It is a clinically diagnosed condition, where the symptoms are related to decreased metabolic effects due to low active thyroid hormones. This case report highlights a severe case of MC, despite the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) being normal and the free thyroxine (FT4) being very mildly decreased.
