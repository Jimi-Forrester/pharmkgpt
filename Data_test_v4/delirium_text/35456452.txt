35456452|t|Major Depressive Disorder: Existing Hypotheses about Pathophysiological Mechanisms and New Genetic Findings.
35456452|a|Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder generally characterized by symptoms associated with mood, pleasure and effectiveness in daily life activities. MDD is ranked as a major contributor to worldwide disability. The complex pathogenesis of MDD is not yet understood, and this is a major cause of failure to develop new therapies and MDD recurrence. Here we summarize the literature on existing hypotheses about the pathophysiological mechanisms of MDD. We describe the different approaches undertaken to understand the molecular mechanism of MDD using genetic data. Hundreds of loci have now been identified by large genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We describe these studies and how they have provided information on the biological processes, cell types, tissues and druggable targets that are enriched for MDD risk genes. We detail our understanding of the genetic correlations and causal relationships between MDD and many psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders and traits. We highlight the challenges associated with genetic studies, including the complexity of MDD genetics in diverse populations and the need for a study of rare variants and new studies of gene-environment interactions.
