39767536|t|Comprehensive Gerontological Assessment: An Update on the Concept and Its Evaluation Tools in Latin America and the Caribbean-A Literature Review.
39767536|a|In recent decades, Latin America and the Caribbean region have experienced accelerated aging. However, despite the significant progress of gerontology in the region, the number of geriatricians and professionals trained in the field is low; a notable gap in the training related to the assessment of older adults can also be observed. Therefore, in this literature review, we update the concept of Comprehensive Gerontological Assessment (CGA) for its application in the region. We compile the characteristics, validity, and reliability of CGA tools, and their usage in government documents across countries in the region. We also analyze the adaptations made to CGA during the COVID-19 pandemic, and discuss challenges related to CGA administration, academic training, research, innovation, and management. This study is particularly relevant as it proposes lines of action for decision-makers, academics, researchers, university students, and the general community, which will allow for more tailored interventions aimed at meeting the needs of older adults, their families, and caregivers. Such actions will positively impact functionality, autonomy, and quality of life, while promoting healthy, active, and successful aging in the region.
