39126053|t|Sex and Gender Differences in Alzheimer's Disease: Genetic, Hormonal, and Inflammation Impacts.
39126053|a|Two-thirds of Americans with Alzheimer's disease are women, indicating a profound variance between the sexes. Variances exist between the sexes in the age and intensity of the presentation, cognitive deficits, neuroinflammatory factors, structural and functional brain changes, as well as psychosocial and cultural circumstances. Herein, we summarize the existing evidence for sexual dimorphism and present the available evidence for these distinctions. Understanding these complexities is critical to developing personalized interventions for the prevention, care, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
