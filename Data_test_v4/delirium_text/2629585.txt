2629585|a|Several observations indirectly suggest that intracellular calcium regulation may be altered by aging and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, calcium homeostasis was examined directly in skin fibroblasts from Alzheimer's patients and compared to cells from normal young and elderly controls. Alterations in both bound and free calcium were noted; cells from Alzheimer's donors have higher levels of bound calcium but lower concentrations of free intracellular calcium when compared to cells from young and normal aged donors. These changes in calcium homeostasis may be physiologically significant, since processes that require transient elevations of intracellular free calcium, such as cell spreading, decline in the Alzheimer's cells. In summary, cultured skin fibroblasts from normal aged and Alzheimer's patients demonstrate deficits in calcium homeostasis and other metabolic processes when compared to cells from young donors.
