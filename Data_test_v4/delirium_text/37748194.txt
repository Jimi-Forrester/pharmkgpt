37748194|t|Concise and Scalable Radiosynthesis of (+)-[18F]MDL100907 as a Serotonin 5-HT2A Receptor Antagonist for PET.
37748194|a|5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT2A) receptors play an important role in several psychiatric disorders. In order to investigate the serotonin (5-HT) receptor in vivo, reliable syntheses are required for positron emission tomography (PET) 5-HT radioligands. Owing to the excellent in vivo properties of [18F]MDL100907 for PET, there has been great interest to develop a novel synthetic route for [18F]MDL100907. Here, we report a highly efficient, scalable, and expedient synthesis for [18F]MDL100907. The radiofluorination was performed on a 18F-labeling boron pinacol ester precursor, which is synthesized using the Liebeskind-Srogl cross-coupling reaction as a key step. Our method is practically more suitable to employ late-stage Cu-mediated radiofluorination and facilitate the production of the [18F]MDL100907 radioligand in excellent decay-corrected RCY of 32 +- 10% (n = 7) within 60 min. We prepared [18F]MDL100907 in high molar activity (2.1 Ci/mumol) and compared it to [11C]MDL100907 in the brain of a nonhuman primate.
