39411641|t|A Case of Pylephlebitis Without Intra-abdominal Infection Secondary to Pneumonia Caused by Hypermucoviscous Klebsiella pneumoniae.
39411641|a|Pylephlebitis is an infective, suppurative thrombosis of the portal vein that is often a complication of intra-abdominal infections. Herein, we report a rare case of hypermucoviscous Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia complicated by pylephlebitis. The patient was administered antibiotics and anticoagulants. His pneumonia improved; however, the thrombus in the portal vein did not shrink, and the patient ultimately died of liver failure. Furthermore, hypermucoviscous K. pneumoniae is involved in the formation of portal vein thrombosis, and if bacteremia persists even after pneumonia has improved, investigating possible complications, including portal vein inflammation, is necessary.
