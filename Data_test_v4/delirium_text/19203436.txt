19203436|t|Diagnostic utility of sound naming in early Alzheimer's disease.
19203436|a|While it is well known that picture naming (PN) is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD), sound naming (SN) has not been thoroughly investigated. We postulated that SN might be impaired more severely and earlier than PN, given the early involvement of the temporal cortex by AD-related pathology. SN and PN were assessed in 21 normal participants, 40 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 27 patients in early stages of AD. Our results showed that SN accuracy and latency were more sensitive to advancing pathology in AD than PN accuracy and latency. SN was more useful and specific in distinguishing MCI patients from normal participants and therefore in potentially identifying the subset of MCI patients who already have impairment in more than one cognitive domain and may actually have incipient AD. These findings indicate a potential diagnostic utility of SN for early detection of the disease. Furthermore, even though most AD patients demonstrated more or less comparable impairment in both tasks, some were disproportionately impaired on SN and others were differentially impaired on PN. Future studies may be able to show that these discrepant groups correspond to patients with right and left hemisphere predominant AD, respectively.
