36629433|t|Porphyromonas gingivalis Outer Membrane Vesicles Promote Apoptosis via msRNA-Regulated DNA Methylation in Periodontitis.
36629433|a|The outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis contain a variety of bioactive molecules that may be involved in the progression of periodontitis. However, the participation of P. gingivalis OMVs in the development of periodontitis has not been elucidated. Here, we isolated P. gingivalis OMVs and confirmed their participation in periodontitis both in vivo and in vitro. Microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and histological analysis showed that under stimulation with P. gingivalis OMVs, the alveolar bone of rats was significantly resorbed in vivo. We found that P. gingivalis OMVs were taken up by human periodontal ligament cells ([hPDLCs]) in vitro, which subsequently resulted in apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine release, which was accomplished by the microRNA-size small RNA (msRNA) sRNA45033 in the P. gingivalis OMVs. Through bioinformatics analysis and screening of target genes, chromobox 5 (CBX5) was identified as the downstream target of screened-out sRNA45033. Using a dual-luciferase reporter assay, overexpression, and knockdown methods, sRNA45033 was confirmed to target CBX5 to regulate hPDLC apoptosis. In addition, CUT&Tag (cleavage under targets and tagmentation) analysis confirmed the mechanism that CBX5 regulates apoptosis through the methylation of p53 DNA. Collectively, these findings indicate that the role of P. gingivalis OMVs is immunologically relevant and related to bacterial virulence during the development of periodontitis. IMPORTANCE P. gingivalis is a bacterium often associated with periodontitis. This study demonstrates that (i) sRNA45033 in P. gingivalis OMVs targets CBX5, (ii) CBX5 regulates the methylation of p53 DNA and its expression, which is associated with apoptosis, and (iii) a novel mechanism of interaction between hosts and pathogens is mediated by OMVs in the occurrence of periodontitis.
