35813961|t|REPS1 as a Potential Biomarker in Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Dementia.
35813961|a|Vascular dementia (VD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are common types of dementia for which no curative therapies are known. In this study, we identified hub genes associated with AD and VD in order to explore new potential therapeutic targets. Genes differentially expressed in VD and AD in all three datasets (GSE122063, GSE132903, and GSE5281) were identified and used to construct a protein-protein interaction network. We identified 10 modules containing 427 module genes in AD and VD. Module genes showing an area under the diagnostic curve > 0.60 for AD or VD were used to construct a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator model and were entered into a support vector machine-recursive feature elimination algorithm, which identified REPS1 as a hub gene in AD and VD. Furthermore, REPS1 was associated with activation of pyruvate metabolism and inhibition of Ras signaling pathway. Module genes, together with differentially expressed microRNAs from the dataset GSE46579, were used to construct a regulatory network. REPS1 was predicted to bind to the microRNA hsa_miR_5701. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis was used to explore immune cell infiltration, which suggested a negative correlation between REPS1 expression and infiltration by plasmacytoid dendritic cells in AD and VD. In conclusion, our results suggest core pathways involved in both AD and VD, and they identify REPS1 as a potential biomarker of both diseases. This protein may aid in early diagnosis, monitoring of treatment response, and even efforts to prevent these debilitating disorders.
