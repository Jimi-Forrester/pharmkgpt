35448530|a|Despite recent advances in diagnostic procedures for neurological disorders, it is still difficult to definitively diagnose some neurodegenerative diseases without neuropathological examination of autopsied brain tissue. As pathological processes in the brain are frequently reflected in the components of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), CSF samples are sometimes useful for diagnosis. After CSF is secreted from the choroid plexus epithelial cells in the ventricles, some flows in the brain, some is mixed with intracerebral interstitial fluid, and some is excreted through two major drainage pathways, i.e., the intravascular periarterial drainage pathway and the glymphatic system. Accordingly, substances produced by metabolic and pathological processes in the brain may be detectable in CSF. Many papers have reported changes in the concentration of substances in the CSF of patients with metabolic and neurological disorders, some of which can be useful biomarkers of the disorders. In this paper, we show the significance of glucose- and neurotransmitter-related CSF metabolites, considering their transporters in the choroid plexus; summarize the reported candidates of CSF biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases, including amyloid-beta, tau, alpha-synuclein, microRNAs, and mitochondrial DNA; and evaluate their potential as efficient diagnostic tools.
