38566826|t|Light on Alzheimer's disease: from basic insights to preclinical studies.
38566826|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), referring to a gradual deterioration in cognitive function, including memory loss and impaired thinking skills, has emerged as a substantial worldwide challenge with profound social and economic implications. As the prevalence of AD continues to rise and the population ages, there is an imperative demand for innovative imaging techniques to help improve our understanding of these complex conditions. Photoacoustic (PA) imaging forms a hybrid imaging modality by integrating the high-contrast of optical imaging and deep-penetration of ultrasound imaging. PA imaging enables the visualization and characterization of tissue structures and multifunctional information at high resolution and, has demonstrated promising preliminary results in the study and diagnosis of AD. This review endeavors to offer a thorough overview of the current applications and potential of PA imaging on AD diagnosis and treatment. Firstly, the structural, functional, molecular parameter changes associated with AD-related brain imaging captured by PA imaging will be summarized, shaping the diagnostic standpoint of this review. Then, the therapeutic methods aimed at AD is discussed further. Lastly, the potential solutions and clinical applications to expand the extent of PA imaging into deeper AD scenarios is proposed. While certain aspects might not be fully covered, this mini-review provides valuable insights into AD diagnosis and treatment through the utilization of innovative tissue photothermal effects. We hope that it will spark further exploration in this field, fostering improved and earlier theranostics for AD.
