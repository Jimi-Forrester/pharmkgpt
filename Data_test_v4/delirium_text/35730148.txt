35730148|a|The percentage of US adults following low-carbohydrate diets (LCD) doubled in the last decade. Some researchers observed this trend with concern and highlighted the potential for nutritional deficiencies and impaired overall diet quality with LCD. The present study investigated nutrient intake in a nationally representative sample of 307 US adults following an LCD. Using cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, we compared nutrient intake profiles in said individuals with the daily nutritional goals specified in the current 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). Results were then compared with the general population consuming a standard American diet. Almost 57 % of low-carbohydrate dieters were female, and the mean age was 48 67 (1 35) years. Individuals consuming LCD exceeded the recommendations for saturated fat, total lipid and sodium intake (both sexes). An insufficient intake was observed for fibre, Mg, potassium and several other vitamins (vitamins A, E, D in both sexes as well as vitamin C in men and folate in women). Neither men nor women met the recommendations for fibre intake. A comparable picture was found for the general population. The potentially insufficient intake of several essential nutrients in LCD warrants consideration and a careful assessment with regard to the current DGA.
