CASES: The first case is a patient with a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia who was collecting old things before the appearance of bahavioural changes like verbal and physical agitation. The second one is a patient who was admitted with complaints of forgetting, diagnosed as having Alzheimer's Disease and presented with paper hoarding behavior in his clinical follow-up. The last patient was presented with visual hallucinations, forgetting, collecting old things and depressive symptoms. He received a diagnosis of Lewy body dementia.
