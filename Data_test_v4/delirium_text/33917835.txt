33917835|t|Treating Neurodegenerative Disease with Antioxidants: Efficacy of the Bioactive Phenol Resveratrol and Mitochondrial-Targeted MitoQ and SkQ.
33917835|a|Growing evidence from neurodegenerative disease research supports an early pathogenic role for mitochondrial dysfunction in affected neurons that precedes morphological and functional deficits. The resulting oxidative stress and respiratory malfunction contribute to neuronal toxicity and may enhance the vulnerability of neurons to continued assault by aggregation-prone proteins. Consequently, targeting mitochondria with antioxidant therapy may be a non-invasive, inexpensive, and viable means of strengthening neuronal health and slowing disease progression, thereby extending quality of life. We review the preclinical and clinical findings available to date of the natural bioactive phenol resveratrol and two synthetic mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants, MitoQ and SkQ.
