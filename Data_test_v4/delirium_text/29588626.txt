29588626|a|BACKGROUND: Abnormally high expression of the mammalian de novo lipogenesis (DNL) pathway in various cancer cells promotes cell over-proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. Inhibition of key enzymes in the DNL pathway, namely, ATP citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid synthase (FASN) can increase apoptosis without cytotoxicity to non-cancerous cells, leading to the search for and presentation of novel selective and powerful targets for cancer therapy. Previous studies reported that epistructured catechins, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and epicatechin (EC) exhibit different mechanisms regarding a strong inducer of apoptosis in various cancer cell lines. Thus, the current study investigated the growth inhibitory effect of EGCG and EC, on the enzyme expression and activity of the DNL pathway, which leads to the prominent activity of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1) mediating apoptosis in HepG2 cells. METHODS: The cytotoxicity on HepG2 cells of EGCG and EC was determined by MTT assay. Cell death caused by apoptosis, the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and cell cycle arrest were then detected by flow cytometry. We further investigated the decrease of fatty acid levels associated with DNL retardation, followed by evaluation of DNL protein expression. Then, the negative inhibitory effect of depleted fatty acid synthesis on malonyl-CoA synthesis followed by regulating of CPT-1 activity was investigated. Thereafter, we inspected the enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which is recognized as one of the causes of apoptosis in HepG2 cells. RESULTS: We found that EGCG and EC decreased cancer cell viability by increasing apoptosis as well as causing cell cycle arrest in HepG2 cells. Apoptosis was associated with MMP dissipation. Herein, EGCG and EC inhibited the expression of FASN enzymes contributing to decreasing fatty acid levels. Notably, this decrease consequently showed a suppressing effect on the CPT-1 activity. We suggest that epistructured catechin-induced apoptosis targets CPT-1 activity suppression mediated through diminishing the DNL pathway in HepG2 cells. In addition, increased ROS production was found after treatment with EGCG and EC, indicating oxidative stress mechanism-induced apoptosis. The strong apoptotic effect of EGCG and EC was specifically absent in primary human hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: Our supportive evidence confirms potential alternative cancer treatments by EGCG and EC that selectively target the DNL pathway.
