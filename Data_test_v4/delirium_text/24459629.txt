24459629|t|An iatrogenic metabolic encephalopathy in a nonagenarian: The dilemma of a critical miss as a possible social dismissal.
24459629|a|Here we posit for discussion the example of a reversible metabolic encephalopthy in a very elderly male that was missed clinically. A metabolic encephalopathy in extrememly elderly patients may be confused with delerium or inattention. A reversible cause of cognative dysfunction in the aged may be missed by practitioners because the aged may be assumed to have some level of impaired cognition; this may lead to a "social dismissal" of mental status changes. We highlight the need for engaged physicians in the care of the aged and vigilance against a professional bias toward the elderly patient that is dismissive.
