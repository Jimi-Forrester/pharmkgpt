36675455|t|From Bench to Bedside in Rheumatoid Arthritis from the "2022 GISEA International Symposium".
36675455|a|While precision medicine is still a challenge in rheumatic disease, in recent years many advances have been made regarding pathogenesis, the treatment of inflammatory arthropathies, and their interaction. New insight into the role of inflammasome and synovial tissue macrophage subsets as predictors of drug response give hope for future tailored therapeutic strategies and a personalized medicine approach in inflammatory arthropathies. Here, we discuss the main pathogenetic mechanisms and therapeutic approaches towards precision medicine in rheumatoid arthritis from the 2022 International GISEA/OEG Symposium.
