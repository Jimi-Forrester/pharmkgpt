8171342|t|Differential effects of apolipoproteins E3 and E4 on neuronal growth in vitro.
8171342|a|Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), one of the three common isoforms of apoE, has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease. The effects of apoE on neuronal growth were determined in cultures of dorsal root ganglion neurons. In the presence of beta-migrating very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL), apoE3 increased neurite outgrowth, whereas apoE4 decreased outgrowth. The effects of apoE3 or apoE4 in the presence of beta-VLDL were prevented by incubation with a monoclonal antibody to apoE or by reductive methylation of apoE, both of which block the ability of apoE to interact with lipoprotein receptors. The data suggest that receptor-mediated binding or internalization (or both) of apoE-enriched beta-VLDL leads to isoform-specific differences in interactions with cellular proteins that affect neurite outgrowth.
