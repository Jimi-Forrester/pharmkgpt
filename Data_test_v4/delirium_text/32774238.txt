32774238|t|Recent Preclinical Insights Into the Treatment of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.
32774238|a|Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative condition associated with significant mortality and morbidity. The central pathophysiological mechanisms by which repetitive cranial injury results in the neurodegeneration of CTE are poorly understood. Current well-established working models emphasize a central role for trauma-induced excessive phosphorylation and accumulation of insoluble tangles of Tau protein. In this review, we summarize recent data from preclinical animal models of CTE where a series of candidate treatments have been carefully evaluated, including kinase inhibitors, antibody therapy, and anti-inflammatory therapies. We discuss the overall translational potential of these approaches and provide recommendations for future bench-to-bedside treatment strategies.
