34578920|t|The Pro-Health Benefits of Morusin Administration-An Update Review.
34578920|a|Prenylflavonoids are widespread in nature. Plants are valuable sources of natural polyphenolic compounds with isoprenyl groups, which include flavones, flavanones, chalcones and aurones. They can be found in flowers, bark and stems. One of the most important compounds found in the bark of white mulberry (Morus alba) is morusin, a prenylated flavone with interesting pro-health properties. The research carried out so far revealed that morusin has antioxidant, antitumor, anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic activity. Moreover, its neuroprotective and antihyperglycemic properties have also been confirmed. Morusin suppresses the growth of different types of tumors, including breast cancer, glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, hepatocarcinoma, prostate cancer, and gastric cancer. It also inhibits the inflammatory response by suppressing COX activity and iNOS expression. Moreover, an antimicrobial effect against Gram-positive bacteria was observed after treatment with morusin. The objective of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about the positive effects of morusin on human health in order to facilitate future study on the development of plant polyphenolic drugs and nutraceutics in the group of prenylflavones.
