28936381|t|Anal Canal Gas Gangrene in Aplastic Anaemia: Rare yet Lethal Entity - A Caveat.
28936381|a|Gas gangrene is one of the most serious infections of traumatic and surgical wounds. The importance lies in the fact that, if not managed at the right time, the condition is fatal. Though perianal cellulitis and gangrene are commonly reported in immunocompromised patients, we report the case of a patient with gas gangrene involving only the anal canal extending to the rectum, a rare presentation to be reported in literature.  An 18-year-old lady, a patient of aplastic anaemia - immunodeficiency, developed gas gangrene of the anal canal possibly due to faecal contamination of anal fissures. The patient was managed with surgical debridement and intravenous antibiotics.  The clinical manifestations of gas gangrene are due to the liberation of toxins by Clostridium perfringens. The infection spreads rapidly and results in necrosis and devitalisation of tissues, unless intervened surgically. The clinical manifestations are more rapid and a high index of suspicion is needed for the diagnosis.
