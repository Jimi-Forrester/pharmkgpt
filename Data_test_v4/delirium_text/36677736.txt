36677736|t|Synthesis, Spectroscopic Characterization, Antibacterial Activity, and Computational Studies of Novel Pyridazinone Derivatives.
36677736|a|In this work, a novel series of pyridazinone derivatives (3-17) were synthesized and characterized by NMR (1H and 13C), FT-IR spectroscopies, and ESI-MS methods. All synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus (Methicillin-resistant), Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Among the series, compounds 7 and 13 were found to be active against S. aureus (MRSA), P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii with the lowest MIC value range of 3.74-8.92 microM. Afterwards, DFT calculations of B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) level were carried out to investigate geometry structures, frontier molecular orbital, molecular electrostatic potential maps, and gap energies of the synthesized compounds. In addition, the activities of these compounds against various bacterial proteins were compared with molecular-docking calculations. Finally, ADMET studies were performed to investigate the possibility of using of the target compounds as drugs.
