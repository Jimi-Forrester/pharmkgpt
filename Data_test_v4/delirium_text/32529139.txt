32529139|a|PURPOSE: To report on the use of outpatient anesthesia (OPA) facilitating delivery of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with severe cognitive impairments (CI) diagnosed with inoperable early stage lung cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We surveyed our institutional review board-approved prospective lung SBRT data registry to document the feasibility of using anesthesia in CI patients and to determine their SBRT outcomes. RESULTS: From 2004 to 2018, 8 from a total 2084 patients were identified for this analysis. The median age at treatment was 68 years (range, 44-78). Most patients were female (62.5%). CI diagnoses included Alzheimer-related dementia (3 patients), chronic schizophrenia (3 patients), severe anxiety disorder (1 patient), and severe developmental disability (1 patient). The median tumor size was 3.4 cm (range, 1.1-10.5), and 7 patients (87.5 %) had central lesions. The median follow-up time was 22.5 months. The most common (50%) SBRT schedule used was 50 Gy in 5 fractions. Intravenous propofol (10 mg/mL) was used for OPA in all cases at the time of simulation and with daily treatments. OPA was well tolerated and all patients completed SBRT as prescribed. There was one grade 5 but no other grade 3 or higher SBRT-related toxicities. One patient died with local failure and one of distant failure. CONCLUSIONS: OPA made lung SBRT feasible for patients with CIs. SBRT outcomes were in keeping with those reported in the literature. CI should not be considered a contraindication per se to SBRT delivery in patients otherwise appropriate for this modality.
