35160093|t|Hospital-Acquired Functional Decline and Clinical Outcomes in Older Cardiac Surgical Patients: A Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study.
35160093|a|This study aimed to determine the effect of hospital-acquired functional decline (HAFD) on prognosis, 1-year post-hospital discharge, of older patients who had undergone cardiac surgery in seven Japanese hospitals between June 2017 and June 2018. This multicenter prospective cohort study involved 247 patients with cardiac disease aged >=65 years. HAFD was defined as a decrease in the short physical performance battery at hospital discharge compared with before surgery. Primary outcomes included a composite outcome of frailty severity, total mortality, and cardiovascular readmission 1-year post-hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were changes in the total score and sub-item scores in the Ki-hon Checklist (KCL), assessed pre- and 1-year postoperatively. Poor prognostic outcomes were observed in 33% of patients, and multivariate analysis identified HAFD (odds ratio [OR] 3.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.75-6.72, p < 0.001) and low preoperative gait speed (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.18-5.17, p = 0.016) as independent predictors of poor prognosis. Patients with HAFD had significantly worse total KCL scores and subscale scores for instrumental activities of daily living, mobility, oral function, and depression at 1-year post-hospital discharge. HAFD is a powerful predictor of prognosis in older patients who have undergone cardiac surgery.
