23378485|t|Translation and validation of a questionnaire to assess the diagnosis and management of dementia in Greek general practice.
23378485|a|The aim of this study was to translate and validate the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge scale (ADKS) in a population of Greek general practitioners (GPs). The international standards for the forward and back translation approach were followed. For the validation step, 112 GPs, treating dementia in their daily practices, were enrolled from Crete. The questionnaire was assessed for the following psychometric properties: intraclass reliability, test-retest reliability, and construct and face validity. Internal consistency of the Greek ADKS was satisfactory (alpha = .65). A high repeatability of the instrument was found during the retest with 27 GPs (intraclass correlation coefficient = 1.0). Factor analysis showed that all the items from the original instrument can be used in the Greek version. The inter-item correlation revealed a high cross-correlation between the items of the questionnaire (alpha > .6). The data confirmed the validity of the Greek version of the ADKS for measuring GPs' knowledge on the diagnosis and management of dementia.
