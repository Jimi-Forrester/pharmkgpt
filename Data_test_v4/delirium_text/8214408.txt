8214408|t|Intravenous flunitrazepam in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal delirium.
8214408|a|Alcohol withdrawal delirium (AWD) requires treatment with an adequate sedative, anticonvulsant, and antipsychotic agent next to general intensive care measures. Optimal medication should have a rapid onset of action and the possibility of parenteral application. A specific antagonist should be available. Flunitrazepam is a benzodiazepine that fulfills all these criteria. Twenty five patients suffering from AWD (mean age 45 years) took part in an open trial and underwent treatment with infusions of flunitrazepam (concentration: 8 mg/250 ml NaCl; speed, 250 ml/hr). Psychopathological, vegetative, and vital parameters were assessed every hour. All patients survived. They were treated with a mean total dose (SD) of 83.9 (45.4) mg of flunitrazepam (1.3 mg/kg body weight), which induced sedation 13.2 (5.3) min after the initiation of intravenous treatment. The mean duration of AWD (85.1 +/- 39.4 hr) corresponded to other studies, whereas the frequency of preexisting and concomitant diseases was higher (92%) in our patients. A patient who suffered from bronchitis and had a nasopharyngeal tamponade showed severe respiratory depression after having received 4 mg of flunitrazepam. This complication remitted immediately when 0.5 mg of flumazenil was given intravenously. No epileptic manifestation was observed during the treatment or after discontinuation of flunitrazepam. Vegetative and psychopathological symptoms (tremor, sweating, hallucinations, confusion, and restlessness) remitted rapidly. Our data suggest that intravenous flunitrazepam can be an efficacious and safe alternative to traditional treatment strategies of AWD.
