36837800|t|Effectiveness of Intermittent Hypoxia-Hyperoxia Therapy in Different Pathologies with Possible Metabolic Implications.
36837800|a|Intermittent oxygen therapy (IHT), initially used in the hypoxic administration variant, has been shown to be effective in various pathologies studied, from cardiopulmonary to vascular and metabolic pathologies and more. IHT used to prevent and treat various diseases has thus gained more and more attention as the years have passed. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects have been investigated at multiple biological levels, from systemic physiological reactions to genomic regulation. In the last decade, a new method of intermittent oxygen therapy has been developed that combines hypoxic and hyperoxic periods. They can be applied both at rest and during physical exercise, hence the specific indications in sports medicine. It has been hypothesized that replacing normoxia with moderate hyperoxia may increase the adaptive response to the intermittent hypoxic stimulus by upregulating reactive oxygen species and hypoxia-inducible genes. This systematic literature review is based on the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis"-"PRISMA"-methodology, the widely internationally accepted method.
