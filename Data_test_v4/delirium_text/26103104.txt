26103104|a|Current demographic trends and medical practices raise the question of cancer screening in the elderly, especially those with dementia. Furthermore, studies have suggested that patient with Alzheimer disease showed a reduced risk of cancer. However, this link may be biased by the absence of cancer screening. That's why we conducted a survey to poll general practitioners' (GP) opinion on screening cancer in the elderly. In this study, 304 general practitioners were asked, from May to March 2014, about their cancer screening practices and on the elements influencing it. Eighty-two physicians responded. The rate of response was 29.4%. Forty-nine (60%) GP said practicing cancer screening in the elderly, 60 (64%) thought that screening does not lead to treatment, 51 (62%) GP were not favorable to cancer screening in patients with dementia, 63 (77%) GP thought that there is a lack of recommendations to guide cancer screening in the elderly. Finally, this study shows that cancer screening is less performed in patients with dementia. Further, promote exchange between general practitioners and specialists, by strengthening Cancer and Geriatrics networks, could probably increase cancer screening in the elderly, with or without dementia.
