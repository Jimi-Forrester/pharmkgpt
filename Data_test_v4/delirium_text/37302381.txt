37302381|t|Effectiveness of sleep interventions to reduce delirium in critically ill patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
37302381|a|PURPOSE: To analyze the effectiveness of sleep interventions in reducing the incidence and duration of delirium in the ICU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane databases for relevant randomized controlled trials from inception to August 2022. Literature screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed independently by two investigators. Data from the included studies were analyzed using Stata and TSA software. RESULTS: Fifteen randomized controlled trials were eligible. Meta-analysis showed that the sleep intervention was associated with a reduced incidence of delirium in the ICU (RR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.58 to 0.93, p < 0.001) compared to the control group. The results of the trial sequence analysis further confirm that sleep interventions are effective in reducing the occurrence of delirium. Pooled data from the three dexmedetomidine trials showed significant differences in the incidence of ICU delirium between groups (RR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.59, p < 0.001). The respective pooled results of other sleep interventions (e.g., light therapy, earplugs, melatonin, and multicomponent nonpharmacologic treatments) did not find a significant effect on reducing the incidence and duration of ICU delirium (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence suggests that non-pharmacological sleep interventions are not effective in preventing delirium in ICU patients. However, limited by the number and quality of included studies, future well-designed multicenter randomized controlled trials are still needed to validate the results of this study.
