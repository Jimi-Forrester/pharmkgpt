32419227|a|The degeneration of the human brain is a complex process, which often affects certain brain regions due to healthy aging or disease. This degeneration can be evaluated on regions of interest (ROI) in the brain through probabilistic networks and morphological estimates. Current approaches for finding such networks are limited to analyses at discrete neuropsychological stages, which cannot appropriately account for connectivity dynamics over the onset of cognitive deterioration, and morphological changes are seldom unified with connectivity networks, despite known dependencies. To overcome these limitations, a probabilistic wombling model is proposed to simultaneously estimate ROI cortical thickness and covariance networks contingent on rates of change in cognitive decline. This proposed model was applied to analyze longitudinal data from healthy control (HC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) groups and found connection differences pertaining to regions, which play a crucial role in lasting cognitive impairment, such as the entorhinal area and temporal regions. Moreover, HC cortical thickness estimates were significantly higher than those in the AD group across all ROIs. The analyses presented in this work will help practitioners jointly analyze brain tissue atrophy at the ROI-level conditional on neuropsychological networks, which could potentially allow for more targeted therapeutic interventions.
