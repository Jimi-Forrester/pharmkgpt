38347288|a|Central nervous system (CNS) accumulation of fibrillary deposits made of Amyloid beta (Abeta), hyperphosphorylated Tau or alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), present either alone or in the form of mixed pathology, characterizes the most common neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) as well as the aging brain. Compelling evidence supports that acute neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke, are also accompanied by increased deposition of toxic Abeta, Tau and alpha-syn species. While the contribution of these pathological proteins to neurodegeneration has been experimentally ascertained, the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving Abeta, Tau and alpha-syn-related brain damage remain to be fully clarified. In the last few years, studies have shown that Abeta, Tau and alpha-syn may contribute to neurodegeneration also by inducing and/or promoting blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. These pathological proteins can affect BBB integrity either directly by affecting key BBB components such as pericytes and endothelial cells (ECs) or indirectly, by promoting brain macrophages activation and dysfunction. Here, we summarize and critically discuss key findings showing how Abeta, Tau and alpha-syn can contribute to BBB damage in most common NDDs, TBI and stroke. We also highlight the need for a deeper characterization of the role of these pathological proteins in the activation and dysfunction of brain macrophages, pericytes and ECs to improve diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic neurological disorders.
