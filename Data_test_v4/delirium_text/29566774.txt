29566774|a|ABSTRACTCare aides working in nursing homes are often exposed to responsive behaviours in older adults living with Alzheimer's disease. As these behaviors may induce psychological distress, the current research aims to estimate the contribution of a set of variables on the psychological distress reported by care aides. Variables include perceived frequency of responsive behaviours, primary and secondary cognitive appraisal, and coping strategies. A total of ninety-two day care aides were recruited in nursing homes in the Quebec City area. Standard multiple regression was completed and findings show that frequency of responsive behaviours, primary appraisal of threat, secondary appraisal (feeling incapable of changing the situation) and seeking emotional support contribute to care aides' psychological distress. This study highlights the importance of responsive behaviours on the units and discusses the psychological mechanisms used by care aides.
