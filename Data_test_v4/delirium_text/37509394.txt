37509394|t|Cellular Therapy for Lung Cancer: Focusing on Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR T) Cells and Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) Therapy.
37509394|a|Lung cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors has led to a marked improvement in the outcomes of lung cancer patients. Despite these advances, there is a huge unmet need for therapeutic options in patients who are not candidates for targeted or immunotherapy or those who progress after first-line treatment. With its high mutational burden, lung cancer appears to be an attractive target for novel personalized treatment approaches. In this review, we provide an overview of two adoptive cell therapy approaches-chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) T-cell therapy and Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in lung cancer with an emphasis on current challenges and future perspectives. While both these therapies are still in the early phases of development in lung cancer and need more refinement, they harbor the potential to be effective treatment options for this group of patients with otherwise poor prognoses.
