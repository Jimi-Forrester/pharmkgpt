9846958|t|Amyloid-beta deposition in skeletal muscle of transgenic mice: possible model of inclusion body myopathy.
9846958|a|Inclusion body myopathy is a progressive muscle disorder characterized by nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions and vacuolation of muscle fibers. Affected muscle fibers contain deposits of congophilic amyloid, amyloid-beta immunoreactive filaments, and paired helical filaments, all of which are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease in brain. Accumulations of amyloid-beta and its precursor are thought to play important roles in the pathogenesis of both inclusion body myopathy and Alzheimer's disease. Overexpression of mutant forms of beta protein precursor in transgenic mice by neuron-specific promoters has been reported to cause amyloid deposits in the brain. Here we report that overexpression in transgenic mice of the signal plus 99-amino acid carboxyl-terminal sequences of beta protein precursor, under the control of a cytomegalovirus enhancer/beta-actin promoter, resulted in vacuolation and increasing accumulation of the 4-kd amyloid-beta and the carboxyl-terminus in skeletal muscle fibers during aging. These deposits in transgenic muscle only rarely showed Congo red birefringence. Thus, overexpression of part of beta protein precursor in transgenic mice led to development of some of the characteristic features of inclusion body myopathy. These mice may be a useful model of inclusion body myopathy, which shares a number of pathological markers with Alzheimer's disease.
