35464324|t|MicroRNAs as the Potential Regulators of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Modifiers of the COVID-19 Clinical Features.
35464324|a|The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) warrants the identification of factors that may determine both risk and severity of infection. The factors include microRNAs that have a wide regulatory potential and hence are particularly interesting. The review focuses on the potential roles of human microRNAs and the viral genome as well as microRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical features of COVID-19. The review summarizes the information about the human microRNAs that are thought to specifically bind to the SARS-CoV-2 genome and considers their expression levels in various organs (cells) in both healthy state and pathologies that are risk factors for severe COVID-19. Potential mechanisms whereby SARS-CoV-2 may affect the clinical features of COVID-19 are discussed in brief. The mechanisms include blocking of human microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, changes in gene expression in infected cells, and possible epigenetic modifications of the human genome with the participation of coronavirus microRNAs.
