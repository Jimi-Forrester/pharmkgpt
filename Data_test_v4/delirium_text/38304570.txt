38304570|t|Decreasing the incidence of delirium via multi-sensory stimulation in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit: A protocol for a randomized feasibility study.
38304570|a|Introduction: Delirium is a common acute brain dysfunction syndrome in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Family engagement strategies, based on the theory of multi-sensory stimulation to ameliorate sensory deprivation in patients, may be an effective and scalable method to reduce the burden of delirium. Methods: /design: This is a assessor-blinded, randomised controlled trial of the feasibility of multi-sensory stimulation (MS) in patients with delirium. A total of 72 mechanically ventilated patients (n = 24 in each group) admitted to the ICU will be randomised to routine non-pharmacological delirium care (control), family multi-sensory stimulation and nurse multi-sensory stimulation groups. All participants except the control group will receive multi-sensory stimulation, including visual, auditory, tactile and kinesthetic stimulation, for 5 days. Our primary aim is to determine the feasibility of the study procedure (recruitment, eligibility, retention and attrition rates, appropriateness of clinical outcome measures), feasibility, acceptability and safety of the intervention (adverse events, satisfaction and other). Our secondary objective is to assess the preliminary efficacy of the MS protocol in reducing the incidence, duration and severity of delirium. Sedation levels and delirium severity will be assessed twice daily. Enrolled participants will be followed in hospital until death, discharge or up to 28 days after treatment. Ethics and dissemination: The current study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of Huazhong University of Science and Technology Union Shenzhen Hospital, China (KY-2023-031-01). The results of this study will be presented at scientific conferences and submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number: ChiCTR2300071457.
