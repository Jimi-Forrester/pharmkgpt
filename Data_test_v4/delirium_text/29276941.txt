29276941|t|Rnf152 Is Essential for NeuroD Expression and Delta-Notch Signaling in the Zebrafish Embryos.
29276941|a|We report the biological functions of a zebrafish homologue of RING-finger protein 152 (rnf152) during embryogenesis. rnf152 was initially identified as a brain-enriched E3 ligase involved in early embryogenesis of zebrafish. Expression of rnf152 was ubiquitous in the brain at 24 hpf but restricted to the eyes, midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB), and rhombomeres at 48 hpf. Knockdown of rnf152 in zebrafish embryos caused defects in the eyes, MHB, and rhombomeres (r1-7) at 24 hpf. These defects in rnf152-deficient embryos were analyzed by whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) using neuroD, deltaD, notch1a, and notch3 probes. NeuroD expression was abolished in the marginal zone, outer nuclear layer (ONL), inner nuclear layer (INL), and ganglion cell layer (GCL) of the eyes at 27 hpf. Furthermore, deltaD and notch1a expression was remarkably reduced in the ONL, INL, subpallium, tectum, cerebellum, and rhombomeres (r1-7) at 24 hpf, whereas notch3 expression was reduced in the tectum, cerebellum, and rhombomeres at 24 hpf. Finally, we confirmed that expression of Notch target genes, her4 and ascl1a, also decreased significantly in these areas at 24 hpf. Thus, we propose that Rnf152 is essential for development of the eyes, midbrain and hindbrain, and that Delta-Notch signaling is involved.
