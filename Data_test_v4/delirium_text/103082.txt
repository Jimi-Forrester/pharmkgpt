103082|a|The laboratory transmission to animals of an apparently degenerative disease of the nervous system, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), is now well established. Important questions arising from this observation are the possibility of natural transmission or infectivity and the existence of other similarly transmissible diseases. Epidemiological studies have revealed some possible clusters of CJD and also an association with previous craniotomy, but there is no definite evidence of natural infection. A few instances have been reported of experimental CJD in animals following inoculation with material from Alzheimer's disease, but apart from this there is so far no evidence of transmission of any other form of degenerative nervous disease.
