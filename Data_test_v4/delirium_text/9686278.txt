9686278|t|Differential diagnosis in dementia.
9686278|a|Dementia is characterised by progressive memory loss, associated with agnosia, aphasia, dyscalculia, apraxia, and deficits in executive functioning. Alzheimer disease is the most frequent cause of dementia, with vascular dementia, diffuse Lewy body disease, and other etiologies being important differential diagnoses. A strategy and diagnostic hierarchy for diagnosis in dementia is proposed. Diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, and vascular dementia are discussed.
