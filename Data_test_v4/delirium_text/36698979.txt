36698979|t|Electron microscopy reveals toroidal shape of master neuronal cell differentiator REST - RE1-silencing transcription factor.
36698979|a|The RE1-Silencing Transcription factor (REST) is essential for neuronal differentiation. Here, we report the first 18.5-angstrom electron microscopy structure of human REST. The refined electron map suggests that REST forms a torus that can accommodate DNA double-helix in the central hole. Additionally, we quantitatively described REST binding to the canonical DNA sequence of the neuron-restrictive silencer element. We developed protocols for the expression and purification of full-length REST and the shortened variant REST-N62 produced by alternative splicing. We tested the mutual interaction of full-length REST and the splicing variant REST-N62. Revealed structure-function relationships of master neuronal repressor REST will allow finding new biological ways of prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and diseases.
