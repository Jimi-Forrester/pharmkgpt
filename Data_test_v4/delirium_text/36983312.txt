36983312|t|Efficacy of Lidocaine Infusion in High-Risk Vascular Surgery-A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Single-Center Clinical Trial.
36983312|a|BACKGROUND: In perioperative pain control, adjuvants such as lidocaine can reduce opioid consumption in a specific type of surgery. The aim of this single-center prospective double-blinded randomized controlled trial was to determine opioid consumption in the perioperative period in patients receiving continuous lidocaine infusion. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective abdominal aorta and/or iliac arteries open surgery were randomized into two groups to receive 1% lidocaine or placebo at the same infusion rate based on ideal body weight (bolus of 0.15 mL/kg during the induction of anesthesia followed by continuous infusion of 0.2 mL/kg/h during surgery; postoperatively 0.1 mL/kg/h for 24 h) additionally to standard opioid analgesia. RESULTS: Total opioid consumption within 24 h after surgery was 89.2 mg (95%CI 80.9-97.4) in the lidocaine and 113.1 mg (95%CI 102.5-123.6) in the placebo group (p = 0.0007). Similar findings were observed in opioid consumption intraoperatively (26.7 mg (95%CI 22.2-31.3) vs. 35.1 mg (95%CI 29.1-41.2), respectively, p = 0.029) and six hours postoperatively (47.5 mg (IQR 37.5-59.5) vs. 60 mg (IQR 44-83), respectively, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk vascular surgery, lidocaine infusion as an adjunct to standard perioperative analgesia is effective. It may decrease opioid consumption by more than 20% during the first 24 h after surgery, with no serious adverse effects noted during the study period.
