37504524|t|Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors to Decrease the Uric Acid Concentration-A Novel Mechanism of Action.
37504524|a|Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) are glucose-lowering agents whose positive impact on cardiovascular risk has been described extensively. Not only do they influence lipid profile, blood pressure, atherosclerosis risk, hemoglobin level, and insulin resistance, but they also reduce cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, and hospitalization rates. Some of these effects may be due to their impact on serum uric acid (SUA) concentration. Findings from nine meta-analyses showed that, indeed, SGLT2is significantly reduce SUA. The data on the drug- and dose-dependency of this effect were inconclusive. Several factors alternating the beneficial effects of SGLT2is on SUA, such as glycated hemoglobin concentration (HbA1c), presence of diabetes, and baseline SUA level, were described. Even though there is a consensus that the lowering of SUA by SGLT2is might be due to the increased urinary excretion rate of uric acid (UEUA) rather than its altered metabolism, the exact mechanism remains unknown. The influence of SGLT2is on SUA may not only be used in gout treatment but may also be of huge importance in explaining the observed pleiotropic effects of SGLT2is.
