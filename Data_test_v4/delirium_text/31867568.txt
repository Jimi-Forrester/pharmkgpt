31867568|a|Neurocognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), affect millions of people worldwide and are characterized by cognitive decline. Human and animal studies have shown that chronic immune response and inflammation are important factors in the pathogenesis of AD. Chronic inflammation can accelerate the aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides and later hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. The exact etiology of AD is not clear, but genetics and environmental factors, such as age, family history, and lifestyle are linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Lifestyle habits, such as poor diet, are associated with inflammation and could accelerate or slow down the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we provide a review of the potential conditions and factors that stimulate the inflammatory processes in AD. An understanding of inflammatory mechanisms influencing the development of AD may help to protect against dementia and AD.
