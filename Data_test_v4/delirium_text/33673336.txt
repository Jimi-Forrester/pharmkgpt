33673336|t|Aquaporins in Immune Cells and Inflammation: New Targets for Drug Development.
33673336|a|The mammalian immune system senses foreign antigens by mechanisms that involve the interplay of various kinds of immune cells, culminating in inflammation resolution and tissue clearance. The ability of the immune cells to communicate (via chemokines) and to shift shape for migration, phagocytosis or antigen uptake is mainly supported by critical proteins such as aquaporins (AQPs) that regulate water fluid homeostasis and volume changes. AQPs are protein channels that facilitate water and small uncharged molecules' (such as glycerol or hydrogen peroxide) diffusion through membranes. A number of AQP isoforms were found upregulated in inflammatory conditions and are considered essential for the migration and survival of immune cells. The present review updates information on AQPs' involvement in immunity and inflammatory processes, highlighting their role as crucial players and promising targets for drug discovery.
