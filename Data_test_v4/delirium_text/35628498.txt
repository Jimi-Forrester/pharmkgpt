35628498|t|The Role of DNA Repair in Genomic Instability of Multiple Myeloma.
35628498|a|Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a B cell malignancy marked by genomic instability that arises both through pathogenesis and during disease progression. Despite recent advances in therapy, MM remains incurable. Recently, it has been reported that DNA repair can influence genomic changes and drug resistance in MM. The dysregulation of DNA repair function may provide an alternative explanation for genomic instability observed in MM cells and in cells derived from MM patients. This review provides an overview of DNA repair pathways with a special focus on their involvement in MM and discusses the role they play in MM progression and drug resistance. This review highlights how unrepaired DNA damage due to aberrant DNA repair response in MM exacerbates genomic instability and chromosomal abnormalities, enabling MM progression and drug resistance.
