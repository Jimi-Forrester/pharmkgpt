12150769|t|Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and motor neurone disease: identifying a common mechanism.
12150769|a|Although Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and motor neurone disease are distinct disorders, there could be a common neurodegenerative mechanism that characterises the death of selective neurone populations in each case. We propose that this mechanism could be an aberrantly activated, developmental process involving a non-classical, non-enzymatic action of acetylcholinesterase mediated via a short linear motif near the C-terminal end of the molecule. Since this motif has a highly conserved homology with part of the amyloid precursor protein, it may be particularly attractive as a target for novel therapeutic strategies in neurodegeneration.
