25095819|t|Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia: one potentially preventable and modifiable disease. Part I: Pathology, diagnosis and screening.
25095819|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) frequently coexist and their separation may well be a false dichotomy. The neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular changes vary from the extremes of 'pure AD' to 'pure VaD' and a combination of changes is the most frequent. Both changes have a preclinical phase of decades. The clinical presentation is often out of proportion to the neuropathology to a lesser or greater degree. The diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment is based on clinical assessment and diagnostic criteria have been published. Neuropsychological testing and specialist evaluation may be required. The UK and US governments propose screening of all older adults. The value of routine screening has been questioned. Consent for testing and counseling are essential.
