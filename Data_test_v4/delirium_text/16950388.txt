16950388|a|INTRODUCTION: We describe three patients with hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) who developed acute organic brain syndrome. All three presented with high-grade fever and twilight state, and were admitted to our hospital. After admission, delirium developed in all three. As delirium improved, various other psychiatric symptoms, including hallucinations, agitation, hypoactivity, affective lability and insomnia, were noted. DISCUSSION: When treated with steroid hormones, immunoglobulin and neuroleptics, all patients demonstrated improvement in their psychiatric symptoms, as well as in their general condition and laboratory findings. Ultimately, they all recovered and were discharged. CONCLUSION: It needs to be noted that organic brain syndrome might be observed at the onset of HPS. Consequently, early diagnosis and treatment for psychiatric symptoms, as well as for HPS, are crucial.
