15785034|a|We evaluated everyday memory impairment in 24 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test (RBMT) and compared the scores with those of 48 age-, sex- and education-matched normal controls (NC) and 48 age-, sex- and education-matched Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. Overall everyday memory was impaired in MCI patients but the severity was milder than that in AD patients. The MCI patients showed impairment of everyday memory tasks requiring delayed recall. But they could normally perform tasks immediately after memorizing, except for recalling and retracing a simple new route. The total Profile score correctly classified 100% of the MCI patients and 91.7% of NC, thus demonstrating the usefulness of the RBMT for diagnosing MCI patients. Prospective memory tasks were not useful for detecting the patients with MCI.
