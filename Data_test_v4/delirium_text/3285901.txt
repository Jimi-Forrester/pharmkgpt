3285901|t|Delirium in liver transplantation candidates: discriminant analysis of multiple test variables.
3285901|a|We report the results of electroencephalograms, Mini-Mental State exam, Trailmaking Tests A and B, and serum albumin levels in 108 consecutive liver transplantation candidates. We compared test results to a clinical DSM-III diagnosis of delirium. Although each variable could differentiate between the two groups (delirium n = 18; nondelirium n = 90) at a statistically significant level, a discriminant analysis involving either all variables or only three particular variables (Trailmaking B, EEG code, and albumin) resulted in the highest specificity (97.8%) and sensitivity (83.3%), with a correct classification of 95.4% of subjects. The analysis also generates an equation that can be applied to clinical situations to enhance the accurate recognition of delirium. In addition, to explain abnormal Trailmaking B scores and/or EEGs in subjects who did not otherwise meet DSM-III criteria for delirium, we suggest the presence of a "subclinical delirium."
