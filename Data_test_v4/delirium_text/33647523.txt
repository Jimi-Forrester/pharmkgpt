33647523|a|The underlying structural correlates of predisposition to postoperative delirium remain largely unknown. A combined analysis of preoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers could improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of delirium. Therefore, we aimed to identify different MRI brain phenotypes in older patients scheduled for major elective surgery, and to assess the relation between these phenotypes and postoperative delirium. Markers of neurodegenerative and neurovascular brain changes were determined from MRI brain scans in older patients (n = 161, mean age 71, standard deviation 5 years), of whom 24 (15%) developed delirium. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed. We found six distinct groups of patients with different MRI brain phenotypes. Logistic regression analysis showed a higher odds of developing postoperative delirium in individuals with multi-burden pathology (n = 15 (9%), odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 3.8 (1.1-13.0)). In conclusion, these results indicate that different MRI brain phenotypes are related to a different risk of developing delirium after major elective surgery. MRI brain phenotypes could assist in an improved understanding of the structural correlates of predisposition to postoperative delirium.
