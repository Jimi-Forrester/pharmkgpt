29776436|t|Rates and causes of 30-day readmission and emergency room utilization following head and neck surgery.
29776436|a|BACKGROUND: Unplanned returns to hospital are common, costly, and potentially avoidable. We aimed to investigate and characterize reasons for all-cause readmissions to hospital as in-patients (IPs) and visits to the Emergency Department (ED) within 30-days following patient discharge post head and neck surgery (HNS). METHODS: Retrospective case series with chart review. All patients within the Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery who underwent HNS for benign and malignant disease from January 1, 2010 to May 31, 2015 were identified. The electronic medical records of readmitted patients were reviewed for reasons of readmission, demographic data, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Following 1281 surgical cases, there were 41 (3.20%) IP readmissions and 109 (8.43%) ED visits within 30-days after discharge for HNS. For IP readmissions, most common causes included infection (26.8%), respiratory symptoms (17.1%), and pain (17.1%). Most common reasons for ED visits were for pain (31.5%), bleeding (17.6%), and infection (14.8%). Readmitted IPs had significantly higher health burden at pre-operative baseline as compared to patients who visited the ED when assessed with the American Society of Anesthesiology scores (p = 0.002) and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Rate of 30-day IP readmission and ED utilization was 3.20 and 8.43%, respectively. Pain and infection were common causes for returns to hospital. Discharge planning may be improved to target common causes for post-surgical hospital visits in order to decrease readmission rates.
