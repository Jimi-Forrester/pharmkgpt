36317131|t|A Novel LncRNA SNHG3 Promotes Osteoblast Differentiation Through BMP2 Upregulation in Aortic Valve Calcification.
36317131|a|Based on high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing, SNHG3 was among the most highly expressed long noncoding RNAs in calcific aortic valve disease. SNHG3 upregulation was verified in human and mouse calcified aortic valves. Moreover, in vivo and in vitro studies showed SNHG3 silencing markedly ameliorated aortic valve calcification. In-depth functional assays showed SNHG3 physically interacted with polycomb repressive complex 2 to suppress the H3K27 trimethylation BMP2 locus, which in turn activated BMP2 expression and signaling pathways. Taken together, SNHG3 promoted aortic valve calcification by upregulating BMP2, which might be a novel therapeutic target in human calcific aortic valve disease.
