20733307|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Since little is known about the role of gender in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prospective epidemiological study was conducted to detect gender differences in relation to AD evolution and outcome. METHODS: Six hundred AD patients, 214 men and 386 women, first seen between September 2000 and December 2003, were enrolled; the follow-up period lasted until December 2008. RESULTS: The men had greater comorbidity and higher mortality than the women, who instead recorded more disability and longer survival. Survival curves showed that women reach partial loss of autonomy faster than men. Higher Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores at baseline showed a predictive value for loss of autonomy regardless of gender. Pharmacological treatment seems to have a protective role on disability and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Gender influences disease evolution not only directly but also through other factors such as comorbidity.
