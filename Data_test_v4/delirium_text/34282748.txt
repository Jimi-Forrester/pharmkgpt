34282748|a|This study investigated the effects of vortioxetine on cognitive function in adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This single-arm, open-label, phase II study enrolled 111 adults with MCI without depressive symptoms to receive 5-10 mg/day vortioxetine for 6 months. Main outcomes assessed: cognitive function [Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)], disease severity [Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)], clinician-assessed improvement and safety. Mean MoCA score increased from 24.2 points (baseline) to 29.7 points (month 6), placing most subjects within the cognitively normal range (>=26 points). Compared with baseline, MoCA and DSST scores were significantly improved at months 1, 3 and 6 (P < 0.001 for all). Global CDR scores significantly improved from baseline to month 6 (mean change -0.37 points; P < 0.001), representing an improvement from very mild impairment (0.50 points) to cognitively normal status (0.13 points), mainly in CDR memory scores. At month 6, 89.6% of subjects had improved disease severity. Adverse events and adverse drug reactions were reported in 9.9% (n = 11) and 2.7% (n = 3) of subjects, respectively. Vortioxetine treatment was associated with significant improvement in cognitive function and a favorable safety profile in community-dwelling older adults with MCI. Given the lack of evidence for efficacious pharmacologic interventions for MCI, our results are encouraging and warrant further investigation.
