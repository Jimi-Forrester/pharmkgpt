37447285|t|Dietary Implications of the Bidirectional Relationship between the Gut Microflora and Inflammatory Diseases with Special Emphasis on Irritable Bowel Disease: Current and Future Perspective.
37447285|a|The immune system is vital for safeguarding the human body against infections and inflammatory diseases. The role of diet and meal patterns in modulating immune function is complex, and highlighting this topic is crucial for identifying potential ways to improve immune health. In Europe, the Mediterranean diet and Western diet are the most common dietary patterns, and gaining an understanding of how they affect immune function is essential for public health. There are numerous inflammatory diseases that are observed in younger and older people. Some of the common diseases include polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), vasculitis, sarcopenia, cirrhosis, cancer, and fibromyalgia, but the main focus in this review article is on irritable bowel disease (IBD). In general, dietary choices can have an immense impact on the microbial flora of the gut in people with inflammatory diseases. The intake of Mediterranean-style foods promotes the growth of healthy bacteria that enhances the function of the immune system. On the other hand, it is mostly seen that the intake of Western-style foods leads to the growth of harmful gut bacteria that contributes to inflammation and disease development by weakening the immune system. Additionally, inflammation in the gut can impact brain function, leading to mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression. Rare inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis and sarcoidosis, are of main interest in this article. All the above-mentioned common and rare inflammatory diseases have a certain relationship with the microbiota of the gut. The gut microbiome plays a significant role in IBD; fiber and prebiotic interventions may represent promising adjunct therapies for pediatric IBD by targeting the gut microbiome. By advancing a good overall arrangement of microorganisms in the stomach through dietary mediations, working on the side effects and alleviating of diseases might be conceivable. The gut microbiota can be affected differently by various dietary fatty acid types. There is also an involvement of genetics in the progression of IBD, such as transcriptional factors, and one gene of interest is the LCT gene, which encodes for lactase, an enzyme responsible for digesting lactose in the gut.
