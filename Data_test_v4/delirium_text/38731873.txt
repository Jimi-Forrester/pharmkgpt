38731873|a|The supply and control of iron is essential for all cells and vital for many physiological processes. All functions and activities of iron are expressed in conjunction with iron-binding molecules. For example, natural chelators such as transferrin and chelator-iron complexes such as haem play major roles in iron metabolism and human physiology. Similarly, the mainstay treatments of the most common diseases of iron metabolism, namely iron deficiency anaemia and iron overload, involve many iron-chelator complexes and the iron-chelating drugs deferiprone (L1), deferoxamine (DF) and deferasirox. Endogenous chelators such as citric acid and glutathione and exogenous chelators such as ascorbic acid also play important roles in iron metabolism and iron homeostasis. Recent advances in the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia with effective iron complexes such as the ferric iron tri-maltol complex (feraccru or accrufer) and the effective treatment of transfusional iron overload using L1 and L1/DF combinations have decreased associated mortality and morbidity and also improved the quality of life of millions of patients. Many other chelating drugs such as ciclopirox, dexrazoxane and EDTA are used daily by millions of patients in other diseases. Similarly, many other drugs or their metabolites with iron-chelation capacity such as hydroxyurea, tetracyclines, anthracyclines and aspirin, as well as dietary molecules such as gallic acid, caffeic acid, quercetin, ellagic acid, maltol and many other phytochelators, are known to interact with iron and affect iron metabolism and related diseases. Different interactions are also observed in the presence of essential, xenobiotic, diagnostic and theranostic metal ions competing with iron. Clinical trials using L1 in Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, as well as HIV and other infections, cancer, diabetic nephropathy and anaemia of inflammation, highlight the importance of chelation therapy in many other clinical conditions. The proposed use of iron chelators for modulating ferroptosis signifies a new era in the design of new therapeutic chelation strategies in many other diseases. The introduction of artificial intelligence guidance for optimal chelation therapeutic outcomes in personalised medicine is expected to increase further the impact of chelation in medicine, as well as the survival and quality of life of millions of patients with iron metabolic disorders and also other diseases.
