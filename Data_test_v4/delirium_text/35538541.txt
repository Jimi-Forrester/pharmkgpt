35538541|a|BACKGROUND: Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is an uncommon clinical condition characterized by the presence of mucinous ascites, mainly induced by perforated appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (AMN). The peritoneal surface of the small bowel is usually spared from disease manifestation due to peristaltic movements. Mucinous tumours can disseminate as PMP on the entire peritoneum, but are rarely intraluminal. For the first time in literature, we report a case of intraluminal PMP involving the ileum. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old male was treated for perforated AMN and disseminated PMP with cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. During follow-up, the patient developed intraperitoneal recurrence together with intraluminal depositions in the ileum, both disease manifestations with identical KRAS and SMAD4 mutations. Hereafter, the patient was treated with palliative care. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the variation in the biological and clinical behaviour of this rare disease. Clinicians should be aware of unusual tumour distribution patterns of PMP, including the presence of mucinous tumour within the small bowel.
