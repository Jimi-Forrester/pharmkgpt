39861558|t|The Genus Chiliadenus: A Comprehensive Review of Taxonomic Aspects, Traditional Uses, Phytochemistry and Pharmacological Activities.
39861558|a|The genus Chiliadenus (Asteraceae) has been traditionally used in Mediterranean medicine for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties. However, scientific research on this genus remains limited, highlighting the need for a comprehensive review of its chemical composition and pharmacological characteristics. This review compiles existing knowledge on Chiliadenus species, focusing on their secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids, terpenes, and essential oils, as well as associated biological activities. The findings show that the traditional therapeutic properties of Chiliadenus are well supported by reported pharmacological activities in previous studies, emphasizing the potential of this genus for the development of new therapeutic agents. However, the lack of comparative studies among Chiliadenus species and the scarcity of in vivo studies and clinical trials hinder the full realization of its therapeutic potential. Specifically, comparative studies could be key to identifying species with unique chemical profiles and understanding how variations in secondary metabolite composition may influence their pharmacological activities. This work highlights the urgent need to expand research in these areas to validate the pharmacological properties of Chiliadenus species for their application in modern medicine.
