31551204|t|Effect and analysis of ulinastatin combined with thymosin on cardiopulmonary function and delirium in sepsis patients.
31551204|a|The aim of this study was to explore the clinical effect of ulinastatin combined with thymosin in patients with sepsis and its influence on cardiopulmonary function and delirium. Sixty-eight sepsis patients were enrolled as study subjects. The patients were randomly divided into a symptomatic treatment group (n=34) and a combined treatment group (n=34) on the basis of random number table. The two groups were first operated and then, the symptomatic treatment group was given symptomatic support treatment, whilst the combined treatment group was treated with ulinastatin and thymosin on the prerequisite of the symptomatic treatment group. After 7 days of treatment, the evaluation of the curative effect was performed, followed by the comparison of the cardiopulmonary function, immune level and safety between the two groups of patients. The cardiac index and oxygenation index of the combined treatment group were higher than those of the symptomatic treatment group 7 days after treatment (P<0.05). Whereas, the levels of plasma D-dimer and cTnI were lower than those of the symptomatic treatment group (P<0.05). In addition, CD3+, CD4+, CD4+/CD8+ levels of the combined treatment group were higher than those of the symptomatic treatment group 7 days after treatment (P<0.05). On the contrary, CD8+ levels of the combined treatment group were lower than those of the symptomatic treatment group 7 days after treatment. There was no significant (P>0.05) difference in drug safety between the two groups during treatment.
