38943394|a|Background: Portable digital health technologies (DHTs) could help evaluate non-cognitive symptoms, but evidence to support their use in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is uncertain. Objective: 1) To describe portable or wearable DHTs used to obtain digital biomarkers in patients with DLB, 2) to assess the digital biomarkers' ability to evaluate non-cognitive symptoms, and 3) to assess the feasibility of applying digital biomarkers in patients with DLB. Methods: We systematically searched databases MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science from inception through February 28, 2023. Studies assessing digital biomarkers obtained by portable or wearable DHTs and related to non-cognitive symptoms were eligible if including patients with DLB. The quality of studies was assessed using a modified check list based on the NIH Quality assessment tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-sectional Studies. A narrative synthesis of data was carried out. Results: We screened 4,295 records and included 20 studies. Seventeen different DHTs were identified for assessment of most non-cognitive symptoms related to DLB. No thorough validation of digital biomarkers for measurement of non-cognitive symptoms in DLB was reported. Studies did not report on aspects of feasibility in a systematic way. Conclusions: Knowledge about feasibility and validity of individual digital biomarkers remains extremely limited. Study heterogeneity is a barrier for establishing a broad evidence base for application of digital biomarkers in DLB. Researchers should conform to recommended standards for systematic evaluation of digital biomarkers.
