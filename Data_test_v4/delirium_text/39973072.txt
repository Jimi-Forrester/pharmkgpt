39973072|a|Boric acid (BA) is a weak acid and the simplest compound resulting from the dissolution of boron in water. There is great competition to determine whether boron is an essential or nonessential nutrient. Date molasses is a potent type of sweetener with valuable components, such as flavonoids and phenolics, and has significant health benefits. This study investigated the neuro-essentiality and neurotoxicity of boric acid boron in adult male albino rat cortex and cerebellum brain areas and the impact of date molasses treatment. Animals were grouped into the following groups: control, low and high boric acid doses, 10 and 500 mg/kg, respectively, with or without 250 mg/kg date molasses. The results revealed the ability of BAs to cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the cerebellum and cortex, revealing the ability of date molasses to decrease BA accumulation at different time intervals. Additionally, the results varied between a nonsignificant increase or decrease in calcium ion content, monoamines (norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin), glucose, adenosine triphosphate, malondialdehyde and glutathione, depending on the BA dose. Moreover, date molasses mitigated any unwanted BA results. In conclusion, boric acid, which is within a permissible limit, could be essential and have a neuroprotective effect, whereas at a sublethal level, it could have a neurotoxic effect. Additionally, Date molasses can have neuroprotective effects and antagonize the neurotoxic effects of boric acid through its antioxidant and scavenging effects.
