37446601|t|Role of Melatonin in Bovine Reproductive Biotechnology.
37446601|a|Melatonin has profound antioxidant activity and numerous functions in humans as well as in livestock and poultry. Additionally, melatonin plays an important role in regulating the biological rhythms of animals. Combining melatonin with scientific breeding management has considerable potential for optimizing animal physiological functions, but this idea still faces significant challenges. In this review, we summarized the beneficial effects of melatonin supplementation on physiology and reproductive processes in cattle, including granulosa cells, oocytes, circadian rhythm, stress, inflammation, testicular function, spermatogenesis, and semen cryopreservation. There is much emerging evidence that melatonin can profoundly affect cattle. In the future, we hope that melatonin can not only be applied to cattle, but can also be used to safely and effectively improve the efficiency of animal husbandry.
