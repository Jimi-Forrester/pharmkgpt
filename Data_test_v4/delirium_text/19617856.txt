19617856|a|Fibrillar aggregates of amyloid beta-peptides are major constituents of the plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, and have been implicated in the neurotoxicity of Alzheimer's. We previously reported that the methanol extract of mulberry leaves inhibits the formation of amyloid beta-peptide (1-42)-fibrils in vitro, and protects hippocampal neurons from amyloid beta-peptide (1-42)-induced cell death. In this study, we identified antiamyloidogenic substances, pheophorbide a, kaempferol -3-O-glucoside, and kaempferol -3-O-(6-malonyl) glucoside, from the methanol extract of mulberry leaves. We also compared the antiamyloidogenic activity of pheophorbide a with that of other porphyrin-related compounds.
