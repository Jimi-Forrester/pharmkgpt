33273904|t|In Vivo Plasticity at Hippocampal Schaffer Collateral-CA1 Synapses: Replicability of the LTP Response and Pharmacology in the Long-Evans Rat.
33273904|a|Broad issues associated with non-replicability have been described in experimental pharmacological and behavioral cognitive studies. Efforts to prevent biases that contribute to non-replicable scientific protocols and to improve experimental rigor for reproducibility are increasingly seen as a basic requirement for the integrity of scientific research. Synaptic plasticity, encompassing long-term potentiation (LTP), is believed to underlie mechanisms of learning and memory. The present study was undertaken in Long-Evans (LE) rats, a strain of rat commonly used in cognitive behavioral tests, to (1) compare three LTP tetanisation protocols, namely, the high-frequency stimulation (HFS), the theta-burst stimulation (TBS), and the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 stratum radiatum synapse and to (2) assess sensitivity to acute pharmacology. Results: (1) When compared to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, the HFS using a stimulus intensity of 50% of the maximum slope obtained from input/output (I/O) curves elicited lower and higher thresholds of synaptic plasticity responses in SD and LE rats, respectively. The 2-train TBS protocol significantly enhanced the LTP response in LE rats over the 5- and 10-train TBS protocols in both strains, and the 5 x TBS protocol inducing a subthreshold LTP response was used in subsequent pharmacological studies in LE rats. The PPF protocol, investigating the locus of the LTP response, showed no difference for the selected interstimulus intervals. (2) Scopolamine, a nonspecific muscarinic antagonist, had a subtle effect, whereas donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, significantly enhanced the LTP response, demonstrating the sensitivity of the TBS protocol to enhanced cholinergic tone. MK-801, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, significantly reduced LTP response, while memantine, another NMDA antagonist, had no effect on LTP response, likely associated with a weaker TBS protocol. PQ10, a phosphodiesterase-10 inhibitor, significantly enhanced the TBS-induced LTP response, but did not change the PPF response. Overall, the results confirm the strain-dependent differences in the form of synaptic plasticity, replicate earlier plasticity results, and report effective protocols that generate a relatively subthreshold margin of LTP induction and maintenance, which are suitable for pharmacology in the LE rat strain mainly used in cognitive studies.
