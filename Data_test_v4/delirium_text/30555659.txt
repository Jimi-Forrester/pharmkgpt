30555659|t|The Association of PON1 192 Q/R Polymorphism with the Risk of Idiopathic Male Infertility in Northern Iran.
30555659|a|BACKGROUND: Infertility is defined as the inability to achieve pregnancy after 12 months of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. Environmental and genetic factors are involved in male infertility. The polymorphism studies have a crucial role in disease recognition. Paraoxonase (PON) is an oxidant enzyme which is associated with inflammation, oxidative stress and lipid metabolism. The present study aimed to evaluate the relationship between PON1 192 Q/R polymorphism and the susceptibility to idiopathic male infertility. METHODS: Samples were collected from 220 patients diagnosed with male infertility and 230 controls genotyped by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: A significant difference in genotype distributions of PON1 192 Q/R polymorphism was observed between patients and controls (p=0.001). Our findings revealed that individuals with the variant QR had a significant decreased risk of idiopathic male infertility (OR=0.49, 95%CI=0.33-0.73, p=0.0004). Moreover, analyses showed that R allele may have a protective effect on susceptibility of idiopathic male infertility (OR=0.31, 95%CI=0.21-0.47, p=0.0001). CONCLUSION: The data from this study indicates that the PON1 192 Q/R polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of idiopathic male infertility. However, more studies should be considered with larger number of patients and control subjects to confirm our results.
