29844947|t|Surgical Technical Evidence Review of Hip Fracture Surgery Conducted for the AHRQ Safety Program for Improving Surgical Care and Recovery.
29844947|a|BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery pathways (ERPs) have been shown to improve patient outcomes in a variety of contexts. This review summarizes the evidence and defines a protocol for perioperative care of patients with hip fracture and was conducted for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality safety program for improving surgical care and recovery. STUDY DESIGN: Perioperative care was divided into components or "bins." For each bin, a semisystematic review of the literature was conducted using MEDLINE with priority given to systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials. Observational studies were included when higher levels of evidence were not available. Existing guidelines for perioperative care were also incorporated. For convenience, the components of care that are under the auspices of anesthesia providers will be reported separately. Recommendations for an evidence-based protocol were synthesized based on review of this evidence. RESULTS: Eleven bins were identified. Preoperative risk factor bins included nutrition, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, and anemia. Perioperative management bins included thromboprophylaxis, timing of surgery, fluid management, drain placement, early mobilization, early alimentation, and discharge criteria/planning. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides the evidence basis for an ERP for perioperative care of patients with hip fracture.
