This study explores the relationship between subjective cognitive concerns in multiple sclerosis and reduced brain volume in regions of interest implicated in cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: A total of 158 patients with multiple sclerosis completed the Quality of Life in Neurologic Disorders Measures (Neuro-QoL) short forms to assess subjective cognitive concerns and underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging. Regional brain volumes from regions of interest implicated in cognitive dysfunction were measured using NeuroQuant automated volumetric quantitation. Linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between subjective cognitive concerns and brain volume. RESULTS: Controlling for age, disease duration, gender, depression and fatigue, increased subjective cognitive concerns were associated with reduced thalamic volume (standardized beta = 0.223, t150 =2.406, P = 0.017) and reduced cortical gray matter volume (standardized beta = 0.240, t150 = 2.777, P = 0.006). Increased subjective cognitive concerns were not associated with any other regions of interest that were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective cognitive concern in MS is associated with reduced thalamic and cortical gray matter volumes, areas of the brain that have been implicated in objective cognitive impairment. These findings may lend neuroanatomical significance to subjective cognitive concerns and patient-reported outcomes as measured by Neuro-QoL.
