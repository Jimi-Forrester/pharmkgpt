33840933|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The synergism between intrathecal opioids and low dose local anesthetics makes it possible to achieve reliable spinal anesthesia (SA) with minimal hypotension. The study objective was to compare the hemodynamic effects of reduced dose of 0.5% intrathecal bupivacaine (2mL) with 25 mug butorphanol in cardiac vs non-cardiac patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included sixty patients aged 30-80 years, undergoing infraumbilical surgeries in the study and compared thirty cardiac patients with mild to moderate reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on 2D echocardiography (Group C) with 30 non-cardiac patients (Group NC) for similar types of surgery. Both the groups received 0.5% bupivacaine 2.0 ml with 25 mug butorphanol. RESULTS: The spinal block characteristics were similar in both groups (P > 0.05). The blood pressure of the patients in the two groups was comparable till 80 min P > 0.05 after which Group NC had significant increase in blood pressure compared to Group C upto 95 min (P < 0.05). Similarly, heart rate was comparable until 90 min (P > 0.05) after which Group NC had significant increase in heart rate versus Group C upto 100 min (P < 0.05). Eight patients in group C and five patients in group NC showed hypotension. Bradycardia was seen in 4 patients in group C in comparison to only one patient in group NC. CONCLUSION: We can safely consider spinal anesthesia with 10 mg bupivacaine and 25mug butorphanol in cardiac patients with mild to moderately reduced ejection fraction presenting for infraumbilical non-cardiac surgeries with the advantage of intraoperative hemodynamic stability and adequate postoperative analgesia.
