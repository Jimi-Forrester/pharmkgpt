31876684|a|PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by accumulation of amyloid beta peptides. MicroRNAs have been identified as significant regulators and therapeutic targets of Alzheimer's disease. However, the roles of miR-16-5p and miR-19b-3p and their mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease progression remain largely unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Amyloid beta-treated SH-SY5Y cells were used to study Alzheimer's disease progression in vitro. Transfection was conducted into SH-SY5Y cells using Lipofectamine 2000. The expression levels of miR-16-5p, miR-19b-3p and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) were measured by quantitative real-time PCR or western blot, respectively. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected in amyloid beta-treated SH-SY5Y cells by MTT or flow cytometry, respectively. The interaction between BACE1 and miR-16-5p or miR-19b-3p was explored by luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation analyses. RESULTS: The expression levels of miR-16-5p and miR-19b-3p were reduced but BACE1 protein expression was enhanced in SH-SY5Y cells after treatment of amyloid beta. Overexpression of miR-16-5p or miR-19b-3p attenuated amyloid beta-induced viability inhibition and apoptosis promotion in SH-SY5Y cells, while their knockdown exacerbated amyloid beta-induced injury. BACE1 was confirmed as a target of miR-16-5p and miR-19b-3p and its overexpression aggravated amyloid beta-induced loss of viability and production of apoptosis, while its depletion caused an opposite effect. Moreover, upregulation of BACE1 alleviated the regulatory effects of miR-16-5p and miR-19b-3p on amyloid beta-induced injury. CONCLUSION: MiR-16-5p and miR-19b-3p relieved amyloid beta-induced injury by targeting BACE1 in SH-SY5Y cells, indicating miR-16-5p and miR-19b-3p as protective agents for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
