35815732|a|Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and affects society in terms of the number of lives lost. Current cancer treatments are based on conventional chemotherapy which is nonspecific in targeting cancer. Therefore, intensive efforts are underway to better target cancer-specific cells while minimizing the side effects on healthy tissues by using LDL particles as active drug delivery vehicles. The goal is to encapsulate anticancer agents thiosemicarbazone metal-ligand complexes into LDL particles to increase the cytotoxic effect of the agent by internalization through LDL receptors into MCF7, A549, and C42 cancer cell lines as segregate models for biological evaluations targeting tubulin. Zeta potential data of LDL-particles encapsulated anticancer agents showed an acceptable diameter range between 66-91 nm and uniform particle morphology. The results showed cell proliferation reduction in all tested cell lines. The IC50 values of LDL encapsulated thiosemicarbazone metal-ligand complexes treated with MCF7, A549, and C42 ranged between 1.18-6.61 microM, 1.17-9.66 microM, and 1.01-6.62 microM, respectively. Western blot analysis showed a potent decrease in tubulin expression when the cell lines were treated with LDL particles encapsulated with thiosemicarbazone metal-ligand complexes as anticancer agents. In conclusion, the data provide strong evidence that LDL particles are used as an active drug delivery strategy for cancer therapy.
