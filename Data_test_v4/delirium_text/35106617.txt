35106617|t|Effect of therapeutic drug monitoring-based dose optimization of piperacillin/tazobactam on sepsis-related organ dysfunction in patients with sepsis: a randomized controlled trial.
35106617|a|PURPOSE: Insufficient antimicrobial exposure is associated with worse outcomes in sepsis. We evaluated whether therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-guided antibiotic therapy improves outcomes. METHODS: Randomized, multicenter, controlled trial from January 2017 to December 2019. Adult patients (n = 254) with sepsis or septic shock were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive continuous infusion of piperacillin/tazobactam with dosing guided by daily TDM of piperacillin or continuous infusion with a fixed dose (13.5 g/24 h if eGFR >= 20 mL/min). Target plasma concentration was four times the minimal inhibitory concentration (range +- 20%) of the underlying pathogen, respectively, of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in empiric situation. Primary outcome was the mean of daily total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score up to day 10. RESULTS: Among 249 evaluable patients (66.3 +- 13.7 years; female, 30.9%), there was no significant difference in mean SOFA score between patients with TDM (7.9 points; 95% CI 7.1-8.7) and without TDM (8.2 points; 95% CI 7.5-9.0) (p = 0.39). Patients with TDM-guided therapy showed a lower 28-day mortality (21.6% vs. 25.8%, RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5-1.3, p = 0.44) and a higher rate of clinical (OR 1.9; 95% CI 0.5-6.2, p = 0.30) and microbiological cure (OR 2.4; 95% CI 0.7-7.4, p = 0.12), but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Attainment of target concentration was more common in patients with TDM (37.3% vs. 14.6%, OR 4.5, CI 95%, 2.9-6.9, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: TDM-guided therapy showed no beneficial effect in patients with sepsis and continuous infusion of piperacillin/tazobactam with regard to the mean SOFA score. Larger studies with strategies to ensure optimization of antimicrobial exposure are needed to definitively answer the question.
