28825106|a|The deposition of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) in the brain is the most important pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mechanism of Abeta neurotoxicity may be closely related to the disturbance of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Non-invasive micro-test technique (NMT) is a novel technique developed in recent years, which can be used to directly record transmembrane ion influx and efflux in a non-contact way by detecting the diffusion potentials outside of the membrane. The present study examined the effects of Abeta31-35 pretreatment on glutamate (Glu)-induced Ca2+ influx and low [Ca2+] solution-induced Ca2+ efflux in the hippocampal slices of C57BL/6 mice using NMT. The results showed that: (1) acute administration of Glu (2.5, 5, 10 mmol/L) evoked a persistent transmembrane Ca2+ influx in hippocampal CA1 neurons, with a rapid onset and subsequent decay; (2) pretreatment with Abeta dose-dependently increased the average rate of Ca2+ influx induced by Glu during the initial 5 min, which was blocked by NMDA receptor antagonist D-APV; (3) perfusion with low [Ca2+] artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) induced a continuous Ca2+ efflux, which was mostly blocked by KB-R7943, a specific antagonist of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger; (4) Abeta31-35 pretreatment partially inhibited the low [Ca2+] aCSF-induced Ca2+ efflux. These results indicate that Abeta not only facilitates Ca2+ influx but also inhibits Ca2+ efflux, which jointly contribute to the Abeta-induced intracellular Ca2+ overload; the potentiation of Abeta on Glu excitotoxicity is mainly mediated by NMDA receptors, while the target for Abeta to affect Ca2+ efflux was mainly Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. NMT showed multiple advantages in detecting transmembrane Ca2+ flux in brain slices, such as non-invasiveness to target cells, fast, convenient and real-time acquisition of Ca2+ flux. Therefore, this study provided new experimental evidence for Abeta-induced Ca2+ overload, as well as a novel application for NMT in measuring transmembrane Ca2+ flux of neurons in the brain.
