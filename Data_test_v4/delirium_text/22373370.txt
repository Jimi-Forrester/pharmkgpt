22373370|a|BACKGROUND: Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a cytokine having multiple functions in the central nervous system such as promoting repair mechanisms in degenerative diseases and stroke. To date, however, its neuroprotective effects in non-disease conditions have not been studied METHODS: With the aim of exploring the relationship between peripheral TGF-beta1 expression and brain structural integrity, 70 healthy participants underwent high-resolution structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans and blood sampling. Data were processed to obtain brain cortical thickness and serum concentrations of TGF-beta1. We investigated the correlation between TGF-beta1 and cortical thickness using both region-of-interest- and vertex-based approaches. FINDINGS: Region-of-interest-based analysis of the cortical mantle showed a correlation between TGF-beta1 serum concentrations and cortical thickness bilaterally in cingulate and right frontal and temporal areas. Similar results emerged in the vertex-based analysis, where significant correlations were found bilaterally in cingulate and right frontal cortices. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that TGF-beta1, through its role in down-regulating inflammatory processes, might have a beneficial effect on the structural integrity of the brain in physiological states.
