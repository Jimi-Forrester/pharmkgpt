38742956|t|Bioinformatics analysis for constructing a cellular senescence-related age-related macular degeneration diagnostic model and identifying relevant disease subtypes to guide treatment.
38742956|a|Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition causing progressive central vision loss. Growing evidence suggests a link between cellular senescence and AMD. However, the exact mechanism by which cellular senescence leads to AMD remains unclear. Employing machine learning, we established an AMD diagnostic model. Through unsupervised clustering, two distinct AMD subtypes were identified. GO, KEGG, and GSVA analyses explored the diverse biological functions associated with the two subtypes. By WGCNA, we constructed a coexpression network of differential genes between the subtypes, revealing the regulatory role of hub genes at the level of transcription factors and miRNAs. We identified 5 genes associated with inflammation for the construction of the AMD diagnostic model. Additionally, we observed that the level of cellular senescence and pathways related to programmed cell death (PCD), such as ferroptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, exhibited higher expression levels in subtype B than A. Immune microenvironments also differed between the subtypes, indicating potentially distinct pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets. In summary, by leveraging cellular senescence-associated gene expression, we developed an AMD diagnostic model. Furthermore, we identified two subtypes with varying expression patterns of senescence genes, revealing their differential roles in programmed cell death, disease progression, and immune microenvironments within AMD.
