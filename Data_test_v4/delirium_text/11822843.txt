11822843|a|This review focuses on delirium and early recognition of symptoms by nurses. Delirium is a transient organic mental syndrome characterized by disturbances in consciousness, thinking and memory. The incidence in older hospitalized patients is about 25%. The causes of delirium are multi-factorial; risk factors include high age, cognitive impairment and severity of illness. The consequences of delirium include high morbidity and mortality, lengthened hospital stay and nursing home placement. Delirium develops in a short period and symptoms fluctuate, therefore nurses are in a key position to recognize symptoms. Delirium is often overlooked or misdiagnosed due to lack of knowledge and awareness in nurses and doctors. To improve early recognition of delirium, emphasis should be given to terminology, vision and knowledge regarding health in ageing and delirium as a potential medical emergency, and to instruments for systematic screening of symptoms.
