36255737|a|How ancestry-associated genetic variance affects disparities in the risk for polygenic diseases and influences the identification of disease-associated genes warrant a deeper understanding. We hypothesized that the discovery of genes associated with polygenic diseases may be limited by overreliance on single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genomic investigation, since most significant variants identified in genome-wide SNP association studies map to introns and intergenic regions of the genome. To overcome such potential limitation, we developed a gene-constrained and function-based analytical method centered on high-risk variants (hrV) that encode frameshifts, stopgains, or splice site disruption. We analyzed the total number of hrV per gene in populations of different ancestry, representing a total of 185 934 subjects. Using this analysis, we developed a quantitative index of hrV (hrVI) across 20 428 genes within each population. We then applied hrVI analysis to the discovery of genes associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a polygenic disease with ancestry-related disparity. HrVI profiling and gene-to-gene comparisons of ancestry-specific hrV between the case (20 781 subjects) and control (24 440 subjects) populations in the T2DM national repository identified 57 genes associated with T2DM, 40 of which were discoverable only by ancestry-specific analysis. These results illustrate how function-based and ancestry-specific analysis of genetic variations can accelerate the identification of genes associated with polygenic diseases. Besides T2DM, such analysis may facilitate our understanding of the genetic basis for other polygenic diseases that are also greatly influenced by environmental and behavioral factors, such as obesity, hypertension, and Alzheimer's disease.
