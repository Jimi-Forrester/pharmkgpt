8401787|a|The two major primary degenerative dementias, dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) and frontal lobe degeneration of non-Alzheimer type (FLD) have several clinical features in common but also many symptoms that differ. In a clinical material of 80 patients with either of the two forms of dementia (DAT = 39, FLD = 41) we have studied the levels of neuropeptides in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in order to find biochemical markers for CNS affection. The dementia forms were evaluated by careful clinical analysis, psychometric testing and measurement of regional cerebral blood flow. Approximately one third of the subjects died during the completion of the study and neuropathology was performed, confirming the diagnoses. We observed reductions in the CSF levels of antidiuretic hormone and somatostatin in both DAT and FLD. A strong tendency to reduction was noted for neuropeptide Y (NPY). There was a correlation with the duration of disease demonstrating a significant reduction in NPY levels in subjects with DAT. Most notably there was a strong reduction in the levels of delta sleep inducing peptide (DSIP) in DAT cases only. The levels of DSIP in FLD were the same as in controls. The reverse was found for corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) which had a significant reduction in FLD patients but not in those with DAT. The present study indicates a difference in the CSF levels of neuropeptides, observations that these may serve as biochemical markers which differentiate DAT and FLD.
