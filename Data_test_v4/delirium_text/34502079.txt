34502079|t|Chemical Chaperones Modulate the Formation of Metabolite Assemblies.
34502079|a|The formation of amyloid-like structures by metabolites is associated with several inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs). These structures display most of the biological, chemical and physical properties of protein amyloids. However, the molecular interactions underlying the assembly remain elusive, and so far, no modulating therapeutic agents are available for clinical use. Chemical chaperones are known to inhibit protein and peptide amyloid formation and stabilize misfolded enzymes. Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of the inhibitory effect of osmolytes and hydrophobic chemical chaperones on metabolite assemblies, thus extending their functional repertoire. We applied a combined in vivo-in vitro-in silico approach and show their ability to inhibit metabolite amyloid-induced toxicity and reduce cellular amyloid content in yeast. We further used various biophysical techniques demonstrating direct inhibition of adenine self-assembly and alteration of fibril morphology by chemical chaperones. Using a scaffold-based approach, we analyzed the physiochemical properties of various dimethyl sulfoxide derivatives and their role in inhibiting metabolite self-assembly. Lastly, we employed whole-atom molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the role of hydrogen bonds in osmolyte inhibition. Our results imply a dual mode of action of chemical chaperones as IEMs therapeutics, that could be implemented in the rational design of novel lead-like molecules.
