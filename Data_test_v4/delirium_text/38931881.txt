38931881|t|Nanoarchitectonics-Based Materials as a Promising Strategy in the Treatment of Endodontic Infections.
38931881|a|Endodontic infections arise from the interactive activities of microbial communities colonizing in the intricate root canal system. The present study aims to update the latest knowledge of nanomaterials, their antimicrobial mechanisms, and their applications in endodontics. A detailed literature review of the current knowledge of nanomaterials used in endodontic applications was performed using the PubMed database. Antimicrobial nanomaterials with a small size, large specific surface area, and high chemical activity are introduced to act as irrigants, photosensitizer delivery systems, and medicaments, or to modify sealers. The application of nanomaterials in the endodontic field could enhance antimicrobial efficiency, increase dentin tubule penetration, and improve treatment outcomes. This study supports the potential of nanomaterials as a promising strategy in treating endodontic infections.
