27120781|t|In vivo screening and discovery of novel candidate thalidomide analogs in the zebrafish embryo and chicken embryo model systems.
27120781|a|Thalidomide, a drug known for its teratogenic side-effects, is used successfully to treat a variety of clinical conditions including leprosy and multiple myeloma. Intense efforts are underway to synthesize and identify safer, clinically relevant analogs. Here, we conduct a preliminary in vivo screen of a library of new thalidomide analogs to determine which agents demonstrate activity, and describe a cohort of compounds with anti-angiogenic properties, anti-inflammatory properties and some compounds which exhibited both. The combination of the in vivo zebrafish and chicken embryo model systems allows for the accelerated discovery of new, potential therapies for cancerous and inflammatory conditions.
