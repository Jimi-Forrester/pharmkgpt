30992604|a|Consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) is a young and upcoming subspecialty of psychiatry. When one looks at the history of CLP in India, the progress in the area of CLP paralleled that seen in various developed countries. However, over the years, compared to developed countries, CLP started lagging behind in India. In India, CLP services are mostly been provided as per the consultation model and true liaison model practice is missing. There has been meager research in the area of CLP in India, and there is marked heterogeneity in training across different centers. There is lack of specialized training programs in this country. Considering the increasing emphasis on providing person-centered care, there is a need to shift the focus of training from identifying and managing only primary psychiatric disorders to interphase of psychiatry and other disciplines.
