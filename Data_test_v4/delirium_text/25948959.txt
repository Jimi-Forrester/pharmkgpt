25948959|a|Free radicals are one of the frequent products of normal cellular metabolism. Disparity of metabolism and excessive generation of free radicals predisposes to disorders like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and aging phenomenon. Curculigo orchioides Gaertn. is known for "adaptogen" and "aphrodisiac" activity and has been proved for antiasthmatic, estrogenic, antiosteoporotic activity along with protection from cisplatin-induced cell damage. C. orchioides was powdered and subjected to soxhlet extraction using methanol. Phytochemical studies and estimation of polyphenols and flavonoids was performed. Acute toxicity studies were performed by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD guidelines. Animals were treated with cyclophosphamide to induce neurotoxicity. Curculigo orchioides was powdered and subjected to soxhlet extraction using methanol. Catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and lipid peroxidation were estimated by reported methods. C. orchioides (400 mg/kg) significantly promoted restoration of catalase (P < 0.005), superoxide dismutase (P < 0.005), and glutathion (P < 0.05) levels. Similarly, a very significant decrease (P < 0.005) in the levels of malondialdehyde was observed. In all cases as mentioned previously, C. orchioides at dose 200 mg/kg promoted significant (P < 0.05) restoration of enzyme levels. C. orchioides (Kali Musli) is rich source of phytochemicals like flavonoids and polyphenols. Flavonoids and polyphenols are reputed to demonstrate neuroprotective effect. These phytochemicals in the present study might be responsible to demonstrate neuroprotective effect.
