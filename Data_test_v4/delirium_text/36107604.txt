36107604|a|The purpose of this study was to confirm the association between the serum vitamin D levels and ischemic stroke lesion size, functional ability, and cognitive function in elderly ischemic stroke patients. This study included Korean ischemic stroke patients aged 65 to 85 years. The size of the lesion was measured in brain images taken within 24 hours of hospitalization. The level of 25-(OH) Vitamin D (ng/mL), a metabolite of vitamin D, in the serum collected within 48 hours of hospitalization, and the modified Barthel index (MBI), gait performance, the muscle power of hip and knee extensors on the hemiplegic side, and mini-mental status examination (MMSE) were recorded within 1 week of the onset of the disease. Each factor was compared through correlation analysis, and the significance was confirmed using the Spearman correlation coefficient method. The association between the serum vitamin D levels and the size of the ischemic stroke lesion, the MBI, gait performance, the muscle power of hip and knee extensors on the hemiplegic side, and the MMSE were analyzed. It was confirmed that there was a significant correlation between all the factors (P < .005). In patients with serum vitamin D levels of >= 30 ng/mL, both the functional ability and cognitive functions were better than in patients lower than 30 ng/mL. We confirmed the lower the level of serum vitamin D levels, the larger the size of the ischemic stroke lesion when it occurred in elderly Koreans. And we confirmed that serum vitamin D levels affected the functional ability and cognitive function. And we recommend that elderly Koreans should maintain their blood vitamin D level above 30 ng/mL. We believe that this will help preserve the functional ability and cognitive function when ischemic stroke occurred.
