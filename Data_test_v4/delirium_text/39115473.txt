39115473|t|Global Research Trends in Postoperative Delirium and Its Risk Factors: A Bibliometric and Visual Analysis.
39115473|a|PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium (POD) is one of the most frequent complications after surgery which is closely associated with many adverse outcomes, including high mortality and low quality of life. This study aims to carry out a bibliometric analysis of POD and its risk factors from 2012 to 2022 to reveal the research status and hot spots. DESIGN: This study is a bibliometric and visualized analysis. METHODS: Relevant publications between 2012 and 2022 were extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection database. CiteSpace software (v6.1. R2, Drexel University), VOSviewer software (v1.6.18, Leiden University), and the Online Analysis Platform of Literature Metrology were used to analyze research attributes. These publications were used to analyze research attributes, including countries, journals, institutions, authors, keywords, and burst detection, to predict trends and hot spots. FINDINGS: We included a total of 1,324 related documents from 2012 to 2022. The literature on POD has increased significantly since 2016. The United States and Harvard University were the leading literature publishing country (436/1324, 32.9%) and institution (112/1324, 8.5%). Anesthesia and Analgesia was the most frequently published journal. Keywords analysis with VOSviewer revealed that the keywords could be divided into five clusters, including anesthesia techniques, cardiac surgery, risk factors, intraoperative anesthesia monitoring, and postoperative cognitive dysfunction. We included a total of 198 POD risk factors documents, and the literature on POD risk factors increased. The People's Republic of China and Harvard University were the leading literature publishing country (53/198, 26.8%) and institution (12/198, 6.1%). Elderly, hip surgery, frailty, postoperative pain, cardiac surgery, dementia, and depression are keywords that are risk factors for POD. CONCLUSIONS: The number of literature on POD in the field of anesthesia has increased significantly. Risk factors and anesthesia techniques are still key areas of research. Encephalogram, the use of sedatives, and perioperative nursing may be the new research focus. Older adults, hip fractures, cardiac surgery, liver transplants, dementia, and depression are hot words in the field of POD risk factors.
