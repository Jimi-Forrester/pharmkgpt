35255943|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication following anesthesia and surgery. General anesthetic isoflurane has potential neurotoxicity and induces cognitive impairments, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. Astrocytes form interconnected networks in the adult brain through gap junctions (GJs), which primarily comprise connexin 43 (Cx43), and play important roles in brain homeostasis and functions such as memory. However, the role of the GJ-Cx43-mediated astrocytic network in isoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction has not been defined. METHODS: 4-month-old male C57BL/6 mice were exposure to long-term isoflurane to induce cognitive impairment. To simulate an in vitro isoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction-like condition, primary mouse astrocytes were subjected to long-term isoflurane exposure. Cognitive function was assessed by Y-maze and fear conditioning tests. Western blot was used to determine the expression levels of different functional configurations of Cx43. The morphology of the GJs-Cx43 was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining. Levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 were examined by ELISA. The ability of GJs-Cx43-mediated intercellular communication was examined by lucifer yellow dye transfer assay. Ethidium bromide uptake assays were used to measure the activity of Cx43 hemichannels. The ultrastructural morphology of astrocyte gap junctions and tripartite synapse were observed by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: After long-term isoflurane anesthesia, the GJs formed by Cx43 in the mouse hippocampus and primary mouse astrocytes were significantly reduced, GJs function was impaired, hemichannel activity was enhanced, the levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 were increased, and mice showed significant cognitive impairment. After treatment with the novel GJ-Cx43 enhancer ZP1609, GJ-Cx43-mediated astrocytic network function was enhanced, neuroinflammation was alleviated, and ameliorated cognition dysfunction induced by long-term isoflurane exposure. However, ZP1609 enhances the astrocytic network by promoting Cx43 to form GJs without affecting hemichannel activity. Additionally, our data showed that long-term isoflurane exposure does not alter the structure of tripartite synapse. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal a novel mechanism of the GJ-Cx43-mediated astrocytic network involved in isoflurane-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments, which provides new mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of POCD and identifies potential targets for its treatment.
