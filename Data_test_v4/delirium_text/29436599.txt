29436599|a|The aim of the present study was to establish a cell model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and investigate the neurotoxic effects of beta-amyloid (Abeta) on the cytoskeleton. PC12 cells were cultured and treated with Abeta25-35, and cell survival was analyzed with the MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was visualized using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Immunocytochemistry and phalloidin staining were used to label the cytoskeleton of PC12 cells. Abeta25-35 was found to induce PC12 cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). Moreover, Abeta25-35 also caused dose-dependent disintegration of the cytoskeleton (P<0.05). Therefore, the PC12 cell cytoskeleton was found to be sensitive to Abeta25-35 neurotoxicity. The disintegration of the cytoskeleton is likely an important pathological alteration in AD, and Abeta is a key molecule involved in AD pathogenesis.
