32326266|t|Canjiqueira Fruit: Are We Losing the Best of It?
32326266|a|Fruits and byproducts are valuable sources of nutrients and bioactive compounds, which are associated with a decreased risk of developing several diseases, such as cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and Alzheimer's. The fruits of canjiqueira (Byrsonima cydoniifolia) are already exploited as a food resource, while the seeds are discarded. This study aimed at showing the potential of the whole fruit of canjiqueira. Elemental characterization was performed on ICP OES, while thermal stability was assessed on thermogravimetry. The determination of the fatty acid profile was carried out on gas chromatography and bioactive compound identification using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Results show that both parts of canjiqueira fruit are a source of various minerals, such as Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, and Mn while the seed only is a good source for Zn. Oleic and linoleic acids are the main compounds in pulp and seed. The thermal stability of seed oil is superior to pulp oil, while piceatannol concentration is higher in seed than pulp. All parts of canjiqueira fruit may be used as a strategy to address nutrition issues and are valuable ingredients to prospective food products.
