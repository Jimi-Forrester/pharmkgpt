39766432|t|Psychiatric Disorders and Cognitive Fluctuations in Parkinson's Disease: Changing Approaches in the First Decades of the 21st Century.
39766432|a|Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder characterized, in addition to the well-recognized motor disturbances, by a complex interplay between cognitive and psychiatric manifestations. We dissect the complex landscape of PD-related psychiatric symptoms, taking into account the impact of functional neurological disorders, somatic delusions, impulse control disorders, and conditions within the bipolar spectrum. The newer entities of somatoform and functional neurological disorders, as well as preexisting bipolar spectrum disorders, are analyzed in detail. Moreover, we emphasize the need for a holistic understanding of PD, wherein the cognitive and psychiatric dimensions are valued alongside motor symptoms. Such an approach aims to facilitate early detection and personalized interventions, and enhance the overall quality of life for individuals suffering from this neurodegenerative disorder.
