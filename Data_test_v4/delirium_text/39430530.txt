39430530|a|Background: Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are complex pathologies with a myriad of molecular actors involved in both disease progression and remission. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is suspected to be one such actor due to its neurotrophic effects. The BDNF precursor, pro-BDNF, has different effects, as it mainly promotes neuronal apoptosis. Both forms also play a role in depression and depressive episodes (DE). The aim of this exploratory study was to compare serum BDNF and pro-BDNF levels in patients with AUDs after withdrawal and according to DE status with those of controls without AUDs or DE. Materials and methods: Ninety-nine AUD patients and 40 controls were included. Questionnaires were used to assess both alcohol and psychiatric domains: the severity of hazardous alcohol consumption was assessed using Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), craving was assessed using Obsessive and Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS), anxiety was assessed with Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and depression with Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Blood samples were collected during two visits: at the time of alcohol withdrawal (M0) and two months later (M2). ELISAs to measure serum BDNF and pro-BDNF levels were performed. AUD patients were categorized according to depression status at M2. Forty-five patients remained abstinent whereas 54 relapsed. BDNF serum levels rose after alcohol withdrawal, but pro-BDNF levels did not vary between M0 and M2. Results: AUD subjects without DE at M2 had higher BDNF levels at both M0 and M2 than AUD subjects with DE at M2. AUD subjects showed lower MADRS and OCD scores at M2 than at M0. AUD subjects without DE had lower BDNF levels at M0 than controls but not at M2, regardless of abstinence maintenance. Conclusion: BDNF serum levels were reduced in AUD patients compared to controls and were further reduced in patients with both AUDs and DE. Alcohol withdrawal treatment was sufficient to induce an increase in serum BDNF levels after 2 months, regardless of whether abstinence was maintained during this time period.
