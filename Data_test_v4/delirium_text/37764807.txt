37764807|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the combined effects of vitamin D3 supplementation and aerobic training on regulating the autophagy process in rats with type 2 diabetic induced by a high-fat diet and streptozotocin. A total of 40 Wistar rats were divided into five groups: normal control (NC), diabetic control (DC), diabetic + aerobic training (DAT), diabetic + vitamin D3 (DVD), and diabetic + aerobic training + vitamin D3 (DVDAT). The rats underwent eight weeks of aerobic training with an intensity of 60% maximum running speed for one hour, along with weekly subcutaneous injections of 10,000 units of vitamin D3. The protein levels of different autophagy markers were assessed in the left ventricular heart tissue. The results showed that the protein levels of AMPK, pAMPK, mTOR, and pmTOR were significantly lower in the DC group compared to the NC group. Conversely, the levels of ULK, Beclin-1, LC3II, Fyco, and Cathepsin D proteins were significantly higher in the DC group. However, the interventions of aerobic training and vitamin D3 supplementation, either individually or in combination, led to increased levels of AMPK, pAMPK, mTOR, and pmTOR, and decreased levels of ULK, Beclin-1, LC3II, Fyco, and Cathepsin D (p < 0.05). Additionally, the aerobic capacity in the DAT and DVDAT groups was significantly higher compared to the NC, DC, and DVD groups (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that type 2 diabetes is associated with excessive autophagy in the left ventricle. However, after eight weeks of vitamin D3 supplementation and aerobic training, a significant reduction in excessive autophagy was observed in rats with type 2 diabetes.
