34501540|t|Effects of a Multifaceted Intervention Program on the Eating Ability of Nursing Home Residents.
34501540|a|Oropharyngeal dysphagia is a common problem for nursing home residents that leads to aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition. Musculature surrounding head and neck and tongue strength are crucial for safe and efficient oropharyngeal swallowing. Oral hygiene facilitates the smooth swallowing. The aim of this study was thus to investigate the effects of a multifaceted intervention program which combines the interactive oral activities, tongue strength training and oral cleaning procedure on the eating ability of nursing home residents. A sequential, multiple time series, single-group quasi-experimental research design was used, and 41 residents were recruited to participate in this study. The study was divided into three phases, each lasting two months. In phase 1, the participants were conducting their usual activities, except that the outcome variables were measured on five occasions to obtain baseline data. Phase 2 was a two-month washout period, and phase 3 was the intervention period. Thirty-six residents completed phase 1, and 34 residents completed the phase 3 intervention period. The eight-week phase 3 intervention program comprised three sessions per day, conducted seven days a week, with each session lasting 15-20 min. Outcome variables were measured at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 in phases 1 and 3 to evaluate the feasibility of the program. Following the intervention program, controlling for baseline differences, the patients' tongue strength, food consumption, mealtime duration, oral health, and dysphagia severity were significantly improved in phase 3 relative to phase 1. These improvements lasted through to at least 2 months posttest. The study illustrates that this multifaceted intervention program may be an effective approach for improving the eating ability of nursing home residents.
