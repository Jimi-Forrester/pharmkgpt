38555343|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Recent literature has proposed two subgroups of PD. The "body-first subtype" is associated with a prodrome of isolated REM-sleep Behavior Disorder (iRBD) and a relatively symmetric brain degeneration. The "brain-first subtype" is suggested to have a more asymmetric degeneration and a prodromal stage without RBD. This study aims to investigate the proposed difference in symmetry of the degeneration pattern in the presumed body and brain-first PD subtypes. We analyzed 123I-FP-CIT (DAT SPECT) and 18F-FDG PET brain imaging in three groups of patients (iRBD, n = 20, de novo PD with prodromal RBD, n = 22, and de novo PD without RBD, n = 16) and evaluated dopaminergic and glucose metabolic symmetry. The RBD status of all patients was confirmed with video-polysomnography. The PD groups did not differ from each other with regard to the relative or absolute asymmetry of DAT uptake in the putamen (p = 1.0 and p = 0.4, respectively). The patient groups also did not differ from each other with regard to the symmetry of expression of the PD-related metabolic pattern (PDRP) in each hemisphere. The PD groups had no difference in symmetry considering mean FDG uptake in left and right regions of interest and generally had the same degree of symmetry as controls, while the iRBD patients had nine regions with abnormal left-right differences (p < 0.001). Our findings do not support the asymmetry aspect of the "body-first" versus "brain-first" hypothesis.
