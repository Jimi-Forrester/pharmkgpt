23641903|a|We have fabricated a DNA-based nanofiber created by self-assembly of guanine quadruplex (Hoogsteen base pairing) and double-stranded DNA (Watson-Crick base pairing). When duplexes containing a long stretch of contiguous guanines and single-stranded overhangs are incubated in potassium-containing buffer, the preformed duplexes create high molecular weight species that contain quadruplexes. In addition to observation of these larger species by gel electrophoresis, solutions were analyzed by atomic force microscopy to reveal nanofibers. Analysis of the atomic force microscopy images indicates that fibers form with lengths ranging from 250 to 2,000 nm and heights from 0.45 to 4.0 nm. This work is a first step toward the creation of new structurally heterogeneous (quadruplex/duplex), yet controllable, DNA-based materials exhibiting novel properties suitable for a diverse array of nanotechnology applications.
