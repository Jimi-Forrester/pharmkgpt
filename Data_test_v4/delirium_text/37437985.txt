37437985|a|Aging is a major risk factor for many age-associated disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. Both mitochondrial dysfunction and proteostatic decline are well-recognized hallmarks of aging and age-related neurodegeneration. Despite a lack of therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, a number of interventions promoting mitochondrial integrity and protein homeostasis (proteostasis) have been shown to delay aging-associated neurodegeneration. For example, many antioxidant polysaccharides are shown to have pharmacological potentials in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases through regulation of mitochondrial and proteostatic pathways, including oxidative stress and heat shock responses. However, how mitochondrial and proteostatic mechanisms work together to exert the antineurodegenerative effect of the polysaccharides remains largely unexplored. Interestingly, recent studies have provided a growing body of evidence to support the crosstalk between mitostatic and proteostatic networks as well as the impact of the crosstalk on neurodegeneration. Here we summarize the recent progress of antineurodegenerative polysaccharides with particular attention in the mitochondrial and proteostatic context and provide perspectives on their implications in the crosstalk along the mitochondria-proteostasis axis.
