8965052|t|Utilization of acute inpatient services for alcohol detoxification.
8965052|a|This study indicates that the majority of patients admitted to VA hospitals for medical detoxification could have those services provided on an outpatient or less intensive basis. However, inpatient medical detoxification services appear to be appropriate for those alcoholics at risk for potential life-threatening complications of withdrawal such as delirium tremens, or those with concurrent associated medical conditions such as pancreatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or complications of cirrhosis. Data were obtained from a national random sample of hospitalizations in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) inpatient medical and surgical units. Medical records for 144 alcoholism-related medical admissions to 35 VA medical centers were reviewed using the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (AEP), a clinically based utilization review instrument widely used in the private sector. The medical records for the admission and each day of medical/surgical inpatient stay were reviewed using clinical criteria for the appropriateness of acute inpatient care as opposed to lower levels of care.
