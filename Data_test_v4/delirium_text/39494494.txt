39494494|a|This study aimed to present an overview of the current status of research and important discoveries about immunotherapy for glomerulonephritis in general using bibliometric analysis. We collected the literature on immunotherapy for glomerulonephritis from the Web of Science (WOS) database for the last 10 years (2014-2024), and we assessed the mapping of knowledge using Citespace. The findings demonstrated that there were 258 articles concerning the immunotherapy for glomerulonephritis, with a faster growth after 2018. The USA, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, and Anders, Hans-Joachim are the nation, organization, and writer with the highest number of publications. The most often cited reference is Rovin BH (2021) as well (5). The best partnerships are formed by prestigious universities and developed countries for glomerulonephritis research on immunotherapy. Three research hotspots in this area are rituximab, adjuvant, and antibody production erythematosus, respectively.
