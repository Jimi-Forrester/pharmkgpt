37314016|a|Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. While mortality is high regardless of inciting infection or comorbidities, mortality in patients with cancer and sepsis is significantly higher than mortality in patients with sepsis without cancer. Cancer patients are also significantly more likely to develop sepsis than the general population. The mechanisms underlying increased mortality in cancer and sepsis patients are multifactorial. Cancer treatment alters the host immune response and can increase susceptibility to infection. Preclinical data also suggests that cancer, in and of itself, increases mortality from sepsis with dysregulation of the adaptive immune system playing a key role. Further, preclinical data demonstrate that sepsis can alter subsequent tumor growth while tumoral immunity impacts survival from sepsis. Checkpoint inhibition is a well-accepted treatment for many types of cancer, and there is increasing evidence suggesting this may be a useful strategy in sepsis as well. However, preclinical studies of checkpoint inhibition in cancer and sepsis demonstrate results that could not have been predicted by examining either variable in isolation. As sepsis management transitions from a 'one size fits all' model to a more individualized approach, understanding the mechanistic impact of cancer on outcomes from sepsis represents an important strategy towards delivering on the promise of precision medicine in the intensive care unit.
