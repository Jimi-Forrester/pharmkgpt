307138|t|[Improvement of zoster therapy by adamantine].
307138|a|In the course of 3 years we observed a considerable improvement of herpes zoster in 44 patients being treated with amantadine. The periods of pain and efflorescence were shortened to 1/3 of the values usually experienced and painful post-zoster complications did not occur. The therapeutic effect depends on a) beginning treatment with high doses as early as possible, b) combination of local and systemic administration of adamantine, c) continuation of treatment for several weeks with gradually reducing doses. Harmless side-effects which are easily controlled are dryness of mouth, slight fall in blood pressure and insignificant general stimulation. In old people half the standard dose should be given in the beginning and particular attention paid to symptoms of restlessness on account of a possible delirium. Severe disorders of renal function are a contraindication.
