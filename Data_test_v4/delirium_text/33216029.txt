33216029|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing neurodegenerative disease without effective treatments or therapies. Despite the use of different approaches and an extensive variety of genetic amyloid based models, therapeutic strategies remain elusive. AD is characterized by three main pathological hallmarks that include amyloid-beta plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammatory processes; however, many other pathological mechanisms have been described in the literature. Nonetheless, the study of the disease and the screening of potential therapies is heavily weighted toward the study of amyloid-beta transgenic models. Non-transgenic models may aid in the study of complex pathological states and provide a suitable complementary alternative to evaluating therapeutic biomedical and intervention strategies. In this review, we evaluate the literature on non-transgenic alternatives, focusing on the use of these models for testing therapeutic strategies, and assess their contribution to understanding AD. This review aims to underscore the need for a shift in preclinical research on intervention strategies for AD from amyloid-based to alternative, complementary non-amyloid approaches.
