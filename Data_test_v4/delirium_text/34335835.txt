34335835|t|Ethnopharmacological Survey on Treatment of Hypertension by Traditional Healers in Bukavu City, DR Congo.
34335835|a|BACKGROUND: Ethnopharmacological studies are relevant for sustaining and improving knowledge of traditional medicine within the framework of complementary/alternative therapeutic practices based solely on experience and observation across generations. Hypertension is a common cardiovascular disorder affecting more than 50% of older people in Africa (PLoS One. 2019; 14 (4): e0214934; published online on April 5, 2019, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0214934). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey from October 2014 to August 2015 with 18 renowned traditional healers from the city of Bukavu to capture botanical plant species and remedies used by herbalists to manage hypertension in the Democratic Republic of Congo. RESULTS: Respondents cited 41 plant species belonging to 25 botanical families. The ten most common plants are Allium sativum, Galinsoga ciliata, Moringa oleifera, Bidens pilosa, Persea americana, Piper capense, Catharanthus roseus, Rauvolfia vomitoria, Sida rhombifolia, and Vernonia amygdalina. The parts used are primary leaves (48.8%) formulated as oral decoctions (65.9%). CONCLUSION: The literature review validated the use of 73.2% of the plants listed. Plants of high local use-value not supported by other studies deserve in-depth chemical and pharmacological studies.
