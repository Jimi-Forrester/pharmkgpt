34871490|t|Perioperative Considerations for Acute Appendicitis in Patients With Coronavirus Infection: Two Cases Report.
34871490|a|We report considerations related with surgery through 2 cases of acute appendicitis (AA) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. In November and December 2020, AA occurred in 2 patients with COVID-19, who underwent emergency surgery. In case 1, an 84-year-old woman was asymptomatic and diagnosed with AA on the 20th day of infection. She was discharged after surgery without complication. In contrast, case 2 was that a 69-year-old man with pneumonia was treated with antibiotics, steroids, and remdesivir. After surgery, he was hospitalized for a long duration due to persistent pneumonia and wound complications. We should perform in well-established negative pressure operating rooms, personal protective equipment, and protocols. Since the physical examination and blood tests were limited, image examination like computed tomography scan should be considered if AA is suspected. If pneumonia is accompanied before surgery, pneumonia may worsen after surgery, or complications such as wound infection may occur.
