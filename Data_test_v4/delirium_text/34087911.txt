34087911|t|Transient oculomotor paralysis after cerebral angiography: A case report.
34087911|a|RATIONALE: A special case of transient oculomotor nerve palsy after cerebral angiography. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 55-year-old man developed oculomotor nerve dysfunction after right radial artery puncture angiography. DIAGNOSES: Cerebral angiography-induced oculomotor nerve palsy. INTERVENTIONS: According to the patient's disease state, intravenous drip of dexamethasone 10 mg/d. OUTCOMES: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no abnormalities, and the patient recovered completely after 48 hours of hormone therapy. LESSONS: Transient eye palsy caused by contrast agent encephalopathy is a clinically rare neurological dysfunction caused by adverse effects of contrast agents. Early prevention and correct treatment are critical.
