37759897|t|Adults with Cerebral Palsy: Navigating the Complexities of Aging.
37759897|a|The goal of this narrative review is to highlight the healthcare challenges faced by adults with cerebral palsy, including the management of long-term motor deficits, difficulty finding clinicians with expertise in these long-term impairments, and scarcity of rehabilitation options. Additionally, this narrative review seeks to examine potential methods for maintaining functional independence, promoting social integration, and community participation. Although the brain lesion that causes the movement disorder is non-progressive, the neurodevelopmental disorder worsens from secondary complications of existing sensory, motor, and cognitive impairments. Therefore, maintaining the continuum of care across one's lifespan is of utmost importance. Advancements in healthcare services over the past decade have resulted in lower mortality rates and increased the average life expectancy of people with cerebral palsy. However, once they transition from adolescence to adulthood, limited federal and community resources, and health care professionals' lack of expertise present significant obstacles to achieving quality healthcare and long-term benefits. This paper highlights the common impairments seen in adults with cerebral palsy. Additionally, it underscores the critical role of long-term healthcare and management to prevent functional decline and enhance quality of life across physical, cognitive, and social domains.
