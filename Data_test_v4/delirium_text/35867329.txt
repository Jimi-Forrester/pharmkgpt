35867329|t|Recurrent Transient Ischemic Attack Induces Neural Cytoskeleton Modification and Gliosis in an Experimental Model.
35867329|a|Transient ischemic attack (TIA) presents a high risk for subsequent stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementia (ADRD). However, the neuropathophysiology of TIA has been rarely studied. By evaluating recurrent TIA-induced neuropathological changes, our study aimed to explore the potential mechanisms underlying the contribution of TIA to ADRD. In the current study, we established a recurrent TIA model by three times 10-min middle cerebral artery occlusion within a week in rat. Neither permanent neurological deficit nor apoptosis was observed following recurrent TIA. No increase of AD-related biomarkers was indicated after TIA, including increase of tau hyperphosphorylation and beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Neuronal cytoskeleton modification and neuroinflammation was found at 1, 3, and 7 days after recurrent TIA, evidenced by the reduction of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), elevation of neurofilament-light chain (NFL), and increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1)-positive microglia at the TIA-affected cerebral cortex and basal ganglion. Similar NFL, GFAP and Iba1 alteration was found in the white matter of corpus callosum. In summary, the current study demonstrated that recurrent TIA may trigger neuronal cytoskeleton change, astrogliosis, and microgliosis without induction of cell death at the acute and subacute stage. Our study indicates that TIA-induced neuronal cytoskeleton modification and neuroinflammation may be involved in the vascular contribution to cognitive impairment and dementia.
