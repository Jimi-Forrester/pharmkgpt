17464526|a|BACKGROUND: There is evidence of a link between nutrient intake and cognitive impairment and decline in old age. There has been no study of nutrient intake in Irish subjects at risk of dementia. AIM: To investigate the possible link between nutrient intake and cognitive performance in a group of Irish adults at risk of dementia, and to compare the nutrient intake in these adults stratified by the absence or presence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele. METHOD: Forty-four subjects, who were first-degree blood relatives of people with Alzheimer's disease, were recruited. Cognitive performance and nutritional intake were assessed and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype determined. RESULTS: The intakes of cholesterol (P < 0.037) and Na (P < 0.037) were significantly higher in subjects with altered cognitive performance. There was no significant difference in nutrient intakes between APOE epsilon-4 allele positive and APOE epsilon-4 allele negative subjects. CONCLUSION: The findings of this work suggest that dietary cholesterol and sodium intake may be linked to cognitive impairment.
