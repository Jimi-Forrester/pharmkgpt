35833748|a|According to the World Health Organization, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already infected more than 400 million people and caused over 5 million deaths globally. The infection is associated with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from no signs of illness to severe pathological complications that go beyond the typical respiratory symptoms. On this note, new-onset neurological and neuropsychiatric syndromes have been increasingly reported in a large fraction of COVID-19 patients, thus potentially representing a significant public health threat. Although the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive, a growing body of evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger an autoimmune response, which could potentially contribute to the establishment and/or exacerbation of neurological disorders in COVID-19 patients. Shedding light on this aspect is urgently needed for the development of effective therapeutic intervention. This review highlights the current knowledge of the immune responses occurring in Neuro-COVID patients and discusses potential immune-mediated mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger neurological complications.
