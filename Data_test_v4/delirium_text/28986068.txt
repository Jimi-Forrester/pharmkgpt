28986068|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by progressive dementia associated with global cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials evaluating omega-3 supplementation in patients with AD. OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is scientific evidence of the effectiveness of omega-3 supplementation in improving cognitive function in patients with AD. SEARCH STRATEGY: We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the following databases: Medline, Cochrane Central, Cinahl, and LILACS. An electronic search was also conducted using Google Scholar. STUDY SELECTION: Six articles met the eligibility criteria. The risk of bias was assessed following the Cochrane method. CONCLUSION: There is no consistent evidence to support the effectiveness of omega-3 supplementation in improving cognitive function in AD patients in the short and medium term.
