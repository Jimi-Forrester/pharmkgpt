38143373|a|BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and autonomic dysfunction. A major pathological feature of MSA is the presence of alpha-synuclein aggregates in oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system. A genome-wide association study revealed that the CDH4 gene is associated with MSA. However, virtually nothing is known about the role of CDH4 in the context of MSA. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare the expression of CDH4 between MSA and control brains, and to investigate its relationship with alpha-synuclein in oligodendrocytes. METHODS: RNA and protein were prepared from putamen, motor cortex white matter, cerebellum, and superior occipital cortex tissues collected from MSA (N = 11) and control (N = 13) brains. The expression of CDH4 was measured at mRNA and protein levels by qPCR and western blotting. Oligodendrocyte cells were cultured on plates and transfected with CDH4 cDNA and its impact on alpha-synuclein was analyzed. RESULTS: Firstly, we found that CDH4 in MSA brain was significantly elevated in the disease-affected motor cortex white matter in MSA (N = 11) compared to controls (N = 13) and unaltered in the disease-unaffected superior occipital cortex. Secondly, we determined that increases in CDH4 expression caused changes in the cellular levels of alpha-synuclein in oligodendrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: When put together, these results provide evidence that support the GWAS association of CDH4 with MSA.
