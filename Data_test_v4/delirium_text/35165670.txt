35165670|t|Mental health outcomes of adults hospitalized for COVID-19: A systematic review.
35165670|a|BACKGROUND: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 may be at high risk of mental health (MH) disorders. This systematic review assesses MH outcomes among adults during and after hospitalization for COVID-19 and ascertains MH care utilization and resource needs. METHODS: We searched multiple medical literature databases for studies published December 2019 to March 2021. Studies of >= 200 participants were synthesized. One reviewer completed article selection, data abstraction and assessed study quality and strength of evidence, with verification by a second. RESULTS: Fifty articles met preliminary inclusion criteria; 19 articles that included >= 200 participants were synthesized. Evidence from these primarily fair-quality studies suggests many patients experience symptoms of depression (9-66%), anxiety (30-39%), and insomnia (24-40%) during and 3 months after hospitalization for COVID-19. However, patients infrequently receive a new MH disorder diagnosis 6 months after hospitalization (5% are diagnosed with a new mood disorder, 7% anxiety disorder, and 3% insomnia). Some hospitalized patients - including women and those with more severe COVID-19 - may be at higher risk of poor MH outcomes. Data on MH care utilization and resource needs are currently limited. LIMITATIONS: Most included studies were small, did not report the proportion of participants with preexisting MH disorders, and did not use comparison groups. CONCLUSIONS: While many patients experience MH symptoms after hospitalization for COVID-19, most do not go on to develop a new MH disorder. Future studies should report whether participants have preexisting MH disorders and compare patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to patients hospitalized for other causes.
