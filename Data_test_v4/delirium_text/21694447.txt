21694447|t|The dynamics of CD147 in Alzheimer's disease development and pathology.
21694447|a|CD147, also known as basigin, EMMPRIN, neurothelin, TCSF, M6, HT7, OX47, or gp42, is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin super-family. It is expressed in many neuronal and non-neuronal tissues including the hippocampus, pre-frontal cortex thyroid, heart, early erythroid, amygdala, and placenta. This protein is involved in various cellular and biological functions, such as lymphocyte migration and maturation, tissue repair cancer progression, T and B lymphocyte activation, and induction of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase. The CD147 protein interacts with other proteins such as cyclophilin A (CyPA), Cyclophilin B (CyPB), sterol carrier protein (SCP), caveolin-1 and integrins, and can influence amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide levels, a protein that is central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Mechanisms by which CD147 regulate Abeta levels remain unclear, thus in this review we discuss its involvement in Abeta production and clearance and potential mechanisms by which controlling CD147 levels could impact on Abeta accumulation and AD pathogenesis.
