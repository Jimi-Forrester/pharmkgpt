33630665|t|Chemotherapy and the Risk of Alzheimer's Disease in Colorectal Cancer Survivors: Evidence From the Medicare System.
33630665|a|PURPOSE: Evidence on the nature of the relationship between patients receiving chemotherapy as an essential part of guideline-concordant cancer care and the onset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other adverse cognitive outcomes has been mixed. Biological mechanisms were proposed to support both a potentially beneficial and an adverse role. To explore the relationship between chemotherapy and onset of AD and other neurocognitive disorders (ND) in colorectal cancer survivors. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 135,834 individuals older than 65 years diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2007, using SEER-Medicare data. A proportional hazards model was used before and after the use of inverse probability weighting to account for populational differences between the chemotherapy and nonchemotherapy groups. Weights were normalized to the total sample size. RESULTS: After inverse probability weighting, chemotherapy was associated with decreased AD risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.791; 95% CI: 0.758 to 0.824) and lower risk for the majority of other ND including AD-related diseases (HR: 0.823; CI: 0.802 to 0.844), dementia (permanent mental disorder) (HR: 0.807; CI: 0.782 to 0.832), and dementia (senile) (HR: 0.772; CI: 0.745 to 0.801). The only adverse effect to remain significant was cerebral degeneration (excluding AD) (HR: 1.067; CI: 1.033 to 1.102). The effects for AD remained after treatment was stratified by chemotherapy agent type and remained significant for up to 6 years past diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy use in colorectal cancer survivors demonstrated an association with reduced risk for AD and other ND.
