35052505|a|Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a major flavan-3-ol of green tea polyphenols that exhibits various beneficial health effects, including antioxidant, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to evaluate whether EGCG prevents scopolamine-induced learning and memory impairment in in vivo and ex vivo models. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were pre-treated with EGCG (5 mg/kg/day; intraperitoneal injection (i.p.)) for 10 days. Then, EGCG and scopolamine (1 mg/kg/day; i.p.) were applied 60 and 30 min before the behavioral tests, respectively, for another 9 days. EGCG alleviated the cognitive deficits in the Y-maze, passive avoidance, and Morris water maze tests. EGCG showed improved cholinergic functions by decreasing acetylcholinesterase activity in hippocampi dissected from the brain of the rats after the behavioral tests. EGCG also reduced oxidative stress, partly due to increased superoxide dismutase activity and decreased malondialdehyde level in the hippocampi of the rat brains after the behavioral tests. Furthermore, EGCG attenuated the scopolamine-induced blockade of long-term potentiation in organotypic hippocampal tissue of seven-day-old SD rats. Taken together, these results suggested that EGCG is a potential therapeutic agent for alleviating cognitive dysfunction.
