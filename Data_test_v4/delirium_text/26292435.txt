26292435|t|Delirium: The Nurse's Role in Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment.
26292435|a|Delirium is an acute change in mental status typically caused by a medical condition. Delirium complicates care, increases safety risks, and has a negative impact on patient outcome. By identifying mental status changes early, the nurse is in a strategic position to prevent delirium in 30%-40% of at-risk patients. An interdisciplinary team approach can prevent, diagnose, and treat delirium to improve safety, reduce cost of care, and optimize patient outcomes.
