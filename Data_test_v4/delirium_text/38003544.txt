38003544|t|Iron and Targeted Iron Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease.
38003544|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. beta-amyloid plaque (Abeta) deposition and hyperphosphorylated tau, as well as dysregulated energy metabolism in the brain, are key factors in the progression of AD. Many studies have observed abnormal iron accumulation in different regions of the AD brain, which is closely correlated with the clinical symptoms of AD; therefore, understanding the role of brain iron accumulation in the major pathological aspects of AD is critical for its treatment. This review discusses the main mechanisms and recent advances in the involvement of iron in the above pathological processes, including in iron-induced oxidative stress-dependent and non-dependent directions, summarizes the hypothesis that the iron-induced dysregulation of energy metabolism may be an initiating factor for AD, based on the available evidence, and further discusses the therapeutic perspectives of targeting iron.
