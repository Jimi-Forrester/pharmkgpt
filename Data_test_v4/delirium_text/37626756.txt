37626756|t|Functional Recovery after the Application of Amniotic Tissues and Methylene Blue during Radical Prostatectomy-A Pilot Study.
37626756|a|Amniotic tissues and methylene blue (MB) provide the ability for neuroregeneration, and MB enables intraoperative neurostaining. We first combined the techniques to explore a neuroprotective effect on early functional outcomes in a retrospective proof-of-concept trial of 14 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP). The patients were followed up at a median of 13 months, and the continence and potency rates were reported. Early recovery of continence was found after three months. No effect on potency was detected. The findings indicate the feasibility of this tissue-engineering strategy, and justify prospective comparative studies.
