39488204|a|Fibril-type aggregates of tau occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dozens of tauopathies. Fibrils catalyze aggregation by prion-like seeding, which in part underlies disease progression. Seeding by recombinant and brain-derived tau fibrils is measured using biosensor cells that express aggregation-prone tau mutants fused with fluorescent reporter proteins. Seeding results in a punctated phenotype that is well established, but evidence that fluorescent tau fusion proteins from biosensor cells assemble into fibril-type structures is lacking. We investigated the effects of seeding on fibril formation by biosensor cells. Fluorescent punctated cell phenotypes that were catalyzed persisted with varying stabilities. Seeded cells bearing punctated phenotypes yielded sarkosyl-insoluble fibrils, although non-seeded cells did not. ImmunoEM of cell-purified fibrils shows that GFP localizes to the proteolytically sensitive fuzzy coat of tau fibrils. The presented data offer compelling evidence that fluorescent puncta are fibril-type aggregates of tau that result from prion-like seeding.
