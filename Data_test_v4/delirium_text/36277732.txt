36277732|a|Objectives: To explore the characteristics of hallucinations in hospitalized rehabilitation patients with COVID-19. Design: Retrospective review using medical records of patients with COVID-19 and admitted to the acute inpatient rehabilitation unit (ARU). Setting: A public hospital in southern California, specializing in rehabilitation medicine. Participants: Patients with COVID-19 and hallucinations who were consecutively admitted from January 1st to April 30th, 2021. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Types and themes of hallucinations. Results: Eight of the 37 patients (21.6%) admitted to the ARU with COVID-19 exhibited hallucinations. All were Hispanic and 7 of them were men; their average age was 56.5 (range: 38-71). Seven patients had COVID-19 pneumonia and 1 developed respiratory distress secondary to Guillain-Barre Syndrome. One patient had posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. The average length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) was 31.3 days (range: 8-48). Most of the hallucinations occurred during their ICU stay and 2 continued to their ARU stay. All recalled details of hallucinations with 7 exhibiting visual hallucinations, consistent with peduncular hallucinosis with or without auditory and/or tactile components. One patient experienced tactile hallucinations. The themes of hallucinations identified to reflect the contents of the hallucinations were patients' comfort-seeking, fearfulness, and seeing deceased family members. All patients had impaired cognition at the ARU admission but improved at discharge. Four patients had depressed mood/anxiety and 1 had depressed mood alone but without a history of psychiatric illness. ICU delirium was documented in 5 patients. The negative experience of hallucinations seemed to affect their participation of the ARU stay. Conclusions: More than 20% of patients with COVID-19 who were transferred to attend inpatient rehabilitation exhibited hallucinations. It remains uncertain if these hallucinations were related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation team should be aware to support patients with COVID-19 who experience hallucinations.
