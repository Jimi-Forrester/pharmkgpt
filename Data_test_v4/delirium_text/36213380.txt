36213380|t|The Beneficial Effects of Geniposide on Glucose and Lipid Metabolism: A Review.
36213380|a|Geniposide is a naturally sourced active ingredient that has diverse pharmacological effects and great potential in improving or treating different kinds of diseases. In recent years, more and more studies have confirmed that geniposide can improve glucose and lipid metabolism disorder, which is an increasingly prevalent health problem causing various metabolic diseases globally. Our review aims to summarize basic information on the pharmacological effects of geniposide on glucolipid metabolism. Geniposide increases glucose utilization and insulin production, protects pancreatic islet beta cells, inhibits insulin resistance and hepatic glucose production, and suppresses gluconeogenesis. While in the aspect of lipid metabolism, geniposide can promote lipolysis, inhibit lipogenesis, and regulate lipid transport. Geniposide ameliorates lipid and glucose metabolic disorders, improving the entire glycolipid metabolism network in a three-dimensional manner at the level of molecular mechanism. Growing evidence revealed that geniposide may serve as an effective drug to combat metabolic diseases for the time to come.
