32666028|t|Melatonin for delirium prevention in acute medically ill, and perioperative geriatric patients.
32666028|a|Delirium is a challenging neuropsychiatric ailment that has a negative impact on morbidity and mortality and is difficult to treat once it has developed. The purpose of this review was to analyze the efficacy of melatonin in the prevention of delirium in hospitalized geriatric patients in the acute medically ill and perioperative wards. The databases searched included PubMed (1946 to February 12, 2020), CINAHL (1982 to February 12, 2020), EMBASE (1974 to February 12, 2020), and Web of Science (1900 to February 12, 2020) using search terms related to melatonin, delirium, and prevention. Meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies were included. We excluded publications pertaining to the intensive care unit or oncology, case reports/series, and those not in English. Seven full-text publications were included for qualitative analysis. Patient comorbidities, patient medications, melatonin dosing, dosing regimens, and duration of treatment varied between the studies, which yielded heterogeneous results. Overall, this literature review yielded four studies that showed positive results and three that showed negative results for delirium prevention. The current data for the use of melatonin in delirium is conflicting. This area requires further research of more homogeneous studies with larger sample sizes.
