31861708|t|Serine-Arginine Protein Kinase 1 (SRPK1) as a Prognostic Factor and Potential Therapeutic Target in Cancer: Current Evidence and Future Perspectives.
31861708|a|Cancer, a heterogeneous disease composed of tumor cells and microenvironment, is driven by deregulated processes such as increased proliferation, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and evasion of apoptosis. Alternative splicing, a mechanism led by splicing factors, is implicated in carcinogenesis by affecting any of the processes above. Accumulating evidence suggests that serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1), an enzyme that phosphorylates splicing factors rich in serine/arginine domains, has a prognostic and potential predictive role in various cancers. Its upregulation is correlated with higher tumor staging, grading, and shorter survival. SRPK1 is also highly expressed in the premalignant changes of some cancers, showing a potential role in the early steps of carcinogenesis. Of interest, its downregulation in preclinical models has mostly been tumor-suppressive and affected diverse processes heterogeneously, depending on the oncogenic context. In addition, targeting SRPK1 has enhanced sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy in some cancers. Lastly, its aberrant function has been noted not only in cancer cells but also in the endothelial cells of the microenvironment. Although the aforementioned evidence seems promising, more studies are needed to reinforce the use of SRPK1 inhibitors in clinical trials.
