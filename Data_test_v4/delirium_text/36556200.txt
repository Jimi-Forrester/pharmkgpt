36556200|t|Emerging Perspectives on Gene Therapy Delivery for Neurodegenerative and Neuromuscular Disorders.
36556200|a|Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), are a group of heterogeneous diseases that mainly affect central nervous system (CNS) functions. A subset of NDDs exhibit CNS dysfunction and muscle degeneration, as observed in Gangliosidosis 1 (GM1) and late stages of PD. Neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) are a group of diseases in which patients show primary progressive muscle weaknesses, including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), Pompe disease, and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). NDDs and NMDs typically have a genetic component, which affects the physiological functioning of critical cellular processes, leading to pathogenesis. Currently, there is no cure or efficient treatment for most of these diseases. More than 200 clinical trials have been completed or are currently underway in order to establish safety, tolerability, and efficacy of promising gene therapy approaches. Thus, gene therapy-based therapeutics, including viral or non-viral delivery, are very appealing for the treatment of NDDs and NMDs. In particular, adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) are an attractive option for gene therapy for NDDs and NMDs. However, limitations have been identified after systemic delivery, including the suboptimal capacity of these therapies to traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB), degradation of the particles during the delivery, high reactivity of the patient's immune system during the treatment, and the potential need for redosing. To circumvent these limitations, several preclinical and clinical studies have suggested intrathecal (IT) delivery to target the CNS and peripheral organs via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF administration can vastly improve the delivery of small molecules and drugs to the brain and spinal cord as compared to systemic delivery. Here, we review AAV biology and vector design elements, different therapeutic routes of administration, and highlight CSF delivery as an attractive route of administration. We discuss the different aspects of neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases, such as pathogenesis, the landscape of mutations, and the biological processes associated with the disease. We also describe the hallmarks of NDDs and NMDs as well as discuss current therapeutic approaches and clinical progress in viral and non-viral gene therapy and enzyme replacement strategies for those diseases.
