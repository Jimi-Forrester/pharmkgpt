37626926|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that remains uncured. Its pathogenesis is characterized by the formation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques. The use of antigen-specific regulatory T cells (Tregs) through adoptive transfer has shown promise for the treatment of many inflammatory diseases, although the effectiveness of polyspecific Tregs is limited. Obtaining a sufficient number of antigen-specific Tregs from patients remains challenging. AIMS AND METHODS: To address this problem, we used an antibody-like single-chain variable fragment from a phage library and subsequently generated a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting beta-amyloid. RESULTS: The beta-amyloid-specific CARs obtained were stimulated by both recombinant and membrane-bound Abeta isolated from the murine brain. The generated CAR-Tregs showed a normal Treg phenotype, were antigen-specific activatable, and had suppressive capacity. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential of CAR technology to generate antigen-specific Tregs and presents novel approaches for developing functional CARs.
