29963449|t|Unusual Cause for Maxillofacial Injury.
29963449|a|Penetrating facial injuries are potentially dangerous and may require emergency management because of the presence of vital structures in the face, and it may be life-threatening especially when the injury involves airway, major blood vessels, spinal cord, and cervical spines. Penetrating injuries of the facial region can occur due to missile injuries, blast injuries, motor vehicle accidents, and accidental fall on sharp objects. However, injury to face caused by the shattering of a protective helmet itself is extremely rare. Primary management is targeted to deal with life-threatening conditions and stabilize the patient followed by subsequent care in a well-equipped setting. We present a case of a 30-year-old male, who suffered extensive soft and hard tissue injury of the maxillofacial region due to shattering of a protective helmet causing a ballistic effect.
