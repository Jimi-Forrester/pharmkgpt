21050832|a|Ageing of the population leads to an increase of cognitive disorders and chronic renal failure incidence. Compared to the general population, prevalence of cognitive impairment is more important in renal failure patients, especially in dialyzed patients. No direct link has been established between renal failure and cognitive impairment. The care of older and older patients and the high frequency of vascular risk factors, in particular hypertension and diabetes, partially explain the prevalence of vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease in this population. Other factors as the anemia, phosphocalcic metabolism disorders facilitate the cognitive impairment. The present work reviews the links existing between chronic renal failure and cognitive impairment.
