31403690|t|Thrombocytopenia in Patients Hospitalized for Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome and Its Associations to Clinical Complications.
31403690|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the predictive value of thrombocytopenia (TP) in alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) as a marker of evolution of non-complicated AWS (nAWS) to severe, complicated AWS (cAWS): delirium tremens (DTs) and withdrawal seizures (wS), and to broaden knowledge about differences between nAWS and cAWS groups in relation to severity of TP. METHODS: This study involved 300 people (236 males and 64 females), aged 19-65 years (M = 44.64, SD = 11.32), hospitalized in the detoxification ward with ICD-10 diagnosis of F10.3 (AWS) or F10.4 (DTs), divided into nAWS and cAWS groups, 150 cases each. AWS severity was measured by CIWA-Ar. Available clinical and laboratory data were analyzed. RESULTS: TP was found in 139 (46%) of all subjects (nAWS = 32, cAWS = 107). nAWS and cAWS did not differ according to age, gender, length and severity of the last binge. A relationship between the occurrence of TP and cAWS was found (P < 0.001). The lower was the number of PLT, the more AWS incidence was observed. In CIWA-Ar, TP subjects had at least moderate AWS (P < 0.001). nAWS had higher PLT values than cAWS cases (Mrang = 195.96 vs. 105.04, P < 0.001). The predictive value of TP in cAWS was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that patients with AWS and TP (in particular <119k/mL) are at higher risk of developing cAWS.
