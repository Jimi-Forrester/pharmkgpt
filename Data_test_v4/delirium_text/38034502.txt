38034502|a|Purpose: The objective of this article is to draw attention to an unusual clinical manifestation of pulmonary embolism (PE) as symptoms suggesting an underlying mental disorder. This seems all the more important since PE is one of the most common causes of potentially preventable hospital deaths and delayed diagnosis of PE in patients consulted at emergency departments has been shown to be most common in elderly patients and the ones presenting with significantly altered mental status. Views: PE is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and appropriate management. There is no symptom that can be found characteristic for PE. Clinical picture of this condition is varied and may resemble many other disorders. The article emphasises that PE may also manifest with psychopathological symptoms that mimic psychiatric emergencies. Three most common groups of psychopathological symptoms that can mask a developing PE, such as panic attacks, symptoms of psychosis, and catatonia, are discussed here based on the literature review. Conclusions: Particular care must be exercised while evaluating such a patient because initial misdiagnosis results in the patient being referred to a mental health care unit instead of a unit treating somatic disorders. There are no diagnostic or treatment facilities in large psychiatric hospitals to assist such a patient. This, in turn, leads to a significant delay in management and, consequently, to major complications or death.
