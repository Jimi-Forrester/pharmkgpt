31186776|t|ceRNA network analysis reveals prognostic markers for glioblastoma.
31186776|a|Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common aggressive cancer that originates in the brain, which has a poor prognosis. It is therefore crucial to understand its underlying genetic mechanisms in order to develop novel therapies. The present study aimed to identify some prognostic markers and candidate therapeutic targets for GBM. To do so, RNA expression levels in tumor and normal tissues were compared by microarray analysis. The differential expression of RNAs in normal and cancer tissues was analyzed, and a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed for pathway analysis. The results revealed that RNA expression patterns were considerably different between normal and tumor samples. A ceRNA network was therefore constructed with the differentially expressed RNAs. ETS variant 5 (ETV5), myocyte enhancer factor 2C and ETS transcription factor (ELK4) were considerably enriched in the significant pathway of 'transcriptional misregulation in cancer'. In addition, prognostic analysis demonstrated that ETV5 and ELK4 expression levels were associated with the survival time of patients with GBM. These results suggested that ELK4 and ETV5 may be prognostic markers for GBM, and that their microRNAs may be candidate therapeutic targets.
