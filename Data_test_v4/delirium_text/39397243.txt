39397243|t|Ferroptosis in ischemic stroke: Animal models and mechanisms.
39397243|a|Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, with the majority of cases resulting from ischemic events due to arterial occlusion. Current therapeutic approaches focus on rapid reperfusion through intravenous thrombolysis and intravascular thrombectomy. Although these interventions can mitigate long-term disability, reperfusion itself may induce neuronal injury. The exact mechanisms underlying neuronal damage following cerebral ischemia have yet to be reported. Recent research suggests that ferroptosis may play a significant role in post-ischemic neuronal death, which can be targeted to prevent neuronal loss. This review explores the three essential hallmarks of ferroptosis: the presence of redox-active iron, the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids, and the loss of lipid peroxide repair capacity. The involvement of ferroptosis in neuronal injury following ischemic stroke is also explored, along with an overview of ferroptosis-associated changes in different ischemic stroke animal models. Furthermore, recent therapeutic interventions targeting the ferroptosis pathway, as well as the opportunities, difficulties, and future directions of ferroptosis-targeted therapies in ischemic stroke, are discussed.
