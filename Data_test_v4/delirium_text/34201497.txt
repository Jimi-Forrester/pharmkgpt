34201497|t|Morphological and Calcium Signaling Alterations of Neuroglial Cells in Cerebellar Cortical Dysplasia Induced by Carmustine.
34201497|a|Cortical dysplasias are alterations in the organization of the layers of the brain cortex due to problems in neuronal migration during development. The neuronal component has been widely studied in experimental models of cortical dysplasias. In contrast, little is known about how glia are affected. In the cerebellum, Bergmann glia (BG) are essential for neuronal migration during development, and in adult they mediate the control of fine movements through glutamatergic transmission. The aim of this study was to characterize the morphology and intracellular calcium dynamics of BG and astrocytes from mouse cerebellum and their modifications in a model of cortical dysplasia induced by carmustine (BCNU). Carmustine-treated mice were affected in their motor coordination and balance. Cerebellar dysplasias and heterotopias were more frequently found in lobule X. Morphology of BG cells and astrocytes was affected, as were their spontaneous [Ca2+]i transients in slice preparation and in vitro.
