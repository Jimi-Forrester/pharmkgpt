28237746|a|BACKGROUND: Depression has a high prevalence among patients with Alzheimer's disease, and it has a significant negative impact on their functioning. However, despite its significant impact and challenge, few treatment outcomes data are available to guide clinical care of depression among this population. We developed a cognitive-behavioral intervention to persons with AD. In this paper, we describe the intervention and results of an open trial evaluating its feasibility and utility. SETTING: Dementia Unit. SUBJECT: Alzheimer's disease patients. METHODS: The treatment was administered over a period of three months with the implication of a caregiver. Dyads were followed for an additional three months in-person sessions. A selection of skills is offered, including education and self-awareness, coping self-statements, behavioral activation, problem-solving therapy, exercise, and caregiver education. RESULTS: Nine participants were enrolled. Overall, patients and caregivers were satisfied with the treatment and reported that they benefited-in terms of depression, anxiety, and caregiver distress. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are preliminaries and attention now needs to be turned to futher evaluation in a randomized clinical trial.
