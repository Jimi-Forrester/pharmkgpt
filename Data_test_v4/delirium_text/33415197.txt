33415197|t|The Burden Experience of Formal and Informal Caregivers of Older Adults With Hip Fracture in Nigeria.
33415197|a|INTRODUCTION: The incidence of hip fracture among older adults in Nigeria is on the rise. As a result, there is increased frequency of hospitalization, patient suffering, family burden, and societal cost. One dimension that has not been sufficiently explored is the burden of care experienced by informal and formal caregivers. OBJECTIVES: To describe the care burden experience of informal and formal caregivers for older adults with hip fractures in a specialized orthopedic center in Nigeria and to explore in detail how their experience differs in caregiving roles. METHOD: This study was conducted in the phenomenological approach of qualitative methods. Face-to-face interviews and focus group interaction with 12 family caregivers and 5 health-care professionals were carried out until data saturation was achieved. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The physical, emotional, and general health of elderly hip fracture patients are issues that affect caregiving. Factors that contribute to increased caregivers' burden include system factors (lack of personnel and health-care facilities) and patient factors: comorbidity, patient's cognitive status, and challenges completing activities of daily living (ADL). Social and financial barriers to care contribute to the type of burden experienced by the participants. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers experience difficulty in helping patients complete their ADL because patients with hip fracture have mobility issues that are often complicated by comorbid physical and cognitive problems. Strategies to reduce caregivers' burden for older adults with hip fracture in Nigeria are needed. Greater access to health-care services and ADL aids, and training of caregivers on how to deal with cognitive and multimorbid health problems are potential solutions.
