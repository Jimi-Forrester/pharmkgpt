30861197|t|Frailty, oral health and nutrition in geriatrics inpatients: A cross-sectional study.
30861197|a|BACKGROUND: Poor nutritional status is a risk factor for the development of frailty. Likewise, oral health is independently associated with nutrition. The potential association between oral health and frailty in hospitalised elderly adults has, however, not previously been investigated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between oral health and frailty in hospitalised elderly adults and to identify the predictors of frailty. METHOD: A cross-sectional study of 168 geriatric inpatients >65 years old was performed from August to December 2016. Patients of non-English speaking background, with impaired cognition (MMSE <24), severe hearing or visual impairment or active delirium were excluded. Oral health, nutrition and frailty were assessed using previously validated tools, namely the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI), Mini Nutrition Assessment (MNA) and Reported Edmonton Frailty Scale (REFS). Other data collected included demographics, co-morbidities, level of education and smoking/alcohol history. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, the REFS score decreased with better nutritional status/higher MNA (P < 0.001) and better self-reported oral health/higher GOHAI (P = 0.023). Nutritional status accounted for 17% of variability in frailty assessment. On multivariate analysis, co-morbidities (P < 0.001), MNA (P < 0.001) and living in residential care (P < 0.001) were independent predictors of frailty. After adjusting for nutrition and co-morbidities, self-reported oral health was found to have an independent negative association with frailty (P = 0.019). CONCLUSION: Poor self-reported oral health was found to be independently associated with frailty. Further research should be directed at whether interventions to maintain good oral health can prevent or slow the progression of frailty.
