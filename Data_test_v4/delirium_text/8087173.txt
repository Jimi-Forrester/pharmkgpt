8087173|a|Excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors and elevation of intracellular calcium levels initiate the neurodegenerative process resulting from cerebral ischemia. However, the subsequent cascade of molecular changes which are of pathogenic significance is less well understood. Breakdown of the cytoskeleton may be involved in the progression from compromise of neuronal viability to irreversible damage. Alteration of the microtubule-associated protein tau, as reflected by increased Alz-50 immunoreactivity, was induced by permanent focal cerebral ischemia in vivo but only in a proportion of neurones. Alz-50 immunoreactive neurones did not exhibit the characteristics of irreversible ischemic cell damage. Increased immunoreactivity to the stress response protein ubiquitin was also induced by ischemia in a proportion of neurones. Both proteins are components of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. Alterations of the microtubule-associated protein tau may be a feature of the early stages of the ischemia-induced degeneration and the ubiquitin response may be an attempt by compromised neurones to deal with the presence of abnormal proteins.
