22091570|t|Biomarkers for delirium--a review.
22091570|a|To improve delirium recognition and care, numerous serum biomarkers have been investigated as potential tools for risk stratification, diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication of delirium. The literature was reviewed, and no evidence was found to support the clinical use of any delirium biomarker, although certain biomarkers such as S-100 beta and insulin-like growth factor-1 and inflammatory markers have shown some promising results that need to be evaluated in future studies with appropriate sample size, prospective designs, and in a more-generalizable population.
