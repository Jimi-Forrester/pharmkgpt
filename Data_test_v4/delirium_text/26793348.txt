26793348|a|BACKGROUND: Assist/control (A/C) ventilation may induce delirium in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We conducted a trial to determine whether initial synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with pressure support (SIMV + PS) could improve clinical outcomes in these patients. METHODS: Intubated patients with moderate ARDS were enrolled and we compared SIMV + PS with A/C. Identical sedation, analgesia and ventilation strategies were performed. The co-primary outcomes were early (<=72 h) partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) and incidence of delirium. The secondary outcomes were all-cause in-hospital mortality, dosages of analgesics and sedatives, incidence of patient-ventilator asynchrony, and duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay. RESULTS: We screened 2,684 patients and 40 patients were enrolled in our study. In SIMV + PS, early (<=72 h) PaO2/FiO2 was greater improved than that at baseline and that in A/C (P<0.05) with lower positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (8.7+-3.0 vs. 10.3+-3.2, P<0.001) and FiO2 (58%+-18% vs. 67%+-19%, P<0.001). We found more SIMV + PS success (defined as SIMV + PS successfully applied without switching to A/C) (100.0% vs. 16.7%, P<0.001), less male (46.3% vs. 85.7%, P=0.015) and pulmonary etiology of ARDS (53.8% vs. 92.9%, P=0.015), and lower PEEP (9.1+-3.1 vs. 10.3+-3.3, P=0.004) and FiO2 (58%+-19% vs. 71%+-19%, P<0.001) in survival patients. However, there were no significant differences in incidence of delirium and mortality, dosages of analgesics and sedatives, incidence of patient-ventilator asynchrony, duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate ARDS, SIMV + PS can safely and effectively improve oxygenation, but does not decrease mortality, incidence of delirium and patient-ventilator asynchrony, dosages of analgesics and sedatives, and duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay.
