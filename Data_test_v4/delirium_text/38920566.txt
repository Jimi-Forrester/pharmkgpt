38920566|t|Utilizing a Disposable Sensor with Polyaniline-Doped Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes to Enable Dopamine Detection in Ex Vivo Mouse Brain Tissue Homogenates.
38920566|a|Disposable sensors are inexpensive, user-friendly sensing tools designed for rapid single-point measurements of a target. Disposable sensors have become more and more essential as diagnostic tools due to the growing demand for quick, easy-to-access, and reliable information related to the target. Dopamine (DA), a prevalent catecholamine neurotransmitter in the human brain, is associated with central nervous system activities and directly promotes neuronal communication. For the sensitive and selective estimation of DA, an enzyme-free amperometric sensor based on polyaniline-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PANI-MWCNTs) drop-coated disposable screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) was fabricated. This PANI-MWCNTs-2/SPCE sensor boasts exceptional accuracy and sensitivity when working directly with ex vivo mouse brain homogenates. The sensor exhibited a detection limit of 0.05 muM (S/N = 3), and a wide linear range from 1.0 to 200 muM. The sensor's high selectivity to DA amidst other endogenous interferents was recognized. Since the constructed sensor is enzyme-free yet biocompatible, it exhibited high stability in DA detection using ex vivo mouse brain homogenates extracted from both Parkinson's disease and control mice models. This research thus presents new insights into understanding DA release dynamics at the tissue level in both of these models.
