39393800|t|The Relationship between Delirium and Dementia.
39393800|a|Delirium and dementia are common causes of cognitive impairment in older adults. They are distinct but interrelated. Delirium, an acute confusional state, has been linked to the chronic and progressive loss of cognitive ability seen in dementia. Individuals with dementia are at higher risk for delirium, and delirium itself is a risk factor for incident dementia. Additionally, delirium in individuals with dementia can hasten underlying cognitive decline. In this review, we summarize recent literature linking these conditions, including epidemiological, clinicopathological, neuroimaging, biomarker, and experimental evidence supporting the intersection between these conditions. Strategies for evaluation and diagnosis that focus on distinguishing delirium from dementia in clinical settings and recommendations for delirium prevention interventions for patients with dementia are presented. We also discuss studies that provide evidence that delirium may be a modifiable risk factor for dementia and consider the impact of delirium prevention interventions on long-term outcomes.
