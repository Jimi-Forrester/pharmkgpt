38334009|t|Association between plasma CTRPs with cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease.
38334009|a|AIMS: Recent evidence indicated the biological basis of complement 1q (C1q)/tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related protein (CTRP) 3, 4, and 14 for affecting brain structure and cognitive function. Thus, we aimed to investigate the association between plasma CTRPs with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: A multicenter, cross-sectional study recruited patients with AD (n = 137) and cognitively normal (CN) controls (n = 140). After the data collection of demographic characteristics, lifestyle risk factors, and medical history, plasma levels of tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (pT217), pT181, neurofilament light (NfL), CTRP3, 4, and 14 were examined and compared. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to determine associations of plasma CTPRs with the presence of AD. The correlation analysis was used to explore correlations between plasma CTPRs with scores of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale, and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), and levels of plasma pT217, pT181, and NfL. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and Delong's test were used to determine the diagnostic power of plasma CTPRs. RESULTS: Plasma levels of CTRP3, 4, and 14 were higher in AD group than those in CN group. After adjusting for conventional risk factors, CTRP3, CTRP4, and CTRP14 were associated with the presence of AD. In AD patients, CTRP3 was negatively correlated with scores of MMSE and MoCA, while positively correlated with ADL score, CDR-SB score, pT217, and pT181; CTRP4 was positively correlated with CDR-SB score, pT181, and NfL; CTRP14 was negatively correlated with MMSE score, while positively correlated with CDR-SB score, pT217, and NfL. An independent addition of CTRP3 and 4 to the basic model combining age, sex, years of education, APOE4 status, BMI, TG, and HDL-C led to a significant improvement in diagnostic power for AD, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: All the findings preliminarily uncovered associations between plasma CTRPs and AD and suggested the potential of CTRPs as a blood-derived biomarker for AD.
