35388531|a|The gut microbiome is linked to several diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and colon cancer. The gut microbiome is also associated with the modulation of immune function, resulting in a different response to immune checkpoint therapy. The gut microbiome differs according to lifestyle, diet, sex, race, genetic background, and country. Lifestyle, especially diet, plays an important role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Recent studies have revealed a connection between the gut microbiome and prostate cancer. A high-fat diet causes gut dysbiosis and gut bacterial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids and phospholipids that enter systemic circulation result in promoting prostate cancer growth. Additionally, the gut microbiota can serve as a source of testosterone, which affects prostate cancer progression. Men with castration-resistant prostate cancer have an increased abundance of gut bacteria with androgenic functions. Men with high-risk prostate cancer share a specific gut microbial profile and profiling gut microbiota could be a potentially effective tool to screen men with high-risk prostate cancer. Lifestyle modifications can improve the gut microbiome. Furthermore, altering the gut microbiome using prebiotic or probiotic interventions may prevent or delay prostate cancer development. Further study into the "Gut-Prostate Axis" would help in the discovery of new strategies for the prevention, screening, and treatment of prostate cancer.
