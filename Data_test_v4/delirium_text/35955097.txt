35955097|a|(1) Background: The influence of serotonin on many regulatory mechanisms has not been sufficiently studied. The use of a physical method, assuming the possibility of its action on increasing the concentration of serotonin, may be the direction of therapy limiting the number of antidepressants used. The aim of the research was to study the effects of low-frequency magnetic fields of different characteristics on the circadian profile of serotonin in men with low back pain. (2) Methods: 16 men with back pain syndrome participated in the study. The patients were divided into two groups. In group 1, magnetotherapy (2.9 mT, 40 Hz, square wave, bipolar) was applied at 10.00 a.m. In group 2, the M2P2 magnetic stimulation program of the Viofor JPS device was used. Treatments in each group lasted 3 weeks, 5 days each, with breaks for Saturday and Sunday. The daily serotonin profile was determined the day before the exposure and the day after the last treatment. Blood samples (at night with red light) were collected at 8:00, 12:00, 16:00, 24:00, and 4:00. The patients did not suffer from any chronic or acute disease and were not taking any medications. (3) Results: In group 1, a significant increase in serotonin concentration was observed after 15 treatments at 4:00. In group 2, a significant increase in serotonin concentration was observed at 8:00 after the end of the treatments. In comparison between magnetotherapy and magnetic stimulation, the time points at which differences appeared after the application of serotonin occurred due to the increase in its concentrations after the application of magnetic stimulation. (4) Conclusions: Magnetotherapy and magnetic stimulation, acting in a similar way, increase the concentration of serotonin. Weak magnetic fields work similarly to the stronger ones used in TMS. It is possible to use them in the treatment of mental disorders or other diseases with low serotonin concentrations.
