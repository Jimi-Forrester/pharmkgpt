27472877|t|PKC Activation Counteracts ADAM10 Deficit in HuD-Silenced Neuroblastoma Cells.
27472877|a|Neuronal ELAV/Hu (nELAV) are RNA-binding proteins that mainly regulate gene expression by increasing the stability and/or translation rate of target mRNAs bearing ARE (adenine and uracil-rich elements) sequences. Among nELAV target transcripts there is ADAM10, an alpha-secretase involved in the non-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) which leads to the production of the neuroprotective sAbetaPPalpha peptide. The aim of this study was to evaluate if nELAV depletion affects ADAM10 expression in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. We also studied the effects of Bryostatin-1, a molecule able to activate nELAV protein cascade. The specific HuD/nELAV gene silencing decreased both nELAV and ADAM10 protein contents; similar results were obtained by Abeta40 treatment in wild-type SH-SY5Y cells. In HuD-silenced cells, the exposure to Bryostatin-1 counteracted both nELAV and ADAM10 proteins downregulation, by restoring nELAV/ADAM10 basal levels. We also found that sAbetaPPalpha release, which seemed not to be compromised by Abeta40 challenge or HuD-silencing, was favored by Bryostatin-1. Overall, these findings strongly suggest that a deficiency in nELAV content negatively affects ADAM10 expression and may play a role in neurodegenerative diseases, which may benefit by molecules activating ELAV cascade.
