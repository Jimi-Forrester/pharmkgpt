30827242|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesions. Deficiency of Serotonin signaling recently has been linked to the increased Abeta level in transgenic mice and humans. In addition, tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (Tph2), a second tryptophan hydroxylase isoform, controls brain serotonin synthesis. However, it remains to be determined that whether Tph2 deficient APP/PS1mice affect the formation of Abeta plaques in vivo. METHODS: Both quantitative and qualitative immunochemistry methods, as well as Congo red staining were used to evaluate the Abeta load and astrogliosis in these animals. RESULTS: we studied alterations of cortex and hippocampus in astrocytes and senile plaques by Tph2 conditional knockout (Tph2 CKO) AD mice from 6-10 months of age. Using Congo red staining and immunostained with Abeta antibody, we showed that plaques load or plaques numbers significantly increased in Tph2 CKO experimental groups at 8 to 10 months old, compared to wild type (WT) group, respectively. Using GFAP+ astrocytes immunofluorescence method, we found that the density of GFAP+ astrocytes markedly enhanced in Tph2 CKO at 10 months. We showed Abeta plaques co-localized autophagic markers LC3 and p62. Nevertheless, we did not observe any co-localization between GFAP+ astrocytes and autophagic markers, but detected the co-localization between betaIII-tubulin+ neurons and autophagic markers. CONCLUSION: Overall, our work provides the preliminary evidence in vivo that Tph2 plays a role in amyloid plaques generation.
