11276026|a|This review of the literature describes the psychosocial consequences of all the elements associated with Pelvis Exenterative Surgery (PES): a diagnosis of cancer and/or its recurrence, impact of procedures such as simple or radical hysterectomy, prostatectomy, or colostomy. All studies report a high incidence of anxiety, depression, self-image insult, sexual dysfunction, social isolation, and dysfunction. There are few studies of the consequences of PES itself. Their consensus is that its psychosocial impact is not as catastrophic as one would expect. However, their methodological drawbacks do not yet permit a definitive conclusion. The interaction of the patients with their surgeon and treatment team during the preoperative period is examined with special attention to potential pitfalls. Acute psychiatric syndromes that may occur during the postoperative period (delirium, anxiety, depression, brief reactive psychosis) and their management is discussed. So are sexual dysfunctions. General principles of intervention in preparing patients for invasive procedures and facilitating favorable outcomes are described. J. Surg. Oncol. 2001;76:224-236.
