22776645|t|Lack of an association between Paraoxonase 1 gene polymorphisms (Q192R, L55M) and Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.
22776645|a|The association between Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) gene polymorphisms (Q192R, L55M) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk has been reported inconsistent results. To assess the association between PON1 polymorphisms and AD risk, a meta-analysis was performed. Based on comprehensive searches of the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Weipu, and CBM databases, a total of 10 studies including 3081 AD cases and 3054 controls were identified. The pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were performed. There was no significant association between PON1 Q192R polymorphism and AD risk in all comparison models (R vs. Q, OR=0.89, 95% CI=0.82-0.96; RR vs. QQ, OR=0.83, 95% CI=0.68-1.01; RR+RQ vs. QQ, OR=0.86, 95% CI=0.75-0.97; and RR vs. QR+QQ, OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.81-1.11). For the PON1 L55M polymorphism, lack of an association was also found (L vs. M, OR=0.95, 95% CI=0.86-1.05; LL vs. MM, OR=0.67, 95% CI=0.51-0.88; LL vs. ML+MM, OR=0.82, 95% CI=0.69-0.98; and LL+ML vs. MM, OR=0.75, 95% CI=0.58-0.96). On subgroup analysis by ethnicity, similar results were found. Conclusively, the present meta-analysis revealed that PON1 gene polymorphisms (Q192R, L55M) were unlikely to contribute to AD susceptibility.
