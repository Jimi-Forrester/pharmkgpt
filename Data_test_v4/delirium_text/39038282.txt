39038282|t|Initial Perspectives From Rural-Residing Adults on a Digital Cognitive Health Coaching Intervention: Exploratory Qualitative Analysis.
39038282|a|BACKGROUND: A growing body of research has examined lifestyle-based interventions for dementia prevention. Specifically, health coaching interventions have been linked to decreased risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) comorbidities, such as diabetes. Despite the association, there is a lack of research examining the efficacy and perception of digital health coaching on reducing AD risk. Understanding the perceived benefits of participating in a digital health coach program is critical to ensure long-term use, including participant adherence and engagement. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine the initial attitudes toward a digital health coaching intervention aimed at preventing cognitive decline among at-risk, rural participants. METHODS: This exploratory qualitative study is part of the ongoing Digital Cognitive Multidomain Alzheimer Risk Velocity Study (DC-MARVel; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04559789), a 2-year randomized control trial examining the effects of a digital health coaching intervention on dementia risk, cognitive decline, and general health outcomes. Participants were recruited from the northwest region of Arkansas via word of mouth, email, local radio, and social media. At the time of the analysis, 103 participants randomly assigned to the health coaching group completed an average of 4 coaching sessions over a 4-month period. The intervention included asynchronous messages 1-2 times per week from their health coach that contained health education articles based on the participant's goals (eg, increase physical activity), unlimited access to their coach for questions and recommendations, and monthly meetings with their coach via videoconference or phone to discuss their goals. Participants were asked 2 open-ended questions, "What were your top 1 or 2 takeaways from your recent Health Coaching session?" and "Is there anything you would change about our Health Coaching sessions?" A thematic analysis was conducted using feedback responses from 80 participants (mean age, SD 7.6 years). RESULTS: The following four themes emerged from participants' feedback: (1) healthy lifestyle and behavioral changes, (2) a sense of self-awareness through introspection, (3) value in coach support, and (4) a desire for a change in program format (eg, frequency). In total, 93% (n=74) of participants expressed that the intervention needed no changes. CONCLUSIONS: Initial participation in the digital cognitive health coaching intervention was well received, as evidenced by participants reporting value in goal setting and strategies for healthy lifestyle and behavioral changes as well as self-reflection on their personal lifestyle choices. Feedback about their assigned coach also offers insight into the importance of the coach-participant relationship and may serve as a significant factor in overall participant success. Given the exploratory nature of this study, more robust research is needed to elicit more information from participants about their experiences to fully understand the acceptability of the digital health coaching intervention.
