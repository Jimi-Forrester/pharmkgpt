31295839|a|In this work the polymerization of catechin, epicatechin, and resveratrol was carried out through a peroxidase oxidation process in order to improve the biological activity of these phenolic compounds. The antioxidant activity of the oligomers was evaluated by their ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their capacity to chelate metal ions Fe2+ and Cu2+. The antitumor effect of the oligomers was determined by their ability to induce toxicity in the T24 human bladder cancer cell line. By enzymatic peroxidase oxidation, it was possible to produce oligomers of catechin, epicatechin, and resveratrol with antioxidant capacity significantly higher than their preceding monomers. The ROS scavenging capacity of the oligomers was 20 times higher than that of the monomers, while the ability of the oligomers to chelate metal ions increased up to about 1000 times. Our data show the antitumor effect of the oligomers of catechin, epicatechin, and resveratrol in the T24 cell line, which was similar to that observed with cisplatin. Oligomers of catechin, epicatechin, and resveratrol have great potential to be used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases and bladder cancer.
