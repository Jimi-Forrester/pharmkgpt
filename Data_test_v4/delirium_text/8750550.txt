8750550|t|Neurological complications of liver transplantation.
8750550|a|We examined 199 consecutive patients who underwent 220 liver transplantations, to define the type, frequency and aetiology of posttransplant neurological complications and their prognostic value. We found neurological complications in 63 patients (32%), mostly involving the central nervous system. The most frequent complications were mental status changes ranging from delirium to coma and seizures. The aetiology was multifactorial, cyclosporin A neurotoxicity being the main cause. Patients with neurological complications had a higher mortality rate than those without. In our series, neurological complications represented a major medical problem with increased morbidity and mortality.
