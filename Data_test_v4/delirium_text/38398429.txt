38398429|a|Background/Objective: Amyloid beta (beta) -40 levels increase with age and inflammation states and appear to be associated with clinical manifestations of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We investigated the correlation of Abeta peptides with myocardial injury and inflammation biomarkers in patients with or without ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, NSTEMI). Methods: This singe-center, cross-sectional, observational, and correlation study included 65 patients with ACS (n = 34 STEMI, 29 males, age = 58 +- 12 years; n = 31 NSTEMI, 22 males, age = 60 +- 12 years) who were enrolled in the coronary care unit within 12 h after symptom onset from February 2022 to May 2023. Abeta peptide levels and biochemical parameters were assessed. Results: NSTEMI patients had a higher prevalence of hypertension (p = 0.039), diabetes (p = 0.043), smoking (p = 0.003), and prior myocardial infarction (p = 0.010) compared to STEMI patients. We observed a higher level of Abeta-42 in NSTEMI (p = 0.001) but no difference in Abeta-40 levels. We also found a correlation between age and NT-proBNP with both Abeta peptides (Abeta-40, Abeta-42) (p = 0.001, p = 0.002 respectively). Conclusions: Our results show that patients with NSTEMI had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and prior myocardial infarction). Considering these results, we propose that Abeta-42 can add value to risk stratification in NSTEMI patients.
