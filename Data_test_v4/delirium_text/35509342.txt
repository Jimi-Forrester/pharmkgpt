35509342|t|Is a decrease in activities of daily living in the elderly irreversible? A case report of Wernicke encephalopathy in home medical care.
35509342|a|The patient was an 83-year-old male who, after being hospitalized for 70 days for suffocation due to aspiration, was provided with home medical care (HMC) as his physical condition did not allow him to climb stairs. Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) was suspected based on his disorientation and a continued loss of appetite. This diagnosis was supported by abnormal serum thiamine and the disappearance of delirium after thiamine administration. In addition, he became able to use stairs. Patients who receive HMC should undergo active screening and receive treatment with WE in mind.
