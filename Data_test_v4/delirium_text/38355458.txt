38355458|a|BACKGROUND: Clinical characteristics and long-term data on the safety and efficacy of LAAC in preventing cerebrovascular accident and thromboembolism among Chinese patients with non-valvular AF (NVAF) remain limited. METHODS: Data of consecutive NVAF patients who underwent LAAC at Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, from June 1, 2014, to December 31, 2021, were collected and analyzed retrospectively. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the composite endpoint of stroke/transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, and death from cardiovascular causes. The primary safety endpoint is the severe bleeding defined by the LAAC Munich consensus. RESULTS: Of the 222 patients enrolled, the mean age was 66.90 +- 9.62 years, with a majority being male (77.03%). Many patients are non-paroxysmal AF (71.19%) with a median duration of AF of 4.00 years. The mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was 3.78 +- 1.49, and the mean HAS-BLED score was 1.68 +- 0.86. Thromboembolic events (76.58%) were the most common indication for LAAC. The device, technical, and procedural success rates were 98.65%, 98.65%, and 93.69%, respectively. The anticoagulation continuation rate was 56.36%, 31.25%, and 22.60% at 3-, 6- and 12 months post-procedure, respectively. Throughout a mean 2.81 years of follow-up, the incidence of the primary efficacy endpoint was 4.27 per 100 patient-years, predominantly attributable to stroke/TIA (3.12 per 100 PYs). Five patients experienced major bleeding during the follow-up period. Post-procedure imaging revealed minimal complications, with only one substantial peri-device leak. Device-related thrombus occurred in 2.33% of patients, resolving with anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that LAAC is a safe and effective alternative option for Chinese patients with AF, with a high success rate, few complications as well as fewer long-term adverse outcome events.
