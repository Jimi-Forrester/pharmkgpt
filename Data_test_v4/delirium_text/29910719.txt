29910719|a|The design of novel inhibitors to target BACE1 with reduced cytotoxicity effects is a promising approach to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multiple clinical drugs and antibodies such as AZD3293 and Solanezumab are being tested to investigate their therapeutical potential against AD. The current study explores the binding pattern of AZD3293 and Solanezumab against their target proteins such as beta-secretase (BACE1) and mid-region amyloid-beta (Abeta) (PDBIDs: 2ZHV & 4XXD), respectively using molecular docking and dynamic simulation (MD) approaches. The molecular docking results show that AZD3293 binds within the active region of BACE1 by forming hydrogen bonds against Asp32 and Lys107 with distances 2.95 and 2.68 A, respectively. However, the heavy chain of Solanezumab interacts with Lys16 and Asp23 of amyloid beta having bond length 2.82, 2.78, and 3.00 A, respectively. The dynamic cross correlations and normal mode analyses show that BACE1 depicted good residual correlated motions and fluctuations, as compared to Solanezumab. Using MD, the Root Mean Square Deviation and Fluctuation (RMSD/F) graphs show that AZD3293 residual fluctuations and RMSD value (0.2 nm) was much better compared to Solanezumab (0.7 nm). Moreover, the radius of gyration (Rg) results also depicts the significance of AZD3293 docked complex compared to Solanezumab through residual compactness. Our comparative results show that AZD3293 is a better therapeutic agent for treating AD than Solanezumab.
