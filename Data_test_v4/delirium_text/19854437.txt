19854437|t|A combinatorial feature selection approach to describe the QSAR of dual site inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase.
19854437|a|Regarding the great potential of dual binding site inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase as the future potent drugs of Alzheimer's disease, this study was devoted to extraction of the most effective structural features of these inhibitors from among a large number of quantitative descriptors. To do this, we adopted a unique approach in quantitative structure-activity relationships. An efficient feature selection method was emphasized in such an approach, using the confirmative results of different routine and novel feature selection methods. The proposed methods generated quite consistent results ensuring the effectiveness of the selected structural features.
