37612162|a|OBJECTIVE: Flap complications continue to be a challenge in microsurgical reconstruction for older adults. We aimed to evaluate the impact of age on surgical outcomes after microvascular reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively investigated 103 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma who had undergone microvascular reconstruction surgery to compare microsurgical reconstruction, common postoperative complications, and flap success rates in geriatric (>75 years) and non-geriatric (<75 years) patients. We also evaluated differences based on the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status score. RESULTS: We found no significant differences between the geriatric and non-geriatric groups in peri-operative, postoperative, or general complications. Conversely, we found that delirium and aspiration pneumonia were significantly more likely to occur in geriatric patients and that multiple medical complications were significantly more likely to occur in geriatric patients with a high American Society of Anesthesiologists score. CONCLUSION: Microvascular reconstruction can be performed effectively and without excessive complications in geriatric patients, and age should not be considered a contraindication for this procedure. Comorbidities play a stronger role in the prediction of adverse events.
