33806288|t|TRAIL Mediates Neuronal Death in AUD: A Link between Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration.
33806288|a|Although the cause of progressive neurodegeneration is often unclear, neuronal death can occur through several mechanisms. In conditions such as Alzheimer's or alcohol use disorder (AUD), Toll-like receptor (TLR) induction is observed with neurodegeneration. However, links between TLR activation and neurodegeneration are lacking. We report a role of apoptotic neuronal death in AUD through TLR7-mediated induction of death receptor signaling. In postmortem human cortex, a two-fold increase in apoptotic terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining in neurons was found in AUD versus controls. This occurred with the increased expression of TLR7 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) death receptors. Binge ethanol treatment in C57BL/6 mice increased TLR7 and induced neuronal apoptosis in cortical regions that was blocked by TLR7 antagonism. Mechanistic studies in primary organotypic brain slice culture (OBSC) found that the inhibition of TLR7 and its endogenous ligand let-7b blocked ethanol-induced neuronal cell death. Both IMQ and ethanol induced the expression of TRAIL and its death receptor. In addition, TRAIL-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies blocked both imiquimod (IMQ) and ethanol induced neuronal death. These findings implicate TRAIL as a mediator of neuronal apoptosis downstream of TLR7 activation. TLR7 and neuronal apoptosis are implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, TRAIL may represent a therapeutic target to slow neurodegeneration in multiple diseases.
