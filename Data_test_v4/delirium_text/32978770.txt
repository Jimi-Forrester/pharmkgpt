32978770|t|[Experience of Implementing ABCDEF Bundle Care to Reduce Delirium in a Traumatic Brain Injury Patient].
32978770|a|Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have a high incidence rate of delirium, which leads to poor prognoses. This case study describes a nursing experience of implementing ABCDEF bundle care to reduce delirium in a patient with TBI. The period of nursing care was April 23 to April 30, 2019. A comprehensive assessment of this patient's physical, psychological, familial, social, and spiritual dimensions was conducted via consultation, observation, and physical assessment. The assessment results showed that the patient suffered from acute delirium and cerebral perfusion impairment. In addition, the results showed that the patient's wife suffered from caregiver role strain that was further exacerbated by family difficulties. Multiple, individualized patient-tailored nursing interventions were developed under ABCDEF bundle care to alleviate delirium during the period of nursing care. These interventions included spontaneous awakening trials, spontaneous breathing trials, coordination, delirium assessment, early mobilization, and family engagement. Furthermore, family involvement and interprofessional cooperation with social workers were conducted concurrently to alleviate economic and care burdens and mitigate caregiver role strain in the patient's wife. It is hoped that this nursing care experience helps promote increased attention towards delirium, helps improve early detection of delirium in patients with TBI, and promotes the provision of individualized bundle care that draws on different perspectives in order to achieve holistic health care.
