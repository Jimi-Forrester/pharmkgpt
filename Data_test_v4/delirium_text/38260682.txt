38260682|t|Neuromark PET: A multivariate method for Estimating and comparing whole brain functional networks and connectomes from fMRI and PET data.
38260682|a|Positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are both widely used neuroimaging techniques to study brain function. Although whole brain resting functional MRI (fMRI) connectomes are widely used, the integration or association of whole brain functional connectomes with PET data are rarely done. This likely stems from the fact that PET data is typically analyzed by using a regions of interest approach, while whole brain spatial networks and their connectivity (covariation) receive much less attention. As a result, to date, there have been no direct comparisons between whole brain PET and fMRI connectomes. In this study, we present a method that uses spatially constrained independent component analysis (scICA) to estimate corresponding PET and fMRI connectomes and examine the relationship between them using mild cognitive impairment (MCI) datasets. Our results demonstrate highly modularized PET connectome patterns that complement those identified from resting fMRI. In particular, fMRI showed strong intra-domain connectivity with interdomain anticorrelation in sensorimotor and visual domains as well as default mode network. PET amyloid data showed similar strong intra-domain effects, but showed much higher correlations within cognitive control and default mode domains, as well as anticorrelation between cerebellum and other domains. The estimated PET networks have similar, but not identical, network spatial patterns to the resting fMRI networks, with the PET networks being slightly smoother and, in some cases, showing variations in subnodes. We also analyzed the differences between individuals with MCI receiving medication versus a placebo. Results show both common and modality specific treatment effects on fMRI and PET connectomes. From our fMRI analysis, we observed higher activation differences in various regions, such as the connection between the thalamus and middle occipital gyrus, as well as the insula and right middle occipital gyrus. Meanwhile, the PET analysis revealed increased activation between the anterior cingulate cortex and the left inferior parietal lobe, along with other regions, in individuals who received medication versus placebo. In sum, our novel approach identifies corresponding whole-brain PET and fMRI networks and connectomes. While we observed common patterns of network connectivity, our analysis of the MCI treatment and placebo groups revealed that each modality identifies a unique set of networks, highlighting differences between the two groups.
