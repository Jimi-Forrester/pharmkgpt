34576830|t|Behavioral and Neurochemical Shifts at the Hippocampus and Frontal Cortex Are Associated to Peripheral Inflammation in Balb/c Mice Infected with Brucella abortus 2308.
34576830|a|Brucellosis is a zoonosis affecting 50,000,000 people annually. Most patients progress to a chronic phase of the disease in which neuropsychiatric symptoms upsurge. The biological processes underlying the progression of these symptoms are yet unclear. Peripheral inflammation mounted against Brucella may condition neurochemical shifts and hence unchained neuropsychiatric disorders. Our work aimed at establishing whether neurological, behavioral, and neurochemical disarrays are circumstantially linked to peripheral inflammation uprise secondary to Brucella abortus 2308 infections. We then evaluated, in control and Brucella-infected mice, skeletal muscle strength, movement coordination, and balance and motivation, as well as dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin availability in the cerebellum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus. Serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines and corticosterone in vehicle-injected and -infected mice were also estimated. All estimates were gathered at the infection acute and chronic phases. Our results showed that infected mice displayed motor disabilities, muscular weakness, and reduced motivation correlated with neurochemical and peripheral immunological disturbances that tended to decrease after 21 days of infection. The present observations support that disturbed peripheral inflammation and the related neurochemical disruption might lead to mood disorders in infected mice. Future experiments must be aimed at establishing causal links and to explore whether similar concepts might explain neurological and mood disorders in humans affected by brucellosis.
