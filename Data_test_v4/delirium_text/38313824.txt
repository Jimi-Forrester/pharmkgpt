38313824|a|Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have a high specific surface area, adjustable pores and can be used to obtain functional porous materials with diverse and well-ordered structures through coordination and self-assembly, which has intrigued wide interest in a broad range of disciplines. In the arena of biomedical engineering, the functionalized modification of MOFs has produced drug carriers with excellent dispersion and functionalities such as target delivery and response release, with promising applications in bio-detection, disease therapy, tissue healing, and other areas. This review summarizes the present state of research on the functionalization of MOFs by physical binding or chemical cross-linking of small molecules, polymers, biomacromolecules, and hydrogels and evaluates the role and approach of MOFs functionalization in boosting the reactivity of materials. On this basis, research on the application of functionalized MOFs composites in biomedical engineering fields such as drug delivery, tissue repair, disease treatment, bio-detection and imaging is surveyed, and the development trend and application prospects of functionalized MOFs as an important new class of biomedical materials in the biomedical field are anticipated, which may provide some inspiration and reference for further development of MOF for bio-medical applications.
