1754628|t|A longitudinal study of cerebrospinal fluid acetylcholinesterase in delirium: changes at the acute stage and at one-year followup.
1754628|a|Cerebrospinal fluid acetylcholinesterase (CSF AChE) was determined for elderly delirious patients during the acute stage and after a 1-year followup, and the AChE levels were compared with those of age-equivalent controls. At the acute phase, the AChE levels of the delirious patients were in the same range as those of the control group, but during the followup, a slight declining trend was observed. These results do not unambiguously support the previously suggested role of cholinergic dysfunction in the pathogenesis of acute delirium, although the augmented striatal release of AChE in hyperkinetic and mixed delirium may mask the involvement of cholinergic neurons.
