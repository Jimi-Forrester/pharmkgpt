38157587|a|Previous studies have demonstrated resilience to AD-related neuropathology in a form of cognitive reserve (CR). In this study we investigated a relationship between CR and hypometabolic subtypes of AD, specifically the typical and the limbic-predominant subtypes. We analyzed data from 59 Abeta-positive cognitively normal (CN), 221 prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 174 AD dementia participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) from ADNI and ADNIGO/2 phases. For replication, we analyzed data from 5 Abeta-positive CN, 89 prodromal AD and 43 AD dementia participants from ADNI3. CR was estimated as standardized residuals in a model predicting cognition from temporoparietal grey matter volumes and covariates. Higher CR estimates predicted slower cognitive decline. Typical and limbic-predominant hypometabolic subtypes demonstrated similar baseline CR, but the results suggested a faster decline of CR in the typical subtype. These findings support the relationship between subtypes and CR, specifically longitudinal trajectories of CR. Results also underline the importance of longitudinal analyses in research on CR.
