35469242|a|Introduction: Postoperative delirium (POD) is one of the prevalent and potentially fatal clinical conditions, leading to high disability and mortality in older patients, as well as increased duration of hospital stay and more hospitalization expenses. There were no effective drugs in the clinical management of POD, and an absence of evidence-based medicine concerning the treatment of POD. Materials and Methods: The present study explored whether atorvastatin (Ato) can decrease the occurrence rate of POD. The present research included patients over the age of 60 who were hospitalized to critical care units (ICUs) following surgery for malignant tumors. Patients received Ato (40mg/day) or placebos utilizing a computer-based random sequencing (in a 1:1 ratio). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of delirium within the first seven days following surgery. Results: A total of 230 individuals were classified into two groups, namely the placebo group (n=123) and the Ato group (n=107). Patients belonging to two groups had similar baseline clinical data, and there were no statistically significant differences between them. The occurrence of delirium in the Ato group was remarkably reduced unlike the case in the placebo group. 30-day all-cause mortality did not vary significantly between the two groups. Pulmonary infection and Bedsore were significantly decreased in the Ato group than the placebo group, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in rhabdomyolysis and abnormal liver enzymes. In terms of medication responses, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. Ato patients had remarkably shortened hospital stays and spent remarkably less on hospitalization expenditures in comparison with those in the placebo group. Conclusion: The findings from the present research indicated that Ato can decrease the occurrence of delirium following surgical operation of malignant tumors among elderly patients, it also can reduce the duration of hospitalization, hospital cost, and post-surgical complications, but not improve 30-day all-cause mortality.
