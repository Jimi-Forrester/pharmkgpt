33458508|t|Optimization of Surfactant- and Cosurfactant-Aided Pine Oil Nanoemulsions by Isothermal Low-Energy Methods for Anticholinesterase Activity.
33458508|a|Highly stable pine oil-loaded nanoemulsions were evaluated for nutraceutical and storage stability applications. Pine oil-loaded nanoemulsion preparation was done with pine oil as the oily phase and additionally with different ratios of the non-ionic surfactant (Tween 80) and cosurfactant (ethanol) in an aqueous solution using the isothermal low-energy or spontaneous emulsification method. A transparent and stable nanoemulsion was obtained with a combination of pine oil (5 wt %), surfactant mixture (35 wt %), and water quantity sufficient (qs) by the isothermal low-energy method. The mean droplet size and zeta-potential of the fabricated nanoemulsion were  14 nm and -3.4 mV, respectively. The size of the transparent nanoemulsion increased to ~45 nm and showed turbidity at 60  C. Microrheological investigation highlighted the gel-sol-gel conversion in the presence of applied angular frequency at 25  C. The loss modulus shifted to lower frequency at 60  C in comparison to other temperatures. The anticholinesterase (AChE) inhibition activity of the pine oil-loaded nanoemulsion suggested a possible therapeutic value, and at 0.10% concentration of the nanoemulsion, the AChE inhibition activity was  95.72 +- 5.59%. These studies have important implications in fabrication and optimization of a nanoemulsion as a delivery system for combating reminiscence in Alzheimer's disease and application in the nutraceutical-based industry. This isothermal low-energy method offers an advantage of preparing an edible oil delivery system using simple and rapid operational parameters.
