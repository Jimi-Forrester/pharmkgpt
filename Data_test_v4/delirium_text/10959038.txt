10959038|a|Estrogen deprivation has been implicated as a risk factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as epidemiological data suggests that estrogen replacement therapy can protect against the onset, and progression of the disease. Biochemical data suggests that estrogen exerts its affect through the processing of the amyloid precursor protein to beta-amyloid which is deposited in the brains of patients with AD. The effects of estrogens may be more widespread, however, as it has been implicated in the maintenance of neuronal architecture and protection from free radicals. This review aims to discuss the various roles of estrogen in the development of AD.
