33424980|t|Gene Profiles in the Early Stage of Neuronal Differentiation of Mouse Bone Marrow Stromal Cells Induced by Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor.
33424980|a|A stably established population of mouse bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) with self-renewal and multilineage differentiation potential was expanded in vitro for more than 50 passages. These cells express high levels of mesenchymal stem cell markers and can be differentiated into adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic lineages in vitro. Subjected to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) treatment, a typical neuronal phenotype was induced in these cells, as supported by neuronal morphology, induction of neuronal markers, and relevant electrophysiological excitability. To identify the genes regulating neuronal differentiation, cDNA microarray analysis was conducted using mRNAs isolated from cells differentiated for different time periods (0, 4, 24, and 72 h) after bFGF treatment. Various expression patterns of neuronal genes were stimulated by bFGF. These gene profiles were shown to be involved in developmental, functional, and structural integration of the nervous system. The expression of representative genes stimulated by bFGF in each group was verified by RT-PCR. Amongst proneural genes, the mammalian achate-schute homolog 1 (Mash-1), a basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional factor, was further demonstrated to be significantly upregulated. Overexpression of Mash-1 in mouse BMSCs was shown to induce the expression of neuronal specific enolase (NSE) and terminal neuronal morphology, suggesting that Mash-1 plays an important role in the induction of neuronal differentiation of mouse BMSCs.
