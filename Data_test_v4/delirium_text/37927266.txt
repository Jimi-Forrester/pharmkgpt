37927266|t|Tackling Dementia Together via The Australian Dementia Network (ADNeT): A Summary of Initiatives, Progress and Plans.
37927266|a| In 2018, the Australian Dementia Network (ADNeT) was established to bring together Australia's leading dementia researchers, people with living experience and clinicians to transform research and clinical care in the field. To address dementia diagnosis, treatment, and care, ADNeT has established three core initiatives: the Clinical Quality Registry (CQR), Memory Clinics, and Screening for Trials. Collectively, the initiatives have developed an integrated clinical and research community, driving practice excellence in this field, leading to novel innovations in diagnostics, clinical care, professional development, quality and harmonization of healthcare, clinical trials, and translation of research into practice. Australia now has a national Registry for Mild Cognitive Impairment and dementia with 55 participating clinical sites, an extensive map of memory clinic services, national Memory and Cognition Clinic Guidelines and specialized screening for trials sites in five states. This paper provides an overview of ADNeT's achievements to date and future directions. With the increase in dementia cases expected over coming decades, and with recent advances in plasma biomarkers and amyloid lowering therapies, the nationally coordinated initiatives and partnerships ADNeT has established are critical for increased national prevention efforts, co-ordinated implementation of emerging treatments for Alzheimer's disease, innovation of early and accurate diagnosis, driving continuous improvements in clinical care and patient outcome and access to post-diagnostic support and clinical trials. For a heterogenous disorder such as dementia, which is now the second leading cause of death in Australia following cardiovascular disease, the case for adequate investment into research and development has grown even more compelling.
