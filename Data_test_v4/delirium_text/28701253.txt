28701253|t|A Brief Review of Three Common Supplements Used in Alzheimer's Disease.
28701253|a|Individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their caregivers are using supplements in an effort to halt the progression of the disease. Individuals at risk for or fearing Alzheimer's may use these supplements to try to prevent the disease. Senior care pharmacists are accessible and uniquely qualified to answer questions, make recommendations, and attempt to make drug therapy safe and effective for these individuals. With this in mind, it is important to know the data supporting (or not supporting) common supplements marketed toward those with AD. A review of efficacy and safety data, drug interactions, as well as the mechanism of action believed to benefit those with AD of three common supplements (Prevagen, Cerefolin NAC, and the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid DHA), are highlighted.
