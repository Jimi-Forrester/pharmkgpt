34214098|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of duloxetine as an alternative to opioid treatment for postoperative pain management following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: Among 944 patients, 290 (30.7%) of patients received opioid or duloxetine for pain control for 6 weeks when the pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score was greater than 4 out of 10 at the time of discharge. 121 patients in the Opioid group and 118 in the Duloxetine group were followed up for more than one year. Preoperative and postoperative patient reported outcome measures (pain VAS score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA Index (WOMAC) score were compared. The rate of further drug prescription (opioid or duloxetine) after 6 weeks of first prescription, 30-day readmission rate, and side effects were also investigated. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in pain VAS score, WOMAC Pain and Function score, at each time point between before and after surgery (all p>0.05). Fifteen (9.8%) patients in the opioid group and six (4.4%) patients in the duloxetine group were prescribed additional medication after first 6 weeks, showing no significant (p>0.05) difference in proportion. The 30-day readmission rate and the incidence of side effects were also similar (all p>0.05). There was no difference in the incidence of side effects between the two groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Duloxetine and opioid did not show any difference in pain control, function, and side effects for up to one year after TKA. Although large-scale randomized controlled trials are still required to further confirm the side effects of duloxetine, it can be considered as an alternative to opioid for postoperative pain control following TKA.
