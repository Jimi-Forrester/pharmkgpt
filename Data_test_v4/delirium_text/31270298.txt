31270298|t|Preoperative Smoking Cessation Period Is Not Related to Postoperative Respiratory Complications in Patients Undergoing Lung Cancer Surgery.
31270298|a|PURPOSE: Smoking is reported to be a risk factor for postoperative complications. However, there is no consensus regarding the length of time for which patients need to give up smoking. Therefore, we examined the relationship between preoperative smoking status and postoperative complications in patients who underwent lobectomy for treatment of lung cancer. METHODS: Between January 2009 and December 2014, 1380 patients underwent lobectomy for lung cancer at our institution. After excluding patients who had undergone induction therapy, 1248 patients were enrolled in this study. We examined the relationship between postoperative complications and preoperative smoking habitation. RESULTS: Among the enrolled patients, 1210 (97%) underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy and 38 (3%) underwent lobectomy via open thoracotomy. The incidence of postoperative complications was higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, and the frequency of respiratory-related complications increased along with the number of pack-years. However, there was no relationship between the length of the preoperative smoking cessation period and the frequency of postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: The risk of postoperative complications does not increase even if smoking is continued within 2 weeks before surgery. It seems unnecessary to delay the timing of surgery to allow patients to cease smoking, especially those scheduled for thoracoscopic surgery.
