26257416|t|Comparison of ketorolac and low-dose ketamine in preventing tourniquet-induced increase in arterial pressure.
26257416|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Application of tourniquet during orthopaedic procedures causes pain and increase in blood pressure despite adequate anaesthesia and analgesia. In this study, we compared ketorolac with ketamine in patients undergoing elective lower limb surgery with tourniquet in order to discover if ketorolac was equally effective or better than ketamine in preventing tourniquet-induced hypertension. METHODS: Approval was granted by the Institutional Ethics Review Committee and informed consent was obtained from all participants. A randomised double-blinded controlled trial with 38 patients each in the ketamine and ketorolac groups undergoing elective knee surgery for anterior cruciate ligament repair or reconstruction was conducted. Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia were standardised in all patients, and the minimum alveolar concentration of isoflurane was maintained at 1.2 throughout the study period. One group received ketamine in a dose of 0.25 mg/kg and the other group received 30 mg ketorolac 10 min before tourniquet inflation. Blood pressure was recorded before induction of anaesthesia (baseline) and at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min after tourniquet inflation. RESULTS: The demographic and anaesthetic characteristics were similar in the two groups. At 0 and 10 min, tourniquet-induced rise in blood pressure was not observed in both groups. From 20 min onward, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly higher in ketorolac group compared to ketamine group. CONCLUSION: We conclude that ketamine is superior to ketorolac in preventing tourniquet-induced increases in blood pressure.
