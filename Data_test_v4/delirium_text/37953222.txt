37953222|a|Dementia is one of the leading causes of death in the US. Approximately, 6 million elderly people in the US had dementia in 2020. Advanced dementia is complicated by multiple problems that can lead to distress in both the patient and their caregivers. With the increase in aging population, physicians will be expected to take care of patients with dementia. Palliative and hospice care can play an important part in helping to alleviate physical symptoms as well as address non-medical/spiritual needs. In this review article, we highlight the patient-centered approach to treat symptoms and patient's needs to improve their quality of life. We discuss the most important and persistent challenges in advanced dementia with the aim to provide excellent care at the end-of-life and caregiver experience. Data were identified by using PubMed, EBSCO, and Google Scholar databases (January 1980 to present) using the following search terms: dementia, palliative care, advanced dementia, and hospice care. The search was repeated using geriatrics, end-oflife, decision making, advanced care, capacity evaluation, nutrition, infections, pain management, dyspnea, delirium, de-prescribing, and spiritual care. Additional review of literature was undertaken using relevant references of identified articles. There are many missed opportunities to improve care in this vulnerable patient population that when addressed can lead to peaceful and dignified death.
