16120299|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction causes dozens of debilitating diseases, and is implicated in the etiology of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases, among others. However, development of mitochondrially targeted therapeutic agents has been impeded by the lack of high-throughput screening techniques that are capable of distinguishing in intact cells the mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsi(m)) from the plasma membrane potential, (deltapsi(p)). We report here a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay that specifically monitors deltapsi(m) that is not confounded by background signal arising from potentiometric dye responding to deltapsi(p). The technique relies on energy transfer between nonyl acridine orange (NAO), which stains diphosphatidyl glycerol (cardiolipin) that is indigenous to the inner mitochondrial membrane, and tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMR), a potentiometric dye that is sequestered by mitochondria as a Nernstian function of deltapsi(m) and concentration. FRET occurs only when both dyes co-localize to the mitochondria, and results in quenching of NAO emission by TMR in proportion to deltapsi(m). Validation studies using compounds with well-characterized mitochondrial effects, including oligomycin, CCCP+, bongkrekic acid, cyclosporin A, nigericin, ADP, and ruthenium red, demonstrate that the FRET-based deltapsi(m) assay responds in accord with the known pharmacology. Validation studies assessing the suitability of the technique for high-throughput compound screening indicate that the assay provides a sensitive and robust assessment not only of mitochondrial integrity in situ, but also, when used in conjunction with agents such as cyclosporin A, an indicator of permeability transition.
