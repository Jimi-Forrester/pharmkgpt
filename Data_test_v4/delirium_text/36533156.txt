36533156|t|Diagnosis and management of Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies: recommendations of the Scientific Department of Cognitive Neurology and Aging of the Brazilian Academy of Neurology.
36533156|a|Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) represent the second most common type of degenerative dementia in patients aged 65 years and older, leading to progressive cognitive dysfunction and impaired quality of life. This study aims to provide a consensus based on a systematic Brazilian literature review and a comprehensive international review concerning PDD and DLB. Moreover, we sought to report on and give recommendations about the best diagnostic approaches focusing on primary and secondary care. Based on the available data, we recommend clinicians to apply at least one brief global cognitive instrument to assess PDD, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination and preferably the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised. Validated instruments to accurately assess functional abilities in Brazilian PD patients are still incipient. Further studies should focus on biomarkers with Brazilian cohorts.
