37577501|t|Molecular modeling of apoE in complexes with Alzheimer's amyloid-beta fibrils from human brain suggests a structural basis for apolipoprotein co-deposition with amyloids.
37577501|a|Apolipoproteins co-deposit with amyloids, yet apolipoprotein-amyloid interactions are enigmatic. To understand how apoE interacts with Alzheimer's amyloid- beta (A beta ) peptide in fibrillary deposits, the NMR structure of full-length human apoE was docked to four structures of patient-derived A beta 1-40 and A beta 1-42 fibrils determined previously using cryo-electron microscopy or solid-state NMR. Similar docking was done using the NMR structure of human apoC-III. In all complexes, conformational changes in apolipoproteins were required to expose large hydrophobic faces of their amphipathic alpha -helices for sub-stoichiometric binding to hydrophobic surfaces on sides or ends of fibrils. Basic residues flanking the hydrophobic helical faces in apolipoproteins interacted favorably with acidic residue ladders in some amyloid polymorphs. Molecular dynamics simulations of selected apoE-fibril complexes confirmed their stability. Amyloid binding via cryptic sites, which became available upon opening of flexibly linked apolipoprotein alpha -helices, resembled apolipoprotein-lipid binding. This mechanism probably extends to other apolipoprotein-amyloid interactions. Apolipoprotein binding alongside fibrils could interfere with fibril fragmentation and secondary nucleation, while binding at the fibril ends could halt amyloid elongation and dissolution in a polymorph-specific manner. The proposed mechanism is supported by extensive prior experimental evidence and helps reconcile disparate reports on apoE's role in A beta aggregation. Furthermore, apoE domain opening and direct interaction of Arg/Cys158 with amyloid potentially contributes to isoform-specific effects in Alzheimer's disease. In summary, current modeling supported by prior experimental studies suggests similar mechanisms for apolipoprotein-amyloid and apolipoprotein-lipid interactions; explains why apolipoproteins co-deposit with amyloids; and helps reconcile conflicting reports on the chaperone-like apoE action in A beta aggregation.
