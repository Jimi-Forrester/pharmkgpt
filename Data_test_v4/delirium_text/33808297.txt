33808297|t|Preoperative Cognitive Impairment as a Predictor of Postoperative Outcomes in Elderly Patients Undergoing Spinal Surgery for Degenerative Spinal Disease.
33808297|a|Cognitive status has been reported to affect the peri-operative and post-operative outcomes of certain surgical procedures. This prospective study investigated the effect of preoperative cognitive impairment on the postoperative course of elderly patients (n = 122, >65 years), following spine surgery for degenerative spinal disease. Data on demographic characteristics, medical history, and blood analysis results were collected. Preoperative cognition was assessed using the mini-mental state examination, and patients were divided into three groups: normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment. Discharge destinations (p = 0.014) and postoperative cardiopulmonary complications (p = 0.037) significantly differed based on the cognitive status. Operation time (p = 0.049), white blood cell count (p = 0.022), platelet count (p = 0.013), the mini-mental state examination score (p = 0.033), and the Beck Depression Inventory score (p = 0.041) were significantly associated with the length of hospital stay. Our investigation demonstrated that improved understanding of preoperative cognitive status may be helpful in surgical decision-making and postoperative care of elderly patients with degenerative spinal disease.
