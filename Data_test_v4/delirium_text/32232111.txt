32232111|a|Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial chronic inflammatory disease that underlies myocardial infarction and stroke. Efficacious treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypertension has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular disease. However, atherosclerosis still confers a considerable risk of adverse cardiovascular events. In the current mechanistic understanding of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, inflammation is pivotal both in disease development and progression. Recent clinical data provided support for this notion and treatment targeting inflammation is currently being explored. Interestingly, neural reflexes regulate cytokine production and inflammation. Hence, new technology utilizing implantable devices to deliver electrical impulses to activate neural circuits are currently being investigated in treatment of inflammation. Hopefully, it may become possible to target vascular inflammation in cardiovascular disease using bioelectronic medicine. In this review, we discuss neural control of inflammation and the potential implications of new therapeutic strategies to treat cardiovascular disease.
