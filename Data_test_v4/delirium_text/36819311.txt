36819311|a|Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychological disturbance resulting from exposure to a traumatic experience that lasts more than one month. PTSD in the United States has a lifetime prevalence of 3.4% to 26.9% in civilians and 7.7% to 17.0% in military veterans. Emergence agitation (EA) and emergence delirium (ED) are known phenomena in the postanesthetic period. PTSD is closely associated with EA following anesthesia. In addition, EA in patients with PTSD can be severe and challenging to manage. EA is a risk to both patients and healthcare workers. Furthermore, EA has been shown to increase the overall risk of postoperative delirium and complications. Currently, studies on the anesthetic management of patients with PTSD are scarce and limited to case reports. Here, we present a summary of several important published case reports and a brief review of the literature regarding the anesthetic management of PTSD and EA to aid in managing patients with PTSD. In addition, we present two cases of successful EA prevention in patients with severe PTSD. From our review of the literature and the successful prevention of EA in our patients with severe PTSD, we conclude that there is an increased need for overall awareness among anesthesia and perioperative care providers of the effect of PTSD on EA. Anesthesia providers should aim to include as many management recommendations as possible and avoid possible triggers of EA via a multidisciplinary approach. Multiple pharmacological agents have been used for the anesthetic management of PTSD with varying results. Of the agents studied, dexmedetomidine has been found to be the most consistently beneficial.
