32631254|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence-based practice in geriatric oncology is growing, and national initiatives have focused on expanding cancer care and research to improve health outcomes for older adults. However, there are still gaps between knowledge and practice for older adults with cancer. MAIN TEXT: Here we provide a detailed methodology of geriatric oncology care delivery within a single institution. The Cancer and Aging Resiliency (CARE) clinic is a multidisciplinary approach for implementing geriatric-driven health care for older adults with cancer. The CARE clinic was developed as a direct response to recommendations targeting key multifactorial geriatric health conditions (e.g. falls, nutritional deficits, sensory loss, cognitive impairment, frailty, multiple chronic conditions, and functional status). The multidisciplinary team assesses and delivers a comprehensive set of recommendations, all in one clinic visit, to minimize burden on the patient and the caregiver. The CARE clinic consultative model is a novel approach integrating cancer subspecialties with geriatric oncology healthcare delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with cancer have unique needs that are independent of routine oncology care. The CARE clinic model provides specific assessments and interventions to improve health outcomes among older adults with cancer.
