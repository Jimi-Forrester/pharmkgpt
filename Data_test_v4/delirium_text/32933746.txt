32933746|a|BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that postoperative delirium is associated with diminished recovery toward baseline preoperative ambulation levels one-month postoperatively. METHODS: Patients included were >=60 years old undergoing inpatient operations. Ambulation was measured as steps/day using an accelerometer worn for >=3-days preoperatively and >=28-days postoperatively. Primary outcome was the percent recovery of preoperative steps. RESULTS: 109 patients were included; 17 (16%) developed postoperative delirium. Recovery of ambulation toward preoperative baseline at postoperative day-28 was decreased in delirium group (34% vs. 69%; p < 0.01). Immediate postoperative ambulation was similar in the delirium vs. no-delirium groups (p = 0.79). Delirium occurred on average on postoperative 3 +- 4 days. Subsequently, ambulation was decreased in the delirium group compared to non-delirium group at postoperative week-1 (p = 0.01), week-2 (p = 0.02), week-3 (p < 0.01) and week-4 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing inpatient operations who develop delirium recover only one-third of their baseline steps one-month postoperatively. Postoperative delirium results in a decreased recovery towards baseline ambulation for at least 4-weeks following major operations in comparison to non-delirious patients. The decrease in ambulation in the delirium versus no-delirium groups occurred after the occurrence of postoperative delirium.
