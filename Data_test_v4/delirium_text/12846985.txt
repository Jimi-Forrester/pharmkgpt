12846985|a|The nosological relationship between Parkinson's disease, dementing syndromes with Lewy bodies, and Alzheimer's disease has been the subject of continuing debate. Here I argue, on the basis of recent data from families with hereditary versions of these diseases and from transgenic modeling, that these nosological debates are inevitable, impossible to resolve, and a product of the fact that we define diseases as entities rather than processes.
