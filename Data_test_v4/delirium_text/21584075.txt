21584075|a|The study aims to find out the sociodemographic profile of HIV-seropositive defence personnel and type of psychiatric morbidity in them. 172 HIV-seropositive subjects in CDC stage II, III and IV were compared with 40-seronegative controls. Driver trade was found to be more susceptible because of high mobility facilitating access to red light areas. Heterosexual promiscuous activity was found to be predominant mode of HIV-infection transmission (92.44%). In 72.09% cases HIV-infection was a chance detection which signifies that if an epidemiological survey is conducted many more cases will come to light. Overall psychiatric morbidity was found in 50% of study groups compared to 10% in controls.Break-up of diagnostic categories as per ICD-10 criteria were depressive episode 22.9%, anxiety disorder 9.86%, alcohol dependence syndrome 6.39%, delirium 1.16% and cognitive impairment 10.47%. The study highlights that HIV-epidemic and its associated psychiatric morbidity is largely a behavioural problem. Hence it calls for an active participation of mental health professionals to counteract the challenge posed by it.
