36836542|t|OCT Findings in Patients with Methamphetamine Use Disorder.
36836542|a|PURPOSE: In the present study, the purpose was to examine the results of optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements in patients diagnosed with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) by comparing them with healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 114 eyes were evaluated in this study (27 patients and 30 control group participants). After detailed biomicroscopic examinations of all participants by the same ophthalmologist, both eyes were evaluated by OCT. The retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) and macular thickness were calculated from OCT. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were detected between the demographic data of the patient and control groups (p > 0.05). When OCT findings were evaluated, macular thickness and volume were not different between the groups (p > 0.05). With respect to RNFL, the left eye superior, inferior, temporal, and nasal quadrants, as well as the left eye's total measurements were found to be thicker than those of controls (p < 0.05). In both eyes, the left eye nasal quadrant and APIS total score were negatively correlated, the total RNLF measurement of the right eye and APIS motivation subscale score were negatively correlated, central macular thickness and the APIS motivation subscale score were positively correlated, and the APIS substance use characteristics subscale score and left eye temporal quadrant RNLF measurement were positively correlated. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to evaluate addiction severity and OCT findings in MUD. However, this study needs to be supported by further studies so that OCT findings, which can be used as an effective method for demonstrating possible neurodegeneration in methamphetamine use disorder, gain importance.
