37280418|t|Comparison between original SARS-CoV-2 strain and omicron variant on thin-section chest CT imaging of COVID-19 pneumonia.
37280418|a|OBJECTIVES: We investigated different computed tomography (CT) features between Omicron-variant and original-strain SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia to facilitate the clinical management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed to select patients with original-strain SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia from February 22 to April 22, 2020, or Omicron-variant SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia from March 26 to May 31, 2022. Data on the demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, clinical types, and CT features were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: There were 62 and 78 patients with original-strain or Omicron-variant SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, respectively. There were no differences between the two groups in terms of age, sex, clinical types, symptoms, and comorbidities. The main CT features differed between the two groups (p = 0.003). There were 37 (59.7%) and 20 (25.6%) patients with ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the original-strain and Omicron-variant pneumonia, respectively. A consolidation pattern was more frequently observed in the Omicron-variant than original-strain pneumonia (62.8% vs. 24.2%). There was no difference in crazy-paving pattern between the original-strain and Omicron-variant pneumonia (16.1% vs. 11.6%). Pleural effusion was observed more often in Omicron-variant pneumonia, while subpleural lesions were more common in the original-strain pneumonia. The CT score in the Omicron-variant group was higher than that in the original-strain group for critical-type (17.00, 16.00-18.00 vs. 16.00, 14.00-17.00, p = 0.031) and for severe-type (13.00, 12.00-14.00 vs 12.00, 10.75-13.00, p = 0.027) pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The main CT finding of the Omicron-variant SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia included consolidations and pleural effusion. By contrast, CT findings of original-strain SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia showed frequent GGO and subpleural lesions, but without pleural effusion. The CT scores were also higher in the critical and severe types of Omicron-variant than original-strain pneumonia.
