RECENT FINDINGS: MPI is a tracer method that is currently in the preclinical development stage. It provides high sensitivity for the detection and localization of magnetic nanoparticles with very high spatial and temporal resolution and a similar application spectrum as PET. Unlike MRI, the MPI signal is not contaminated by background signal from tissues and is highly quantifiable in terms of local tracer concentrations. These properties make the technology ideally suited for localization of specific targets or quantification of vascular parameters. MPI uses magnetic nanoparticles which can be modified by various coatings, and by adding ligands (i.e. peptides or antibodies) for specific targeting. This makes MPI an attractive tool for the potential detection of abnormal protein deposits, such as Abeta plaques, with greater specificity than MRI. Neural stem cells can also be labelled with these nanoparticles ex vivo to monitor their migration in vivo. SUMMARY: The capabilities of MPI opens the potential for several applications of MPI in neurocognitive disorders, including vascular imaging, detection of amyloid plaques and potentially other pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and stem-cell tracking.
