36221397|a|BACKGROUND: Gunao-Yizhi decoction has the effects of supplementing intelligence, strengthening marrow, resolving phlegm, and reducing turbidity. It is clinically used for the treatment of vascular dementia (VaD). However, there is still a lack of systematic evaluation of its efficacy and safety. This review conducted a systematic review of the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of Gunao-Yizhi decoction combined with donepezil for VaD. METHODS: China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang database (Wanfang), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), China Biology Medicine disc (CBM), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials on Gunao-Yizhi decoction combined with donepezil for VaD. RevMan 5.3 software was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Twelve studies were obtained, including 1036 patients. Compared with donepezil alone, meta-analysis showed that Gunao-Yizhi decoction combined with donepezil could improve clinical efficacy, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, Hasegawa dementia scale (HDS), increase the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in serum, and reduce the level of malonaldehyde dismutas (MDA) in serum. The GRADE system was adopted to evaluate the outcome index. Clinical efficiency and the MMSE score were evaluated as very-low-quality evidence. HDS score, serum SOD level, and serum MDA level were evaluated as low-quality evidence. CONCLUSION: Gunao-Yizhi decoction combined with donepezil has a significant prevalence in the treatment of vascular dementia, with no increase in adverse events. Gunao-Yizhi decoction can be recommended for routine use in the treatment of VaD.
