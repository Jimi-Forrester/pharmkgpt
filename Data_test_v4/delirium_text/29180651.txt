29180651|t|Bidirectional Electron-Transfer in Polypeptides with Various Secondary Structures.
29180651|a|The protein-mediated bidirectional electron transfer (ET) is the foundation of protein molecular wire, and plays an important role in the rapid detection of oxo-guanine-adenine DNA mismatches by MutY glycosylase. However, the influences of structural transitions on bidirectional ET are still not clear. In this work, the modified through-bond coupling (MTBC) model was further refined to correlate the structural transition and ET rate more quantitatively. With this model, various polyglycine structures (310-helix, alpha-helix, beta-sheets, linear, polyproline helical I and II) were studied to explore the influences of structural transitions on bidirectional ET. It was found that the HOMO-LUMO gaps (DeltaE) in CN (from the carboxyl to amino terminus) direction are much lower than that in opposite direction, except for polypro I. However, with the equal tunneling energy, the differences between bidirectional ET rates are slight for all structures. In structural transitions, we found that the ET rates are not only affected by the Ramachandran angles, but also correlated to the alignment of C = O vectors, the alignment of peptide planes and the rearrangement of other structure factors. The detailed information can be used to rationalize the inhomogeneous ET across different protein structures and design more efficient protein molecular wires.
