36685230|t|Saliva based diagnostic methodologies for a fast track detection of autism spectrum disorder: A mini-review.
36685230|a|Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is considered a complicated neurodevelopment disorder with rising prevalence globally. ASD is characterized by a series of events including varying degrees of defects in communication, learning, and social interaction which is accompanied by stereotypical behavioral patterns. Despite extensive research, the current diagnosis for ASD is complex and almost solely based on the behavioral assessments of the suspected individuals. The multifactorial etiopathology of this disease along with the diversity of symptoms among different individuals adds to the current intricacies for accurate prognosis of ASD. Hence, there exists a dire need for biologically relevant biomarkers for an early diagnosis and for tracking the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Until recently, among various biofluids, saliva has gained increasing interest for biomarker identification, the advantages include the non-invasive nature and ease of sample handling. This mini-review aims to provide a succinct summary of recent literature on saliva-based diagnostic modalities for ASD, examine various studies that highlight the potential use of proteomic and/or RNA-based biomarkers. Finally, some conclusive perspectives of using the salivary system for ASD mechanistic details and diagnosis are also discussed.
