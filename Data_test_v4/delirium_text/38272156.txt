38272156|a|A strong relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dysfunction has been the focus of increasing attention in aging societies. In the present study, we examined the long-term effect of scallop-derived plasmalogen (sPlas) on vascular remodeling-related proteins in the brain of an AD with cerebral hypoperfusion (HP) mouse model. We demonstrated, for the first time, that cerebral HP activated the axis of the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE)/phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3)/provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1)/nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1), accounting for such cerebral vascular remodeling. Moreover, we also found that cerebral HP accelerated pSTAT3-mediated astrogliosis and activation of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, probably leading to cognitive decline. On the other hand, sPlas treatment attenuated the activation of the pSTAT3/PIM1/NFATc1 axis independent of RAGE and significantly suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation, demonstrating the beneficial effect on AD.
