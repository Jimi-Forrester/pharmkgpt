6581838|t|[Familial Alzheimer's disease: a study of HLA markers].
6581838|a|We have studied HLA markers in family with 2 "Probable" and 2 "possible" cases of Alzheimer disease over 3 generations. Three of them (two brothers and the father) present A29 C-B12 DR2 haplotype. It seems that it exists an association between HLA system and Alzheimer disease but we cannot define the character of this genetic linkage; the study of many families and sporadic cases will allow to define it.
