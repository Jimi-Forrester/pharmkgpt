37342446|a|BACKGROUND: Smell disorders are the most frequent persistent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) complications. AIM: To describe the patterns and characteristics of persistent smell and taste disorders in Egyptian patients. METHODS: Assessment was done to 185 patients (adults = 150, age: 31.41 +- 8.63 years; children = 35; age: 15.66 +- 1.63 years). Otolaryngology and neuropsychiatric evaluations were done. Measurements included: A clinical questionnaire (for smell and taste); sniffin' odor, taste and flavor identification tests and the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS). RESULTS: Duration of disorders was 11.53 +- 3.97 ms (6-24 ms). Parosmia (n = 119; 64.32%) was developed months after anosmia (3.05 +- 1.87 ms). Objective testing showed anosmia in all, ageusia and flavor loss in 20% (n = 37) and loss of nasal and oral trigeminal sensations in 18% (n = 33) and 20% (n = 37), respectively. Patients had low scoring of sQOD-NS (11.41 +- 3.66). There were no specific differences in other demographics and clinical variables which could distinguish post-COVID-19 smell and taste disorders in children from adults. CONCLUSION: The course of small and taste disorders are supportive of the nasal and oral neuronal compromises. Post-COVID-19 taste and trigeminal disorders were less frequent compared to smell disorders. Post-COVID-19 flavor disorders were solely dependent on taste and not smell disorders. There were no demographics, clinical variables at onset or specific profile of these disorders in children compared to adults.
