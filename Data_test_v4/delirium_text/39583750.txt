39583750|t|Caveolae with serotonin and NMDA receptors as promising targets for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
39583750|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most general type of cognitive impairments. Until recently, strategies that prevent its clinical progression have remained more elusive. Consequently, research direction should be for finding effective neuroprotective agents. It has been suggested oxidative stress, mitochondrial injury, and inflammation level might lead to brain cell death in many neurological disorders. Therefore, several autophagy-targeted bioactive compounds may be promising candidate therapeutics for the prevention of brain cell damage. Interestingly, some risk genes to Alzheimer's disease are expressed within brain cells, which may be linked to cholesterol metabolism, lipid transport, endocytosis, exocytosis and/or caveolae formation, suggesting that caveolae may be a fruitful therapeutic target to improve cognitive impairments. This review would highlight the latest advances in therapeutic technologies to improve the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In particular, a paradigm that serotonin and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors agonist/antagonist within caveolae structure might possibly improve the cognitive impairment. Consequently, cellular membrane biophysics should improve our understanding of the pathology of the cognitive dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease. Here, this research direction for the purpose of therapy may open the potential to move a clinical care toward disease-modifying treatment strategies with certain benefits for patients.
