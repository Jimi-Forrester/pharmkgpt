38138229|t|Analysis of Changes in Sleep Quality and Patterns after Hip Fracture Using Real Evidence of Artificial Intelligence Linked (REAL) Hip Cohort Data.
38138229|a|Background and Objectives: Hip fractures are commonly found in elderly patients, and often result in chronic pain and decreased physical function, as well as worsening of overall health. It is known that early surgical intervention during the acute phase and rehabilitation are important for improving clinical outcomes for these patients. However, the importance of management for improving the quality of life of these patients is becoming more emphasized. Studies on changes in sleep patterns after hip fractures are rare overseas. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of sleep disturbance in patients with hip fractures and to analyze the changes in sleep disturbance after surgery by comparing the preoperative and postoperative results. Materials and Methods: During the period from August 2022 to January 2023, patients who underwent surgical treatment for hip fractures and were recruited into the REAL Hip Cohort were selected as research subjects. The sleep survey was conducted using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI is composed of 18 questions, each divided into areas of sleep quality, sleep latency, duration, efficiency, disturbance, use of medication, and daytime dysfunction. Each area is scored 0-3 points and the total is 0-21. A score greater than five indicates sleep disorder. The PSQI was surveyed during hospitalization and three months after surgery for post-fracture sleep status. To analyze changes before and after the fracture, paired T-tests and chi-square tests were performed. Results: From August 2022 to January 2023, a total of 40 patients who were recruited into the REAL Hip Cohort responded to the PSQI survey. The average age was 77.4 years and 36 were female. Sleep quality worsened from 0.75 +- 1.0 before surgery to 1.4 +- 1.0 three months after surgery (p = 0.019), and sleep efficiency also worsened from 0.4 +- 0.6 to 1.4 +- 1.0 (p < 0.001). The PSQI increased from an average of 5.2 +- 2.8 before surgery to 8.2 +- 4.2 three months after surgery (p = 0.007), and the number of patients who could be diagnosed with sleep disorders also increased from 12 (40%) to 24 (60%) (p = 0.030). Conclusions: A decline in overall sleep status was observed in patients in a survey on sleep patterns three months after hip fracture. Additional management is needed to improve their sleep patterns.
