21161042|a|Experiments on rats showed that neurodegenerative brain damage caused by administration of neurotoxic fragment of beta-amyloid protein Abeta25-35 in a dose of 2 mug into Meynert giant cell nucleus leads to long-term memory impairment in rats. Intranasal administration of antibodies to glutamate in a dose of 300 mug/kg 1 h after damage restores learning capacity of the experimental animals in the conditioned passive avoidance paradigm.
