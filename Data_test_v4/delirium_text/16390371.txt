16390371|a|OBJECTIVE: There have been inconclusive results to date on the association between the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated whether ApoE epsilon4 allele is associated with NPS in probable AD. METHOD: Data for 197 subjects with probable AD were analysed. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory was used to evaluate the frequency and severity of NPS. Multiple logistic regression models were used to test the association between ApoE genotype and NPS in AD. RESULTS: The ApoE epsilon3/3 genotype was present in 52.3%, epsilon3/4 in 44.1%, and epsilon4/4 in 3.6% of patients. ApoE epsilon4 carriers showed a higher frequency of apathy than non-carriers. After multiple adjustments, the ApoE epsilon4 allele was significantly associated with apathy. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a relationship between the ApoE epsilon4 allele and apathy in patients with AD.
