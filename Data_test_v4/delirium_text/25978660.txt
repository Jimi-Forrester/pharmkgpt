25978660|a|PURPOSE: The goals of this study were to examine how dosing strategies and timeliness of antipsychotic medication initiation would affect delirium duration. METHODS: This is a retrospective paper and electronic record review of patients in an academic hospital who had been diagnosed with delirium. Forty-two patients met inclusion criteria. Quantitative and qualitative data on the course of delirium was gathered, as well as important demographic and medical variables. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in duration of delirium between the scheduled and PRN groups using survival analysis, although the test was marginally significant (log rank test, p<0.06). Those who received treatment within 24 hours of recognition had significantly shorter durations of delirium compared to those who began treatment after 24 hours (log rank test, p<0.006). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that early psychopharmacological treatment of delirium can reduce duration. Future research needs to investigate prompt and scheduled medication dosing strategies for treatment of delirium symptoms.
