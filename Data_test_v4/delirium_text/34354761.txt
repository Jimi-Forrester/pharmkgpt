34354761|a|BACKGROUND: Presbyopia is a primary cause of a decline in near vision. In this study, we developed a new mixed herbal medicine to retard presbyopic progression and increase the amplitude of accommodation (AA), which is beneficial for near vision. METHODS: A total of 400 participants between the ages of 45 and 70 years were recruited. We designed the mixed herbal drug to include Cassiae Semen (200 mg), wolfberry (200 mg), and Dendrobium huoshanense (DD) (40 mg) in one capsule. In experiment 1, the recruited subjects were directed to perform a push-up test to measure their AA; this was then converted to the additional diopters of reading glasses. In experiment 2, 240 subjects took three capsules daily for six months and then stopped medical therapy for a six-month follow-up. In experiment 3, 160 subjects were randomly categorized into four groups: a placebo group, low-dose group (LDG) (1 capsule daily), middle-dose group (MDG) (two capsules daily), and high-dose group (HDG) (three capsules daily). The 160 volunteers took different doses for six months and then stopped treatment, accompanied by another six-month follow-up. In experiments 2 and 3, the change in AA, uncorrected far visual acuity (UFVA), and uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA) were recorded each month for one year. RESULTS: In experiment 1, AA was found to decrease with age and a great deal of additional power was needed in older individuals. In experiment 2, the mean AA reached a maximum value of 2.1D (P < 0.05) after six months, while the UNVA improved by about two to three lines of a Jaeger chart in most of the subjects. At nine months, all the means decreased slightly to 2.0 D (P < 0.05). This meant that the mixed herbal medicine could still maintain AA for another three months because the herbal therapy was stopped at the seventh month. In experiment 3, the maximal AA was 2.8D, 2.9D, and 3.2D (P < 0.05) in the LDG, MDG, and HDG after six-month treatments, respectively. Experiment 3 showed that AA gain occurred in a dose-dependent manner; the higher the dose, the greater the AA value. CONCLUSION: Only two studies on the use of herbal drugs for presbyopia have been reported in PubMed. In our study, we found that taking a mixed herbal drug caused an excellent gain in AA. This is the first study to report that the characteristics of the new herbal regimen could retard and even ameliorate presbyopia.
