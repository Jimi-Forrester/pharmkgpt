38410619|a|White matter hyperintensities, one of the major markers of cerebral small vessel disease, disrupt the integrity of neuronal networks and ultimately contribute to cognitive dysfunction. However, a deeper understanding of how white matter hyperintensities related to the connectivity patterns of brain hubs at the neural network level could provide valuable insights into the relationship between white matter hyperintensities and cognitive dysfunction. A total of 36 patients with moderate to severe white matter hyperintensities (Fazekas score >= 3) and 34 healthy controls underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessments and resting-state functional MRI scans. The voxel-based graph-theory approach-functional connectivity strength was employed to systematically investigate the topological organization of the whole-brain networks. The white matter hyperintensities patients performed significantly worse than the healthy controls in episodic memory, executive function and information processing speed. Additionally, we found that white matter hyperintensities selectively affected highly connected hub regions, predominantly involving the medial and lateral prefrontal, precuneus, inferior parietal lobule, insula and thalamus. Intriguingly, this impairment was connectivity distance-dependent, with the most prominent disruptions observed in long-range connections (e.g. 100-150 mm). Finally, these disruptions of hub connectivity (e.g. the long-range functional connectivity strength in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) positively correlated with the cognitive performance in white matter hyperintensities patients. Our findings emphasize that the disrupted hub connectivity patterns in white matter hyperintensities are dependent on connection distance, especially longer-distance connections, which in turn predispose white matter hyperintensities patients to worse cognitive function.
