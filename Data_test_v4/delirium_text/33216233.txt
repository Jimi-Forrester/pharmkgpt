33216233|t|Sex Differences in the Gut-Brain Axis: Implications for Mental Health.
33216233|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this article is to highlight how sex differences in the gut-brain axis may contribute to the discrepancies in incidence of neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders between females and males. We focus on autism spectrum disorder, psychotic disorders, stress and anxiety disorders, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease and additionally discuss the comorbidity between inflammatory bowel disorder and mental health disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Human and animal studies show that sex may modify the relationship between the gut or immune system and brain and behavior. Sex also appears to modify the effect of microbial treatments such as probiotics and antibiotics on brain and behavior. There is emerging evidence that assessing the role of sex in the gut-brain axis may help elucidate the etiology of and identify effective treatments for neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders.
