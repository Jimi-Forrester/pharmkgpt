37298496|t|Parkinson's Disease: From Genetics and Epigenetics to Treatment, a miRNA-Based Strategy.
37298496|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, characterized by an initial and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta via a potentially substantial contribution from protein aggregates, the Lewy bodies, mainly composed of alpha-Synuclein among other factors. Distinguishing symptoms of PD are bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, unstable posture and gait, hypokinetic movement disorder and resting tremor. Currently, there is no cure for PD, and palliative treatments, such as Levodopa administration, are directed to relieve the motor symptoms but induce severe side effects over time. Therefore, there is an urgency for discovering new drugs in order to design more effective therapeutic approaches. The evidence of epigenetic alterations, such as the dysregulation of different miRNAs that may stimulate many aspects of PD pathogenesis, opened a new scenario in the research for a successful treatment. Along this line, a promising strategy for PD treatment comes from the potential exploitation of modified exosomes, which can be loaded with bioactive molecules, such as therapeutic compounds and RNAs, and can allow their delivery to the appropriate location in the brain, overcoming the blood-brain barrier. In this regard, the transfer of miRNAs within Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes has yet to demonstrate successful results both in vitro and in vivo. This review, besides providing a systematic overview of both the genetic and epigenetic basis of the disease, aims to explore the exosomes/miRNAs network and its clinical potential for PD treatment.
