35327328|t|Neuropsychological Outcome of Critically Ill Patients with Severe Infection.
35327328|a|Sepsis and septic shock represent important burdens of disease around the world. Sepsis-associated neurological consequences have a great impact on patients, both in the acute phase and in the long term. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a severe brain dysfunction that may contribute to long-term cognitive impairment. Its pathophysiology recognizes the following two main mechanisms: neuroinflammation and hemodynamic impairment. Clinical manifestations include different forms of altered mental status, from agitation and restlessness to delirium and deep coma. A definite diagnosis is difficult because of the absence of specific radiological and biological criteria; clinical management is restricted to the treatment of sepsis, focusing on early detection of the infection source, maintenance of hemodynamic homeostasis, and avoidance of metabolic disturbances or neurotoxic drugs.
