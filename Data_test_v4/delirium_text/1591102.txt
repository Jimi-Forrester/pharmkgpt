1591102|a|A highly sensitive silver technique for glial cytoplasmic inclusions in olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) was applied to 15 subjects with neurodegenerative disorders including 4 patients with OPCA, 4 patients with Joseph disease and with 3 normal control subjects, and the argyrophilic structures in the OPCA cases were immunocytochemically examined. As a result, the argyrophilic structures were found in the OPCA cases and Alzheimer cases. The argyrophilic structures included the white matter oligodendroglia, and neurons, astroglia and oligodendroglia in the putamen, pontine nucleus and inferior olivary nucleus. The pontocerebellar tracts and the surrounding white matter of the inferior olivary nucleus contained a small number of argyrophilic nerve fibers with a hollow structure, which were interpreted as myelin. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the oligodendroglia in the white matter had immunoreactivities to an paired helical filament (PHF), microtubule associated protein 5 (MAP5), tau and ubiquitin antiserum, and the astroglia in the white matters had an immunoreactivity to a MAP5 antiserum. In the putamen, pontine nucleus and inferior olivary nucleus, in addition to the immunoreactivities observed in the oligodendroglia, the neurons were immunoreactive for PHF, MAP5, tau and ubiquitin antisera, and the astroglia had the same immunoreactivities as the neurons except for being tau negative in the putamen. The nerve fibers in the pontocerebellar tract and inferior olivary nucleus capsule were strongly positive for myelin basic protein and negative for PHF antiserum. These findings indicate that the Gallyas positive argyrophilia in the OPCA subjects is closely associated with PHF or tau.
