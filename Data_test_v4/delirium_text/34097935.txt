34097935|t|Neurophysiological basis of the N400 deflection, from Mismatch Negativity to Semantic Prediction Potentials and late positive components.
34097935|a|The first theoretical model on the neurophysiological basis of the N400: the deflection reflects layer I dendritic plateaus on a preparatory state of synaptic integration that precedes layer V somatic burst firing for conscious identification of the higher-order features of the stimulus (a late positive shift). Plateaus ensue from apical disinhibition by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-positive interneurons (VIPs) through suppression of Martinotti cells, opening the gates for glutamatergic feedback to trigger dendritic regenerative potentials. Cholinergic transients contribute to these dynamics directly, holding a central role in the N400 deflection. The stereotypical timing of the (frontal) glutamatergic feedback and the accompanying cholinergic transients account for the enigmatic "invariability" of the peak latency in the face of a gamut of different stimuli and paradigms. The theoretical postulations presented here may bring about unprecedented level of detail for the N400 deflection to be used in the study of schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and other higher-order pathologies. The substrates of a late positive component, the Mismatch Negativity and the Semantic Prediction Potentials are also surveyed.
