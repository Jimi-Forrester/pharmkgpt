25593293|t|Epac activation initiates associative odor preference memories in the rat pup.
25593293|a|Here we examine the role of the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) in beta-adrenergic-dependent associative odor preference learning in rat pups. Bulbar Epac agonist (8-pCPT-2-O-Me-cAMP, or 8-pCPT) infusions, paired with odor, initiated preference learning, which was selective for the paired odor. Interestingly, pairing odor with Epac activation produced both short-term (STM) and long-term (LTM) odor preference memories. Training using beta-adrenergic-activation paired with odor recruited rapid and transient ERK phosphorylation consistent with a role for Epac activation in normal learning. An ERK antagonist prevented intermediate-term memory (ITM) and LTM, but not STM. Epac agonist infusions induced ERK phosphorylation in the mitral cell layer, in the inner half of the dendritic external plexiform layer, in the glomeruli and, patchily, among granule cells. Increased CREB phosphorylation in the mitral and granule cell layers was also seen. Simultaneous blockade of both ERK and CREB pathways prevented any long-term beta-adrenergic activated odor preference memory, while LTM deficits associated with blocking only one pathway were prevented by stronger beta-adrenergic activation. These results suggest that Epac and PKA play parallel and independent, as well as likely synergistic, roles in creating cAMP-dependent associative memory in rat pups. They further implicate a novel ERK-independent pathway in the mediation of STM by Epac.
