30669253|t|Investigating the Molecular Basis of the Aggregation Propensity of the Pathological D76N Mutant of Beta-2 Microglobulin: Role of the Denatured State.
30669253|a|Beta-2 microglobulin (beta2m) is a protein responsible for a pathologic condition, known as dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA), caused by its aggregation and subsequent amyloid formation. A naturally occurring mutation of beta2m, D76N, presents a higher amyloidogenic propensity compared to the wild type counterpart. Since the three-dimensional structure of the protein is essentially unaffected by the mutation, the increased aggregation propensity of D76N has been generally ascribed to its lower thermodynamic stability and increased dynamics. In this study we compare the equilibrium unfolding and the aggregation propensity of wild type beta2m and D76N variant at different experimental conditions. Our data revealed a surprising effect of the D76N mutation in the residual structure of the denatured state, which appears less compact than that of the wild type protein. A careful investigation of the structural malleability of the denatured state of wild type beta2m and D76N pinpoint a clear role of the denatured state in triggering the amyloidogenic propensity of the protein. The experimental results are discussed in the light of the previous work on beta2m and its role in disease.
