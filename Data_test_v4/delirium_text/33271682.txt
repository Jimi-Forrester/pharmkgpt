33271682|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a global public health threat. Though the fear, anxiety, and stress related to COVID-19 have been studied in depth, the direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the central nervous system (CNS) remain elusive. Research related to the earlier coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks (like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS) shows the neurotropic nature of CoV and the plethora of neuropsychiatric effects that it can cause. Though the current health priorities in managing COVID-19 remain restricted to containment and targeting pulmonary symptoms, the potential acute and long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae of the infection can increase morbidity and worsen the quality of life. Emerging evidence shows neural spread of the novel coronavirus. Delirium, encephalopathy, olfactory disturbances, acute behavioral changes, headache and cerebrovascular accidents are its common neuropsychiatric complications. These are directly related to increase in peripheral immunological markers, severity of infection and case fatality rate. This narrative review synthesizes available evidence related to the neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19. Also, as SARS-CoV-2 shares structural and functional similarities with its earlier congeners, this article proposes possible long-term neuropsychological sequelae and pathogenic mechanisms for the same, based on research in the other coronavirus outbreaks.
