36055520|a|Many neurodegenerative diseases have a multifactorial etiology and variable course of progression that cannot be explained by current models. Neurotropic viruses have long been suggested to play a role in these diseases, although their exact contributions remain unclear. Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) is one of the most common viruses detected in the adult brain, and has been clinically associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), and, more recently, Alzheimer's disease (AD). HHV-6A is a ubiquitous viral pathogen capable of infecting glia and neurons. Primary infection in childhood is followed by the induction of latency, characterized by expression of the U94A viral transcript in the absence of viral replication. Here we examine the effects of U94A on cells of the central nervous system. We found that U94A expression inhibits the migration and impairs cytoplasmic maturation of human oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) without affecting their viability, a phenotype that may contribute to the failure of remyelination seen in many patients with MS. A subsequent proteomics analysis of U94A expression OPCs revealed altered expression of genes involved in tubulin associated cytoskeletal regulation. As HHV-6A seems to significantly be associated with early AD pathology, we extended our initially analysis of the impact of U94A on human derived neurons. We found that U94A expression inhibits neurite outgrowth of primary human cortical neurons and impairs synapse maturation. Based on these data we suggest that U94A expression by latent HHV-6A in glial cells and neurons renders them susceptible to dysfunction and degeneration. Therefore, latent viral infections of the brain represent a unique pathological risk factor that may contribute to disease processes.
