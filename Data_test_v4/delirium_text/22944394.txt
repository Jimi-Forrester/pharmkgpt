22944394|t|Stability of early-stage amyloid-beta(1-42) aggregation species.
22944394|a|Accumulation of aggregated amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) is an important feature of Alzheimer's disease. There is significant interest in understanding the initial steps of Abeta aggregation due to the recent focus on soluble Abeta oligomers. In vitro studies of Abeta aggregation have been aided by the use of conformation-specific antibodies which recognize shape rather than sequence. One of these, OC antiserum, recognizes certain elements of fibrillar Abeta across a broad range of sizes. We have observed the presence of these fibrillar elements at very early stages of Abeta incubation. Using a dot blot assay, OC-reactivity was found in size exclusion chromatography (SEC)-purified Abeta(1-42) monomer fractions immediately after isolation (early-stage). The OC-reactivity was not initially observed in the same fractions for Abeta(1-40) or the aggregation-restricted Abeta(1-42) L34P but was detected within 1-2weeks of incubation. Stability studies demonstrated that early-stage OC-positive Abeta(1-42) aggregates were resistant to 4M urea or guanidine hydrochloride but sensitive to 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Interestingly, the sensitivity to SDS diminished over time upon incubation of the SEC-purified Abeta(1-42) solution at 4 C. Within 6-8days the OC-positive Abeta42 aggregates were resistant to SDS denaturation. The progression to, and development of, SDS resistance for Abeta(1-42) occurred prior to thioflavin T fluorescence. In contrast, Abeta(1-40) aggregates formed after 6days of incubation were sensitive to both urea and SDS. These findings reveal information on some of the earliest events in Abeta aggregation and suggest that it may be possible to target early-stage aggregates before they develop significant stability.
