38613099|t|Polyphenolic Compounds: Orchestrating Intestinal Microbiota Harmony during Aging.
38613099|a|In the aging process, physiological decline occurs, posing a substantial threat to the physical and mental well-being of the elderly and contributing to the onset of age-related diseases. While traditional perspectives considered the maintenance of life as influenced by a myriad of factors, including environmental, genetic, epigenetic, and lifestyle elements such as exercise and diet, the pivotal role of symbiotic microorganisms had been understated. Presently, it is acknowledged that the intestinal microbiota plays a profound role in overall health by signaling to both the central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as other distant organs. Disruption in this bidirectional communication between bacteria and the host results in dysbiosis, fostering the development of various diseases, including neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. This review aims to delve into the intricate biological mechanisms underpinning dysbiosis associated with aging and the clinical ramifications of such dysregulation. Furthermore, we aspire to explore bioactive compounds endowed with functional properties capable of modulating and restoring balance in this aging-related dysbiotic process through epigenetics alterations.
