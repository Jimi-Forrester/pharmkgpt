37822141|t|System Failure: Systemic inflammation following spinal cord injury.
37822141|a|Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects hundreds of thousands of people in the United States, and while some effects of the injury are broadly recognized (deficits to locomotion, fine motor control, and quality of life), the systemic consequences of SCI are less well-known. The spinal cord regulates systemic immunological and visceral functions, and this control is often disrupted by the injury resulting in viscera including the gut, spleen, liver, bone marrow, and kidneys experiencing local tissue inflammation and physiological dysfunction. The extent of pathology depends on the injury level, severity, and time post-injury. In this review, we describe immunological and metabolic consequences of SCI across several organs. Since infection and metabolic disorders are primary reasons for reduced lifespan after SCI, it is imperative that research continues to focus on these deleterious aspects of SCI to improve life span and quality of life for individuals with SCI.
