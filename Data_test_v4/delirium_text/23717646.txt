23717646|a|Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) containing the alpha9 subunit are expressed in a wide variety of non-neuronal tissues ranging from immune cells to breast carcinomas. The alpha9 subunit is able to assemble into a functional homomeric nAChR and also co-assemble with the alpha10 subunit into functional heteromeric nAChRs. Despite the increasing awareness of the important roles of this subunit in vertebrates, the study of human alpha9-containing nAChRs has been severely limited by difficulties in its expression in heterologous systems. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, functional expression of human alpha9alpha10 nAChRs is very low compared to that of rat alpha9alpha10 nAChRs. When oocytes were co-injected with cRNA of alpha9 and alpha10 subunits of human versus those of rat, oocytes with the rat alpha9 human alpha10 combination had an ~-fold higher level of acetylcholine-gated currents (I(ACh)) than those with the human alpha9 rat alpha10 combination, suggesting difficulties with human alpha9 expression. When the ratio of injected human alpha9 cRNA to human alpha10 cRNA was increased from 1:1 to 5:1, I(ACh) increased 36-fold (from 142+-23 nA to 5171+-748 nA). Functional expression of human alpha9-containing receptors in oocytes was markedly improved by appending the 5'-untranslated region of alfalfa mosaic virus RNA4 to the 5'-leader sequence of the alpha9 subunit cRNA. This increased the functional expression of homomeric human alpha9 receptors by 70-fold (from 7+-1 nA to 475+-158 nA) and of human alpha9alpha10 heteromeric receptors by 80-fold (from 113+-62 nA to 9192+-1137 nA). These findings indicate the importance of the composition of the 5' untranslated leader sequence for expression of alpha9-containing nAChRs.
