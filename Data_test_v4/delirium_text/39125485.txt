39125485|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have shown that the levodopa treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) elevates circulating homocysteine levels, which are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and neurological disorders, or thrombosis. The present trial aimed to examine whether the intake of vitamin B12, folic acid, and vitamin D3 supplements improved homocysteine level and quality of life (QoL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: An interventional prospective trial was conducted in multiple centers across Romania. Participants with clinically established PD taking at least 300 mg/day of levodopa for more than 1 year received a daily tablet of a supplement containing 800 UI of vitamin D3, 1000 microg of folic acid, and 15 microg of vitamin B12. They were followed for 6 months and their serum homocysteine, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and QoL scores were measured at baseline and at 6 months of treatment. QoL was measured using a 15D questionnaire, which assesses mobility, vision, hearing, breathing, sleeping, eating, speech, excretion, usual activities, mental function, discomfort and symptoms, depression, distress, vitality, and sexual activity. RESULTS: Twenty-four PD patients with a mean age of 71 +- 5.04 years (54.2% male and 45.8% female) finished the study. After the intervention, the mean score of speech, mental function, discomfort and symptoms, depression, and QoL significantly increased (p < 0.05 for all). Also, the serum homocysteine and vitamin D were significantly enhanced (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.025, respectively). Changes in vitamin B12 were not statistically significant at 6 months of treatment (p = 0.996). No gender differences were found among the changes that we have demonstrated for homocysteine, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and QoL levels (p < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study showed that the dietary intake of vitamin B12, folic acid, and vitamin D3 remarkably decreased the dimensions of homocysteine and finally increased the total score of QoL in PD patients. We have successfully captured the potential benefits of the supplementation regimen over time and provided insights into the broader implications for managing PD with a focus on nutritional support.
