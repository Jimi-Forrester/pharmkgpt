38931292|t|Exploring the Significance of Gut Microbiota in Diabetes Pathogenesis and Management-A Narrative Review.
38931292|a|Type 2 diabetes is a disease with significant health consequences for the individual. Currently, new mechanisms and therapeutic approaches that may affect this disease are being sought. One of them is the association of type 2 diabetes with microbiota. Through the enteric nervous system and the gut-microbiota axis, the microbiota affects the functioning of the body. It has been proven to have a real impact on influencing glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. With dysbiosis, there is increased bacterial translocation through the disrupted intestinal barrier and increased inflammation in the body. In diabetes, the microbiota's composition is altered with, for example, a more abundant class of Betaproteobacteria. The consequences of these disorders are linked to mechanisms involving short-chain fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide, among others. Interventions focusing on the gut microbiota are gaining traction as a promising approach to diabetes management. Studies are currently being conducted on the effects of the supply of probiotics and prebiotics, as well as fecal microbiota transplantation, on the course of diabetes. Further research will allow us to fully develop our knowledge on the subject and possibly best treat and prevent type 2 diabetes.
