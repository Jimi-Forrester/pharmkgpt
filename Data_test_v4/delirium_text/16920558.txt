16920558|t|Incidence of delirium and associated mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients.
16920558|a|Delirium has been associated with a high risk of mortality in medical patients. Despite the high incidence of delirium in patients who undergo hemapoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), delirium as a risk factor for death has not been examined in this population. Thirty adult patients undergoing HSCT who were admitted to the University of Iowa Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program inpatient unit were assessed prospectively from 1 to 2 weeks before transplantation, throughout their inpatient stay, and at 100 days after transplantation. The Delirium Rating Scale and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale were used twice weekly during the inpatient period to assess delirium severity and occurence. Patients' self-reports of medical history, computerized medical records, and neuropsychological and psychiatric assessments were used to identify pretransplantation risk factors. The incidence of delirium (Delirium Rating Scale score >12 or Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale score >or=8) was 43% and occurred with highest frequency in the first 2 weeks after transplantion. The presence of delirium at any point during hospitalization after transplantation and transplant type (allogeneic) were highly predictive of mortality (p < .0005; odds ratios, 14.0 and 14.4). In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of monitoring for delirium during the acute recovery period after transplantation and suggests that early or even prophylactic treatment for delirium should be studied. Studies to determine the factors that connect delerium soon after transplantation to mortality are highly warranted.
