38715149|t|Rationally Designed Peptoid Inhibitors of Amyloid-beta Oligomerization.
38715149|a|While plaques comprised of fibrillar Abeta aggregates are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, soluble Abeta oligomers present higher neurotoxicity. Thus, one therapeutic approach is to prevent the formation of Abeta oligomers and reduce their associated harmful effects. We have proposed a peptoid mimic of the Abeta hydrophobic KLVFF core as an ideal candidate aggregation inhibitor due to its ability to evade proteolytic degradation via repositioning of the side chain from the alpha-carbon to the amide nitrogen. This peptoid, JPT1, utilizes chiral sidechains to achieve a helical structure, while C-terminal addition of two phenylalanine residues places aromatic groups on two sides of the helix with spacing designed to facilitate interaction with amyloid beta-sheet structure. We have previously shown that JPT1 modulates Abeta fibril formation. Here, we demonstrate that JPT1 also modulates Abeta oligomerization, and we explore the role of the charge on the linker between the KLVFF mimic and the extended aromatic residues. Additionally, we demonstrate that peptoid-induced changes in Abeta oligomerization correlate with attenuation of oligomer-induced nuclear factor-kappaB activation in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. These findings support the therapeutic potential of peptoids to target early stages of Abeta aggregation and impact the associated Abeta-induced cellular response.
