35371628|t|A Case of Rapidly Progressive Dementia.
35371628|a|Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a very rare neurodegenerative disorder that usually presents as rapidly progressive dementia with an extremely poor prognosis. The diagnosis of CJD can be extremely challenging due to its rarity, manifestation with non-specific neurological symptoms, associated broad differentials, and a need for extensive workup. Awareness of disease-specific biomarkers, radiological signs, and diagnostic criteria are crucial for timely diagnosis. Here, we report a case of CJD, which presented as an atypical movement disorder that progressed to dementia and failure to thrive within a few weeks of presentation.
