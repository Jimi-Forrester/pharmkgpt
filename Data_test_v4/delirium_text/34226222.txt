34226222|t|Point-of-care ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia in older ED patients with hip fractures: a study to test the feasibility of a training programme and time needed to complete nerve blocks by ED physicians after training.
34226222|a|OBJECTIVES: Point-of-care ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia (POCUS-GRA) provides safe, rapid analgesia for older people with hip fractures but is rarely performed in the emergency department (ED). Self-perceived inadequate training and time to perform POCUS-GRA are the two most important barriers. Our objective is to assess the feasibility of a proposed multicentre, stepped-wedge cluster randomised clinical trial (RCT) to assess the impact of a knowledge-to-practice (KTP) intervention on delirium. DESIGN: Open-label feasibility study. SETTING: An academic tertiary care Canadian ED (annual visits 60 000). PARTICIPANTS: Emergency physicians working at least one ED shift per week, excluding those already performing POCUS-GRA more than four times per year. INTERVENTION: A KTP intervention, including 2-hour structured training sessions with procedure bundle and email reminders. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary feasibility outcome is the proportion of eligible physicians that completed training and subsequently performed POCUS-GRA. Secondary outcome is the time needed to complete POCUS-GRA. We also test the feasibility of the enrolment, consent and randomisation processes for the future stepped-wedge cluster RCT (NCT02892968). RESULTS: Of 36 emergency physicians, 4 (12%) were excluded or declined participation. All remaining 32 emergency physicians completed training and 31 subsequently treated at least one eligible patient. Collectively, 27/31 (87.1%) performed 102 POCUS-GRA blocks (range 1-20 blocks per physician). The median (IQR) time to perform blocks was 15 (10-20) min, and reduction in pain was 6/10 (3-7) following POCUS-GRA. There were no reported complications. CONCLUSION: Our KTP intervention, consent process and randomisation were feasible. The time to perform POCUS-GRA rarely exceeded 30 min, Our findings reinforce the existing data on the safety and effectiveness of POCUS-GRA, mitigate perceived barriers to more widespread adoption and demonstrate the feasibility of trialling this intervention for the proposed stepped-wedge cluster RCT.
