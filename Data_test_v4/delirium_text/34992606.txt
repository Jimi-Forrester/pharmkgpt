34992606|a|Tetratricopeptide repeat and ankyrin repeat containing 1 (TRANK1) is a robust risk gene of bipolar disorder (BD). However, little is known on the role of TRANK1 in the pathogenesis of BD and whether the gut microbiota is capable of regulating TRANK1 expression. In this study, we first investigated the serum mRNA level of TRANK1 in medication-free patients with a depressive episode of BD, then a mice model was constructed by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to explore the effects of gut microbiota on brain TRANK1 expression and neuroinflammation, which was further verified by in vitro Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment in BV-2 microglial cells and neurons. 22 patients with a depressive episode and 28 healthy individuals were recruited. Serum level of TRANK1 mRNA was higher in depressed patients than that of healthy controls. Mice harboring 'BD microbiota' following FMT presented depression-like phenotype. mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines and TRANK1 were elevated in mice hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In vitro, LPS treatment activated the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors in BV-2 cells, which was capable of upregulating the neuronal expression of TRANK1 mRNA. Moreover, primary cortical neurons transfected with plasmid Cytomegalovirus DNA (pcDNA3.1(+)) vector encoding human TRANK1 showed decreased dendritic spine density. Together, these findings add new evidence to the microbiota-gut-brain regulation in BD, indicating that microbiota is possibly involved in the neuropathogenesis of BD by modulating the expression of TRANK1.
