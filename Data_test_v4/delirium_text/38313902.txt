38313902|t|Acute Encephalopathy Workup for a Patient With a History of Lupus Cerebritis and Unremarkable Inflammatory Markers: A Case Report.
38313902|a|Lupus is a relatively rare disease; however, many of the patients diagnosed with lupus experience an acute confusional state. Despite the prevalence, lupus cerebritis remains a diagnosis of exclusion due to the number of differential diagnoses of the cause of acute confusional state and unreliable clinical markers. This case report highlights the significant duration it takes to work up a broad differential before initiating treatment for lupus. Our case involves a 65-year-old woman with a documented history of lupus, who presented with acute encephalopathy. Following the comprehensive diagnostic investigation, the patient was treated with high-dose steroids that resolved the patient's symptoms. This report considers the option of empiric steroid treatment in the setting of acute encephalopathy in individuals with a history of lupus cerebritis with inconclusive test results.
