33563387|a|Understanding how anesthetics impact cerebral physiology, cerebral blood flow, brain metabolism, brain relaxation, and neurologic recovery is crucial for optimizing anesthesia during supratentorial craniotomies. Intraoperative goals for supratentorial tumor resection include maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral autoregulation, optimizing surgical access and neuromonitoring, and facilitating rapid, cooperative emergence. Evidence-based studies increasingly expand the impact of anesthetic care beyond immediate perioperative care into both preoperative optimization and minimizing postoperative consequences. New evidence is needed for neuroanesthesia's role in neurooncology, in preventing conversion from acute to chronic pain, and in decreasing risk of intraoperative ischemia and postoperative delirium.
