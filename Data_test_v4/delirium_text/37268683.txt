37268683|a|Our knowledge of traumatic brain injury has been fast growing with the emergence of new markers pointing to various neurological changes that the brain undergoes during an impact or any other form of concussive event. In this work, we study the modality of deformations on a biofidelic brain system when subject to blunt impacts, highlighting the importance of the time-dependent behavior of the resulting waves propagating through the brain. This study is carried out using two different approaches involving optical (Particle Image Velocimetry) and mechanical (flexible sensors) in the biofidelic brain. Results show that the system has a natural mechanical frequency of [Formula: see text] 25 oscillations per second, which was confirmed by both methods, showing a positive correlation with one another. The consistency of these results with previously reported brain pathology validates the use of either technique, and establishes a new, simpler mechanism to study brain vibrations by using flexible piezoelectric patches. The visco-elastic nature of the biofidelic brain is validated by observing the the relationship between both methods at two different time intervals, by using the information of the strain and stress inside the brain from the Particle Image Velocimetry and flexible sensor, respectively. A non-linear stress-strain relationship was observed and justified to support the same.
