38312529|t|Global Research Trends and Hotspots for Ferroptosis, Necroptosis, and Pyroptosis in Alzheimer's Disease from the Past to 2023: A Combined Bibliometric Review.
38312529|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a genetically intricate neurodegenerative disorder. Studies on "Ferroptosis in AD", "Pyroptosis in AD", and "Necroptosis in AD" are becoming more prevalent and there is increasing evidence that they are closely related to AD. However, there has not yet been a thorough bibliometrics-based investigation on this subject. Objective: This study uses a bibliometric approach to visualize and analyze the literature within the field of three distinct types of cell death in AD and explores the current research hotspots and prospective research directions. Methods: We collected relevant articles from the Web of Science and used CiteSpace, VOS viewer, and Pajek to perform a visual analysis. Results: A total of 123, 95, and 84 articles were published in "Ferroptosis in AD", "Pyroptosis in AD", and "Necroptosis in AD", respectively. Based on keywords analysis, we can observe that "oxidative stress" and "lipid peroxidation", "cell death" and "activation", and "Nlrp3 inflammasome" and "activation" were the three most prominent words in the field of "Ferroptosis in AD", "Pyroptosis in AD", and "Necroptosis in AD", respectively. Focusing on the breakout words in the keyword analysis, we reviewed the mechanisms of ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis in AD. By mapping the time zones of the keywords, we speculated on the evolutionary trends of ferroptosis, pyrotosis, and necroptosis in AD. Conclusions: Our findings can help researchers grasp the research status of three types of cell death in AD and determine new directions for future research as soon as possible.
