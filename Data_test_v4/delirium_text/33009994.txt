33009994|a|PURPOSE: To assess the impact of frailty on compliance of standard therapy, complication, rate and survival in patients with gynecological malignancy aged 80 years and older. METHODS: In total, 83 women with gynecological malignancy (vulva, endometrial, ovarian or cervical cancer) who underwent primary treatment between 2007 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Frailty index was calculated and its association with compliance of standard treatment, peri- and postoperative mortality and morbidity, and survival was evaluated. RESULTS: Frailty was observed in 24.1% of cases. Both frail and non-frail patients were able to receive standard therapy in most cases - 75.0% and 85.7%, respectively (p = 0.27). Frail patients did not show an increased postoperative complication rate. Frail patients had shorter 3 years overall survival rates (28%) when compared to non-frail patients (55%) (p = 0.02). In multivariable analysis high frailty index (Hazard Ratio [HR] 12.15 [1.39-106.05], p = 0.02) and advanced tumor stage (HR 1.33 [1.00-1.76], p = 0.05) were associated with poor overall survival, but not age, histologic grading, performance status, and compliance of standard therapy. CONCLUSION: Majority of patients was able to receive standard therapy, as suggested by the tumor board, irrespective of age and frailty. Nonetheless, frailty is a common finding in patients with gynecological malignancy aged 80 years and older. Frail patients show shorter progression-free, and overall survival within this cohort.
