38155982|a|Background: Cognitive impairment is a prevalent condition that substantially elevates mortality rates among the elderly. The impact of hypertension on mortality in older adults with cognitive impairment is a subject of contention. This study aims to examine the influence of hypertension on both all-cause and CVD-specific mortality in elderly individuals experiencing cognitive impairment within a prospective cohort. Methods: This study encompassed 2,925 participants (weighted 53,086,905) aged 60 years or older from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning 2011-2014. Incidence of all-cause and CVD-specific mortality was ascertained through linkage with National Death Index records until 31 December 2019. Survival was performed employing the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated via Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: Over the follow-up period of up to 9.17 years [with a median (IQR) time to death of 6.58 years], equivalent to 18,731.56 (weighted 3.46 x 108) person-years, there were a total of 576 recorded deaths. Participants with CI exhibited a 1.96-fold higher risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI: 1.55-2.49; p < 0.01) and a 2.8-fold higher risk of CVD-specific mortality (95% CI: 1.83-4.29; p < 0.01) in comparison to participants without CI. Among participants with CI, concurrent hypertension comorbidity was linked to a 2.73-fold elevated risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI: 1.78-4.17; p < 0.01) and a 5.3-fold elevated risk of CVD-specific mortality (95% CI: 2.54-11.04; p < 0.01). Further stratified analyses revealed that the combined effects of hypertension and CI on all-cause and CVD-specific mortality were more pronounced in participants aged 60-69 years compared to those aged 70-80 years (p for interaction <0.01). The primary findings exhibited resilience across a series of sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Participants with CI exhibited a markedly elevated risk of all-cause and CVD-specific mortality when coexisting with hypertension. Appropriate management of hypertension in patients with CI may be helpful in reducing the excess risk of death.
