34488804|a|BACKGROUND: The neuroimmune system is required for normal neural processes, including modulation of cognition, emotion, and adaptive behaviors. Aberrant neuroimmune activation is associated with dysregulation of memory and emotion, though the precise mechanisms at play are complex and highly context dependent. Sex differences in neuroimmune activation and function further complicate our understanding of its roles in cognitive and affective regulation. METHODS: Here, we characterized the physiological sickness and inflammatory response of the hippocampus following intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of a synthetic viral mimic, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), in both male and female C57Bl/6N mice. RESULTS: We observed that poly I:C induced weight loss, fever, and elevations of cytokine and chemokines in the hippocampus of both sexes. Specifically, we found transient increases in gene expression and protein levels of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-6, TNFalpha, CCL2, and CXCL10, where males showed a greater magnitude of response compared with females. Only males showed increased IFNalpha and IFNgamma in response to poly I:C, whereas both males and females exhibited elevations of IFNbeta, demonstrating a specific sex difference in the anti-viral response in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that type I interferons are one potential node mediating sex-specific cytokine responses and neuroimmune effects on cognition. Together, these findings highlight the importance of using both males and females and analyzing a broad set of inflammatory markers in order to identify the precise, sex-specific roles for neuroimmune dysregulation in neurological diseases and disorders.
