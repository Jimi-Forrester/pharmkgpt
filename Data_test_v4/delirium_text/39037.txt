39037|t|Treatment of delirium--a reappraisal.
39037|a|Delirium is a frequently encountered clinical syndrome which can pose serious problems for the physician and patient. Numerous etiological possibilities exist, and each case is usually associated with multiple causal factors. Although the pathophysiology is poorly understood, the clinical presentation is marked either by stupor and hypoarousal or agitation and hyperarousal. Both types of delirium must be treated by searching for and correcting reversible causative factors. In addition, medication may be quite efficacious in managing the clinical aspects of agitated delirium. Most cases of agitated delirium are either of the "sensory overload" or "sensory deprivation" type. The drug treatment of each is discussed with reference to their respective central nervous system physiological correlates.
