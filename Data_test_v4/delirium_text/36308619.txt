36308619|t|Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor: A Novel Dynamically Regulated Therapeutic Modulator in Neurological Disorders.
36308619|a|The growth factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase receptor type B (TrkB) play an active role in numerous areas of the adult brain, where they regulate the neuronal activity, function, and survival. Upregulation and downregulation of BDNF expression are critical for the physiology of neuronal circuits and functioning in the brain. Loss of BDNF function has been reported in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative or psychiatric disorders. This article reviews the BDNF gene structure, transport, secretion, expression and functions in the brain. This article also implicates BDNF in several brain-related disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, epilepsy and bipolar disorder.
