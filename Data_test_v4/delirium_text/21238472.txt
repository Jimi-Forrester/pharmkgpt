21238472|t|LPS-mediated production of pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids in whole blood samples: biological effects of +896A/G TLR4 polymorphism in a Sicilian population of healthy subjects.
21238472|a|Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the principal mediators of rapid microbial recognition: the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor TLR4 seems to have a paradigmatic role. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TLR4 gene, such as +896A/G, known to attenuate receptor signaling, have been described. The +896A/G SNP is significantly less frequent in patients with myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's disease or prostate cancer, whereas it is overrepresented in centenarians. To clarify and confirm the biological effects of +896A/G SNP and its role in the pathophysiology of age-related diseases and longevity, we assessed the levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10 and eicosanoids (LTB4 and PGE2) in LPS-stimulated whole blood samples in vitro of 50 young healthy Sicilians, screened for the presence of this SNP. To evaluate the possible influence of SNPs in PTGS2 and 5-Lo genes on eicosanoid production, the enrolled individuals were also genotyped for -765G/C PTGS2 and -1708G/A 5-Lo SNPs. Both pro-inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids were significantly lower in carriers bearing the TLR4 mutation, whereas the anti-inflammatory IL-10 values were higher. On the basis of data reported herein, some suggestions can be drawn. First, pathogen load, by interacting with the host genotype, determines the type and intensity of inflammatory responses, according to the pro-inflammatory status and tissue injury, implicated in the pathophysiology of major age-related diseases. Second, adequate control of inflammatory response might reduce the risk of these diseases, and, reciprocally, might increase the chance of extended survival in an environment with reduced antigen (that is, pathogen) load.
