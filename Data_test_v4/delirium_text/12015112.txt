12015112|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between Alzheimer's disease and its family history of the patients. METHODS: Stratified analyses and logistic regression analysis were used to examine the association between Alzheimer's disease and its family history exposure in 127 cases and 254 matched controls from a population-based case-control study. RESULTS: The risk of Alzheimer's disease was significantly higher in those who had at least one first-degree relative with dementia or major psychosis as compared to those who had no dementia or major relatives with psychosis (OR = 6.25; 8.33). Adjusted for age and level of education, family history of dementia was still associated with Alzheimer's disease positively (OR = 2.07). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that familial aggregation of Alzheimer's disease might exist among people living Beijing.
