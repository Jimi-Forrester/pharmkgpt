35055417|t|Prognostic Factors for Mortality, Activity of Daily Living, and Quality of Life in Taiwanese Older Patients within 1 Year Following Hip Fracture Surgery.
35055417|a|BACKGROUND: Hip fractures among older adults are a major public health concern worldwide. This study investigated the potential clinical factors that predict postoperative 1-year activities of daily living (ADL), quality of life (QoL), and mortality in Taiwanese older adults following hip fracture. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study enrolling older adults (>=60 years) who had undergone hip fracture surgery in a single medical center. The comprehensive clinical history of each patient was examined. QoL, ADL, and mortality events were recorded consecutively at 3, 6, and 12 months after operation. The multiple logistic regression model and the generalized estimating equation (GEE) were adopted to identify contributing factors for mortality and postoperative ADL and QoL prognosis, respectively. RESULTS: Among 377 participants with hip fracture, 48 died within 1 year of the index operation. ADL and QoL considerably decreased at 3 months following hip surgery. Old age, high Charlson Comorbidity Index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists grading were crucial predictors for mortality at the 1-year follow-up. The generalized estimating equation analysis indicated that the length of postoperative follow-up time, serum albumin level, patient cognitive status, and handgrip strength were considerably associated with QoL and ADL recovery prognosis in the Taiwanese older adults following hip fracture. CONCLUSIONS: Hip fractures have long-lasting effects on the older adults. Our data imply several prognosis predicting parameters that may assist clinicians in accounting for an individual's personalized risks in order to improve functional outcomes and reduce mortality.
