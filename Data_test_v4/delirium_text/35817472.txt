35817472|a|OBJECTIVES: The central nervous system disorder in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), called neuropsychiatric lupus (NPSLE), is one of the most severe phenotypes with various clinical symptoms, including mood disorder, psychosis and delirium as diffuse neuropsychological manifestations (dNPSLE). Although stress is one of the aggravating factors for neuropsychiatric symptoms, its role in the pathogenesis of dNPSLE remains to be elucidated. We aimed to investigate stress effects on the neuropsychiatric pathophysiology in SLE using lupus-prone mice and patients' data. METHODS: Sleep disturbance stress (SDS) for 2 weeks was placed on 6-8-week-old female MRL/lpr and control mice. Behavioural phenotyping, histopathological analyses and gene and protein expression analyses were performed to assess SDS-induced neuroimmunological alterations. We also evaluated cytokines of the cerebrospinal fluid and brain regional volumes in patients with dNPSLE and patients with non-dNPSLE. RESULTS: SDS-subjected MRL/lpr mice exhibited less anxiety-like behaviour, whereas stressed control mice showed increased anxiety. Furthermore, stress strongly activated the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in SDS-subjected MRL/lpr. A transcriptome analysis of the PFC revealed the upregulation of microglial activation-related genes, including Il12b. We confirmed that stress-induced microglial activation and the upregulation of interleukin (IL) 12/23p40 proteins and increased dendritic spines in the mPFC of stressed MRL/lpr mice. IL-12/23p40 neutralisation and tyrosine kinase 2 inhibition mitigated the stress-induced neuropsychiatric phenotypes of MRL/lpr mice. We also found a higher level of cerebrospinal fluid IL-12/23p40 and more atrophy in the mPFC of patients with dNPSLE than those with non-dNPSLE. CONCLUSIONS: The microglial IL-12/23 axis in the mPFC might be associated with the pathogenesis and a promising therapeutic target for dNPSLE.
