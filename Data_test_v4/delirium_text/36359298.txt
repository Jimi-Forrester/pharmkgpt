36359298|t|Fats, Friends or Foes: Investigating the Role of Short- and Medium-Chain Fatty Acids in Alzheimer's Disease.
36359298|a|Characterising Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a metabolic disorder of the brain is gaining acceptance based on the pathophysiological commonalities between AD and major metabolic disorders. Therefore, metabolic interventions have been explored as a strategy for brain energetic rescue. Amongst these, medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) supplementations have been reported to rescue the energetic failure in brain cells as well as the cognitive decline in patients. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) have also been implicated in AD pathology. Due to the increasing therapeutic interest in metabolic interventions and brain energetic rescue in neurodegenerative disorders, in this review, we first summarise the role of SCFAs and MCFAs in AD. We provide a comparison of the main findings regarding these lipid species in established AD animal models and recently developed human cell-based models of this devastating disorder.
