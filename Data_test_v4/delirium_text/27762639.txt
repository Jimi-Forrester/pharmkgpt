27762639|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by a low level of dopamine being expressing in the striatum and a deterioration of dopaminergic neurons (DAn) in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Generation of PD-derived DAn, including differentiation of human embryonic stem cells, human neural stem cells, human-induced pluripotent stem cells, and direct reprogramming, provides an ideal tool to model PD, creating the possibility of mimicking key essential pathological processes and charactering single-cell changes in vitro. Furthermore, thanks to the understanding of molecular neuropathogenesis of PD and new advances in stem-cell technology, it is anticipated that optimal functionally transplanted DAn with targeted correction and transgene-free insertion will be generated for use in cell transplantation. This review elucidates stem-cell technology for modeling PD and offering desired safe cell resources for cell transplantation therapy.
