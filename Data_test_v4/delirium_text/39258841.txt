39258841|a|INTRODUCTION: We examined the relations of misfolded alpha synuclein (alpha-synuclein) with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in two large independent cohorts. METHODS: We included Biomarkers for Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably Two (BioFINDER-2) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants (n = 2315, cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, AD dementia) who had cross-sectional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alpha-synuclein measurement from seed-amplification assay as well as cross-sectional and longitudinal amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau levels (measured in CSF and/or by positron emission tomography). All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and cognitive status. RESULTS: Across cohorts, the main biomarker associated with alpha-synuclein positivity at baseline was higher levels of Abeta pathology (all p values <= 0.02), but not tau. Looking at longitudinal measures of AD biomarkers, alpha-synuclein -positive participants had a statistically significant faster increase of Abeta load, although of modest magnitude (1.11 Centiloid/year, p = 0.02), compared to alpha-synuclein -negative participants in BioFINDER-2 but not in ADNI. DISCUSSION: We showed associations between concurrent misfolded alpha-synuclein and Abeta levels, providing in vivo evidence of links between these two molecular disease pathways in humans. HIGHLIGHTS: Amyloid beta (Abeta), but not tau, was associated with alpha-synuclein (alpha-synuclein) positivity. Such association was consistent across two cohorts, beyond the effect of age, sex, and cognitive status. alpha-synuclein-positive participants had a small, statistically significant faster increase in Abeta positron emission tomography levels in one of the two cohorts.
