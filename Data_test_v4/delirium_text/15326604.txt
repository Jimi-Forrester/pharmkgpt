15326604|t|Beta-hairpin conformation of fibrillogenic peptides: structure and alpha-beta transition mechanism revealed by molecular dynamics simulations.
15326604|a|Understanding the conformational transitions that trigger the aggregation and amyloidogenesis of otherwise soluble peptides at atomic resolution is of fundamental relevance for the design of effective therapeutic agents against amyloid-related disorders. In the present study the transition from ideal alpha-helical to beta-hairpin conformations is revealed by long timescale molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water solvent, for two well-known amyloidogenic peptides: the H1 peptide from prion protein and the Abeta(12-28) fragment from the Abeta(1-42) peptide responsible for Alzheimer's disease. The simulations highlight the unfolding of alpha-helices, followed by the formation of bent conformations and a final convergence to ordered in register beta-hairpin conformations. The beta-hairpins observed, despite different sequences, exhibit a common dynamic behavior and the presence of a peculiar pattern of the hydrophobic side-chains, in particular in the region of the turns. These observations hint at a possible common aggregation mechanism for the onset of different amyloid diseases and a common mechanism in the transition to the beta-hairpin structures. Furthermore the simulations presented herein evidence the stabilization of the alpha-helical conformations induced by the presence of an organic fluorinated cosolvent. The results of MD simulation in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE)/water mixture provide further evidence that the peptide coating effect of TFE molecules is responsible for the stabilization of the soluble helical conformation.
