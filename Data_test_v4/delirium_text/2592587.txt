2592587|t|The effect of food on the bioavailability of velnacrine (HP 029) in healthy elderly men: a potential Alzheimer agent.
2592587|a|Velnacrine (HP 029; 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-aminoacridin-1-ol-maleate) is an investigational drug being studied in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In this open, randomized, crossover study, 24 healthy, elderly men were given 100 mg of velnacrine on two different study days to assess the influence of food on the bioavailability of velnacrine. On the first day, subjects received drug either after an overnight fast or 15 minutes after completing a standard breakfast. Seven days later, the treatments were crossed over. Blood and urine samples were collected at specific times and various intervals, respectively, from all subjects before and after drug administration for up to 24 hours. Plasma and urine concentrations of velnacrine were determined by an HPLC method. Administration of velnacrine with food resulted in slightly lower peak plasma levels of unconjugated velnacrine, (175 vs 213 ng/ml) and delayed times-to-peak plasma levels, (2.5 vs 1.5 h) without affecting the AUCs and the t 1/2 of the drug. The amount of unconjugated velnacrine excreted in urine was slightly higher when the drug was taken with food (19 vs 17 mg), but renal clearance was not altered. These results indicate that food delayed the rate but not the extent of velnacrine absorption. The minor differences in Cmax and tmax may not be clinically meaningful. Therefore, velnacrine can be administered with or without food.
