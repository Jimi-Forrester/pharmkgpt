39663597|t|A Recent Update on the Role of Estrogen and Progesterone in Alzheimer's Disease.
39663597|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease responsible for 60%-80% dementia cases globally. The disease is more prevalent among elder females. Female reproductive hormones are found to be essential for cellular activities in brain. The physiological role of neurotrophins and sex hormones in hippocampal region during neurogenesis and neuron differentiation was studied as well. In addition to triggering cellular pathways, estrogen and progesterone carry out a number of biological processes that lead to neuroprotection. They might have an impact on learning and memory. One of estrogen's modest antioxidant properties is its direct scavenging of free radicals. The neurotrophic effect of estrogen and progesterone can be explained by their ability to rise the expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA. Additionally, they have the ability to degrade beta-amyloid and stop inflammation, apoptotic neuronal cell death, and tau protein phosphorylation. To enhance their neuroprotective action, various cross-talking pathways in cells that are mediated by estrogen, progesterone, and BDNF receptors. This include signaling by mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B, and phospholipase/protein kinase C. Clinical research to establish the significance of these substances are fragmented, despite publications claiming a lower prevalence of AD when medication is started before menopause. This review article emphasizes an update on the role of estrogen, and progesterone in AD.
