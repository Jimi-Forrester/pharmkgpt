37801640|t|Outcomes of Chylothorax Nonoperative Management After Cardiothoracic Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
37801640|a|INTRODUCTION: Chylothorax after thoracic surgery is a severe complication with high morbidity and mortality rate of 0.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06 - 0.02). There is no agreement on whether nonoperative treatment or early reoperation should be the initial intervention. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the outcomes of the conservative approach to treat chyle leakage after cardiothoracic surgeries. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in PubMed , Embase, Cochrane Library Central, and LILACS (Biblioteca Virtual em Saude) databases; a manual search of references was also done. The inclusion criteria were patients who underwent cardiothoracic surgery, patients who received any nonoperative treatment (e.g., total parenteral nutrition, low-fat diet, medium chain triglycerides), and studies that evaluated chylothorax resolution, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, infection, morbidity, and mortality. CENTRAL MESSAGE: Nonoperative treatment for chylothorax after cardiothoracic procedures has significant hospital stay, morbidity, mortality, and reoperation rates. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were selected. Pulmonary complications, infections, and arrhythmia were the most common complications after surgical procedures. The incidence of chylothorax in cardiothoracic surgery was 1.8% (95% CI 1.7 - 2%). The mean time of maintenance of the chest tube was 16.08 days (95% CI 12.54 - 19.63), and the length of hospital stay was 23.74 days (95% CI 16.08 - 31.42) in patients with chylothorax receiving nonoperative treatment. Among patients that received conservative treatment, the morbidity event was 0.40 (95% CI 0.23 - 0.59), and reoperation rate was 0.37 (95% CI 0.27 - 0.49). Mortality rate was 0.10 (95% CI 0.06 - 0.02). CONCLUSION: Nonoperative treatment for chylothorax after cardiothoracic procedures has significant hospital stay, morbidity, mortality, and reoperation rates.
