METHODS: EEG was obtained and neuropsychological performance assessed in 254 patients with AD. The EEGs were visually assessed for the presence of focal and/or diffuse abnormalities. Multivariate analysis of variance for repeated measures was performed with presence of focal and/or diffuse abnormalities as between-subjects factor and neuropsychological tests as within-subject factor. Age, sex and education were entered as covariates. RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent of the patients had a normal EEG, 32% had focal abnormalities, 14% diffuse abnormalities and 26% had both focal and diffuse abnormalities. Patients with a normal EEG presented with a cognitive profile in which memory was mostly impaired. Patients with focal and diffuse EEG abnormalities presented with a nonmemory profile. CONCLUSION: These results illustrate that specific types of EEG abnormalities are associated with different cognitive profiles in AD, providing biological support in terms of brain functioning for variability in cognitive impairment.
