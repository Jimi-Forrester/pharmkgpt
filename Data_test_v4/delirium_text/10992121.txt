10992121|a|Behavioral disorders are major manifestations of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. They are associated with caregiver distress, increase the likelihood of institutionalization and may be associated with more rapid cognitive decline. The first step of treatment strategy is an assessment of these disorders. Treatment of behavioral signs is an etiological treatment. Acute behavioral signs are often related to an unknown somatic disease. Chronic signs are often symptoms of the neurological dementia and can be reduced, especially by serotonergic agents and anticonvulsivants. The new antipsychotics are a good alternative to classic neuroleptics known for their frequent cognitive side effects in demented patients. Anticholinesterasic drugs can positively influence noncognitive signs. The treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) involves a number of specific interventions including cognitive stimulation which has shown effectiveness on both cognitive functions and quality of life. Prevention of BPSD includes safety measures such as evaluation of suicidality and violence, vigilance regarding neglect and abuse, planning for legal issues due to the patient's incapacity. Families or caregivers should be provided with counseling, education and support. The treatment of BPSD is part of a global and multimodal care which involves general practioners, nurses, social workers, physiotherapists, neuropsychologists, speech therapists, memory centers, psychogeriatric and geriatric units, and respite care units, nursing homes and long-term care facilities. The coordination of the professionals is a critical aspect of providing effective care for patients with Alzheimer's disease.
