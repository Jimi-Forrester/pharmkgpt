9338779|t|An intracellular protein that binds amyloid-beta peptide and mediates neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease.
9338779|a|Amyloid-beta is a neurotoxic peptide which is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. It binds an intracellular polypeptide known as ERAB, thought to be a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme, which is expressed in normal tissues, but is overexpressed in neurons affected in Alzheimer's disease. ERAB immunoprecipitates with amyloid-beta, and when cell cultures are exposed to amyloid-beta, ERAB inside the cell is rapidly redistributed to the plasma membrane. The toxic effect of amyloid-beta on these cells is prevented by blocking ERAB and is enhanced by overexpression of ERAB. By interacting with intracellular amyloid-beta, ERAB may therefore contribute to the neuronal dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease.
