37684547|t|Delirium in the NICU.
37684547|a|Delirium in the NICU is an underrecognized phenomenon in infants who are often complex and critically ill. The current understanding of NICU delirium is developing and can be informed by adult and pediatric literature. The NICU population faces many potential risk factors for delirium, including young age, developmental delay, mechanical ventilation, severe illness, and surgery. There are no diagnostic tools specific to infants. The mainstay of delirium treatment is to treat the underlying cause, address modifiable risk factors, and supportive care. This review will summarize current knowledge and areas where more research is needed.
