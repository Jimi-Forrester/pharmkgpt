38034177|t|Ralstonia mannitolilytica Bacteremia Stemming From Frequent Outpatient Intravenous Injections at a Local Clinic.
38034177|a|An 83-year-old, male patient was admitted with primary bacteremia caused by Ralstonia mannitolilytica. Before onset, he had been receiving regular injections at a local clinic for abnormal liver function. The present case is the first in which regular injections apparently served as the transmission route for R. mannitolilytica causing bacteremia and demonstrates that this disease can occur in clinics as well as hospitals, raising concerns about the hitherto unnoticed risk of excessive or inappropriate treatments at local clinics.
