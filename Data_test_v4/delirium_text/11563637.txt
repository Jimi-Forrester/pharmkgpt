11563637|a|This report concerns an autopsy case of argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) mimicking temporal Pick's disease. The patient was a Japanese woman without hereditary burden who was 89 years old at the time of death. She developed memory impairment and began wandering at the age of 74, followed by prominent character changes about 6 years after disease onset. A neurological examination 5 months before her death revealed poor rapport, unconcern, severe dementia, and double incontinence, without aphasia or muscle rigidity. Serial neuroradiological examination revealed progressive enlargement of the bilateral inferior horns of the lateral ventricle, reflecting progressive atrophy of the medial temporal lobes. Macroscopically, neuropathological examination showed circumscribed atrophy of the bilateral amygdalae, hippocampi, parahippocampal gyri, and lateral occipitotemporal gyri. Histologically, there was neuronal loss in the areas mentioned above, the caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, substantia nigra, and locus ceruleus, with ballooned neurons in the cerebral cortex and amygdala. Numerous argyrophilic grains with coiled bodies were present not only in the limbic system, but also in the affected cerebrum. Rare neurofibrillary changes were present in the limbic areas, consistent with Braak stage II, with no senile plaques. Based on these findings and a review of the literature, we note that AGD is clinicopathologically similar not only to mesolimbocortical dementia, but also to atypical senile dementia of Alzheimer type. This report may contribute to the elucidation of the clinicopathological hallmarks of AGD.
