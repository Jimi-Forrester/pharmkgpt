39109590|t|Structure-Activity Relationship of Fluorinated Benzenesulfonamides as Inhibitors of Amyloid-beta Aggregation.
39109590|a|Amyloid-beta aggregation is considered one of the factors influencing the onset of the Alzheimer's disease. Early prevention of such aggregation should alleviate disease condition by applying small molecule compounds that shift the aggregation equilibrium toward the soluble form of the peptide or slow down the process. We have discovered that fluorinated benzenesulfonamides of particular structure slowed the amyloid-beta peptide aggregation process by more than three-fold. We synthesized a series of ortho-para and meta-para double-substituted fluorinated benzenesulfonamides that inhibited the aggregation process to a variable extent yielding a detailed picture of the structure-activity relationship. Analysis of compound chemical structure effect on aggregation in artificial cerebrospinal fluid showed the necessity to arrange the benzenesulfonamide, hydrophobic substituent, and benzoic acid in a particular way. The amyloid beta peptide aggregate fibril structures varied in cross-sectional height depending on the applied inhibitor indicating the formation of a complex with the compound. Application of selected inhibitors increased the survivability of cells affected by the amyloid beta peptide. Such compounds may be developed as drugs against Alzheimer's disease.
