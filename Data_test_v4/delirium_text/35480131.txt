35480131|t|Sleep Quality and Related Determinants among Stroke Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study.
35480131|a|Objective: Effective rehabilitation and better quality of life among stroke patients are functions of several factors such as quality and pattern of sleep. The present study aimed to evaluate sleep quality and related determinants in such patients. Method: The present cross-sectional study was performed from October to December 2019 among stroke patients who were admitted to Sina Hospital, Hamadan, Iran. We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire to determine sleep quality in these patients. Significant determinants of the global score of PSQI were identified via multivariable linear regression. Results: A total of 97 stroke patients (age 67+-79 years, 55.7% male) were enrolled into the study. Prevalence of poor sleep was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.91) in stroke patients. Patients with nervous tension and those with surgical treatment and with Non-hemorrhagic CT scan had a predicted increase of 1.65, 2.91 and 3.25 in the mean of the global PSQI score (P <= 0.05), respectively. Conclusion: Nervous tension, treatment method, results of CT scan and cardiac problems may be associated with post-stroke sleep disorder.
