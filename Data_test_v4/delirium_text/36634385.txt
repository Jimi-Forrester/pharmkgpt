36634385|t|Neuronal hyperexcitability in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease - the influence of sleep and noradrenergic transmission.
36634385|a|The link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and network hypersynchrony - manifesting as epileptic activities - received considerable attention in the past decade. However, several questions remain unanswered as to its mechanistic underpinnings. Therefore, our objectives were (1) to better characterise epileptic events in the Tg2576 mouse model throughout the sleep-wake cycle and disease progression via electrophysiological recordings and (2) to explore the involvement of noradrenergic transmission in this pathological hypersynchrony. Over and above confirming the previously described early presence and predominance of epileptic events during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, we also show that these events do not worsen with age and are highly phase-locked to the section of the theta cycle during REM sleep where hippocampal pyramidal cells reach their highest firing probability. Finally, we reveal an antiepileptic mechanism of noradrenergic transmission via alpha1-adrenoreceptors that could explain the intriguing distribution of epileptic events over the sleep-wake cycle in this model, with potential therapeutic implications in the treatment of the epileptic events occurring in many AD patients.
