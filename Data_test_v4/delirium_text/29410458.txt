29410458|t|Heme interaction of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal peptide segment of human cystathionine-beta-synthase.
29410458|a|Cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) belongs to a large family of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes, responsible for the sulfur metabolism. The heme-dependent protein CBS is part of regulatory pathways also involving the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide. Malfunction of CBS can lead to pathologic conditions like cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. Truncation of residues 1-40, absent in X-ray structures of CBS, reduces but does not abolish the activity of the enzyme. Here we report the NMR resonance assignment and heme interaction studies for the N-terminal peptide stretch of CBS. We present NMR-spectral evidence that residues 1-40 constitute an intrinsically disordered region in CBS and interact with heme via a cysteine-proline based motif.
