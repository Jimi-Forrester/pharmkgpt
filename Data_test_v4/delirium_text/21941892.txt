21941892|t|GC/MS analysis of three Amaryllidaceae species and their cholinesterase activity.
21941892|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by the death of nerve cells in the cerebral cortex, is the most common subtype of dementia. Despite the exponential growth in the number of AD patients, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors are currently used to treat AD. Plants of the Amaryllidaceae family are known to synthesize a particular type of bioactive compounds, named Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, which have shown AChE inhibitory activity. Alkaloid extracts of three species of Amaryllidaceae were studied with respect to their acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity and alkaloid patterns. Eleven alkaloids were identified by GC/MS. Significant cholinesterase inhibitory activity was demonstrated by the alkaloid extract of N. undulata (IC50,(HuAChE) = 14.3 +/- 1.2 microg/mL; IC50,(HuBuChE) = 33.9 +/- 1.9 microg/mL).
