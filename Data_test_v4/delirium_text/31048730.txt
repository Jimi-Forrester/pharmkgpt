31048730|a|Fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) induces free radicals and oxidative stress in animals, leading to a range of illnesses. In this study, Ganoderma Microsporum immunomodulatory (GMI) proteins were administered to alleviate PM2.5-induced inflammatory responses in mother rats, and PM2.5-induced inflammatory responses and neurological damage in their offspring. The results suggested that GMI administration decreased the risk of neurological disorders in mother rats and their offspring by reducing the white blood cell count, lessening inflammatory responses and PM2.5-induced memory impairment, and preventing dendritic branches in the hippocampi from declining and microRNAs from PM2.5-induced modulation.
