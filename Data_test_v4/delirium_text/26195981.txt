26195981|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although delirium is generally regarded as a transient syndrome, persistence of delirium in patients with cognitive impairment - even with fatal outcome - has been reported as well. This study aims to describe the clinical features and neuropathological correlates of this type of delirium. METHODS: Inclusion criteria for this case series were: (1) severe persistent delirium until death, (2) history of cognitive decline and (3) consent for brain autopsy. Medical records were examined in combination with collected clinical data and neuropathological findings. RESULT: In 15 patients, all living at home before admission, episodes with delirium lasted for 4.2 months on average. No distinct medical causes of persistent delirium could be identified. Pathological diagnoses included Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies as well as single cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. CONCLUSION: Severe, persistent and fatal delirium in patients with cognitive impairment can occur relatively early in the disease trajectory and is associated with diverse neuropathologies.
