32999343|a|Obesity is common comorbidity in patients with schizophrenia. Previous studies have reported that homocysteine (Hcy) is increased in schizophrenia. However, no study has reported the association between BMI and Hcy levels in schizophrenia. This cross-sectional naturalistic study aimed to evaluate the relationship between BMI, Hcy and clinical symptoms in Chinese Han patients with chronic schizophrenia. Clinical and anthropometric data as well as plasma Hcy level and glycolipid parameters were collected. Psychopathology was measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Our results showed that compared with the low BMI group, the high BMI group had a higher PANSS general psychopathology subscore, higher levels of blood glucose, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (all p < 0.05). Hcy levels were negatively associated with BMI in patients (p < 0.001). Hcy level, the PANSS general psychopathology subscale, total cholesterol and education (all p < 0.05) were the influencing factors of high BMI. Our study suggest that Hcy level may be associated with BMI in patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, patients with high BMI show more severe clinical symptoms and higher glucose and lipid levels.
