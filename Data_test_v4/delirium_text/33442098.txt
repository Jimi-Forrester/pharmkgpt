33442098|t|Factors Associated with Mild Cognitive Impairment among Elderly Filipinos with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
33442098|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aims to identify factors associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among elderly Filipinos with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODOLOGY: This is an analytic cross-sectional study involving 133 elderly (>=60 years old) with Type 2 diabetes mellitus consecutively sampled from the General Medicine and Diabetes Clinics of the Philippine General Hospital. Eligible subjects were interviewed to gather demographic and clinical data. Body mass index, waist-hip ratio and mean blood pressure were computed. HBA1c, lipid profile, creatinine and urine proteinuria were tested or recorded if done recently. Dilated fundus examination via indirect ophthalmoscopy and 10-gram monofilament test were performed to detect retinopathy and neuropathy. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Philippines tool was administered to detect patients with probable MCI using a cutoff score of <=21. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the associated factors. RESULTS: Using MoCA-P tool, MCI has a rate of 45% among elderly Filipino diabetics. Having more than 12 years of education is significantly associated with lower odds of MCI. (OR 0.38 CI 0.18, 0.80, p value 0.010). CONCLUSION: The rate of MCI among Filipino elderly diabetics is high. Higher education is associated with lower odds of having MCI. Case-control or prospective cohort studies involving larger sample and non-diabetic population are recommended.
