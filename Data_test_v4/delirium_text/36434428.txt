36434428|t|Perioperative Indications for Gabapentinoids in Pediatrics: A Narrative Review.
36434428|a|In recent years, there has been increased interest in using gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) as part of multimodal medication plans or enhanced recovery after surgery protocols to mitigate several perioperative clinical challenges. Outcomes explored in the context of using gabapentinoids perioperatively in children are variable and include acute complications of pain, anxiety, nausea and vomiting, and emergence agitation, as well as the long-term postoperative outcome of chronic postsurgical pain. This narrative review describes the current literature regarding perioperative use of gabapentinoids in pediatric patients and aims to describe the role of gabapentinoids in the perioperative setting for each specific indication.
