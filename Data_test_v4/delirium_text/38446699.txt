38446699|t|Effect of Esketamine on Postoperative Delirium in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Valve Replacement with Cardiopulmonary Bypass: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
38446699|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of esketamine on the risk of postoperative delirium (POD) in adults undergoing on-pump cardiac valve surgery. METHODS: In this randomized, triple-blind, controlled trial, 116 adult patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade II or III and a New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade II or III who underwent cardiac valve surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were included. Esketamine (0.25 mg/kg) or normal saline was administered intravenously before anesthesia induction. The primary outcome was POD, defined as a positive delirium assessment according to the 3-minute confusion assessment method (CAM) or the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) on a twice-daily basis for 7 days after surgery. Delirium duration and the delirium subtype were also recorded. The cognitive status of patients was measured according to the Mini-Mental State Examination at baseline, discharge, 30 days postoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 112 patients (mean age, 52 years; 53.6% female) were enrolled; 56 were assigned to receive esketamine, and 56 were assigned to receive placebo. POD occurred in 13 (23.2%) patients in the esketamine group and in 25 (44.6%) patients in the placebo group (relative risk [RR], 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.91; P = .018). Thirteen patients (23.2%) in the esketamine group and 24 (42.9%) patients in the placebo group had multiple episodes of delirium (RR, 0.54, 95% CI, 0.28-0.92), and 13 (23.2%) vs 22 (39.3%) patients exhibited the hyperactive subtype. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of esketamine (0.25 mg/kg) injected intravenously before anesthesia induction reduced the incidence of delirium in relatively young patients with ASA grade II or III who underwent on-pump cardiac surgery.
