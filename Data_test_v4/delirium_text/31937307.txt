31937307|a|BACKGROUND: It is believed that deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain is the central pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which triggers a series of pathological processes. However, the relationship between dyslipidemia and AD is uncertain. Considering the peripheral Abeta levels are related to brain Abeta deposition, we explore the relationships between blood lipids and plasma Abeta. METHODS: Participants who lived in the selected village of Xi'an for more than 3 years were enrolled, aged 40-85 years (n = 1282, 37.9% male). Fasting blood lipid, plasma Abeta levels, basic information and living habits were measured. Multiple linear regressions were used. RESULTS: In total population, blood lipids were not associated with plasma Abeta. After stratified by blood pressure, serum total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-c) were positively associated with plasma Abeta42 levels (betaTC = 0.666, PTC = 0.024; betaLDL-c = 0.743, PLDL-c = 0.011, respectively) in normal blood pressure. LDL-c was negatively associated with plasma Abeta40 levels (beta = - 0.986, P = 0.037) in high blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Elevated plasma Abeta42 levels are associated with higher TC and LDL-c in normal blood pressure. Elevated plasma Abeta40 levels are associated with lower LDL-c in high blood pressure. This indicated that the relationships between blood lipids and plasma Abeta were confounded by blood pressure.
