37630980|a|Cadmium is an environmental contaminant associated with marked neurotoxicity and cognitive impairment. Linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, has demonstrated promising neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia and diabetic dementia. However, there has been no study of its effect on cadmium-induced cognitive deficits. In the present work, linagliptin's prospective neuroprotective effects against cadmium-evoked cognitive decline were examined in vivo in rats. The molecular pathways related to oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy were investigated. Histology, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and biochemical assays were performed on brain hippocampi after receiving linagliptin (5 mg/kg/day). The current findings revealed that cadmium-induced learning and memory impairment were improved by linagliptin as seen in the Morris water maze, Y-maze, and novel object recognition test. Moreover, linagliptin lowered hippocampal neurodegeneration as seen in histopathology. At the molecular level, linagliptin curtailed hippocampal DPP-4 and augmented GLP-1 levels, triggering dampening of the hippocampal neurotoxic signals Abeta42 and p-tau in rats. Meanwhile, it enhanced hippocampal acetylcholine and GABA and diminished the glutamate spike. The behavioral recovery was associated with dampening of the hippocampal pro-oxidant response alongside SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 axis stimulation. Meanwhile, linagliptin counteracted hippocampal apoptosis markers and inhibited the pro-apoptotic kinase GSK-3beta. In tandem, linagliptin activated hippocampal autophagy by lowering SQSTM-1/p62 accumulation, upregulating Beclin 1, and stimulating AMPK/mTOR pathway. In conclusion, linagliptin's antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and pro-autophagic properties advocated its promising neuroprotective impact. Thus, linagliptin may serve as a management approach against cadmium-induced cognitive deficits.
