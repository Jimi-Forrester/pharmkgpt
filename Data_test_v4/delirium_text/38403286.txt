38403286|t|Microglia in brain aging: An overview of recent basic science and clinical research developments.
38403286|a|Aging is characterized by progressive degeneration of tissues and organs, and it is positively associated with an increased mortality rate. The brain, as one of the most significantly affected organs, experiences age-related changes, including abnormal neuronal activity, dysfunctional calcium homeostasis, dysregulated mitochondrial function, and increased levels of reactive oxygen species. These changes collectively contribute to cognitive deterioration. Aging is also a key risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. For many years, neurodegenerative disease investigations have primarily focused on neurons, with less attention given to microglial cells. However, recently, microglial homeostasis has emerged as an important mediator in neurological disease pathogenesis. Here, we provide an overview of brain aging from the perspective of the microglia. In doing so, we present the current knowledge on the correlation between brain aging and the microglia, summarize recent progress of investigations about the microglia in normal aging, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and then discuss the correlation between the senescent microglia and the brain, which will culminate with a presentation of the molecular complexity involved in the microglia in brain aging with suggestions for healthy aging.
