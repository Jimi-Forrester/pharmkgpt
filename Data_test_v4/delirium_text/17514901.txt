17514901|a|More than 20 human diseases are related to protein misfolding which causes formation of amyloids, fibrillar aggregates of normally soluble proteins. Such diseases are called amyloid diseases or amyloidoses. Of them only prion diseases are transmissible. Amyloids of the prion type are described in lower eukaryotes. However, in contrast to mammalian prions, which cause incurable neurodegenerative diseases, prions of lower eukaryotes are related to some non-chromosomally inherited phenotypic traits. Here we summarize the results of studies of prions of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and of the use of yeast model for investigation of some human amyloidoses, such as prion diseases, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases.
