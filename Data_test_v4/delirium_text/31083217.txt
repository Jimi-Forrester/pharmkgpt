31083217|t|An atypical case of serotonin syndrome with normal dose of selective serotonin inhibitors: A case report.
31083217|a|RATIONALE: As increasing frequency of serotonergic drug use, SS (serotonin syndrome) occurred more than ever. But clinicians have not enough knowledge and experience about SS as a potentially life-threatening condition. SS is usually caused by the increased serotonin activity in the central nervous system which may due to a serotonergic agent overdose or the concomitant use of 2 or more serotonergic antidepressants. We report a case of SS due to a normal dose of selective serotonin inhibitors (SSRIs) thus to remind clinicians to pay attention to such patients and make an early diagnosis and initiation of therapy in the clinical practice. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report here a 49-year-old man presented with lethargic, less communicative, and insomnia for 20 days while a diagnosis of depression was considered and he was treated with SSRIs. DIAGNOSIS: The patient in our case fulfilled the 3 criteria existed now for diagnosing SS, including the Sternbach criteria, Radomski revised diagnostic criteria, and the Hunter serotonin toxicity criteria. INTERVENTIONS: All the antidepressants were stopped and cyproheptadine with an initial dose of 12 mg a day was started along with supportive care. The patient was also admitted to emergency intensive care unit for further treatment. He was sedated and paralyzed by intravenous Midazolam and Clonazepam along with physical cooling and supportive care. OUTCOMES: All of the patient's symptoms abated gradually and he soon could get off the bed and be communicative. Finally, the patient made a full recovery and he was discharged from the hospital. LESSONS: Our case suggests an atypical clinical course while the medicine the patient takes was not in so much dose. We assumed that there may have been some variation in metabolism of these agents, resulting in increased possibility that led to the subsequent syndrome. Thus, it is essential for clinicians to keep in mind when patients taking serotonergic agents who demonstrate acute change in their mental status. Besides, clinicians should be aware of such patients who seem to be sensitive to SSRIs, who may require a genetic testing before the initiation of SSRI therapy.
