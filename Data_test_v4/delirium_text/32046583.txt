32046583|t|Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementia Resources: Perspectives of African American and Caucasian Family Caregivers in Northwest Louisiana.
32046583|a|We examined knowledge of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), resources, and research opportunities among older African American (AA) and Caucasian caregivers. A mixed methods design integrated qualitative (focus group) and quantitative (survey) data from Northwest Louisiana. Eight focus groups (59 adults, 92% female, 78% AA, 25% rural) revealed limited knowledge. Quantitative findings from 117 ADRD caregivers (83% female, 72% AA, 30% limited heath literacy, 27% low income) indicated participants obtained information from providers (54%), friends and relatives (32%), and the internet (37%). Barriers to care were cost (24%) and lack of family agreement (17%). Few families used adult daycare (8%) or support groups (28%). Concerns about research participation were violation of privacy (30%) and fear of patient distress (27%). Distrust of doctors was minimal (3%). Findings did not vary by race. There is a need for clear, literacy-appropriate information about ADRD, caregiver resources, and clinical trials.
