37350305|a|OBJECTIVE: Accumulating studies have shown that circulating circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent novel biomarkers for many human diseases. We investigated whether plasma circPTP4A2 and circTLK2 levels are associated with stroke severity, infarct volume, stroke etiology, and functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. METHODS: We applied quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to measure plasma circPTP4A2 and circTLK2 levels of 236 AIS patients within 72 h of symptoms onset and 136 healthy controls. We further assessed the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), infarct size, the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification and the 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS) for each patient. RESULTS: At admission, plasma circPTP4A2 and circTLK2 levels in patients with moderate to severe stroke were significantly higher compared to those with mild stroke. Logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses indicated that they might function as predictive biomarkers for moderate to severe stroke. We also observed a medium positive correlation between these two circRNAs and NIHSS. Plasma circPTP4A2 and circTLK2 levels were slight positively correlated with cerebral infarct volume only in anterior circulation infarction (ACI) patients. Levels of both circPTP4A2 and circTLK2 were closely related with large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke. Moreover, changes within 7 days after admission in circPTP4A2 and circTLK2 were able to predict unfavorable clinical outcome 90 days after AIS. INTERPRETATION: These results demonstrate that plasma circPTP4A2 and circTLK2 strongly correlated with severity, subtypes and prognosis of AIS, and they could serve as promising biomarkers.
