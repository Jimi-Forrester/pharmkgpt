32742620|t|Personalized TMS: role of RNA genotyping.
32742620|a|PURPOSE: Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) such a transcranial magnetic stimulation, intermittent theta burst stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy have emerged as an efficacious and well-tolerated therapy for treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders. While novel NIBS techniques are an exciting addition to the current repertoire of neuropsychiatric therapies, their success is somewhat limited by the wide range of treatment responses seen among treated patients. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: In this study, the authors will review the studies on relevant genetic polymorphisms and discuss the role of RNA genotyping in personalizing NIBS. FINDINGS: Genome studies have revealed several genetic polymorphisms that may contribute for the heterogeneity of treatment response to NIBS where the presence of certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with responders versus nonresponders. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Historically, mental illnesses have been arguably some of the most challenging disorders to study and to treat because of the degree of biological variability across affected individuals, the role of genetic and epigenetic modifications, the diversity of clinical symptomatology and presentations and the interplay with environmental factors. In lieu of these challenges, there has been a push for personalized medicine in psychiatry that aims to optimize treatment response based on one's unique characteristics.
