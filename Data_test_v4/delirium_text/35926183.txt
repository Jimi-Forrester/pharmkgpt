35926183|t|Design and Development of Benzothiazole-Based Fluorescent Probes for Selective Detection of Abeta Aggregates in Alzheimer's Disease.
35926183|a|The formation and accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide are considered the crucial events that are responsible for the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we have designed and synthesized a series of fluorescent probes by using electron acceptor-donor end groups interacting with a pi-conjugating system for the detection of Abeta aggregates. The chemical structure of these probes denoted as RMs, having a conjugated pi-system (C C), showed a maximum emission in PBS (>600 nm), which is the best range for a fluorescent imaging probe. Among all these probes, RM-28 showed an excellent fluorescence property with an emission maximum of >598 nm upon binding to Abeta aggregates. RM-28 also showed high sensitivity (7.5-fold) and high affinities toward Abeta aggregates (Kd = 175.69 +- 4.8 nM; Ka = 0.5 x 107 M-1). It can cross the blood-brain barrier of mice efficiently. The affinity of RM-28 toward Abeta aggregates was observed in 3xTg-AD brain sections of the hippocampus and cortex region using a fluorescent imaging technique, as well as an in vitro fluorescence-based binding assay with Abeta aggregates. Moreover, RM-28 is highly specific to Abeta aggregates and does not bind with intracellular proteins like bovine serum albumin (BSA) and alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) aggregates. The results indicate that the probe RM-28 emerges as an efficient and veritable highly specific fluorescent probe for the detection of Abeta aggregates in both in vitro and in vivo model systems.
