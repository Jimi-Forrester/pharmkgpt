39725855|a|Mild cognitive impairment, dementia and osteoporosis are common diseases of ageing and, with the increasingly ageing global population, are increasing in prevalence. These conditions are closely associated, with shared risk factors, common underlying biological mechanisms and potential direct causal pathways. In this review, the epidemiological and mechanistic links between mild cognitive impairment, dementia and skeletal health are explored. Discussion will focus on how changes in brain and bone signalling can underly associations between these conditions, and will consider the molecular and cellular drivers in the context of inflammation and the gut microbiome. There is a complex interplay between nutritional changes, which may precede or follow the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, and bone health. Polypharmacy is common in patients with MCI or dementia, and there are difficult prescribing decisions to be made due to the elevated risk of falls associated with many drugs used for associated problems, which can consequently increase fracture risk. Some medications prescribed for cognitive impairment may directly impact bone health. In addition, patients may have difficulty remembering medication without assistance, meaning that osteoporosis drugs may be prescribed but not taken. Cognitive impairment may be improved or delayed by physical activity and exercise, and there is evidence for the additional benefits of physical activity on falls and fractures. Research gaps and priorities with the aim of reducing the burden of osteoporosis and fractures in people with MCI or dementia will also be discussed.
