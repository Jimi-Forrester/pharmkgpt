11880865|t|Socioeconomic and health status differences between depressed and nondepressed ED elders.
11880865|a|The objective of the study was to describe differences in demographics, medical conditions, and social situation between depressed and nondepressed elderly emergency department (ED) patients. We studied a prospective convenience sample of English-speaking ED patients greater-than-or-equal 65 years, without altered mental status, obvious dementia or delirium, participating in a depression screening study during an ED visit for a nonpsychiatric complaint. Demographics were collected. Research personnel administered the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination and a health questionnaire. A total of 103 subjects were enrolled. GDS identified 33 patients (32%) with DEP. DEP patients were more likely to report the following: lower income, lower education level, more medical conditions, less independence, assisted living, and poorer overall health than ND patients. A third of these elderly ED patients report symptoms consistent with depression. There are significant differences in socioeconomic characteristics, health status, and functional ability. Future depression studies should focus on elders with these characteristics.
