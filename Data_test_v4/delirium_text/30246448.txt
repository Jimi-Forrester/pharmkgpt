30246448|a|AIM: Delirium is common and dangerous among elderly inpatients; yet, it is underdiagnosed and thus undertreated. This study aimed to test the diagnostic characteristics of a noninvasive point-of-care device with two-channel (bispectral) electroencephalography (EEG) for the screening of delirium in the hospital. METHODS: Patients admitted to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics were assessed for the presence of delirium with a clinical assessment, the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit and Delirium Rating Scale. Subsequently, we obtained a 10-min bispectral EEG (BSEEG) recording from a hand-held electroencephalogram device during hospitalization. We performed power spectral density analysis to differentiate between those patients with and without delirium. RESULTS: Initially 45 subjects were used as a test dataset to establish a cut-off. The BSEEG index was determined to be a significant indicator of delirium, with sensitivity 80% and specificity 87.7%. An additional independent validation dataset with 24 patients confirmed the validity of the approach, with a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 83.3%. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, the BSEEG method was able to distinguish delirious patients from non-delirious patients. Our data showed the feasibility of this technology for mass screening of delirium in the hospital.
