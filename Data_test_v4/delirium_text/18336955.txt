18336955|t|No association of DAPK1 and ABCA2 SNPs on chromosome 9 with Alzheimer's disease.
18336955|a|Recently genetic variation in the DAPK1 and ABCA2 genes has been reported to be associated with late- and early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), respectively. We examined the most significant two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DAPK1 in a large case-control cohort of late-onset subjects and matched controls and one of the most significant SNPs in ABCA2 in a small set of early-onset subjects as well. We did not detect associations with AD for any variation.
