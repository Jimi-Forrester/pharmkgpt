37457560|a|Background: The negative impact of long COVID on social life and human health is increasingly prominent, and the elevated risk of cardiovascular disease in patients recovering from COVID-19 has also been fully confirmed. However, the pathogenesis of long COVID-related inflammatory cardiomyopathy is still unclear. Here, we explore potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of long COVID-associated inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Methods: Datasets that met the study requirements were identified in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained by the algorithm. Then, functional enrichment analysis was performed to explore the basic molecular mechanisms and biological processes associated with DEGs. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and analyzed to identify hub genes among the common DEGs. Finally, a third dataset was introduced for validation. Results: Ultimately, 3,098 upregulated DEGs and 1965 downregulated DEGs were extracted from the inflammatory cardiomyopathy dataset. A total of 89 upregulated DEGs and 217 downregulated DEGs were extracted from the dataset of convalescent COVID patients. Enrichment analysis and construction of the PPI network confirmed VEGFA, FOXO1, CXCR4, and SMAD4 as upregulated hub genes and KRAS and TXN as downregulated hub genes. The separate dataset of patients with COVID-19 infection used for verification led to speculation that long COVID-associated inflammatory cardiomyopathy is mainly attributable to the immune-mediated response and inflammation rather than to direct infection of cells by the virus. Conclusion: Screening of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets sheds new light on the pathogenesis of long COVID-associated inflammatory cardiomyopathy as well as potential therapeutic approaches. Further clinical studies are needed to explore these possibilities in light of the increasingly severe negative impacts of long COVID.
