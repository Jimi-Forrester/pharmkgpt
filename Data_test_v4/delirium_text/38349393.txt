38349393|t|Targeting monoamine oxidase A: a strategy for inhibiting tumor growth with both immune checkpoint inhibitors and immune modulators.
38349393|a|Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is a membrane-bound mitochondrial enzyme present in almost all vertebrate tissues that catalyzes the degradation of biogenic and dietary-derived monoamines. MAOA is known for regulating neurotransmitter metabolism and has been implicated in antitumor immune responses. In this review, we retrospect that MAOA inhibits the activities of various types of tumor-associated immune cells (such as CD8+ T cells and tumor-associated macrophages) by regulating their intracellular monoamines and metabolites. Developing novel MAOA inhibitor drugs and exploring multidrug combination strategies may enhance the efficacy of immune governance. Thus, MAOA may act as a novel immune checkpoint or immunomodulator by influencing the efficacy and effectiveness of immunotherapy. In conclusion, MAOA is a promising immune target that merits further in-depth exploration in preclinical and clinical settings.
