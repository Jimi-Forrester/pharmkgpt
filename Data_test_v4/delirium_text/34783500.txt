34783500|t|Recent-Onset Altered Mental Status: Evaluation and Management.
34783500|a|Potential precipitating factors for the recent onset of altered mental status (AMS) include primary central nervous system insults, systemic infections, metabolic disturbances, toxin exposure, medications, chronic systemic diseases, and psychiatric conditions. Delirium is also an important manifestation of AMS, especially in older people who are hospitalized. Clinicians should identify and treat reversible causes of the AMS, some of which require urgent intervention to minimize morbidity and mortality. A history and physical examination guide diagnostic testing. Laboratory testing, chest radiography, and electrocardiography help diagnose infections, metabolic disturbances, toxins, and systemic conditions. Neuroimaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging should be performed when the initial evaluation does not identify a cause or raises concern for intracranial pathology. Lumbar puncture and electroencephalography are also important diagnostic tests in the evaluation of AMS. Patients at increased risk of AMS benefit from preventive measures. The underlying etiology determines the definitive treatment. When intervention is needed to control patient behaviors that threaten themselves or others, nonpharmacologic interventions are preferred to medications. Physical restraints should rarely be used and only for the shortest time possible. Medications should be used only when nonpharmacologic treatments are ineffective.
