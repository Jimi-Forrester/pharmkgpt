36760099|t|Effect of Acupoint Therapies on Postoperative Sleep Quality: A Narrative Review.
36760099|a|Several studies have reported that sleep quality often decreases in patients after surgery, especially in elderly patients, which seriously affects postoperative prognosis and outcomes, inducing diseases such as postoperative delirium, long-term chronic pain, and potentially fatal cardiovascular events. With the popularization of comfortable medicine, medical workers pay more attention to the postoperative sleep quality of patients. The causes underlying the decrease in postoperative sleep quality may include postoperative pain, the severity of surgical trauma and stress, perioperative anxiety and depression, and postoperative complications. Patients with insomnia often use acupoint therapies as a safe and effective alternative to drugs. Acupoint therapies are among the oldest medical therapies of Traditional Chinese Medicine and are gradually gaining recognition among medical workers worldwide. Various types of acupoint stimulation methods such as transcutaneous electrical acupoint simulation (TEAS), acupressure, acupuncture, and electroacupuncture can change the brain's local electrical activity, inhibit the central nervous system, and achieve deep sedation through stimulating the related acupoints, which provides a novel idea and basis for improvement in factors affecting postoperative sleep quality. This review explores the mechanism of acupoint therapies from several aspects of affecting the sleep quality of patients after surgery and its clinical results. We found that acupoint therapies effectively improve sleep quality and alleviate the postoperative complications of patients, and we emphasize the importance of acupoint therapies to guide future research and clinical practice. Large-scale, multicenter studies are needed to determine the optimal duration, frequency, and timing of acupoint stimulation for improving postoperative sleep quality.
