38435687|a|Background: With the development of healthcare services, drug efficacy, and safety have become the focus of drug use, and processing alters drug toxicity and efficacy, exploring the effects of processing on Evodiae fructus (EF) can guide the clinical use of drugs. Methods: Fifty male Kunming mice were randomly divided into the control group (CCN), raw small-flowered EF group (CRSEF), raw medium-flowered EF group (CRMEF), processing small-flowered EF group (CPSEF), and processing medium-flowered EF group (CPMEF). The CRSEF, CRMEF, CPSEF, and CPMEF groups were gavaged with aqueous extracts of raw small-flowered EF dry paste (RSEF), medium-flowered EF dry paste (RMEF), processing small-flowered EF dry paste (PSEF) and processing medium-flowered EF dry paste (PMEF), respectively, for 21 days at 5 times the pharmacopeial dosage. Upon concluding the experiment, histopathological sections of liver and kidney tissues were examined. Additionally, levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum creatinine (SCr), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were determined. DNA from the intestinal contents of the mice was extracted, and 16S rRNA full-length high-throughput sequencing was performed. Results: After fed EF 21 days, mice exhibited a decreasing trend in body weight. Comparative analysis with the CCN group revealed an upward trend in SCr, BUN, AST, and ALT levels in both CRSEF and CRMEF groups. The CRMEF group displayed notably elevated BUN and AST levels, with an observed increasing trend in Scr and ALT. Kidney sections unveiled cellular edema and considerable inflammatory cell infiltrates, whereas significant liver damage was not evident. Compared with CRSEF, Bun levels were significantly lower while AST levels were significantly higher in the CPMEF group. Additionally, the intestinal microbiota diversity and the relative abundance of Psychrobacter decreased significantly, and the relative abundance of Staphylococcus, Jeotgalicoccus, and Salinicoccus increased significantly in the CPMEF group. AST, ALT, and SCr were positively correlated with Staphylococcus, Jeotgalicoccus, and Salinicoccus. Conclusion: In conclusion, PMEF significantly increased harmful bacteria (Staphylococcus, Jeotgalicoccus, and Salinicoccu) and decreased beneficial bacteria. SEF with 5 times the clinical dose showed nephrotoxicity and SEF nephrotoxicity decreased after processing, but EF hepatotoxicity was not significant, which may be due to insufficient dose concentration and time.
