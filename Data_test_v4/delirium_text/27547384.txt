27547384|a|The treatment of hip fractures in the elderly represents a major public health priority and a source of ongoing debate among orthopaedic surgeons and anesthesiologists. Most of these injuries are treated with surgery in an expedient fashion. From the surgical perspective, there are certain special considerations in this population including osteoporosis, pre-existing arthritis, age, activity level, and overall health that contribute to the type of surgical fixation performed. Open reduction and internal fixation versus arthroplasty remain the two major categories of treatment. While the indications and treatment algorithms still remain controversial, the overall goal for these patients is early mobilization and prevention of morbidity and mortality. The use of preoperative, regional anesthesia has aided in this effort. The purpose of this review article is to examine the various treatment modalities for hip fractures in the elderly and discuss the most recent evidence in the face of a rapidly aging population.
