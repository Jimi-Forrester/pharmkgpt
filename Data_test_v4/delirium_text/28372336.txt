28372336|t|Alterations in the Balance of Amyloid-beta Protein Precursor Species in the Cerebrospinal Fluid of Alzheimer's Disease Patients.
28372336|a|We recently demonstrated that soluble forms of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (sAbetaPP) assemble into multimeric complexes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which contributes to the underestimation of specific sAbetaPP species when assessed by ELISA. To circumvent this issue, we analyzed by SDS-PAGE large fragments of sAbetaPP and their variants in the CSF from Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 20) and control (n = 20) subjects, probing with specific antibodies against particular domains. Similar levels of sAbetaPPalpha and sAbetaPPbeta protein were found in CSF samples from AD and controls, yet there appeared to be a shift in the balance of the soluble full-length AbetaPP (sAbetaPPf) species in AD samples, with a decrease in the proportion of the lower (~100 kDa) band relative to the upper (~120 kDa) band. Similar differences were observed in the contribution of the major KPI-immunoreactive AbetaPP species. CSF samples also displayed differences in the correlations of AbetaPP species with classical AD biomarkers, particularly with respect to the Abeta42 peptide. The differences reveal alterations that probably reflect pathophysiological changes in the brain.
