9628148|t|Motor activity rhythm in dementia with delirium.
9628148|a|Using an actigraph, the activity patterns in 13 demented patients with delirium were examined. We analyzed the data of the eight patients, wearing the actigraphs for more than 10 days. They were classified into four types: type A, nocturnal delirium type; type B, wandering type; type C, hypobulia type; and type D, lying down type. The day to day activity variation was most prominent in type A and seemingly the least in type B. The dominant period of activity rhythm was nearly 24 h in all cases. Additional 12-h period was observed in type C. Actigraphs might become useful in making therapeutic decisions regarding demented patients with delirium.
