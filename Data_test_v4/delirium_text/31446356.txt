31446356|t|Functional implications of pH-induced conformational changes in the Sphingosine kinase 1.
31446356|a|Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) catalyzes the conversion of sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate that acts as a bioactive signalling molecule, and regulates various cellular processes including lymphocyte trafficking, angiogenesis and response to apoptotic stimuli. Abnormal expression of SphK1 has been observed in a wide range of cancers highlighting their role in tumour growth and metastasis. This enzyme also plays a critical role in metabolic and inflammatory diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, diabetic neuropathy and Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we have investigated the structural and conformational changes in SphK1 at varying pH using various spectroscopic techniques. Consistent results were observed with the function of SphK1 at corresponding pH values. SphK1 maintains its secondary and tertiary structure in the pH range of 7.5-10.0. However, protein aggregation was observed in the acidic pH range (4.0-6.5). At pH 2.0, the SphK1 exists in the molten-globule state. Kinase assay also shows that SphK1 activity was optimal in the pH range of 7.5-8.5. To complement in vitro results, we have performed 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation to examine the effect of pH on the structural stability of SphK1 at molecular level. SphK1 maintains its native conformation in the alkaline pH range with some residual fluctuations detected at acidic pH. A considerable correlation was noticed between spectroscopic, enzymatic activity and MD simulation studies. pH dependent structural changes can be further implicated to understand its association with disease condition, and cellular homeostasis with respect to protein function under variable pH conditions.
