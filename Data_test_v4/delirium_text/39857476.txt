39857476|t|Socio-Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Substance Intoxication Receiving a Psychiatric Assessment in the Emergency Department of the Maggiore Della Carita Hospital, Novara, Italy.
39857476|a|Patients intoxicated with alcohol or other substances are often assessed and assisted in the context of the Emergency Department (ED) by emergency physicians, who usually require a psychiatric assessment. This study aims to analyse the characteristics of a sample of patients receiving a psychiatric consultation in the ED setting of the Maggiore della Carita University Hospital in Novara, Italy, in the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023, to find out whether and how patients screening positive for alcohol/drugs differ from those screening negative. Socio-demographic and clinical history information and clinical data related to the ED psychiatric consultations were extracted from the PsNet database, a collection of data extracted from the application that serves as the electronic medical record for patients accessing the ED. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 and STATA version 17 software. Chi-square/Fisher tests, t-tests, and both univariate and multivariate logistic models were employed. Most of the findings regarding socio-demographic characteristics, symptoms observed during the 1362 psychiatric consultations, and treatments received by a total of 922 patients in the ED were consistent with the literature on this topic. However, some results only partially aligned with previous studies, particularly concerning the higher frequency of anxiety and psychotic symptoms, as well as cognitive impairments, observed in consultations for patients who tested negative for alcohol or substances. Interpreting these findings is complex and raises important questions, which may be addressed more effectively by expanding the sample size (extending the research to other EDs) and analysing its characteristics in greater detail. In this regard, improving diagnostic methods for detecting substance use through laboratory tests would also be beneficial.
