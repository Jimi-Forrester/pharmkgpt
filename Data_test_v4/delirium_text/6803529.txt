6803529|t|Epileptic seizures in the elderly: II. Diagnostic problems.
6803529|a|Three principal diagnostic problems were encountered in a group of 81 elderly patients with epileptic seizures: Post-ictal paresis (Todd's palsy) occurred in 13 patients (16%), of whom seven had evidence of past or present cerebral infarction, and six no such evidence. The paresis lasted up to 4 days, and could be confused with recurrent infarction or a transient ischaemic episode. Ictal and post-ictal confusional states of 24 h or more duration (up to 7-8 days) were noted in 11 patients (14%). They occurred in association with normal intellectual function as well as with pre-existing dementia, and required to be distinguished from other causes of delirium. Two patients presented paroxysmal sensory phenomena of ictal type. The differential diagnosis of episodic pain in hemiplegic limbs is discussed.
