36401492|a|BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy and feasibility of using a modified Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score of 13 or 15 as the criterion for switching chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with respiratory failure to sequential invasive-noninvasive ventilation. METHODS: COPD patients with respiratory failure who had undergone endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) between June 2017 and June 2020 at 4 different hospitals in China were included. A total of 296 patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. In group A, the patients were extubated and immediately placed on noninvasive ventilation (NIV) when the modified GCS score reached 13. In group B, the same was done when the modified GCS score reached 15. RESULTS: No significant differences in the mean blood pressure, oxygenation index, arterial partial pressure of oxygen, and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide were seen between groups A and B before extubation and 3 hours after NIV. The re-intubation times were also similar in the 2 groups. Compared to group B, the length of hospital stay, incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia, and time of invasive ventilation were all significantly lower in group A (P = .041, .001, <.001). CONCLUSION: Using a modified GCS score of 13 as the criterion for switching from IMV to NIV can significantly reduce the duration of IMV, length of hospital stay, and incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia in COPD patients with respiratory failure.
