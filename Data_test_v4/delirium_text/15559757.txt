This study aims to examine the specific nature of the association between BPSD in AD and the global severity of illness measured by Global Deterioration Scale(GDS) in antipsychotic-naive AD patients in Korea. METHODS: A total of 562 antipsychotics-naive AD patients were recruited from four different groups [a geriatric mental hospital (n = 145), a semi-hospitalized dementia institution (n = 120), a dementia clinic (n = 114) and community-dwelling dementia patients (n = 183)]. BPSD exhibited by AD patients were measured using the 25-item Korean version of the BEHAVE-AD. RESULTS: Ninety-two percent (n = 517) of AD patients had at least one BPSD, while 56% (n=315) had 4 or more BPSD. Specific kinds of behavioral disturbance peak at the stages of moderate AD (GDS stage 5) or moderately severe AD (GDS stage 6). AD patients left at home without any treatment had higher frequency of BPSD than did other groups seeking treatment, although all of them were antipsychotic-naive. CONCLUSION: BPSD potentially remediable to treatment were highly frequent in Korean AD patients. Health policies to meet the unmet needs of elderly Koreans are urgently needed, especially for AD patients at home without treatment.
