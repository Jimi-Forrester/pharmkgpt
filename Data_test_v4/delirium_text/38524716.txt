38524716|t|Evaluation of the Surgical Treatment of Patients over 90 Years Old with Hip Fractures and Their Morbidity and Mortality.
38524716|a|Objective:  Hip fractures in older adults have the highest impact on the patient's health. These injuries result in many complications, reducing functional capability, quality of life, and life expectancy. This study aimed to provide more epidemiological data on the outcomes of these fractures in nonagenarians from a large city treated at a tertiary hospital. Methods:  This study consisted of medical record reviews and interviews. Results:  In this study, 76 patients underwent 82 surgeries. The mean age of the patients was 92.5 years. Ninety percent of the subjects were female. The patients spent 10.4 days in hospital. Surgery occurred on average 2.3 days after hospitalization. Regarding fractures, 46 were trochanteric (56%), and 34 affected the femoral neck (41.5%). Forty-one surgeries used the short proximal femoral nail (50%), and 18 were partial hip replacements (22%). During hospitalization, 46 patients (55%) had no complications, excluding episodes of delirium, and seven patients (9%) died. Forty-two subjects completed the one-year postoperative follow-up period, with 56% alive and 44% dead. Conclusions:  Treating hip fractures in older patients is challenging. Our goal must focus on helping these subjects receive the quickest and least aggressive treatment possible and start mobilization early. We hope the data presented in this study can lead to a better understanding of the characteristics of our nonagenarian population with hip fractures and seek the best possible treatment for them.
