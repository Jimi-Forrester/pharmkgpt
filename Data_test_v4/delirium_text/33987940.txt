33987940|a|AIMS: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a specialized and indispensable structure in brain blood vessels that is damaged during Alzheimer's disease (AD). CD147 is expressed on the BBB and deeply engaged in the AD pathological process. In this study, we aimed to provide a better understanding of the roles of CD147 in BBB function in health and neurodegenerative disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured CD147 expression in mouse brains and demonstrated that CD147 is exclusively expressed in brain endothelial cells (BECs), and its expression decreases with age. After constructing endothelial-specific CD147 knockout mice, we performed RNA-sequencing on BECs isolated from mice of different ages as well as a range of database analyses. We found that endothelial CD147 is essential for the dual functions of the BBB, including barrier maintenance and transporter regulation. This study also shows that CD147 plays a pivotal role in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in AD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that targeting CD147 in BECs may represent a novel therapeutic strategy, which promoted the design of future experimental investigations and the mechanistic understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.
