36072451|a|Expectations for treatment have a favorable effect on the subsequent course of pain and behavior in patients. It is not known whether receiving hydrodissection while patients view their ultrasound image with doctors (visual feedback) is associated with positive treatment expectations. This was an exploratory, prospective, observational clinical trial. We explored the possibility that visual feedback immediately after ultrasound-guided hydrodissection increases the expectations for treatment, which could be one of the related factors for pain reduction. Treatment expectations were set as mediators of pain using path analysis. The primary endpoint was the numerical rating scale to assess expectations for treatment immediately after hydrodissection, between with and without the visual feedback. During 2019 and 2020, 136 outpatients received ultrasound-guided hydrodissection for myofascial pain syndrome. Of these, 65 (47.8%) patients received visual feedback during ultrasound-guided hydrodissection. Compared with the non-visual feedback group, the visual feedback group had higher expectations for treatment immediately after hydrodissection, and their expectations were maintained at day 14 of treatment (p < 0.001). A numerical rating scale (NRS) to assess expectations for treatment was similar before hydrodissection and immediately after hydrodissection was 8.4 (standard deviations, 1.6) in the visual feedback and 5.9 (standard deviations, 2.6) in the visual feedback. The proportion of increased expectations immediately after hydrodissection was 90.8% (95% CI: 83.7-97.9) in visual feedback group and 38.0% (95% CI: 26.7-49.3) in non-visual feedback group (p < 0.001). In the visual feedback group, 67.7% of patients showed improvement in pain numerical rating scale score by 50% or more at day 14, whereas such improvement was observed in only 36.6% of the non-visual feedback group (p < 0.001). Based on path analysis, the visual feedback had the greatest influence on pain numerical rating scale reduction at 14 days, indirectly due to increased expectations for treatment as a mediator (beta = 0.434). However, the adjusted R 2 values, which is the overall fit of the model, was low at 0.298. Visual feedback during ultrasound-guided hydrodissection increases the expectations for treatment immediately after hydrodissection, which could be one of the related factors for pain reduction in patients with myofascial pain syndrome.
