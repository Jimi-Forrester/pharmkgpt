29580683|t|Mandibular reconstruction with free fibula flaps in the elderly: a retrospective evaluation.
29580683|a|The purpose of this study was to evaluate surgical outcomes in elderly patients who had undergone free fibula flap transfer for malignant head and neck tumours. A retrospective chart review was performed to identify patients who had undergone free fibula flap transfer for mandibular reconstruction after malignant tumour resection at Jichi Medical University Hospital between May 2009 and April 2015. Enrolled patients were divided into an elderly group (>=80years old) and a younger group (<80years old). Seventeen patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the elderly group. Age at surgery ranged from 80 to 92years. Thirteen patients (76.5%) experienced postoperative complications. Surgical site complications occurred in seven patients. The success rate of free fibula flap transfer was 100%. Systemic complications occurred in nine patients, most commonly delirium (n=6). No perioperative mortality was encountered. The overall 1-year survival rate was 94.1% (16/17). No patient reported gait disturbance as a donor site complication or any other major complication. The incidence of postoperative complications did not differ significantly between the elderly and younger groups. Almost no difference in postoperative course was seen between the groups. Elderly patients appear to tolerate free fibula flap reconstruction just as well as younger patients.
