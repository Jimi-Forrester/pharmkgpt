36129571|t|The Emerging Field of Psychedelic Psychotherapy.
36129571|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Few treatments are available for patients with mood disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who have already failed multiple interventions. After several decades when research into psychedelics was effectively halted by federal legislation, the past several years have shown the re-emergence of thoughtful investigations studying the utility of compounds such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and psilocybin. RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies have coupled the safe administration of psychedelic compounds in a controlled environment after several hours of preparation of study participants and followed by multiple sessions to integrate the psychedelic experience. The improvement participants experience appear related to the often profound perspective changes experienced and seem unlike the improvements seen in the currently available care paradigms. Studies cited include treatment resistant depression, end of life despair, and PTSD. Psychedelic psychotherapy, a unique remarriage of biological therapy and psychotherapy, has the potential to transform mental health care.
