16415937|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer dementia is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by loss of memory and other cognitive functions. Oxidative stress is a possible pathogenetic factor and the anti-oxidating vitamins C and E could therefore have a beneficial effect and reduce the damage caused by beta-amyloid. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The relevant literature (several observational studies and two clinical controlled trials) describing effects of vitamin C and E in Alzheimer dementia have been evaluated. RESULTS: Several observational studies in mostly healthy, elderly individuals have indicated that vitamin C and E, mainly from food as well as the combination of high doses of the same vitamins, may have beneficial effect on the development of Alzheimer dementia. One clinical controlled trial in patients with manifest Alzheimer dementia, in which vitamin E 2000 mg/day was given as the only vitamin, has to a certain extent confirmed these results. INTERPRETATION: A causal relationship between intake of the vitamins and Alzheimer dementia has not been clarified. The correct dosages are not known, but a diet rich in these vitamin could probably reduce the risk of dementia. With a high intake of vitamin E, the addition of vitamin C is necessary.
