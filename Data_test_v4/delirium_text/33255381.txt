33255381|a|Laminaria japonica is widely cultivated in East Asia, including South Korea. Fucoidan, a main component of L. japonica, protects neurons from neurological disorders such as ischemia and traumatic brain injury. In the present study, we examined the effects of extract from fermented L. japonica on the reduction of proliferating cells and neuroblasts in mice that were physically (with electric food shock) or psychologically (with visual, auditory and olfactory sensation) stressed with the help of a communication box. Vehicle (distilled water) or fermented L. japonica extract (50 mg/kg) were orally administered to the mice once a day for 21 days. On the 19th day of the treatment, physical and psychological stress was induced by foot shock using a communication box and thereafter for three days. Plasma corticosterone levels were significantly increased after exposure to physical stress and decreased Ki67 positive proliferating cells and doublecortin immunoreactive neuroblasts. In addition, western blot analysis demonstrated that physical stress as well as psychological stress decreased the expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the number of phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB) positive nuclei in the dentate gyrus. Fermentation of L. japonica extract significantly increased the contents of reduced sugar and phenolic compounds. Supplementation with fermented L. japonica extract significantly ameliorated the increases of plasma corticosterone revels and decline in the proliferating cells, neuroblasts, and expression of BDNF and pCREB in the physically stressed mice. These results indicate that fermented L. japonica extract has positive effects in ameliorating the physical stress induced reduction in neurogenesis by modulating BDNF and pCREB expression in the dentate gyrus.
