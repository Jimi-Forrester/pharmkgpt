28671605|a|Dysfunction of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Although agonists for the glycine-binding sites of NMDA receptors have potential as new medication for schizophrenia, their modulation of antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) has not yet been clarified. We herein evaluated the effects of glycine-binding site stimulants of NMDA receptors on antipsychotic-induced EPS in mice and rats. d-cycloserine (DCS) and d-serine significantly improved haloperidol (HAL)-induced bradykinesia in mice, whereas glycine showed no effects. Sodium benzoate, a d-amino acid oxidase inhibitor, also attenuated HAL-induced bradykinesia. Improvements in HAL-induced bradykinesia by DCS were antagonized by the NMDA antagonist dizocilpine or nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NG-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. In addition, DCS significantly reduced HAL-induced Fos expression in the dorsolateral striatum without affecting that in the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, a microinjection of DCS into the substantia nigra pars compacta significantly inhibited HAL-induced EPS concomitant with elevations in dopamine release in the striatum. The present results demonstrated for the first time that stimulating the glycine-binding sites of NMDA receptors alleviates antipsychotic-induced EPS by activating the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, suggesting that glycine-binding site stimulants are beneficial not only for efficacy, but also for side-effect management.
