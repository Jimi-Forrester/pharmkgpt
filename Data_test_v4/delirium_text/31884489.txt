31884489|a|The three isoforms of 3R-tau are predominantly deposited in neurons bearing neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD), while only 3R-tau accumulation has been detected in Pick's disease (PiD), suggesting the involvement of 3R-tau in neurodegeneration. However, both the role and the molecular mechanism of 3R-tau in neurodegeneration are elusive. Here, we co-expressed three isoforms of human wild-type 3R-tau in adult mouse hippocampal to mimic the pathologic tau accumulating observed in PiD patients. We found that co-expressing three 3R-tau isoforms induced hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of tau proteins; simultaneously, the mice showed remarkable neuron death with synapse and memory deficits. Further in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that co-expressing 3R-tau isoforms caused oxidative stress evidenced by an increased malondialdehyde, and the decreased superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase; the 3R-tau accumulation also induced significant glial activation and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Notably, the toxic effects of 3R-tau accumulation were efficiently reversed by administration of antioxidants Vitamin E (VitE) and Vitamin C (VitC), respectively. These data reveal that intracellular accumulation of 3R-tau isoforms in adult brain induces significant neuron death and memory deficits with the mechanism involving oxidation-mediated DSBs; and the antioxidants VitE and VitC can efficiently attenuate the toxicities of 3R-tau. Given that no significant cell death has been detected in the currently available wild-type tau-accumulating models, co-expressing 3R-tau isoforms could be a promising model for drug development of tauopathies, such as PiD.
