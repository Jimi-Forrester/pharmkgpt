22432362|a|Prevention of delirium is an important part of looking after care home residents, however, it can be difficult to detect, especially in those who have dementia. This article explores the perceptions and experiences of care home staff integrating delirium prevention activity in their everyday work. As part of the Stop delirium! feasibility study interviews were carried out and when they were analysed five themes were identified: triggers and knowledge; detection and observation; effect of closest contact; changes in management of care; and communication and teamwork to overcome difficulties. Together these provide insight into how carers identified a potential episode of delirium and indicated the steps that might be taken to manage residents' care. Communication and teamwork were identified as important in delirium prevention and appropriate management.
