22998750|a|INTRODUCTION: The small tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib Mesylate (Gleevec) protects against diabetes, but it is not known how. AREAS COVERED: It has been suggested that islet amyloid and fibrotic deposits promote beta-cell failure and death, leading to Type-2 diabetes. As Imatinib is known to possess anti-fibrotic/amyloid properties, in for example systemic sclerosis and mouse models for Alzheimer's disease, the present review will discuss the possibility that Imatinib acts, at least in part, by ameliorating islet hyalinization and its consequences in the pathogenesis of Type-2 diabetes. EXPERT OPINION: A better understanding of how Imatinib counteracts Type-2 diabetes will possibly help to clarify the pathogenic role of islet amyloid and fibrosis, and hopefully lead to improved treatment of the disease.
