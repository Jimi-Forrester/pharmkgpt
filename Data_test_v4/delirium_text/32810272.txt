32810272|a|Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold great promise for transporting CRISPR-Cas9 RNA-guided endonucleases (RNP) throughout the body. However, the cell-selective delivery of EVs is still a challenge. Here, we designed valency-controlled tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs) conjugated with DNA aptamer, and loaded the valency-controlled TDNs on EV surface via cholesterol anchoring for specific cell targeting. The targeting efficacy of different ratios of aptamer/cholesterol from 1:3 to 3:1 in TDNs on decorating EVs was investigated. TDNs with one aptamer and three cholesterol anchors (TDN1) efficiently facilitated the tumor-specific accumulation of the EVs in cultured HepG2 cells and human primary liver cancer-derived organoids, as well as xenograft tumor models. The intracellular delivery of RNP by TDN1-EVs successfully realized its subsequent genome editing, leading to the downregulation of GFP or WNT10B in specific cells. This system was ultimately applied to reduce the protein expression of WNT10B, which presented remarkable tumor growth inhibition in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo, and could be extended to other therapeutic targets. The present study provides a platform for the directional display of aptamer on surface labeling and the EVs-based Cas9 delivery, which provides a meaningful idea for future cell-selective gene editing.
