37373264|t|An Exploration of the Coherent Effects between METTL3 and NDUFA10 on Alzheimer's Disease.
37373264|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by a decline in cognitive function. However, the etiopathogenesis of AD is unclear. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is abundant in the brain, and it is interesting to explore the relationship between m6A and AD causes. In this paper, the gene expression of METTL3 and NDUFA10 were found to correlate with the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), which is a clinical indicator of the degree of dementia. METTL3 is involved in post-transcriptional methylation and the formation of m6A. NDUFA10 encodes the protein with NADH dehydrogenase activity and oxidoreductase activity in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The following three characteristics were observed in this paper: 1. The lower the expression level of NDUFA10, the smaller the MMSE, and the higher the degree of dementia. 2. If the expression level of METTL3 dropped below its threshold, the patient would have a risk of AD with a probability close to 100%, suggesting a basic necessity for m6A to protect mRNA. 3. The lower the expression levels of both METTL3 and NDUFA10, the more likely the patient would suffer from AD, implying the coherence between METTL3 and NDUFA10. Regarding the above discovery, the following hypothesis is presented: METTL3 expression level is downregulated, then the m6A modification level of NDUFA10 mRNA is also decreased, thereby reducing the expression level of NDUFA10-encoded protein. Furthermore, the abnormal expression of NDUFA10 contributes to the assembly disorder of mitochondrial complex I and affects the process of the electron respiratory chain, with the consequent development of AD. In addition, to confirm the above conclusions, the AI Ant Colony Algorithm was improved to be more suitable for discovering the characteristics of AD data, and the SVM diagnostic model was applied to mine the coherent effects on AD between METTL3 and NDUFA10. In conclusion, our findings suggest that dysregulated m6A leads to altered expression of its target genes, thereby affecting AD's development.
