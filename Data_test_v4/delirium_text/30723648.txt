30723648|t|Geriatric Consultation Reduces High-risk Medication Usage at Discharge in Elderly Trauma Patients.
30723648|a|Background Traumatic injury in a growing geriatric population is associated with higher mortality and complication rates. Geriatric consultation (GC) is vital in reducing risk factors that contribute to adverse outcomes. This study aims to determine if receiving a GC had an impact on high-risk medication usage. Methods Patients eligible for a GC, age >= 65, and length of stay > two days, were identified via a chart review from July 2013 to July 2014 at a Level II trauma center. This population was divided into those with and without a GC. Data collected included demographics, injury severity, medications, delirium, mortality, and readmissions. High-risk medications were defined using the Beers Criteria. Statistical analysis involved using appropriate standard tests to compare groups, including multivariate logistic regression. Results Forty-nine of a total of 104 patients received a GC. Groups were comparable on injury severity score, co-morbidities, and high-risk medication use upon admissions. The GC group was 74% less likely to be discharged on high-risk medications than the non-GC group. Conclusion GC in elderly trauma patients reduces high-risk medication use upon discharge. Further studies are needed to explore how GC impacts readmission rates and mortality. A multidisciplinary trauma team, including a geriatrician, must exist to address the unique medical, psychological, functional, and social issues of a growing, aged trauma population.
