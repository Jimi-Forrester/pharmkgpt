32445876|a|Evidence shows that pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) improves stroke outcomes and dementia. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls the peptide and regulatory protein exchange between the central nervous system and the blood; the transport of these regulatory substances across the BBB has been altered in animal models of stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). PACAP is a powerful neurotrophin that can cross the BBB, which may aid in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases, including stroke and AD. PACAP may function as a potential drug in the treatment, prevention, or management of stroke and AD and other neurodegenerative conditions. Here, we review the effects of PACAP in studies on stroke and dementias.
