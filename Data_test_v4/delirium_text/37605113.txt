37605113|a|Glucose-Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78) is a chaperone protein that is predominantly expressed in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. GRP78 plays a crucial role in protein folding by assisting in the assembly of misfolded proteins. Under cellular stress conditions, GRP78 can translocate to the cell surface (csGRP78) were it interacts with different ligands to initiate various intracellular pathways. The expression of csGRP78 has been associated with tumor initiation and progression of multiple cancer types. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the existing evidence on the roles of GRP78 in various types of cancer and other human pathology. Additionally, the review discusses the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying GRP78's involvement in tumorigenesis and cancer advancement. Furthermore, we highlight recent innovative approaches employed in downregulating GRP78 expression in cancers as a potential therapeutic target.
