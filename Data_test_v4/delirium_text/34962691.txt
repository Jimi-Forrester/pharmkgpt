34962691|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that impairs multiple memory domains without an effective prevention or treatment approach. Amyloid plaque-induced neuroinflammation exacerbates neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in AD. To reduce neuroinflammation, we applied prebiotics or synbiotics to modulate the gut-brain axis in the AD mouse model. AD-like deficits were reduced in mice treated with synbiotics, suggesting that dietary modulation of the gut-brain axis is a potential approach to delay AD progression.
