25566443|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to explore effect of 6 weeks treadmill exercise on brain insulin signaling and beta-amyloid(Abeta). METHODS: The rat model of Alzheimer's disease(AD) used in the present study was induced by the intracerebroventricular(ICV) streptozotocin(STZ). To produce the model of animal with AD, STZ(1.5mg/kg) was injected to a cerebral ventricle of both cerebrums of Sprague-Dawley rat(20 weeks). The experimental animals were divided into ICV-Sham(n=7), ICV-STZ CON(n=7), ICV-STZ EXE(n=7). Treadmill exercise was done for 30 min a day, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Passive avoidance task was carried out before and after treadmill exercise. RESULTS: The results of this study show that treadmill exercise activated Protein kinase B(AKT)/ Glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha (GSK3alpha), possibly via activation of insulin receptor(IR) and insulin receptor substrate(IRS) and reduced Abeta in the brain of ICV-STZ rats. More interestingly, treadmill exercise improved cognitive function of ICV-STZ rats. Finally, physical exercise or physical activity gave positive influences on brain insulin signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Therefore, treadmill exercise can be applied to improve AD as preventive and therapeutic method.
