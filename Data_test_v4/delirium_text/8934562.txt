8934562|a|Transforming growth factor (TGF)beta plays a role in injury repair in sites surrounding brain injury. The present study tested the hypothesis that TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta2 levels in the postmortem CSF of patients with neurodegenerative disorders would be elevated compared to those in normal subjects. Free TGFbeta1 and total TGFbeta2 were measured by ELISA in postmortem ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (vCSF) of patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 30), Alzheimer's disease (n = 30), multiple sclerosis (n = 15), and schizophrenia (n = 12) and of normal controls (n = 16). In addition, albumin, IgG, and total protein in vCSF were measured. Both TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta2 were significantly different between groups (P < 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively). Parkinson's disease vCSF showed significant increases in both TGFbeta1 (P = 0.015) and TGFbeta2 (P = 0.012) compared to normal controls. There was a trend for TGFbeta2 to be elevated in Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis vCSFs, which failed to achieve significance. There were no differences between controls and schizophrenics in TGFbeta1 or TGFbeta2. Alzheimer's disease vCSF showed a significant decrease in protein compared to all other groups, which was not related to blood-brain barrier permeability, age, or autolysis differences. Evidence is presented suggesting that some TGFbeta1 may leak into the vCSF from plasma. Autopsy vCSF levels of TGFbeta isoforms were found to be distinctly different from those reported for human serum, especially for TGFbeta2, which is undetectable in plasma. These results indicate that further in vivo studies of TGFbeta2 in the CSF of Parkinson's disease patients are warranted to determine the relationship between clinical status, medication, and TGFbeta2 concentrations.
