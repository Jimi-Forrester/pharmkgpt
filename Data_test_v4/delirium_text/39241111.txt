39241111|t|Iatrogenic harm in functional neurological disorder.
39241111|a|Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is continuing to gain increasing recognition globally as a valid and potentially treatable disorder. Iatrogenic harm towards patients with FND is significant however, and has been around for centuries. Despite advances in our understanding around the aetiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of FND, many aspects of such harm continue to persist. Avoidance of iatrogenic harm has been highlighted by clinicians as one of the most important therapeutic considerations in FND, however, the sources and range of potential harms, or indeed ways to mitigate them, have not been previously summarised. Using a combination of clinical and research experience and scoping review methodology, this review aims to describe the main sources of iatrogenic harm towards patients with FND, including harm from misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis and treatment, direct harm from professional interactions, other stigma-related harms, harm related to diagnostic overshadowing and over-diagnosis of FND. We also describe some potential ways to address and prevent such harms, such as ways to reduce misdiagnosis with a focus on rule in signs, optimising teaching and communication, ensuring parity of FND with other medical conditions, and continued integration of patient and professional organisations.
