24085630|a|The aim of this study was to investigate chemical constituents of the leaves of Acanthopanax henryi, and their antioxidant, acetyl cholinesterase inhibitory activities. Caffeoyl quinic acid derivates and flavonoids were obtained from A. henry, through column chromatography technologies, and the content of major constituents was determined by the HPLC-UV method. Anti-oxidant activity of the isolated metabolites was evaluated by free radical scavenging (DPPH, ABTS radicals) and superoxide anion scavenging. The results showed that di-caffeoyl quinic acid derivates had stronger antioxidant activity than positive controls (ascorbic acid, trolox and allopurinol). Acetyl cholinesterase inhibitory activity was estimated on the constituents, among which, quercetin, 4-caffeoyl-quinic acid and 4,5-caffeoyl quinic acid were found to have strong acetyl cholinesterase inhibitory activity with IC50 values ranging from 62.6 to 121.9 muM. The present study showed that some of the tested constituents from the leaves of A. henryi exhibit strong antioxidant and acetyl cholinesterase inhibitory effects. This suggest that the leaves of A. henryi can be used as a new natural complementary source of acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors and anti-oxidant agents, thus being a promising potential complementary source against Alzheimer's disease.
