38787758|a|INTRODUCTION: We explored how blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage rate of gadolinium chelates (Ktrans) and BBB water exchange rate (kw) varied in cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) subtypes. METHODS: Thirty sporadic cSVD, 40 cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), and 13 high-temperature requirement factor A serine peptidase 1 (HTRA) -related cSVD subjects were investigated parallel to 40 healthy individuals. Subjects underwent clinical, cognitive, and MRI assessment. RESULTS: In CADASIL, no difference in Ktrans, but lower kw was observed in multiple brain regions. In sporadic cSVD, no difference in kw, but higher Ktrans was found in the whole brain and normal-appearing white matter. In HTRA1-related cSVD, both higher Ktrans in the whole brain and lower kw in multiple brain regions were observed. In each patient group, the altered BBB measures were correlated with lesion burden or clinical severity. DISCUSSION: In cSVD subtypes, distinct alterations of kw and Ktrans were observed. The combination of Ktrans and kw can depict the heterogeneous BBB dysfunction. HIGHLIGHTS: We measured BBB leakage to gadolinium-based contrast agent (Ktrans) and water exchange rate (kw) across BBB in three subtypes of cSVD. CADASIL is characterized by lower kw, HTRA1-related cSVD exhibits both higher Ktrans and lower kw, while sporadic cSVD is distinguished by higher Ktrans. There are distinct alterations in kw and Ktrans among subtypes of cSVD, indicating the heterogeneous nature of BBB dysfunction.
