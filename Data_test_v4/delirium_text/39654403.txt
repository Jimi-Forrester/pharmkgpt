39654403|a|OBJECTIVES: To outline the life and work of Greek physician Asclepiades of Bithynia (124-40 BC), especially his contributions to thinking about mental illness. METHODS: Review and discussion of relevant fragments of Asclepiades' work that survive and review of secondary literature, supplemented by relevant systematic literature searches (e.g. PubMed). RESULTS: Asclepiades challenged the long-standing Hippocratic doctrine of the four humours and developed an approach to physical and mental illness that was humane, reasoned, and a forerunner of later developments in psychiatry. Asclepiades argued that the human body, like everything in the universe, comprised tiny, imperceptible particles, which he called onkoi, seamless masses in perpetual motion. In consequence, Yapijakis describes Asclepiades as 'the father of molecular medicine'. Asclepiades held that good health was maintained by free, balanced motion of onkoi through theoretical pores, while disease resulted from blockage or impaction of onkoi passing through pores in various body parts (e.g. brain). Based on this idea, Asclepiades recommended releasing people with apparent mental illness from confinement and using judicious combinations of diet, exercise, massage, bathing, and music to treat 'phrenitis' (delirium) and melancholia. He suggested that the physician act 'safely, swiftly and pleasantly' ('cito, tutu, jucunde') for both physical and mental illness. CONCLUSIONS: Asclepiades belongs to the historical tradition of progressive medical approaches to mental illness, not least because he applied his principles for the treatment of physical illness to mental illness. His ideas about psychiatry set the scene for further evolution of attitudes to mental illness and its treatment over subsequent centuries.
