32106300|t|Generation and Characterization of Novel Monoclonal Antibodies Targeting p62/sequestosome-1 Across Human Neurodegenerative Diseases.
32106300|a|Human neurodegenerative diseases can be characterized as disorders of protein aggregation. As a key player in cellular autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system, p62 may represent an effective immunohistochemical target, as well as mechanistic operator, across neurodegenerative proteinopathies. In this study, 2 novel mouse-derived monoclonal antibodies 5G3 and 2A5 raised against residues 360-380 of human p62/sequestosome-1 were characterized via immunohistochemical application upon human tissues derived from cases of C9orf72-expansion spectrum diseases, Alzheimer disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, Lewy body disease, and multiple system atrophy. 5G3 and 2A5 reliably highlighted neuronal dipeptide repeat, tau, and alpha-synuclein inclusions in a distribution similar to a polyclonal antibody to p62, phospho-tau antibodies 7F2 and AT8, and phospho-alpha-synuclein antibody 81A. However, antibodies 5G3 and 2A5 consistently stained less neuropil structures, such as tau neuropil threads and Lewy neurites, while 2A5 marked fewer glial inclusions in progressive supranuclear palsy. Both 5G3 and 2A5 revealed incidental astrocytic tau immunoreactivity in cases of Alzheimer disease and Lewy body disease with resolution superior to 7F2. Through their unique ability to highlight specific types of pathological deposits in neurodegenerative brain tissue, these novel monoclonal p62 antibodies may provide utility in both research and diagnostic efforts.
