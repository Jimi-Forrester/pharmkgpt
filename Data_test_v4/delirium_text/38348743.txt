38348743|t|Sex differences in physiological response to increased neuronal excitability in a knockin mouse model of pediatric epilepsy.
38348743|a|BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a common neurological disease; however, few if any of the currently marketed antiseizure medications prevent or cure epilepsy. Discovery of pathological processes in the early stages of epileptogenesis has been challenging given the common use of preclinical models that induce seizures in physiologically normal animals. Moreover, despite known sex dimorphism in neurological diseases, females are rarely included in preclinical epilepsy models. METHODS: We characterized sex differences in mice carrying a pathogenic knockin variant (p.N1768D) in the Scn8a gene that causes spontaneous tonic-clonic seizures (TCs) at ~3 months of age and found that heterozygous females are more resilient than males in mortality and morbidity. To investigate the cellular mechanisms that underlie female resilience, we utilized blood-brain barrier (BBB) and hippocampal transcriptomic analyses in heterozygous mice before seizure onset (pre-TC) and in mice that experienced ~20 TCs (post-TC). RESULTS: In the pre-TC latent phase, both sexes exhibited leaky BBB; however, patterns of gene expression were sexually dimorphic. Females exhibited enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and protein biogenesis, while males activated gliosis and CREB signaling. After seizure onset (chronic phase), females exhibited a metabolic switch to lipid metabolism, while males exhibited increased gliosis and BBB dysfunction and a strong activation of neuroinflammatory pathways. CONCLUSION: The results underscore the central role of oxidative stress and BBB permeability in the early stages of epileptogenesis, as well as sex dimorphism in response to increasing neuronal hyperexcitability. Our results also highlight the need to include both sexes in preclinical studies to effectively translate results of drug efficacy studies.
