12808492|a|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized neuropathologically by beta amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, gliosis and neuronal loss. Recently, we have elucidated a molecular cascade of cell death induced by A beta 25 35 involving the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF kB), p53, and c Jun transcription factors in vitro. At present, no comparative reports have been published to establish a similar cell death signalization pathway in in vitro and in in vivo. The aim of this investigation was to determine if AD brains might activate NF kB, p53, c Jun, Par 4 transcription factors and to establish whether there exist a relationship between neuronal DNA damage and transcription factors activation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated Ab plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and NF kB, p53, and c Jun transcription factor activation in five cerebral regions from 3 normal subjects and from six demented patient with sporadic AD and one patient with AD familiar according to CERAD criteria. Using TUNEL we determine neuronal damage. RESULTS: We demonstrated neuronal damage in 17 out of 50 regions evaluated as TUNEL positive, and their distribution was heterogeneous in all brain regions evaluated; and the activation of NF kB, p53, c Jun and Par 4 transcription factors from case # 24 and #22, corresponding to TUNEL positive. CONCLUSIONS: We found a correlation between severity of DNA damage and nuclear activation of the transcription factors. These findings suggest that the AD brain may induce cell death by a molecular signalization similar to a non neuronal model by Ab exposure. This in situ study might validate previous Ab induced cell death observations in vitro.
