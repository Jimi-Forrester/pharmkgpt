31777988|t|Synthesis, characterization, biological evaluation, and molecular docking studies of some piperonyl-based 4-thiazolidinone derivatives.
31777988|a|Heterocyclic compounds are of particular importance among pharmacologically active compounds. In this study, some piperonyl-based 4-thiazolidinone derivatives (2a-i) were synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic assays. All molecules were tested as enzyme inhibitory factors. These compounds were effective inhibitors of the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE), alpha-glycosidase (alpha-Gly), and the human carbonic anhydrase I and II isoforms (hCA I and II), with Ki values in the range of 8.90-66.51 nM for alpha-Gly, 94.8-289.5 nM for hCA I, 106.3-304.6 nM for hCA II, and 0.55-2.36 nM for AChE. The synthesized molecules were also studied theoretically. Molecular docking calculations were performed to investigate the interaction between the target protein and molecules. CA inhibitor compounds have been clinically used for almost 60 years as antiglaucoma and diuretic drugs. The inhibition of the AChE enzyme results in the blockage of ACh hydrolysis. On the contrary, the design of inhibitor compounds or/and modulators for AChE is of major interest as it is one of the most popular tools to prevent Alzheimer's disease.
