31210999|t|Pre- and Perioperative Risk Factors of Post Hip Fracture Surgery Walking Failure in the Elderly.
31210999|a|INTRODUCTION: Osteoporotic hip fractures are a major problem. They increase mortality, morbidity, and functional decline. Recovery of ambulatory status is an essential prerequisite for older adults living in a normal environment. The main objective of this study was to investigate walking failure at 3 to 6 months after hip fracture surgery with the aim of identifying pre- and perioperative risk factors associated with it. METHODS: A total of 120 participants (>65 years) were recruited following hip fracture surgery at a teaching hospital. Walking status was assessed on average 4.4 +- 1.3 months after hip fracture surgery and compared with prefracture walking status. The participants were divided into 2 groups according to walking status (group 1: ambulatory; group 2: nonambulatory) and risk factors associated with a failure to walk were determined using binominal logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The rate of recovery to prefracture ambulatory status was about 18.3% and 25% of participants could not walk at all. Risk factors for not being able to walk at all included poor prefracture ambulatory status and living at a long care facility as nonmodifiable factors, whereas a shorter length of stay before surgery and having a longer total hospitalization periods were modifiable factors. CONCLUSION: Walking recovery after hip fracture surgery was very poor at 3 to 6 months after hip fracture surgery. Based on our findings, older adults living in a long care facility should be provided their medical and functional needs through professional health-care providers and systematic health delivery systems. The therapeutic management for underlying diseases affecting surgery should precede unconditional early surgery. Older adults hospitalized during longer periods should be focused on their functional care.
