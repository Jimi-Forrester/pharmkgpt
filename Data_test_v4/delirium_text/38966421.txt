38966421|t|Renshen Yangrong decoction for secondary malaise and fatigue: network pharmacology and Mendelian randomization study.
38966421|a|Background: Renshen Yangrong decoction (RSYRD) has been shown therapeutic effects on secondary malaise and fatigue (SMF). However, to date, its bioactive ingredients and potential targets remain unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to assess the potential ingredients and targets of RSYRD on SMF through a comprehensive strategy integrating network pharmacology, Mendelian randomization as well as molecular docking verification. Methods: Search for potential active ingredients and corresponding protein targets of RSYRD on TCMSP and BATMAN-TCM for network pharmacology analysis. Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to find therapeutic targets for SMF. The eQTLGen Consortium (sample sizes: 31,684) provided data on cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL, exposure). The summary data on SMF (outcome) from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were gathered from the MRC-IEU Consortium (sample sizes: 463,010). We built a target interaction network between the probable active ingredient targets of RSYRD and the therapeutic targets of SMF. We next used drug prediction and molecular docking to confirm the therapeutic value of the therapeutic targets. Results: In RSYRD, network pharmacology investigations revealed 193 possible active compounds and 234 associated protein targets. The genetically predicted amounts of 176 proteins were related to SMF risk in the MR analysis. Thirty-seven overlapping targets for RSYRD in treating SMF, among which six (NOS3, GAA, IMPA1, P4HTM, RB1, and SLC16A1) were prioritized with the most convincing evidence. Finally, the 14 active ingredients of RSYRD were identified as potential drug molecules. The strong affinity between active components and putative protein targets was established by molecular docking. Conclusion: This study revealed several active components and possible RSYRD protein targets for the therapy of SMF and provided novel insights into the feasibility of using Mendelian randomization for causal inference between Chinese medical formula and disease.
