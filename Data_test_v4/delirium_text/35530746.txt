35530746|t|Post-Marketing Surveillance Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Nalfurafine (Capsules 2.5 mug, Oral Dispersing Tablets 2.5 mug) in 1186 Patients with Chronic Liver Disease and Intractable Pruritus.
35530746|a|Background: Nalfurafine (Remitch , Toray Industries, Inc.) is a selective kappa-receptor agonist approved in Japan for the improvement of pruritus in patients with chronic liver diseases (only when existing treatments bring insufficient efficacy) in May 2015. Methods: A post-marketing Specific Drug Use Survey was conducted in Japan (March 1, 2016 to June 30, 2020) of the safety and efficacy of nalfurafine for the improvement of pruritus in patients with chronic liver disease. Results: Among 1186 cases analyzed for safety, the incidence of adverse drug reactions was 9.4% (112/1186 cases), lower than 61.4% reported in pre-marketing surveillance (297/484 cases). No specific safety issues were found and no cases of concern for drug dependence identified. Efficacy (itch improvement) was demonstrated in 73.16% (815/1114 cases; 12-week analysis set) and in 85.67% (520/607; general assessment of itch improvement at 1-year analysis set). A significant difference was found in 4 items of itch improvement at 12 weeks and 8 items of itch improvement at 1 year. No noteworthy issues were identified. Mean Visual Analog Scale (VAS) values after 12 weeks and 1 year after the first dose were significantly lower than the baseline (p < 0.0001 for both treatment durations). Mean severity scores (Kawashima's classification scheme) were significantly lower than the pretreatment score at 12 weeks and 1 year after the first dose (both p < 0.0001). No concerns were identified in the efficacy and safety of nalfurafine in patients with specific background, ie, the elderly (aged >= 65 years), those with renal impairment, and those on long-term treatment (>= 365 days) compared with patients without corresponding background. Conclusion: No new safety issues of concern or cases of insufficient efficacy were identified in this Specific Drug Use Survey of the safety and efficacy of nalfurafine for the improvement of pruritus in patients with chronic liver diseases.
