38528644|a|BACKGROUND: The current research targeted to study the impact of nutritional intervention by two sourdough breads in improvement of cognitive dysfunction in diabetic rats. METHODS: Type-2 diabetes was induced in rats by Streptozotocin-Nicotinamide (STZ-NC). Diabetic rats were fed on balanced diet or balanced diet containing 20% of sourdough bread I or II for a month. Lipid profile, oxidative stress, inflammatory markers and cognitive functions were assessed in all rats. Gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2) were assessed in hippocampal tissue, while expression of phosphoenol pyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK), and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) genes were evaluated in hepatic tissue. Chemical composition and fatty acids profile were evaluated in the prepared sourdough bread. RESULTS: Sourdough bread II showed higher content of phenolic compounds, fat, fiber and carbohydrates. Fatty acids profile revealed that sourdough bread I was higher in saturated fatty acids (16.08%), while sourdough bread sample II was higher in unsaturated fatty acids (79.33%). Sourdough bread I or II feeding rats' showed significant improvement in hyperglycemia, oxidative stress markers, inflammatory markers, lipid profile, liver and kidney functions in association with improvement in cognitive function. Gene expression of BDNF and NRF2 in hippocampal tissue were increased significantly, while hepatic GLUT2 and PEPCK gene expression were down-regulated in diabetic given sourdough bread I or II. CONCLUSION: Sourdough bread II was superior in all the studied parameters. The anti-diabetic effect and protection from cognitive dysfunction of sourdough bread samples may be ascribed to the occurrence of dietary fibers, phenolic compounds, and polyunsaturated fatty acids.
