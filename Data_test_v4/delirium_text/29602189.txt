29602189|t|e-Screening revolution: A novel approach to developing a delirium screening tool in the intensive care unit.
29602189|a|OBJECTIVES: Delirium is common in the intensive care unit (ICU), often affecting older patients. A bedside electronic tool has the potential to revolutionise delirium screening. Our group describe a novel approach to the design and development of delirium screening questions for the express purpose of use within an electronic device. Preliminary results are presented. METHODS: Our group designed a series of tests which targeted the clinical criteria for delirium according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria against predefined requirements, including applicability to older patients. RESULTS: Candidate questions, including tests of attention and awareness, were devised and then refined by an expert multidisciplinary group, including geriatricians. A scoring scheme was constructed, with testing to failure an indicator of delirium. The device was tested in healthy controls, aged 20-80 years, who were recorded as being without delirium. CONCLUSION: e-Screening for delirium requires a novel approach to instrument design but may revolutionise recognition of delirium in ICU.
