36308621|t|Cognitive Impairments and blood-brain Barrier Damage in a Mouse Model of Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion.
36308621|a|Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is commonly involved in various brain diseases. Tight junction proteins (TJs) are key components constituting the anatomical substrate of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Changes in cognitive function and BBB after CCH and their relationship need further exploration. To investigate the effect of CCH on cognition and BBB, we developed a bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) model in Tie2-GFP mice. Mice manifested cognitive impairments accompanied with increased microglia after the BCAS operation. BCAS mice also exhibited increased BBB permeability at all time points set from D1 to D42. Furthermore, BCAS mice showed reduced expression of TJs 42 d after the operation. In addition, correct entrances of mice in radial arm maze test had a moderate negative correlation with EB extravasation. Our data suggested that BCAS could lead to cognitive deficits, microglia increase and BBB dysfunction characterized by increased BBB permeability and reduced TJs expression level. BBB permeability may be involved in the cognitive impairments induced by CCH.
