28135117|t|An 11-Year Study of Home Hospice Service Trends in Singapore from 2000 to 2010.
28135117|a|BACKGROUND: Hospice care is most appropriate when a patient no longer benefits from curative treatment and has limited life expectancy. These patients may suffer from any type of life-limiting illness, including end-stage cancer, end-stage heart disease, end-stage renal failure, AIDS, and Alzheimer's disease, among other illnesses. Patients are managed on their pain and symptoms and home hospice care manages these patients in the comfort of their own home, enabling patients to spend their last days with dignity and have a good quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To describe the home hospice patients at HCA Hospice Care (HHC) Singapore from 2000 to 2010. Description of home care patients in terms of their sociodemographic profile and diagnosis at admission. We reviewed the Electronic Medical Records of patients admitted into HHC from 2000 to 2010. RESULTS: Patients had multiple admissions into HHC home hospice as identified in the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2010, but we only selected patient's first admission into HHC home hospice for this analysis. Of the 25,065 patients in the entire samples, 47.3% were males, 65.2% were married, and 84.3% were Chinese. 50.9% of the patients died at home, 75.5% were referred from public hospitals, 53.9% of primary caregivers were children, and the mean age of the patients was 68.0 years. Among all cancer patients admitted into HHC home hospice, lung cancer (23.6%) was the most common principal diagnosis for admission, followed by colorectal (10.5%) and liver cancers (7.7%). Among noncancer patients, renal failure (7.0%) was the most common diagnosis. Among male patients admitted into HHC home hospice, lung cancer (29.6%) was the most common diagnosis, followed by liver cancer (10.8%), colorectal cancer (10.0%), and end-stage renal failure (5.5%). For female patients, lung cancer (16.9%) was the most common diagnosis, followed by breast cancer (15.9%), colorectal cancer (11.0%), and end-stage renal failure (8.7%). Ten-year trends of the sociodemographic profile and diagnosis at admission were further analyzed to determine home hospice services utilization and the needs of the home care patients. CONCLUSION: With an increasing emphasis to encourage aging and dying in the community and more attention given to building up the home hospice industry's capacity and capability, it is important to understand the profile of the patients who have been utilizing home hospice services. This also helps to plan and develop similar services in other parts of the world.
