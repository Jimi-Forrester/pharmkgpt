35277401|t|Risk and incidence of cognitive impairment in patients with chronic kidney disease and diabetes: the results from a longitudinal study in a community cohort of patients and an age and gender-matched control cohort in North Wales, UK.
35277401|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current investigation is to estimate the incidence and risk for neurocognitive disorders (NCD) in a chronic kidney disease (CKD) cohort with diabetes, compared with an age and sex-matched control cohort. DESIGN: Longitudinal follow-up. SETTING: District general hospital North Wales, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-two patients with CKD and an age and gender-matched sample of 143 controls at baseline and at approximately 36 months. INTERVENTIONS: Cognitive function was assessed in the patients with CKD (mean age 75.8+-9.1; 49 men: 43 women) and the control cohort (mean age 74.4+-6.2; 71 men: 72) at baseline and at approximately 36 months. An NCD diagnosis was based on patient, informant, case note review, neuropsychological assessment and application of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders V.5 (DSM-5) for an NCD and Petersen's criteria for mild cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Follow-up neuropsychological assessment and application of DSM-5 criteria of the cognitively normal patients and controls revealed, 25/92 (27%) of the CDK and 20/143 (13.9%) in the control cohort developed an NCD. The CKD cohort had a twofold increased risk for the development of an NCD compared with the controls, adjusted for age and sex. The incidence rate for an NCD in the CKD cohort was 10.5 and 5.1 in the controls, respectively. No association was observed with the stage of CKD and cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal investigation found that patients with CKD have a twofold increased risk for the development of an NCD. The current investigation highlighted the need to recognise that NCD in patients with CKD is a common comorbidity and that they are at a much higher risk for the development of a significant neurodegenerative disorders. In view of these risks, neuropsychological screening and assessment should be incorporated into normal CKD clinical practice and management.
