30637597|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recently, we showed that triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1) was involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) since it modulated microglial phagocytic functions and thus affected amyloid-beta clearance in the brain. Interestingly, a soluble form of TREM1 (sTREM1) can be detected in the plasma of human. To date, whether sTREM1 concentrations were altered in the plasma under AD context remained unclear. METHODS: In this study, we compared the plasma concentrations of sTREM1 between 110 AD patients and 128 age- and gender-matched controls. Meanwhile, the relationship of sTREM1 concentrations with total tau levels in the plasma of AD patients was also assessed. RESULTS: We revealed that the concentrations of sTREM1 were significantly increased in AD patients. Meanwhile, the sTREM1 concentrations were gradually increased during disease progression. More importantly, we showed that the sTREM1 concentrations were positively correlated with the levels of total tau in the plasma of AD patients (r = 0.61, P < 0.001). The subsequent subgroup analysis indicated that this correlation was more pronounced in patients with severe dementia (Mini-Mental State Exam score < 10, r = 0.81, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate a potential association between sTREM1 and tau pathology, and further confirm an involvement of this immune receptor in AD pathogenesis.
