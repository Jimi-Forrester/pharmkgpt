22797007|a|The mutant ubiquitin UBB(+1) is a substrate as well as an inhibitor of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and accumulates in the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A role for the UPS has been suggested in the generation of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques in AD. To investigate the effect of UBB(+1) expression on amyloid pathology in vivo, we crossed UBB(+1) transgenic mice with a transgenic line expressing AD-associated mutant amyloid precursor protein (APPSwe) and mutant presenilin 1 (PS1dE9), resulting in APPPS1/UBB(+1) triple transgenic mice. In these mice, we determined the Abeta levels at 3, 6, 9 and 11 months of age. Surprisingly, we found a significant decrease in Abeta deposition in amyloid plaques and levels of soluble Abeta(42) in APPPS1/UBB(+1) transgenic mice compared to APPPS1 mice at 6 months of age, without alterations in UBB(+1) protein levels or proteasomal chymotrypsin activity. These lowering effects of UBB(+1) on Abeta deposition were transient, as this relative decrease in plaque load was not significant in APPPS1/UBB(+1) mice at 9 and 11 months of age. We also show that APPPS1/UBB(+1) mice exhibit astrogliosis, indicating that they may not be improved functionally compared to APPPS1 mice despite the Abeta reduction. The molecular mechanism underlying this decrease in Abeta deposition in APPPS1/UBB(+1) mice is more complex than previously assumed because UBB(+1) is also ubiquitinated at K63 opening the possibility of additional effects of UBB(+1) (e.g. kinase activation).
