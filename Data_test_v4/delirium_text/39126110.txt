39126110|t|Aging, Cancer, and Inflammation: The Telomerase Connection.
39126110|a|Understanding the complex dynamics of telomere biology is important in the strong link between aging and cancer. Telomeres, the protective caps at the end of chromosomes, are central players in this connection. While their gradual shortening due to replication limits tumors expansion by triggering DNA repair mechanisms, it also promotes oncogenic changes within chromosomes, thus sustaining tumorigenesis. The enzyme telomerase, responsible for maintaining telomere length, emerges as a central player in this context. Its expression in cancer cells facilitates the preservation of telomeres, allowing them to circumvent the growth-limiting effects of short telomeres. Interestingly, the influence of telomerase extends beyond telomere maintenance, as evidenced by its involvement in promoting cell growth through alternative pathways. In this context, inflammation accelerates telomere shortening, resulting in telomere dysfunction, while telomere elements also play a role in modulating the inflammatory response. The recognition of this interplay has promoted the development of novel therapeutic approaches centered around telomerase inhibition. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the field, emphasizing recent progress in knowledge and the implications in understanding of cancer biology.
