32662306|a|Crush injury is a disease that is commonly found in victims of earthquakes, debris flows, mine disasters, explosions, terrorist attacks, local wars, and other accidents. The complications that arise due to the crush injury inflicted on victims give rise to crush syndrome (CS). If not treated in time, the mortality rate of CS is very high. The most important measure that can be taken to reduce mortality in such situations is to immediately start treatment. However, the traditional treatment methods such as fluid resuscitation, diuresis, and hemodialysis are not feasible enough to be carried out at the disaster scene. So there is a need for developing new treatments that are efficient and convenient. Because it is difficult to diagnose in the disaster area and reach the treatment equipment and treat on time. It has become a new research needs to be directed into identifying new medical treatment targets and methods using the etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms of CS. In recent years, a large number of new anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory drug therapies have been shown to be highly efficacious in CS rat/mouse models. Some of them are expected to become specific drugs for the emergency treatment of a large number of patients who may develop CS in the aftermath of earthquakes, wars, and other disasters in the future. Hence, we have reviewed the latest research on the medical therapy of CS as a source for anyone wishing to pursue research in this direction.
