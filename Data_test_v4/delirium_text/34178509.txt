34178509|t|Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Encephalitis: A Detailed Review of the Different Psychiatric Presentations and Red Flags to Look for in Suspected Cases.
34178509|a|Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis is a rare autoimmune disorder that involves N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. It is the most common autoimmune encephalitis, and early detection and treatment are crucial for morbidity-free recovery. Distinguishing this disorder from a primary psychiatric illness is quite challenging as this disorder classically presents with psychiatric manifestations that often resemble schizophrenic psychosis. Therefore, this review intended to scope the psychiatric manifestations this disorder could present with and dissect how they differ from primary psychiatric disorders. A PubMed database search was done. The results yielded were analyzed; eventually, 50 papers were used to review the different signs and symptoms the disease can present with, including common and rare disease presentations. Diagnostic challenges and helpful clinical clues to recognize the disorder were reviewed as well.
