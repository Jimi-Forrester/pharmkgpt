34573656|t|Variation in the Ovine Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Beta-Interaction Protein Gene (GSKIP) Affects Carcass and Growth Traits in Romney Sheep.
34573656|a|The glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta)-interacting protein (encoded by the gene GSKIP) is a small A-kinase anchoring protein, which complexes with GSK3betaand protein kinase A (PKA) and acts synergistically with cAMP/PKA signaling to inhibit GSK3beta activity. The protein plays a role in regulating glycogen metabolism, protein synthesis, the cell cycle, and in regulating gene expression. In this study, PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analyses were used to screen for variation in exon 1 and exon 2 of GSKIP in 840 New Zealand (NZ) Romney sheep. Two SSCP banding patterns representing two different nucleotide variants (A and B) were detected in an exon 1 region, whereas in an exon 2 region only one pattern was detected. Variants A and B of exon 1 had one non-synonymous nucleotide difference c.37A/G (p.Met13Val). The birthweight of sheep of genotype AA (5.9 +- 0.06 kg) was different (p = 0.023) to sheep of genotype AB (5.7 +- 0.06 kg) and BB (5.7 +- 0.06 kg). The hot carcass weight (HCW) of sheep of genotype AA (17.2 +- 0.22 kg) was different (p = 0.012) to sheep of genotype AB (17.6 +- 0.22 kg) and BB (18.0 +- 0.29 kg), and the fat depth at the 12th rib (V-GR) of sheep of genotype AA (7.7 +- 0.31 mm) was different (p = 0.016) to sheep of genotype AB (8.3 +- 0.30 mm) and BB (8.5 +- 0.39 mm). The results suggest that the c.37A/G substitution in ovine GSKIP may affect sheep growth and carcass traits.
