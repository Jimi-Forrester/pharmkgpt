9769858|a|The resolution of fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques (FISH) can be improved using techniques of DNA stretching. The so-called DIRVISH technique has been used to demonstrate the existence of an inversion involving a small chromosomal segment of the long arm of chromosome 14. This inversion was suspected, but not proven, in patients with familial Alzheimer disease. Two-colour FISH using YAC and cosmid probes allowed us to limit the rearranged region around YAC 964e2, which encompasses the Presenilin 1 (PR1) gene. The existence of small-sized inversions within the genome becomes, thus, open to microscope analysis.
