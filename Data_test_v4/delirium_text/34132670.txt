34132670|t|Crossed Hemispheric Accumulation of beta-Amyloid and Tau Protein in a Patient With Typical Alzheimer Disease.
34132670|a|Amyloid (Abeta) and tau proteins are pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD). It is well known that there is spatial disparity between Abeta and tau protein deposition but, crossed hemispheric accumulation of these 2 proteins has not been reported. Here we report the case of a 76-year-old woman with typical AD who underwent amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) ([ 18 F]-florbetaben) and tau PET scans ([ 18 F]PI-2620), revealing crossed accumulation of Abeta and tau in the cerebral hemisphere. A neuropsychological assessment showed impairment in memory with spared activities of daily living. In the PET analysis, amyloid deposition was observed only in the left side of the cerebral hemisphere and tau only in the right side. Neuroimaging follow-up indicated that the spatial pattern of these protein accumulations had not changed. This case suggests the possibility of independent Abeta and tau pathogenic pathways in AD.
