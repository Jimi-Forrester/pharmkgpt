34358726|a|BACKGROUND: There is a significant prevalence of new onset neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), some severe and persistent, in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: This study reports on the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to treat NPS associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A review of the literature pertaining to the use of ECT in patients with COVID-19 and NPS was performed through PubMed, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE. Search terms included "Electroconvulsive Therapy" and "ECT," combined with "COVID-19" and "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2)." In addition, we present a case in which ECT was used to achieve complete remission in a patient who developed new onset, treatment-resistant depression, psychosis, and catatonia, associated with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 67 articles were reviewed with 3 selected for inclusion. These articles detailed 3 case reports of patients with new onset NPS (mania, psychosis and suicidality, and catatonia) that developed in the context of active COVID-19 and were treated successfully with ECT. CONCLUSIONS: ECT, a broad-spectrum treatment that has been found to be effective in various NPS (independent of etiology), is shown in our case report and others, to be safe and effective for NPS associated with COVID-19. Although we identified only 3 other cases in the literature, we believe that the probable antiinflammatory mechanism of ECT, its safety and tolerability, and the faster time to symptom remission support the need for more research and increased clinician awareness about this life-saving procedure.
