38831169|t|Knockdown of DJ-1 Exacerbates Neuron Apoptosis Induced by TgCtwh3 through the NF-kappaB Pathway.
38831169|a|Mutations or loss of function of DJ-1 and Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, which are often caused by oxidative stress. However, the relationship between DJ-1 and T. gondii infection is not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the expression of DJ-1 in the hippocampus tissue of mice or in HT22 infected with T. gondii Chinese 1 genotype Wh3 strain (TgCtwh3) and the effect of DJ-1 knockdown on neuronal apoptosis induced by TgCtwh3 tachyzoite, as well as the underlying mechanism at the cellular and molecular level. Firstly, we detected DJ-1 protein expression and cell apoptosis in the hippocampal tissue of mice infected by TgCtwh3. Then, we examined DJ-1 expression and apoptosis in HT22 challenged with TgCtwh3. Finally, we evaluated the apoptosis in HT22 with DJ-1 knockdown which was infected with TgCtwh3 and assayed the expression of NF-kappaBp65 and p-NF-kappaBp65. Our results showed that DJ-1 expression was reduced and neurons underwent apoptosis in the hippocampus of mice infected with TgCtwh3 tachyzoites. Additionally, the knockdown of DJ-1 followed by infection with TgCtwh3 tachyzoites led to increased apoptosis in HT22 cells through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Therefore, this study suggests that DJ-1 is an important target for preventing apoptosis caused by T. gondii TgCtwh3.
