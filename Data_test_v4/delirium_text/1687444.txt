1687444|t|The cellular basis of delirium and its relevance to age-related disorders including Alzheimer's disease.
1687444|a|A wide variety of conditions lead to delirium (i.e., metabolic encephalopathies) in human beings and animals. Despite the varied etiology the clinical consequences are relatively stereotyped which suggests that the diverse insults that cause delirium may act by common metabolic and cellular "final pathways." Related molecular and cellular mechanisms may be involved in aging and Alzheimer's disease, conditions that predispose to the development of delirium. Animal models of delirium better reflect age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease than those that impair a single neurotransmitter system such as the cholinergic system; the metabolic encephalopathies produce global cognitive disturbance, which is more typical of these disorders. Thus, research related to delirium has far-reaching implications for normal and abnormal brain function.
