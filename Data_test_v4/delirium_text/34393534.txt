34393534|t|The Role of Perioperative Sleep Disturbance in Postoperative Neurocognitive Disorders.
34393534|a|Postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) increases the length of hospital stay, mortality, and risk of long-term cognitive impairment. Perioperative sleep disturbance is prevalent and commonly ignored and may increase the risk of PND. However, the role of perioperative sleep disturbances in PND remains unclear. Nocturnal sleep plays an indispensable role in learning, memory, and maintenance of cerebral microenvironmental homeostasis. Hospitalized sleep disturbances also increase the incidence of postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction. This review summarizes the role of perioperative sleep disturbances in PND and elucidates the potential mechanisms underlying sleep-deprivation-mediated PND. Activated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress; impaired function of the blood-brain barrier and glymphatic pathway; decreased hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor, adult neurogenesis, and sirtuin1 expression; and accumulated amyloid-beta proteins are associated with PND in individuals with perioperative sleep disorders. These findings suggest that the improvement of perioperative sleep might reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Future studies should further investigate the role of perioperative sleep disturbance in PND.
