35700682|t|Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation affects older adults' cognition after general anesthesia: A meta-analysis.
35700682|a|Perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction comprises pre-existing neurocognitive dysfunction, postoperative delirium (POD), and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). This meta-analysis aims to study the effects of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on postoperative cognitive function after general anesthesia in older adults. Eight databases were searched, from the establishment of the databases to January 2022. Eighteen randomized controlled trials were included. TEAS reduced POCD incidence on the 1st and 3rd but not on the 5th and 7th postoperative days (p<0.00001; p<0.00001; p = 0.20; p = 0.30). Owing to the limited number of original studies, POD incidence could not be analyzed. TEAS improved the MMSE scores on the 1st and 3rd but not on the 5th and 7th postoperative days. TEAS reduced the values of S100beta at the end of the surgery and 1 day after surgery and IL-6 on the 1st postoperative day. TEAS can prevent early postoperative cognitive decline after general anesthesia in older adults.
