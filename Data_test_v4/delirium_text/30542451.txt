30542451|a|beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation are considered to be the primary pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Targeted inhibition of these pathological processes may provide effective treatments for AD. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that ellagic acid (EA) exerts neuroprotective effects in several diseases. The present study investigated the effects of EA on AD-associated learning and memory deficits on APP/PS1 double transgenic mice and the underlying mechanisms. APP/PS1 mice or wild-type C57BL/6 mice were intragastrically administered EA (50 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 60 consecutive days. The learning and memory abilities of mice were investigated using the Morris water maze test. Hippocampal regions were examined for the presence of amyloid plaques, neuronal apoptosis and tau phosphorylation. Expression levels of APP, Abeta, RAC-alphaserine/threonine-protein kinase and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3beta in the hippocampus were determined by western blot analysis and ELISA. The results demonstrated that EA treatment ameliorated spatial learning and memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice and significantly reduced neuronal apoptosis and Abeta deposition in the hippocampus (P<0.05 and P<0.01). In addition, EA significantly inhibited the hyperphosphorylation of tau and significantly decreased the activity of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3beta (P<0.01), which is involved in tau phosphorylation. Overall, these findings indicated that the beneficial effects of EA on AD-associated cognitive impairments may be attributed to the inhibition of Abeta production and tau hyperphosphorylation, and its beneficial action may be mediated in part, by the RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase/GSK3beta signaling pathway.
