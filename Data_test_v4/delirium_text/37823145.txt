37823145|a|Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a global health problem and leading cause of death worldwide. Thrombus formation, one of the CVDs, is essentially the formation of fibrin clots. The existing thrombolytic agents have the disadvantages of high price, short half-life, and high bleeding risk; hence, there is an urgent need to find the alternative thrombolytic agents. In recent years, traditional fermented foods have been widely investigated for their outstanding effects in the prevention and treatment of thrombus formation. In this review, we have focused on fibrinolytic enzymes produced by microorganisms during the fermentation of traditional fermented foods and their potential use for treating CVDs. First, we discussed about the sources of fibrinolytic enzymes and microbial strains that produce those enzymes followed by the optimization of fermentation process, purification, and physicochemical properties of fibrinolytic enzymes. Finally, we have summarized the thrombolytic effects of fibrinolytic enzymes in humans and mice. Fibrinolytic enzymes produced by microorganisms during the fermentation of traditional fermented foods not only lyse thrombi but also acts as anti-atherosclerotic, anti-hyperlipidemia, and neuroprotection agents. Therefore, fibrinolytic enzymes from traditional fermented foods have great potential for the prevention and treatment of CVDs.
