32245201|t|Make Sure You Have a Safety Net: Updates in the Prevention and Management of Infectious Complications in Stem Cell Transplant Recipients.
32245201|a|Hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients are at increased risk of infection and immune dysregulation due to reception of cytotoxic chemotherapy; development of graft versus host disease, which necessitates treatment with immunosuppressive medications; and placement of invasive catheters. The prevention and management of infections in these vulnerable hosts is of utmost importance and a key "safety net" in stem cell transplantation. In this review, we provide updates on the prevention and management of CMV infection; invasive fungal infections; bacterial infections; Clostridium difficile infection; and EBV, HHV-6, adenovirus and BK infections. We discuss novel drugs, such as letermovir, isavuconazole, meropenem-vaborbactam and bezlotoxumab; weigh the pros and cons of using fluoroquinolone prophylaxis during neutropenia after stem cell transplantation; and provide updates on important viral infections after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Optimizing the prevention and management of infectious diseases by using the best available evidence will contribute to better outcomes for stem cell transplant recipients, and provide the best possible "safety net" for these immunocompromised hosts.
