38139851|a|Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to either exogenous (PAMPs) or endogenous (DAMPs) stimuli results in the production of IL-18, caspase-1 and IL-1beta. These cytokines have a beneficial role in promoting inflammation, but an excessive activation of the inflammasome and the consequent constitutive inflammatory status plays a role in human pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Autophagic removal of NLRP3 inflammasome activators can reduce inflammasome activation and inflammation. Likewise, inflammasome signaling pathways regulate autophagy, allowing the development of inflammatory responses but preventing excessive and detrimental inflammation. Nanotechnology led to the development of liposome engineered nanovectors (NVs) that can load and carry drugs. We verified in an in vitro model of AD-associated inflammation the ability of Glibenclamide-loaded NVs (GNVs) to modulate the balance between inflammasome activation and autophagy. Human THP1dM cells were LPS-primed and oligomeric Ass-stimulated in the presence/absence of GNVs. IL-1beta, IL-18 and activated caspase-1 production was evaluated by the Automated Immunoassay System (ELLA); ASC speck formation (a marker of NLRP3 activation) was analyzed by FlowSight Imaging flow-cytometer (AMNIS); the expression of autophagy targets was investigated by RT-PCR and Western blot (WB); and the modulation of autophagy-related up-stream signaling pathways and Tau phosphorylation were WB-quantified. Results showed that GNVs reduce activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and prevent the Ass-induced phosphorylation of ERK, AKT, and p70S6 kinases, potentiating autophagic flux and counteracting Tau phosphorylation. These preliminary results support the investigation of GNVs as a possible novel strategy in disease and rehabilitation to reduce inflammasome-associated inflammation.
