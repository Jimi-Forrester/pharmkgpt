23628656|a|The hippocampus is affected by various stimuli that include hyperglycemia, depression, and ischemia. Calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs) have protective roles in the response to such stimuli. However, little is known about the expression of CaBPs under diabetic conditions. This study was conducted to examine alterations in the physiological parameters with type 1 diabetes induced with streptozotocin (STZ) as well as time-dependent changes in the expression of two CaBPs changes of were being evaluated. Rats treated with STZ (70 mg/kg) had high blood glucose levels (> 21.4 mmol/L) along with increased food intake and water consumption volumes compared to the sham controls. In contrast, body weight of the animals treated with STZ was significantly reduced compared to the sham group. CB-specific immunoreactivity was generally increased in the hippocampal CA1 region and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) 2 weeks after STZ treatment, but decreased thereafter in these regions. In contrast, the number of PV-immunoreactive neurons and fibers was unchanged in the hippocampus and DG 2 weeks after STZ treatment. However, this number subsequently decreased over time. These results suggest that CB and PV expression is lowest 3 weeks after STZ administration, and these deficits lead to disturbances in calcium homeostasis.
