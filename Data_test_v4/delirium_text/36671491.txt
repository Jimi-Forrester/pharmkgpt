36671491|t|Effects of Chronic Caffeine Consumption on Synaptic Function, Metabolism and Adenosine Modulation in Different Brain Areas.
36671491|a|Adenosine receptors mainly control synaptic function, and excessive activation of adenosine receptors may worsen the onset of many neurological disorders. Accordingly, the regular intake of moderate doses of caffeine antagonizes adenosine receptors and affords robust neuroprotection. Although caffeine intake alters brain functional connectivity and multi-omics analyses indicate that caffeine intake modifies synaptic and metabolic processes, it is unclear how caffeine intake affects behavior, synaptic plasticity and its modulation by adenosine. We now report that male mice drinking caffeinated water (0.3 g/L) for 2 weeks were behaviorally indistinguishable (locomotion, mood, memory) from control mice (drinking water) and displayed superimposable synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation) in different brain areas (hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, amygdala). Moreover, there was a general preservation of the efficiency of adenosine A1 and A2A receptors to control synaptic transmission and plasticity, although there was a tendency for lower levels of endogenous adenosine ensuring A1 receptor-mediated inhibition. In spite of similar behavioral and neurophysiological function, caffeine intake increased the energy charge and redox state of cortical synaptosomes. This increased metabolic competence likely involved a putative increase in the glycolytic rate in synapses and a prospective greater astrocyte-synapse lactate shuttling. It was concluded that caffeine intake does not trigger evident alterations of behavior or of synaptic plasticity but increases the metabolic competence of synapses, which might be related with the previously described better ability of animals consuming caffeine to cope with deleterious stimuli triggering brain dysfunction.
