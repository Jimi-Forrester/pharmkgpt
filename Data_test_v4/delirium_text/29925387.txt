29925387|t|Surface functionalization of TiO2 nanotubes with minocycline and its in vitro biological effects on Schwann cells.
29925387|a|BACKGROUND: Minocycline has been widely used in central nervous system disease. However, the effect of minocycline on the repairing of nerve fibers around dental implants had not been previously investigated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possibility of using minocycline for the repairing of nerve fibers around dental implants by investigating the effect of minocycline on the proliferation of Schwann cells and secretion of neurotrophic factors nerve growth factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor in vitro. METHODS: TiO2 nanotubes were fabricated on the surface of pure titanium via anodization at the voltage of 20, 30, 40 and 50 V. The nanotubes structure were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and examined with an optical contact angle. Then drug loading capability and release behavior were detected in vitro. The TiO2 nanotubes loaded with different concentration of minocycline were used to produce conditioned media with which to treat the Schwann cells. A cell counting kit-8 assay and cell viability were both selected to study the proliferative effect of the specimens on Schwann cell. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analyses were used to detect the related gene/protein expression of Schwann cells. RESULTS: The results showed that the diameter of TiO2 nanotubes at different voltage varied from 100 to 200 nm. The results of optical contact angle and releasing profile showed the nanotubes fabricated at the voltage of 30 V met the needs of the carrier of minocycline. In addition, the TiO2 nanotubes loaded with the concentration of 20 mug/mL minocycline increased Schwann cells proliferation and secretion of neurotrophic factors in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that the surface functionalization of TiO2 nanotubes with minocycline was a promising candidate biomaterial for the peripheral nerve regeneration around dental implants and has potential to be applied in improving the osseoperception of dental implant.
