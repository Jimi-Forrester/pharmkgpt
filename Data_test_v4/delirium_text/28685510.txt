28685510|a|Recently, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have been continuously reduced in people with diabetes through the intensive management of multiple risk factors. However, contrary to this trend, the prevalence and clinical significance of neurodegenerative disorders are steadily increasing. In previous studies, diabetes mellitus has been found to play an important role in increasing the risk of dementia and cognitive dysfunction through various mechanisms. In particular, hypoglycemia is a frequent clinical situation in the strict management of diabetes and is well known as an important factor that directly affects the risk of dementia and cognitive impairment. This article describes the occurrence of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes, and summarizes the resultant risks of dementia and cognitive dysfunction.
