38778598|a|BACKGROUND: The oxidative deamination of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous amines is catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as monoamine oxidases (MAOs), which are reliant on flavin-adenine dinucleotides. Numerous neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), are significantly correlated with changes in the amounts of biogenic amines in the brain caused by MAO. Hydrogen peroxide, reactive oxygen species, and ammonia, among other toxic consequences of this oxidative breakdown, can harm brain cells' mitochondria and cause oxidative damage. OBJECTIVE: The prime objective of this review article was to highlight and conclude the recent advancements in structure-activity relationships of synthetic derivatives of coumarins for MAO-B inhibition, published in the last five years' research articles. METHODS: The literature (between 2019 and 2023) was searched from platforms like Science Direct, Google Scholar, PubMed, etc. After going through the literature, we have found a number of coumarin derivatives being synthesized by researchers for the inhibition of MAO-B for the management of diseases associated with the enzyme such as Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. The effect of these coumarin derivatives on the enzyme depends on the substitutions associated with the structure. The structure-activity relationships of the synthetic coumarin derivatives that are popular nowadays have been described and summarized in the current study. RESULTS: The results revealed the updated review on SAR studies of synthetic coumarins as MAO-B inhibitors, specifically for Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. The patents reported on coumarin derivatives as MAO-B inhibitors were also highlighted. CONCLUSION: Recently, coumarins, a large class of chemicals with both natural and synthetic sources, have drawn a lot of attention because of the vast range of biological actions they have that are linked to neurological problems. Numerous studies have demonstrated that chemically produced and naturally occurring coumarin analogs both exhibited strong MAO-B inhibitory action. Coumarins bind to MAO-B reversibly thereby preventing the breakdown of neurotransmitters like dopamine leading to the inhibition of the enzyme A number of MAO-B blockers have been proven to be efficient therapies for treating neurological diseases like Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. To combat these illnesses, there is still an urgent need to find effective treatment compounds.
