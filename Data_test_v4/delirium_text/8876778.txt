8876778|a|Several studies have reported that the bulk aluminum (Al) concentration is increased in the brain in Alzheimer disease (AD), while other studies have failed to demonstrate an increase. Most of these investigations have had one or more methodological deficiencies, including lack of adequate neuropathological assessment; failure to age-match the control samples; small sample sizes, lacking statistical power; and geographical heterogeneity in the AD and control populations. The present population-based study of 92 clinically and histopathologically diagnosed AD patients and normal elderly nursing home residents was designed to avoid these potential biases. When a subsample of AD cases with the most severe brain pathology was compared with controls having no or minimal pathology, no statistically significant differences were found in the bulk aluminum concentration measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry in frontal cortex (1.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.7 micrograms/g dry wt), temporal cortex (1.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.5 micrograms/g dry wt), liver (2.0 +/- 1.3 vs. 2.0 +/- 1.2 micrograms/g dry wt), or head of femur (2.4 +/- 1.6 vs. 2.2 +/- 1.0 micrograms/g ash wt). Within the whole series of 92 cases, there was no difference in the bulk aluminum concentration of the frontal cortex between individuals diagnosed as definite, probable, and possible cases of AD using the CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease) criteria. The density of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in frontal and temporal cortex showed no correlation with the bulk aluminum concentration. Logistic regression analyses, which controlled for age and sex, did not influence outcome for any of the comparisons. The data show conclusively that in AD, bulk aluminum concentration is not increased in two cortical brain regions that are selectively vulnerable to the neuropathological changes associated with this disorder.
