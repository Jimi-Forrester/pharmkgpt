29095058|a|BACKGROUND: Dietary fibers are metabolized by gastrointestinal (GI) bacteria into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). We investigated the potential role of these SCFAs in beta-amyloid (Abeta) mediated pathological processes that play key roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Multiple complementary assays were used to investigate individual SCFAs for their dose-responsive effects in interfering with the assembly of Abetass1-40 and Abeta1-42 peptides into soluble neurotoxic Abeta aggregates. RESULTS: We found that several select SCFAs are capable of potently inhibiting Abeta aggregations, in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our studies support the hypothesis that intestinal microbiota may help protect against AD, in part, by supporting the generation of select SCFAs, which interfere with the formation of toxic soluble Abeta aggregates.
