9791918|t|[Schizo-affective psychosis manifested in adolescence].
9791918|a|141 patients with schizoaffective psychosis were observed: 70 patients in the period of the first manifest attack and 71 ones 10-20 years after it (catamnestic group). It was found that juvenile schizoaffective psychosis is clinically heterogenous endogenous disease, presenting in a continuum of forms in the range from the ones close to affective psychosis to the forms closer to shift-like progredient schizophrenia. The course of the psychosis was determined by peculiarities of nonaffective delirious disorders in clinical picture of manifest attacks. 3 main variants of such attacks are recognized: with domination of delusion of imagination (the 1st type); with domination of a delusion of perception (the 2nd type); with domination of a delirium of perception combined with manifestations of acute interpretative delirium (the 3d type). The 1st and 2nd types of manifest attacks correspond to ICD-10 criteria of schizoaffective psychosis. The course and outcome of juvenile schizoaffective psychosis were less favourable than those of analogus psychosis in adult age.
