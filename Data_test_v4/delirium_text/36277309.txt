36277309|a|Background: To help address the issue of inappropriate antipsychotic prescribing to nursing home residents with dementia, the 'Rationalising Antipsychotic Prescribing in Dementia' (RAPID) complex intervention was developed, comprising staff education and training, academic detailing and a novel resident assessment tool. Objectives: The primary objective was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the RAPID complex intervention in a nursing home setting. The secondary objective was to describe associated trends in psychotropic prescribing, falls, and behavioural symptoms. Methods: A mixed-methods feasibility intervention study in one large nursing home in Ireland was undertaken between 07/2017 and 01/2018. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews were conducted with nursing home staff and GPs at the end of the 3-month follow up period to assess participants' experience of the intervention. Quantitative measurements included pre- and post-course evaluation and psychotropic prescribing rates. Results: Sixteen nursing home staff members attended the two education and training days (21% attendance rate), and four GPs participated in the academic detailing sessions (100% attendance rate). Participants of the focus groups and interviews (n = 18) found the education and training beneficial for their work and expressed a desire to continue educating new staff after the study's completion. However, there was limited usage of the resident assessment tool. Participants also offered recommendations to enhance the intervention.The proportion of dementia residents prescribed at least one regular antipsychotic was stable over the 3-months pre-intervention at 45% (n = 18), and at baseline at 44% (n = 19) but decreased slightly to 36% (n = 14) at 3-months post-intervention. At the same time the absolute number of 'PRN' psychotropics administered monthly to dementia residents decreased substantially from 90 at baseline to 69 at 3-months post-intervention. Conclusion: The RAPID complex intervention was broadly feasible to conduct and may be acceptable to stakeholders. However, before it can be evaluated in larger scale studies, certain protocol modifications and further exploratory work are required to improve implementation.
