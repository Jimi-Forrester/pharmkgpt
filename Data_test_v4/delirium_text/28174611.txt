28174611|a|There is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction mediated oxidative stress results in aging and energy metabolism deficits thus playing a prime role in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, neuronal death and cognitive dysfunction. Evidences accrued in empirical studies suggest the antioxidant, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities of the phytochemical pterostilbene (PTS). PTS also exhibits favourable pharmacokinetic attributes compared to other stilbenes. Hence, in the present study, we explored the neuroprotective role of PTS in ameliorating the intracerebroventricular administered streptozotocin (STZ) induced memory decline in rats. PTS at doses of 10, 30 and 50 mg/kg, was administered orally to STZ administered Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The learning and memory tests, Morris water maze test and novel object recognition test were performed which revealed improved cognition on PTS treatment. Further, there was an overall improvement in brain antioxidant parameters like elevated catalase and superoxide dismutase activities, GSH levels, lowered levels of nitrites, lipid peroxides and carbonylated proteins. There was improved cholinergic transmission as evident by decreased acetylcholinesterase activities. The action of ATPases (Na+ K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+) indicating the maintenance of cell membrane potential was also augmented. mRNA expression of battery of genes involved in cellular mitochondrial biogenesis and inflammation showed variations which extrapolate to hike in mitochondrial biogenesis and abated inflammation. The histological findings corroborated the effective role of PTS in countering STZ induced structural aberrations in brain.
