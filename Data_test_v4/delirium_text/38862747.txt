38862747|t|Regional brain aging: premature aging of the domain general system predicts aphasia severity.
38862747|a|Premature brain aging is associated with poorer cognitive reserve and lower resilience to injury. When there are focal brain lesions, brain regions may age at different rates within the same individual. Therefore, we hypothesize that reduced gray matter volume within specific brain systems commonly associated with language recovery may be important for long-term aphasia severity. Here we show that individuals with stroke aphasia have a premature brain aging in intact regions of the lesioned hemisphere. In left domain-general regions, premature brain aging, gray matter volume, lesion volume and age were all significant predictors of aphasia severity. Increased brain age following a stroke is driven by the lesioned hemisphere. The relationship between brain age in left domain-general regions and aphasia severity suggests that degradation is possible to specific brain regions and isolated aging matters for behavior.
