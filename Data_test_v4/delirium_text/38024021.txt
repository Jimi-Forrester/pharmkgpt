38024021|t|Abrupt Withdrawal From Chronic High-Dose Zolpidem Use: A Case Report of Resulting Delirium.
38024021|a|We report the case of a male in his twenties who was prescribed 10 mg of zolpidem daily for sleep disturbances. Within one month, he self-augmented the dose to 30 mg daily. Unable to secure an authorized refill, he sought unauthorized suppliers and increased his daily intake to 70 mg over eight months. One day after his medication supply was depleted, he presented to the emergency department with symptoms indicative of acute delirium. Delirium was successfully alleviated within six hours using lorazepam. This was followed by a five-day lorazepam tapering regimen during the patient's hospital stay and then a subsequent four-day taper in an outpatient setting. This case highlights the dangers associated with zolpidem misuse, the swift onset of withdrawal symptoms following abrupt discontinuation, and the crucial importance of rigorous prescription monitoring and patient education regarding the risks of unguided dosage modifications and the sudden cessation of zolpidem.
