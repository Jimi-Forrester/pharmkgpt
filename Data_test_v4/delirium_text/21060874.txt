21060874|a|BACKGROUND: Monocyte subpopulations distinguished by differential expression of chemokine receptors CCR2 and CX3CR1 are difficult to track in vivo, partly due to lack of CCR2 reagents. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We created CCR2-red fluorescent protein (RFP) knock-in mice and crossed them with CX3CR1-GFP mice to investigate monocyte subset trafficking. In mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, CCR2 was critical for efficient intrathecal accumulation and localization of Ly6C(hi)/CCR2(hi) monocytes. Surprisingly, neutrophils, not Ly6C(lo) monocytes, largely replaced Ly6C(hi) cells in the central nervous system of these mice. CCR2-RFP expression allowed the first unequivocal distinction between infiltrating monocytes/macrophages from resident microglia. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These results refine the concept of monocyte subsets, provide mechanistic insight about monocyte entry into the central nervous system, and present a novel model for imaging and quantifying inflammatory myeloid populations.
