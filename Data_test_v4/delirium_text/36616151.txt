36616151|t|An In-Depth Study of Metabolite Profile and Biological Potential of Tanacetum balsamita L. (Costmary).
36616151|a|Asteraceae species Tanacetum balsamita L. (costmary) is renowned for its traditional usage as an aromatic, carminative and tonic plant. This work aimed at in-depth study of the phytochemical and in vitro biological profilings of methanol-aqueous extracts from the costmary leaves, flower heads and roots. An UHPLC-HRMS analysis revealed more than 100 secondary metabolites including 24 acylquinic acids, 43 flavonoid glycosides, aglycones and methoxylated derivatives together with 15 phenolic acids glycosides. For the first time, 91 compounds are reported in the costmary. The flower heads extract possessing the highest content of total phenolics and flavonoids, actively scavenged DPPH (84.54 +- 3.35 mgTE/g) and ABTS radicals (96.35 +- 2.22 mgTE/g), and showed the highest reducing potential (151.20 and 93.22 mg TE/g for CUPRAC and FRAP, respectively). The leaves extract exhibited the highest inhibition towards acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase (2.11 and 2.43 mg GALAE/g, respectively) and tyrosinase (54.65 mg KAE/g). The root extract inhibited alpha-glucosidase (0.71 +- 0.07 mmol ACAE/g), alpha-amylase (0.43 +- 0.02 mmol ACAE/g) and lipase (8.15 +- 1.00 mg OE/g). At a concentration >2 microg/mL, a significant dose dependent reduction of cell viability towards THP-1 monocyte leukemic cells was observed. Costmary could be recommended for raw material production with antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory properties.
