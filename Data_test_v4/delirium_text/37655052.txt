37655052|t|Chaperone-mediated autophagy: Molecular mechanisms, biological functions, and diseases.
37655052|a|Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a lysosomal degradation pathway that eliminates substrate proteins through heat-shock cognate protein 70 recognition and lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A-assisted translocation. It is distinct from macroautophagy and microautophagy. In recent years, the regulatory mechanisms of CMA have been gradually enriched, including the newly discovered NRF2 and p38-TFEB signaling, as positive and negative regulatory pathways of CMA, respectively. Normal CMA activity is involved in the regulation of metabolism, aging, immunity, cell cycle, and other physiological processes, while CMA dysfunction may be involved in the occurrence of neurodegenerative disorders, tumors, intestinal disorders, atherosclerosis, and so on, which provides potential targets for the treatment and prediction of related diseases. This article describes the general process of CMA and its role in physiological activities and summarizes the connection between CMA and macroautophagy. In addition, human diseases that concern the dysfunction or protective role of CMA are discussed. Our review deepens the understanding of the mechanisms and physiological functions of CMA and provides a summary of past CMA research and a vision of future directions.
