36605932|t|Difference in GFAP Levels in POCD and Non-POCD Patients After on Pump CABG.
36605932|a|Introduction: On-pump, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the most common cause of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after cardiac surgery. Previous studies showed that the incidence of POCD after cardiac surgery was 60%, higher than non-cardiac surgery with 11.7%. Glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) is one of the sensitive biomarkers of brain damage. Previous studies have found that elevated GFAP serum is associated with cognitive impairment. This study aims to measure the difference in GFAP levels in POCD and non-POCD patients after CABG on-pump surgery. Methods: This study is a retrospective cohort design study. The data were obtained from 56 subjects undergoing elective CABG on the pump surgery enrolled into two groups consisting of 28 POCD as a case group and 28 non-POCD as a control group. In this study, the ELISA method measured the levels of GFAP biomarkers within 24 hours after surgery. After 72 hours, the patient received a MoCA-INA examination to determine cognitive impairment. Data analysis was carried out by SPSS 23.00 software. Results: The mean age of patients in both groups was 60 years and was dominated by males (>85%). POCD patients were found to have a significantly longer duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cross-clamp surgery than non-POCD patients (p = 0.002 and p = 0.004). Postoperative GFAP levels in POCD patients were significantly higher than in non-POCD patients (12.95 +- 7.47 vs 3.80 +- 2.77, p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in GFAP levels compared with non-POCD (8.28 +- 7.24 vs -1.5 +- 3.03, p < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) value of GFAP against POCD was 0.887, cut-off GFAP 4.750 with a sensitivity of 92.9% and a specificity of 71.4%. Conclusion: POCD patients had higher GFAP levels than non-POCD patients. There are differences in GFAP levels in patients with POCD and non-POCD post-CABG surgery.
