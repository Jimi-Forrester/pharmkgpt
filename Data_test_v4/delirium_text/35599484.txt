35599484|t|A Signal Detection Analysis of Olfactory Learning in 12-Month-Old 5xFAD Mice.
35599484|a|Although Alzheimer's disease is most often studied in terms of memory impairments, olfactory dysfunction begins in the early stages. We tested olfactory learning, sensitivity, and response bias using signal detection methods in 12-month-old male and female 5xFAD mice and their wildtype controls in the operant olfactometer. Odor detection was not reduced in the 5xFAD mice, but learning was, which was worse in female 5xFAD mice than in males. Female mice were more conservative in their response strategy. Signal detection analysis allows us to discriminate between cognitive and sensory deficits of male and female mouse models of AD.
