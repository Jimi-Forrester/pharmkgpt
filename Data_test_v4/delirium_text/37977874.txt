37977874|t|Hospital variations in failure to rescue after abdominal surgery: a nationwide, retrospective observational study.
37977874|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine hospital variation and intensive care unit characteristics associated with failure to rescue after abdominal surgery in Norway. DESIGN: A nationwide retrospective observational study. SETTING: All 52 hospitals in Norway performing elective and acute abdominal surgery. PARTICIPANTS: All 598 736 patients undergoing emergency and elective abdominal surgery from 2011 to 2021. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcome was failure to rescue within 30 days (FTR30), defined as in-hospital or out-of-hospital death within 30 days of a surgical patient who developed at least one complication within 30 days of the surgery (FTR30). Other outcome variables were surgical complications and hospital FTR30 variation. Statistical analysis was conducted separately for general surgery and abdominal surgery. RESULTS: The 30-day postoperative complication rate was 30.7 (183 560 of 598 736 surgeries). Of general surgical complications (n=25 775), circulatory collapse (n=6127, 23%), cardiac arrhythmia (n=5646, 21%) and surgical infections (n=4334, 16 %) were most common and 1507 (5.8 %) patients were reoperated within 30 days. One thousand seven hundred and forty patients had FTR30 (6.7 %). The severity of complications was strongly associated with FTR30. In multivariate analysis of general surgery, adjusted for patient characteristics, only the year of surgery was associated with FTR30, with an estimated linear trend of -0.31 percentage units per year (95% CI (-0.48 to -0.15)). The driving distance from local hospitals to the nearest referral intensive care unit was not associated with FTR30. Over the last decade, FTR30 rates have varied significantly among similar hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital factors cannot explain Norwegian hospitals' significant FTR variance when adjusting for patient characteristics. The national FTR30 measure has dropped around 30% without a corresponding fall in surgical complications. No association was seen between rural hospital location and FTR30. Policy-makers must address microsystem issues causing high FTR30 in hospitals.
