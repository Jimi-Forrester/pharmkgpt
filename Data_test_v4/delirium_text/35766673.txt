35766673|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of complications associated with the use of temporary pacemakers in patients in the waiting list for the definitive pacemaker implantation in a public hospital located in Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil. METHODS: Retrospective observational study based on data extracted from medical records of patients admitted to Hospital Municipal Dr. Moyses Deutsch, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein from January 2014 to December 2018. Patients aged 18 years or older, diagnosed with high degree atrioventricular block upon admission and with indications for definitive pacemaker implantation were included. All-cause mortality, clinical and surgical complications and length of hospital stay while waiting for the procedure were defined as primary outcomes. RESULTS: The sample comprised 66 patient allocated to one of two groups: with and without the need of temporary pacemaker while in hospital (n=45 and n=21, respectively). The rate of complications was higher in patients who used a temporary pacemaker (p<0.001). These included primarily pneumonia (p=0.048) and length of hospital stay (p=0.029). CONCLUSION: Patients who required a temporary pacemaker stayed longer in hospital. Longer hospital stay is associated with higher rates of general complications and all-cause mortality.
