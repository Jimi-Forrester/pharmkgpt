34861607|a|Early diagnosis of neurodegeneration-oriented diseases that develop with the aging world is essential for improving the patient's living conditions as well as the treatment of the disease. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are prominent examples of neurodegeneration characterized by dementia leading to the death of nerve cells. The clinical diagnosis of these diseases only after the symptoms appear, delays the treatment process. Detection of biomarkers, which are distinctive molecules in biological fluids, involved in neurodegeneration processes, has the potential to allow early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Studies on biosensors, whose main responsibility is to detect the target analyte with high specificity, has gained momentum in recent years with the aim of high detection of potential biomarkers of neurodegeneration process. This study aims to provide an overview of neuro-biosensors developed on the basis of biomarkers identified in biological fluids for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), and to provide an overview of the urgent needs in this field, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis in the general lines of the neurodegeneration pathway. In this review, biosensor systems developed for the detection of biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases, especially in the last 5 years, are discussed.
