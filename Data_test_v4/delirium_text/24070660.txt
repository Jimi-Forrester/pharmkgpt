24070660|t|Neuropsychiatric conditions associated with anesthesia exposure.
24070660|a|BACKGROUND: Although anesthetics have been used for more than a century, their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Given that a number of intraoperative and postoperative neuropsychiatric syndromes have been linked to the use of anesthetics, practitioners should familiarize themselves with these conditions. METHODS: Basic concepts about anesthesia are reviewed and neuropsychiatric syndromes associated with anesthesia exposure described. CONCLUSIONS: Emergence delirium, postoperative delirium, postoperative cognitive dysfunction, and intraoperative awareness can develop in association with use of inhalation anesthetics and intravenously administered anesthetics.
