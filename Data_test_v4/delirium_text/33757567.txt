33757567|a|BACKGROUND: Abnormal body mass index (BMI) has been related to a higher risk of adverse outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, the effects of BMI in patients with acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) on postoperative outcomes remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationships between BMI and in-hospital major adverse outcomes (MAO) in AAAD patients. METHODS: Patients who underwent AAAD surgery at Cardiac Medical Center of Fujian Province from June 2013 to March 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. They were divided into three groups on the basis of Chinese BMI classification established by the World Health Organization: normal weight group (BMI 18.5-23.9 kg/m2), overweight group (BMI 24-27.9 kg/m2), and obese group (BMI >28 kg/m2). Patients' baseline characteristics, preoperative, operative, and postoperative data were collected. A multivariable logistic regression analysis model was performed to identify the association between BMI and MAO in AAAD patients. RESULTS: Of 777 cases, 31.9% were normal weight, 52.5% were overweight, and 15.6% were obese. A total of 160(20.6%) patients died in-hospital. There was a significant difference between the three groups for MAO (62.9% vs 72.1% vs 77.7%, respectively, P = 0.006). The incidence of postoperative complications did not differ among the three groups, except for postoperative bleeding, and prolonged mechanical ventilation, the proportion of which were higher in the overweight and obese groups. Besides, multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that a higher risk of MAO in the overweight [odds ratios (ORs):1.475, 95%CI:1.006-2.162], and obese patients (ORs:2.147, 95%CI:1.219-3.782) with reference to the normal weight patients, and age, white blood cell, prior stroke and cardiopulmonary bypass time were also associated with in-hospital MAO (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: BMI is independently associated with higher in-hospital MAO in patients who underwent AAAD surgery.
