35464703|a|Aims: Bacopa floribunda (BF), an African traditional plant and its species have been widely used as brain tonic for memory enhancement. It has also been reported to help relieve anxiety and some psychological disorders. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of action of BF on Amyloid beta (Abeta) 1-42 peptides induced cognitive deficit in male Wistar rats. Main methods: A total of 48 healthy male wistar rats were used for this study. Some groups were pre-treated with 200 mg/kg of BF extracts before a single bilateral injection of Abeta 1-42 while some were post-treated with BF for 21 days after Abeta1-42 exposure. Cognitive performance was evaluated using Y-Maze and Novel Object recognition tests. After treatments, hippocampal homogenates were assayed for the levels of Acetylcholinesterase, Na-K/ATPase activities, glutamate and Abeta1-42 concentrations among others. Key findings: It was observed that Abeta1-42 caused cognitive impairment and BF extracts especially the ethanol extract was able to significantly (p < 0.05) reverse almost all the perturbations including lipid imbalance caused by Abeta1-42 assault mainly at the post-treatment level. Significance: Administration of ethanol and aqueous extracts of BF mitigated the hazardous effect of Abeta1-42 observed in the blood plasma and hippocampal homogenates. In this context, we conclude that BF is an efficient cognitive enhancer that can help alleviate some symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease.
