36189377|t|Early weaning leads to the remodeling of lipid profile in piglet jejunal crypt cells during post-weaning days.
36189377|a|Reportedly, proteins involved in lipid metabolism change significantly in the jejunal crypt cells of early-weaned piglets, but the exact lipid profile change remains uncertain. In the present study, 32 piglets weaned at 21 d of age were randomly divided into 4 groups with 8 replicates. The jejunal crypt cells of a group of piglets on the post-weaning day (PWD) 1, 3, 7, and 14 were isolated per time point. Crypt cell lipid profiles were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. This study showed that piglets suffered the greatest weaning stress on PWD 3 in terms of the lowest relative weight of the small intestine, the highest relative weight of the spleen, and the highest levels of malondialdehyde, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The lipid profile of jejunal crypt cells including carnitine, sulfatide, sphingomyelin, hexosylceramide, and ceramide greatly changed after weaning, especially between PWD 3 and 14 (P < 0.05). The differential lipid species between these 2 d were mainly involved in the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway. In addition, potential lipid biomarkers for weaning stress in crypt cells such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) (9:0/26:1), PC (17:0/18:2), carnitine (24:0), carnitine (22:0), sphingomyelin (d14:1/22:0), PC (P-18:0/18:4), phosphatidylethanolamine (P-16:0/20:4), phosphatidylinositol (15:1/24:4), and dihexosylceramide (d14:1/26:1) were identified. The changes in lipid profile might be related to the inflammation caused by early weaning. These findings might provide new therapeutical targets for intestinal dysfunctions caused by weaning stress.
