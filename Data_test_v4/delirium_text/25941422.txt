25941422|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The incidence of vascular dementia (VD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently increased and the prevention of progression of these diseases is very difficult. RESULTS: The application of pinpoint plantar long-wavelength infrared light irradiation (PP-LILI) to a patient's sole, at the point where the line drawn between the first and second metatarsal heads intersects with the vertical line from the medial malleolus, was effective in increasing blood flow to the facial artery, elevating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and reducing insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: We found that these effects of PP-LILI might be helpful for preventing VD and AD, conditions that are becoming a social problem in an aging Japanese society.
