9099821|a|Based on the homology of human and monkey amyloid precursor proteins and the derived beta-amyloid peptides (A beta) the investigation of brains from old monkeys might be useful for the understanding of beta-amyloidosis in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, the prefrontal cortex, which is known to be highly susceptible to the deposition of A beta, was screened for the occurrence of senile plaques in perfused tissue of aged rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). A beta deposits were immunocytochemically detected in five of six macaques aged about 28 years. Differently N-terminal truncated A beta species in the senile plaques were simultaneously detected by a carbocyanine double fluorescence method applying the bright red fluorescent Cy3 and the novel green fluorescent Cy2. In a few cases, immunoreactivity for the shortened fragment containing the amino acids 17-42 (A beta(17-42); p3 fragment with a molecular weight of 3 kDa) was demonstrated in deposits apparently devoid of A beta(8-17). Senile plaques were further characterized by carbocyanine double labelling of A beta and astrocytes, microglia and apolipoprotein E.
