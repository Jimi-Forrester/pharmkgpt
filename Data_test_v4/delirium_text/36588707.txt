36588707|t|Pharmacovigilance of triazole antifungal agents: Analysis of the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database.
36588707|a|Triazole antifungal drugs (TAD) are widely used to treat invasive fungal infections due to their broad antifungal spectrum and low toxicity. Despite their preference in the clinic, multiple Adverse Events (AE) are still reported each year. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize the distribution of Adverse Events associated with Triazole antifungal drugs in different systems and to identify Important Medical Events (IME) signals for Triazole antifungal drugs. METHODS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was queried for Adverse Events related to Triazole antifungal drugs from 2012 to 2022. The Adverse Events caused by all other drugs and non-TAD antifungal drugs were analyzed as references. Reporting odds ratio and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network of information components were used to evaluate the association between Triazole antifungal drugs and Important Medical Events. Visual signal spectrum is mapped to identify potential adverse reaction signals. RESULTS: Overall, 10,262 Adverse Events were reported to be associated with Triazole antifungal drugs, of which 5,563 cases were defined as Important Medical Events. Common adverse drug reactions (ADR) mentioned in the instructions such as delirium and hypokalemia were detected, as well as unlabeled ADRs such as rhabdomyolysis and hepatitis fulminant. Cholestasis, drug-induced liver injury, QT interval prolongation and renal impairment have notable signals in all Triazole antifungal drugs, with 50 percent of patients developing a severe clinical outcome. Isavuconazole had the lowest signal intensity and demonstrated a superior safety profile. CONCLUSION: Most results are generally consistent with previous studies and are documented in the prescribing instructions, but some IMEs are not included, such as hepatitis fulminant. Additional pharmaco-epidemiological or experimental studies are required to validate the small number of unlabeled ADRs. TAD-related Important Medical Eventshave a considerable potential to cause clinically serious outcomes. Clinical use of Triazole antifungal drugs requires more attention.
