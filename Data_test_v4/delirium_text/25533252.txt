25533252|a|Frequent emergencies in patients with dementia include aggressiveness, screaming, day/night reversal, other behavioral disorders, and falls. They are often caused by delirium, especially if there has been a rapid change in the patient's state of health. Hypoactive delirium in particular is difficult to recognize in the dementia setting. Acute somatic diseases bear a different meaning in dementia than in non-dementia patients, and priorities must be given to the impaired cerebral performance. In addition to medical decisions, ethical ones need to be made. Special attention should be paid to the resources of the caregiver network. This article describes both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment modalities when dealing with emergencies in dementia patients.
