34696733|t|Psoas compartment block efficacy and safety for perioperative analgesia in the elderly with proximal femur fractures: a randomized controlled study.
34696733|a|BACKGROUND: Proximal femur fractures are most common fractures in the elderly and associated with significant mortality and morbidity, with high economic and social impact. Perioperative pain management influence outcomes and mortality after surgery with early mobilization being possible. The goal of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of the psoas compartment block (PCB) with spinal and general anesthesia. METHODS: We included 90 patients in this randomized controlled study and divided them into three groups. For patients in group 1 ultrasound-guided PCB with bupivacaine 0.125% 6-8 ml / h was performed. Intraoperative anesthesia was provided with PCB and a sciatic nerve block. Postoperative analgesia include prolonged CPB with bupivacaine 0.125% 6-8 ml / h. In group 2 intraoperative spinal anaesthesia were performed. Group 3 patients underwent general sevoflurane inhalation anaesthesia with fentanyl infusion for analgesia. All patients received paracetamol 3 g/day and dexketoprofen 75 mg/day during hospitalization. On-demand, nalbuphine 5 mg SC was used for analgesia. Efficacy outcomes were the ICU length of stay and the total duration of hospitalization, number of patients who had severe pain after surgery, incidence of on-demand analgesia, sleep quality, postoperative mobilization time. Safety outcomes include complication incidence. RESULTS: There were no differences in the duration of ICU stay - gr.1 72 [70-75], gr.2 74 [72-76], gr.3 72 [70-75] hours respectively (p = 0.29), and the total duration of hospitalization - gr.1144 [170-184], gr.2170 [148-188], gr.3178 [144-200] hours respectively. Patients in gr.1 had significantly lower nalbuphine consumption in the first 24 h after surgery and total during hospitalization (0 [0-5] mg versus 15 [10-20] and 20 [15-25] mg in the first 24 h in groups 2 and 3, respectively (p < 0.001). Gr. 1 had lower number of patients with severe pain (10% vs. 47 and 60% in groups 2 and 3, respectively, p < 0.05), lower number of on demand analgesia (0 [0-1] vs. 3 [2-4] and 4 [3, 4] in groups 2 and 3, respectively), better sleep quality (8 [7-9] vs. 6 [5-7] and 4 [3, 4] in groups 2 and 3, respectively, p < 0.001), significantly faster mobilization after surgery - sitting in bed and getting to his feet. MINS was diagnosed significantly more often in gr. 2 and 3 compared with gr. 1 (OR 9 95 CI 1,01-77, p = 0,048 for gr. 2 and OR 11 95 CI 1,2-91, p = 0, 03 for gr. 3). However, none of the patients had symptoms of myocardial ischemia and was not diagnosed with myocardial infarction. There were no difference in the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia and delirium. CONCLUSION: Perioperative PCB in elderly patients with a proximal femur fracture could be an effective analgesia technique, as it decrease the number of patients with severe pain, need for on demand analgesia and opioid consumption. PCB also decrease the incidence of opioid-associated nausea and vomiting, comparing to general anesthesia, and increase the number of patients, who was mobilized in the 1st day (sitting) and 2nd day (getting up) after surgery. PCB may reduce the incidence of MINS, although to assess this outcome more studies are needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04648332 , first registration date 1/12/2020.
