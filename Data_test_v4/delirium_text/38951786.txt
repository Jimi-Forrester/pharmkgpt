38951786|a|PURPOSE: Awake extubation and deep extubation are commonly used anesthesia techniques. In this study, the safety of propofol-assisted deep extubation in the dental treatment of children was assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with severe caries who received dental treatment under general anesthesia and deep extubation between January 2017 and June 2023 were included in this study. Data were collected on the following variables: details and time of anesthesia, perioperative vital signs, and incidence of postoperative complications. The incidence of laryngeal spasm (LS) was considered to be the primary observation indicator. RESULTS: The perioperative data obtained from 195 children undergoing dental treatment was reviewed. The median age was 4.2 years (range: 2.3 to 9.6 years), and the average duration of anesthesia was 2.56 h (range 1 to 4.5 h). During intubation with a videoscope, purulent mucus was found in the pharyngeal cavity of seven children (3.6%); LS occurred in five of them (2.6%), and one child developed a fever (T = 37.8  C) after discharge. Five children (2.6%) experienced emergence agitation (EA) in the recovery room. Also, 13 children (6.7%) experienced epistaxis; 10 had a mild experience and three had a moderate experience. No cases of airway obstruction (AO) and hypoxemia were recorded. The time to open eyes (TOE) was 16.3 +- 7.2 min. The incidence rate of complications was 23/195 (11.8%). Emergency tracheal reintubation was not required. Patients with mild upper respiratory tract infections showed a significantly higher incidence of complications (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Propofol-assisted deep extubation is a suitable technique that can be used for pediatric patients who exhibited non-cooperation in the outpatient setting. Epistaxis represents the most frequently encountered complication. Preoperative upper respiratory tract infection significantly increases the risk of complications. The occurrence of EA was notably lower than reported in other studies.
