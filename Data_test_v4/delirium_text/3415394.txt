3415394|t|Cerebrospinal fluid choline, and acetylcholinesterase activity in familial vs. non-familial Alzheimer's disease patients.
3415394|a|Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline (Ch) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from familial and non-familial Alzheimer disease patients were studied. The choline level was significantly less (p less than 0.04) in familial patients than in non-familial patients. However, there was no difference in AChE activity in these two groups.
