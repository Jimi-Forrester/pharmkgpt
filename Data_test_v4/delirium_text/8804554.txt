8804554|t|Cytotoxicity study of tacrine, structurally and pharmacologically related compounds using rat hepatocytes.
8804554|a|Tacrine is the first drug approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Approximately 50% of patients treated with tacrine develop elevated serum aminotransferase levels, as an indication of potential hepatotoxicity. However, acute and chronic studies with a limited number of animal models have not demonstrated hepatotoxicity. The present study compared the cytotoxicity in hepatocyte cultures of tacrine with structurally (proflavine and 9-aminoacridine) or pharmacologically similar compounds (physostigmine), as well as structurally modified tacrine to determine if there was a structure activity relationship with regards to toxicity. Cytotoxicity was assessed by determination of extra- and intracellular amounts of lactate dehydrogenase. Cytotoxicity was assessed after a four-hour exposure over a test compound concentration range of 0 to 3 mM. Concentration-dependent cytotoxicity occurred with tacrine and all structurally related compounds. Physostigmine which is pharmacologically similar, but structurally different, did not induce cytotoxicity. Cytotoxic potency did not appear to be related to acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, while compounds with acridine structures induced cytotoxicity. Thus, in this in vitro model, cytotoxicity appears to be related to structure and not pharmacological action. Results of this study indicate that compounds structurally related to tacrine are cytotoxic because of the heterocyclic ring structure. Neither unsaturation of an aromatic ring of the heterocyclic compound, amino substitution of the heterocyclic rings, N-hydroxylation of the amino group, nor ring hydroxylation dramatically alter cytotoxicity.
