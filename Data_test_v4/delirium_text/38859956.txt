38859956|a|The genome editing approach by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) is a revolutionary advancement in genetic engineering. Owing to its simple design and powerful genome-editing capability, it offers a promising strategy for the treatment of different infectious, metabolic, and genetic diseases. The crystal structure of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) in complex with sgRNA and its target DNA at 2.5 A resolution reveals a groove accommodating sgRNA:DNA heteroduplex within a bilobate architecture with target recognition (REC) and nuclease (NUC) domains. The presence of a PAM is significantly required for target recognition, R-loop formation, and strand scission. Recently, the spatiotemporal control of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has been considerably improved by genetic, chemical, and physical regulatory strategies. The use of genetic modifiers anti-CRISPR proteins, cell-specific promoters, and histone acetyl transferases has uplifted the application of CRISPR/Cas9 as a future-generation genome editing tool. In addition, interventions by chemical control, small-molecule activators, oligonucleotide conjugates and bioresponsive delivery carriers have improved its application in other areas of biological fields. Furthermore, the intermediation of physical control by using heat-, light-, magnetism-, and ultrasound-responsive elements attached to this molecular tool has revolutionized genome editing further. These strategies significantly reduce CRISPR/Cas9's undesirable off-target effects. However, other undesirable effects still offer some challenges for comprehensive clinical translation using this genome-editing approach. In this review, we summarize recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9 structure, mechanistic action, and the role of small-molecule activators, inhibitors, promoters, and physical approaches. Finally, off-target measurement approaches, challenges, future prospects, and clinical applications are discussed.
