8969351|t|Lewy body disease.
8969351|a|Lewy bodies have historically been considered a histopathologic hallmark of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Recently, it has become clear that Lewy bodies play a role in neurodegenerative processes other than idiopathic Parkinson's disease, including diffuse Lewy body disease and diffuse Lewy bodies with concomitant Alzheimer's disease changes. It is likely that these processes represent a spectrum of neurodegenerative change in which Lewy bodies play a pivotal role. Although much is known and has been written regarding the histopathology and pathophysiology of Lewy body diseases, specific criteria for their diagnosis remain problematic. Within the spectrum of Lewy body disease, overlap in clinical presentation and histopathologic findings has caused some to dismiss attempts at subcategorizing Lewy body disease as artificial. We present, in brief, current information and theories concerning the pathology and pathogenesis of Lewy body disease.
