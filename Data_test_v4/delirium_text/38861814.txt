38861814|t|Infraorbital nerve block for pain management in pediatric cleft lip surgery in resource-limited areas of Indonesia: A case series.
38861814|a|INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Cleft lip and palate (CLP) are congenital anomalies of the craniofacial region, commonly found in low- and middle-income countries, including Indonesia. Surgical correction of clefts typically begins at around three months of age to support infant growth. An infraorbital nerve block is an option for regional anesthesia in CLP surgery. This case series aims to determine the effectiveness of infraorbital nerve block in pain management for pediatric CLP surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: This case series includes five patients who fulfilled the Millard criteria for CLP surgery. All patients received general anesthesia followed by an infraorbital nerve block with 0.2 % ropivacaine in the infraorbital foramen area using the intraoral approach. Data were collected preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively. DISCUSSION: The combination of general anesthesia and infraorbital nerve block resulted in stable hemodynamics, low delirium scores, low pain intensity, and adequate oral intake postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Infraorbital nerve block with ropivacaine provides intraoperative hemodynamic stability, decreased delirium, and effective postoperative pain management in pediatric patients undergoing CLP surgery.
