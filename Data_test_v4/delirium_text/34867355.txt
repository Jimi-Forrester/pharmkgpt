34867355|t|Safety Evaluation for Restorin  NMN, a NAD+ Precursor.
34867355|a|NAD+ is an abundant molecule in the body and vital to all living cells. NAD+ levels decline with age, and this decline correlates with age-related diseases. Therefore, sustaining NAD+ levels offers potential benefits to healthspan and longevity. Here we conducted toxicity studies to evaluate the safety of Restorin  NMN, a high purity form of the direct NAD+ precursor, beta-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). Based on the preliminary toxicity study and a 14-days repeated dose toxicity study at a higher dose level exposure, Restorin  NMN was administered orally to Sprague-Dawley rats for 91 days followed by a 14-days recovery period. The oral doses of 500, 1,000, and 2000 mg/kg/day were compared. There were no test item-related findings that could be considered adverse events in animals dosed at 500 mg/kg/day. The findings in the Restorin  NMN high dose group (2000 mg/kg/day) were similar to the reference item (Nicotinamide Riboside Chloride) dosed at 1740 mg/kg/day: reduced body weight, reductions in body weight gains, and diminished food consumption. In conclusion, the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) for Restorin  NMN is 1,000 mg/kg/day in female rats and 500 mg/kg/day in male rats, and the Low-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (LOAEL) for Resotrin  NMN is 2000 mg/kg/day.
