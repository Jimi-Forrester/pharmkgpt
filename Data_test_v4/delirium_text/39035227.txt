39035227|a|Objectives: We investigated the relationship between the perioperative nutritional status and postoperative walking ability in patients with hip fractures. Methods: We included 246 surgically treated elderly patients with hip fractures who were ambulatory before the injury. Patients were divided into two groups: group A, who were able to walk at discharge, and group B, who were unable to walk at discharge. We pair-matched these two groups according to age, preoperative subdivided walking ability, and fracture site to form groups A' and B'. The prognostic nutritional index (PNI; PNI = 10 x serum albumin (g/dL) + 0.005 x blood total lymphocyte count (/mm3)) before surgery and 1 day, 1 week, and 2 weeks after surgery and energy intake 1 and 2 weeks after surgery were compared. Results: After adjustments for age, preoperative subdivided walking ability, and fracture site, there were 51 patients in group A' (mean age 84.6 years) and 51 patients in group B' (mean age 84.7 years). In group A'/group B', PNI was 43.38/42.60 (P = 0.19) before surgery, 33.87/33.31 (P = 0.44) 1 day after surgery, 34.99/32.35 (P = 0.01) 1 week after surgery, and 37.33/35.69 (P = 0.15) 2 weeks after surgery. Energy intake was 1380.8/1203.1 kcal (P = 0.01) 1 week after surgery and 1382.0/1335.6 kcal (P = 0.60) 2 weeks after surgery. Conclusions: PNI and energy intake at 1 week postoperatively were associated with early postoperative nutrition and the recovery of walking ability.
