16594250|a|The use of psychostimulants to relieve opioid-induced drowsiness and symptoms of depression in medically ill patients has become increasingly established in North America. The role of psychostimulants in the care of patients receiving palliative care is beginning to be debated in the United Kingdom both in the hospice and hospital setting. Delirium has been well defined and reported as a significant problem in populations of patients receiving palliative care.
