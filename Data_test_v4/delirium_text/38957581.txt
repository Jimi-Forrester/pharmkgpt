38957581|t|A novel fluorescent probe with a phosphofluorene molecular structure for selective detection of hydrogen sulfide in living cells.
38957581|a|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas plays a significant role in biological regulation. With advancements in technology, H2S has been discovered across diverse fields, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of its physiological functions through monitoring changes in H2S within complex environments and physiological processes. In this study, we designed a phosphofluorene-based conjugate probe PPF-CDNB with an asymmetric pi-conjugated phosphine structure and utilized dinitrophenyl ether as the recognition site for H2S. PPF-CDNB exhibited exceptional resistance to interference and demonstrated stability over a broad pH range (3.0-10.0), making it suitable for various environmental conditions. Intracellular experiments revealed that PPF-CDNB effectively monitored both endogenous and exogenous levels of H2S.
