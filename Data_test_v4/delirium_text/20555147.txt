20555147|t|Cystatin C levels are positively correlated with both Abeta42 and tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid in persons with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy controls.
20555147|a|Cystatin C is suggested to be involved in neurodegeneration and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by binding to soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. Studies of cystatin C levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in relation to risk of AD are conflicting and relations between cystatin C, Abeta42, and tau levels in CSF in AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls are unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate cystatin C, Abeta42, and tau levels in CSF in AD, MCI, and controls. As a secondary aim, the relationships between cystatin C, Abeta42, and tau levels across disease groups were investigated. Cystatin C, Abeta42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau levels in CSF were analyzed by turbidimetry (cystatin C) and xMAP Luminex technology (Abeta and tau) in persons with AD (n=101), MCI (n=84), and healthy control subjects (n=28). Mean cystatin C levels were similar in cases of AD (5.6 micromol/L +/- 1.7), MCI (5.4 micromol/L +/- 1.48), and controls (5.6 micromol/L +/- 1.6). However, CSF cystatin C levels were strongly and positively correlated with total tau and phosphorylated tau levels (r=0.61-0.81, p< 0.0001) and Abeta42 (r=0.35-0.65, p< 0.001) independent of age, gender, and APOE genotype. Mean CSF cystatin C levels did not differ between patients with AD and MCI and healthy controls. Interestingly, cystatin C levels were positively correlated with both tau and Abeta42 levels in CSF independent of age, gender, and APOE genotype.
