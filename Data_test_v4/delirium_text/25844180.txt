25844180|t|Crystal structure of N-{N-[N-acetyl-(S)-leuc-yl]-(S)-leuc-yl}norleucinal (ALLN), an inhibitor of proteasome.
25844180|a|The title compound, C20H37N3O4, also known by the acronym ALLN, is a tripeptidic inhibitor of the proteolytic activity of the proteasomes, enzyme complexes implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases and other disorders, including cancer. The crystal structure of ALLN, solved from synchrotron radiation diffraction data, revealed the mol-ecules in extended conformation of the backbone and engaging all peptide N and O atoms in inter-molecular hydrogen bonds forming an infinite anti-parallel beta-sheet.
