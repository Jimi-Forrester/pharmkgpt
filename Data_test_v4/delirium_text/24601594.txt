24601594|t|Capping amyloid beta-sheets of the tau-amyloid structure VQIVYK with hexapeptides designed to arrest growth. An ONIOM and density functional theory study.
24601594|a|We present ONIOM calculations using density functional theory (DFT) as the high and AM1 as the medium level that explore the abilities of different hexapeptide sequences to terminate the growth of a model for the tau-amyloid implicated in Alzheimer's disease. We delineate and explore several design principles (H-bonding in the side chains, using antiparallel interactions on the growing edge of a parallel sheet, using all-d residues to form rippled interactions at the edge of the sheet, and replacing the H-bond donor N-H's that inhibit further growth) that can be used individually and in combination to design such peptides that will have a greater affinity for binding to the parallel beta-sheet of acetyl-VQIVYK-NHCH3 than the natural sequence and will prevent another strand from binding to the sheet, thus providing a cap to the growing sheet that arrests further growth. We found peptides in which the Q is replaced by an acetyllysine (aK) residue to be particularly promising candidates, particularly if the reverse sequence (KYVIaKV) is used to form an antiparallel interaction with the sheet.
