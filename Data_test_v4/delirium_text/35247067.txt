35247067|t|Reversibility of brain glucose kinetics in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
35247067|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We have previously shown that individuals with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes have a blunted rise in brain glucose levels measured by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Here, we investigate whether reductions in HbA1c normalise intracerebral glucose levels. METHODS: Eight individuals (two men, six women) with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and mean +- SD age 44.8 +- 8.3 years, BMI 31.4 +- 6.1 kg/m2 and HbA1c 84.1 +- 16.2 mmol/mol (9.8 +- 1.4%) underwent 1H MRS scanning at 4 Tesla during a hyperglycaemic clamp (~12.21 mmol/l) to measure changes in cerebral glucose at baseline and after a 12 week intervention that improved glycaemic control through the use of continuous glucose monitoring, diabetes regimen intensification and frequent visits to an endocrinologist and nutritionist. RESULTS: Following the intervention, mean +- SD HbA1c decreased by 24.3 +- 15.3 mmol/mol (2.1 +- 1.5%) (p=0.006), with minimal weight changes (p=0.242). Using a linear mixed-effects regression model to compare glucose time courses during the clamp pre and post intervention, the pre-intervention brain glucose level during the hyperglycaemic clamp was significantly lower than the post-intervention brain glucose (p<0.001) despite plasma glucose levels during the hyperglycaemic clamp being similar (p=0.266). Furthermore, the increases in brain glucose were correlated with the magnitude of improvement in HbA1c (r = 0.71, p=0.048). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: These findings highlight the potential reversibility of cerebral glucose transport capacity and metabolism that can occur in individuals with type 2 diabetes following improvement of glycaemic control.
