34451604|a|Cancer is the world's second leading cause of death, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths and 19.3 million new cases in 2020. Curcumin analogs are gaining popularity as anticancer agents currently. We reported herein the isolation, molecular engineering, molecular docking, antiproliferative, and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) activities of curcumin analogs. Three curcumin analogs were prepared and docked against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), revealing efficient binding. Antiproliferative activity against 60 NCI cancer cell lines was assessed using National Cancer Institute (NCI US) protocols. The compound 3b,c demonstrated promising antiproliferative activity in single dose (at 10 microM) as well as five dose (0.01, 0.10, 1.00, 10, and 100 microM). Compound 3c inhibited leukemia cancer panel better than other cancer panels with growth inhibition of 50% (GI50) values ranging from 1.48 to 2.73 microM, and the most promising inhibition with GI50 of 1.25 microM was observed against leukemia cell line SR, while the least inhibition was found against non-small lung cancer cell line NCI-H226 with GI50 value of 7.29 microM. Compounds 3b,c demonstrated superior antiproliferative activity than curcumin and gefitinib. In molecular docking, compound 3c had the most significant interaction with four H-bonds and three pi-pi stacking, and compound 3c was found to moderately inhibit EGFR. The curcumin analogs discovered in this study have the potential to accelerate the anticancer drug discovery program.
