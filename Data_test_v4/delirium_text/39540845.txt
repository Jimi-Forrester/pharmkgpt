39540845|t|MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY PATTERN AMONG HOSPITALIZED OLDER ADULTS: THE NATIONAL HOSPITAL ABUJA GERIATRIC UNIT EXPERIENCE.
39540845|a|Background: Understanding morbidity and mortality patterns among older adults is crucial for effective healthcare planning for Nigeria's aging population. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of mortality, assess morbidities, and identify mortality predictors among inpatient older adults managed by the Geriatric team of National Hospital Abuja. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 110 inpatients aged >= 60 years was conducted. Demographic data, diagnoses, length of stay, and outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: The mean age was 76.71 +- 9.44 years, with equal gender distribution. Mortality prevalence was 27.3%. The most common morbidities were hypertension (56.4%), sepsis (50.0%), delirium (46.4%), diabetes (35.5%), and dementia (29.1%). The mean hospital stay was 15.88 +- 12.18 days. Acute renal failure was significantly associated with mortality (p = 0.042) and emerged as the strongest predictor (Adjusted OR = 3.232, 95% CI: 1.080 - 9.668p = 0.036). Age, gender, and length of stay were not significant predictors of mortality. Conclusion: This study reveals a considerable mortality rate and a high prevalence of multi-morbidity among hospitalized older adults. Renal failure was the strongest mortality predictor, while hypertension, sepsis, and delirium were the common morbidities. Recommendations: Develop specialized geriatric care protocols, that include optimal management of prevalent conditions and routine renal function screening. These findings provide valuable insights for improving healthcare delivery for hospitalized older adults in Nigeria.
