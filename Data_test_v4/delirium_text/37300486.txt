37300486|t|Evaluation of the Role of a Clinical Pharmacist on Medication Management in an Adult Burn Clinic via a Collaborative Drug Therapy Management Protocol.
37300486|a|Historically, pharmacists have not been formally involved in managing burn clinic patients. Collaborative Drug Therapy Management (CDTM) protocols allow pharmacists working within a defined context to independently assume responsibility for direct patient care activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the number and type of medication-related interventions made by a clinical pharmacist, in an adult burn clinic, via a CDTM protocol. The protocol allows pharmacists to independently manage the following disease states: pain, agitation, delirium, insomnia, venous thromboembolism, skin/soft tissue infections, and hypermetabolic complications. All pharmacist visits between 1/1/22-9/22/22 were included. A total of 16 patients were seen at 28 visits with a clinical pharmacist for a total of 148 interventions. Patients were mostly males (81%) with a mean +- SD age of 41 +- 15 years. The majority of patients were in-state (94%), with 9 (56%) being from an outlying county. Patients were seen for a median (IQR) of 2 (1,2) visits. Interventions were made at all visits (100%) with a median of 5 (4,6) per visit. Interventions (per visit) included medication reconciliation [28 (100%)], a median of 1 (0,2) medication ordered or adjusted, labs ordered at 7 (25%) visits, with adherence and patient education both reviewed at over 90% of visits. To our knowledge, ours is the first burn center to implement a Clinical Pharmacist CDTM Protocol, with a pharmacist directly impacting transitions of care. This may serve as a framework for other sites. Future directions include continuing to track data for medication adherence and access, billing/reimbursement, and clinical outcomes.
