35527538|t|Absolute Bed Rest Duration of 3 Days for Osteoporotic Vertebral Fractures: A Retrospective Study.
35527538|a|STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. PURPOSE: To reduce unnecessary absolute bed rest (ABR), this study sought to determine the optimal aimed length of ABR in older patients getting conservative treatment for osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs). OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: OVFs are quite common in elderly patients. ABR is a vital part of conservative treatment for OVFs, although the length of ABR may increase patient. No recommendations regarding how long ABR should last. METHODS: This study was conducted in 134 patients with OVFs initially treated conservatively. The patients were split into two groups: 3-day and 7-day ABR. From the time of injury to 1, 4, and 12 weeks after injury, compression rate (CR) and local kyphotic angle (LKA) were assessed and compared between the two groups. Any complications such as pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, delirium, and urinary tract infection known to be related to ABR were examined based on the electronic medical record. RESULTS: Forty-four patients underwent ABR for 3 days and 90 underwent ABR for 7 days. There was no significant difference in CR and LKA between the two groups at the time of injury versus 1, 4, and 12 weeks after injury. The patients were divided into two groups: those who received a 3-day ABR and those who received a 7-day ABR. CR and LKA were measured and compared between the two groups from the time of damage to 1, 4, and 12 weeks after injury. The ABR-related complication rate was 43.4% in the 7-day ABR group and 22.7% in 3-day ABR group (p=0.02). The duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the 3-day ABR group (12.8 days) than in the 7-day group (16 days) (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Considering radiological outcomes, prognosis, complications, patient convenience, and economic impact, a 3-day ABR period is appropriate for the conservative treatment of OVFs.
