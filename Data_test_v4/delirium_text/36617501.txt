36617501|t|Two New Compounds Isolated from the Leaves of Ohwia caudata and Their Neuroprotective Effect against LPS-Induced BV2 Cells.
36617501|a|From the dried leaves of Ohwia caudata, two new compounds, namely (4E)-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-butenoic acid butyl ester (1), and 4-benzyl-1,3-phenylenedicarbamic acid methyl ester (2), together with five known compounds, were isolated and identified. The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were established using 1D-NMR, 2D-NMR and HR-ESI-MS spectral analysis. Previous studies on O. caudata had been reported to protect against Alzheimer's disease, two new compounds were evaluated for their neuroprotective effect against lipopolysaccharide-induced BV2 microglia cells. The result indicated two compounds showed well anti-neuroinflammatory activity at 12.5 muM.
