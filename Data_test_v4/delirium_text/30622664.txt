30622664|a|The gut-brain axis is increasingly recognized as an important pathway of communication and of physiological regulation, and gut microbiota seems to play a significant role in this mutual relationship. Oxidative stress is one of the most important pathogenic mechanisms for both neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, and acute conditions, such as stroke or traumatic brain injury. A peculiar microbiota type might increase brain inflammation and reactive oxygen species levels and might favor abnormal aggregation of proteins. Reversely, brain lesions of various etiologies result in alteration of gut properties and microbiota. These recent hypotheses could open a door for new therapeutic approaches in various neurological diseases.
