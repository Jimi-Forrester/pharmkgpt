38084222|a|Introduction: Epidemic preventive management during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have negatively impacted perioperative outcomes in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). However, little is known about the relationship between epidemic preventive management and delirium after traumatic SCI. Here, we clarified the predictors of delirium after SCI surgery. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 231 patients (mean age, 66 years) who underwent SCI surgery between 2017 and 2021. Patients were categorized into the delirium and non-delirium groups. Preoperative characteristics and laboratory data related to the occurrence of delirium were assessed. During the study period, we continued early surgical intervention. However, early rehabilitation intervention was not performed in the hospital rehabilitation room from May 2020 due to epidemic preventive management, which involved performing rehabilitation on the bed for 8 days postoperatively. Results: Postoperatively, 33 (14.3%) patients experienced delirium. Univariate analysis showed that age (p<0.01), presence of a psychiatric disorder (p<0.05), dementia (p<0.05), serum albumin (p<0.05) and hemoglobin (p<0.01) levels, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification score (p<0.05), and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic (p<0.01) differed significantly in the delirium and non-delirium groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that an age >=73 years (odds ratio [OR], 15.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.54-54.80; p<0.01), treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic (OR, 3.85; 95% CI, 1.61-9.22; p<0.01), and psychiatric disorder (OR, 29.38; 95% CI, 5.63-153.43; p<0.01) were associated with delirium. Conclusions: Our comprehensive preventive management during the COVID-19 pandemic was identified as one of the risk factors for delirium after SCI surgery. Patients with preventive management should be cautioned regarding the risk of delirium.
