36590471|t|An integrative comparative study between ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia versus parenteral opioids alone for analgesia in emergency department patients with hip fractures: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
36590471|a|Background: Emergency physicians play a major role in managing patients with hip fractures. The most commonly used pain management option is parenteral opioids. However, parenteral opioids are subjected to several adverse effects. New pain management techniques such as regional anesthesia are used as alternatives to parenteral opioids. Anatomical landmarks were used to administer regional anesthesia; however, ultrasound guidance has shown promising results with regional anesthesia. Objective: of the Review: The present study compares the efficacy of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia (USGRA) to parenteral opioids in analgesia of hip fractures patients. Methods: A literature search for original and relevant articles carried out through six electronic databases, yielded 710 articles which were then assessed using the eligibility criteria resulting in 8 studies eligible for inclusion. Results: A Meta-analysis of the seven studies showed that ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block was more effective than parenteral opioids in relieving pain. Similarly, meta-analysis of data from two studies shows that US-guided FICB significantly reduced pain scores than parenteral opioids. A subgroup analysis of adverse events showed no significant difference in nausea/vomiting and respiratory complications. However, a subgroup analysis on hypotension showed that the incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in USGRA than parenteral opioids. The present study also revealed that patients in the USGRA group required less frequent rescue analgesia than the patients in the parenteral opioids group. Conclusion: Results of the present study show that USGRA is superior to parenteral opioids in reducing pain and the need for rescue analgesia in patients with hip fractures.
