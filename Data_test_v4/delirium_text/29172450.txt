29172450|t|Endogenous Alpha-Synuclein Protein Analysis from Human Brain Tissues Using Single-Molecule Pull-Down Assay.
29172450|a|Alpha-synuclein (alpha-SYN) is a central molecule in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Despite several studies, the molecular nature of endogenous alpha-SYN especially in human brain samples is still not well understood due to the lack of reliable methods and the limited amount of biospecimens. Here, we introduce alpha-SYN single-molecule pull-down (alpha-SYN SiMPull) assay combined with in vivo protein crosslinking to count individual alpha-SYN protein and assess its native oligomerization states from biological samples including human postmortem brains. This powerful single-molecule assay can be highly useful in diagnostic applications using various specimens for neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
