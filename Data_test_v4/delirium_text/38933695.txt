38933695|a|Objective: Postoperative delirium (POD), a common complication affecting short- and long-term prognosis in elderly patients, leads to a heavy burden on social economy and health care. The main purpose of this study is to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the 100 most frequently cited articles on POD. Methods: "Postoperative delirium" and its synonyms were searched in the Web of Science (WoS) core database. The top-100 cited articles were automatically selected by sorting the records in descending order. Key information such as author, journal, article type, publication year, citations, since 2013 usage count, institution, country, and keywords were extracted and analyzed. VOSviewer software was applied to do the visualization analyses of institution co-operation, author interaction, author co-citation, and keywords co-occurrence. The CiteSpace software was used to analyze keywords burst. Results: Most articles were published by authors and institutions in the United States of America (USA). Inouye was the most influential author of this field. The journals that recorded these articles had a high impact factor (IF), with a highest IF of 168.9 and an average IF of 18.04. Cohort studies were the main document type in this field (42 publications), followed by randomized controlled trial (RCT) and systematic reviews or meta-analysis (18 and 14, respectively). The 10 keywords with the highest appearance were "delirium", "risk-factors", "surgery", "confusion assessment method", "elderly patients", "hip fracture", "intensive care unit", "cardiac surgery", "general anesthesia", and "risk". Moreover, "double blind" and "cardiac surgery" were the most recent booming keywords. Conclusion: We indicated the current research status and tendency of POD by analyzing the 100 most influential articles on POD. The USA is the leader in this field. Prospective study is the preference for authors to cite. Cardiac surgery remains the primary research carrier and the hotspots in the near future may be double-blind studies.
