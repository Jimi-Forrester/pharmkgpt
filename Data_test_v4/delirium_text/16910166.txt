16910166|t|Expression and activity of methionine cycle genes are altered following folate and vitamin E deficiency under oxidative challenge: modulation by apolipoprotein E-deficiency.
16910166|a|Folate deficiency increases neuronal oxidative damage and potentiates the deleterious effects of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) deficiency. Mice lacking ApoE (ApoE -/- mice) upregulate the expression and activity of another enzyme, glutathione synthase (GS), when deprived of folate, in an apparent attempt to compensate for increased oxidative damage. Herein, we examined the influence of ApoE and folate deficiency on expression and activity of several enzymes of the methionine cycle. Expression and activity of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase was increased in the order ApoE +/+ < ApoE +/- < ApoE -/- in response to folate deprivation. Expression of cystathione beta synthase followed a similar pattern. By contrast, expression and activity of methionine synthase decreased following folate deprivation in the order ApoE +/+ < ApoE +/- < ApoE -/-. These studies demonstrate that folate deficiency induces compensatory regulation of methionine cycle genes, and that these effects are potentiated by ApoE deficiency in a gene-dosage manner. They further support the notion that latent genetic deficiencies, including those of methionine cycle, may contribute to Alzheimer's disease, especially in concert with age-related nutritional deficiencies.
