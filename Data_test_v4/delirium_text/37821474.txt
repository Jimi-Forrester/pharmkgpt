37821474|a|Dietary components have recently received rapidly expanding attention for their potential to halt or reverse the development of many oxidative stress-mediated diseases after exposure to environmental toxicants. 7, 12 dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) is one of the most common environmental pollutants. The present study aimed to evaluate the chemo-preventive effects of broccoli as a nutritional component against DMBA intoxication in rats. A daily dose of aqueous (1 ml/rat) and methanolic (150 mg/kg) broccoli extracts, respectively, was given to 50-day-old female rats for 26 successive weeks after carcinogen intoxication with a single dose of 20 mg/ml of DMBA. DMBA intoxication resulted in a redox imbalance (a decreased GSH level and an increased MDA level) and increased DNA fragmentation in the liver, kidney, and brain. Besides, it affected the level of expression of the bcl2 gene in the liver, kidney, and brain tissue but didn't affect cfos gene expression accompanied by histopathological changes. The aqueous and methanolic broccoli extract supplements ameliorated the adverse effects by increasing the level of GSH, decreasing the MDA level, and reducing DNA fragmentation. Besides, broccoli extracts decreased the expression of bcl2 in the liver and brain and up-regulated bcl2 expression in the kidney, accompanied by lowering NF-kappabeta 65 expression in the liver and brain and gamma-catenin expression in the liver and kidney. In conclusion, broccoli as a dietary component had a strong chemoprotective effect against oxidative stress, DNA damage, and genotoxicity induced by DMBA intoxication in rats.
