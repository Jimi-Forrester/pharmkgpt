32583036|a|BACKGROUND: Since its foundation in 2011, the German Network for Early Mobilization of mechanically ventilated intensive care patients delivered, among others, more than 90 monthly newsletters, 14 research projects, and 3 national conferences. PURPOSE: The aim of this online survey was to evaluate whether members of the Network perceived a professional benefit for themselves and their intensive cate units (ICU). METHODS: An interprofessional online survey of 303 clinicians of the Network in German speaking countries in July 2019 was undertaken. The survey included questions about newsletters, personal benefits, perceived improvements on their workplaces, and future expectations. RESULTS: The response rate was 48% (n = 145), mainly nurses and physiotherapists. The majority perceived the newsletter as good. Members reported that the network extended their professional knowledge and improved the quality of the ICUs regarding early mobilization, delirium management, and interprofessional goals. Participants expressed a wish for more workshops, case reports, webinars, and other educational possibilities. CONCLUSIONS: Members of the network Early Mobilization perceived a personal and professional benefit. The network supported quality improvements projects in ICUs. The progress of the network may serve as an example for development of other professional networks.
