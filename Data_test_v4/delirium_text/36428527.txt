36428527|t|Cell-Free Amniotic Fluid and Regenerative Medicine: Current Applications and Future Opportunities.
36428527|a|Amniotic fluid (AF) provides critical biological and physical support for the developing fetus. While AF is an excellent source of progenitor cells with regenerative properties, recent investigations indicate that cell-free AF (cfAF), which consists of its soluble components and extracellular vesicles, can also stimulate regenerative and reparative activities. This review summarizes published fundamental, translational, and clinical investigations into the biological activity and potential use of cfAF as a therapeutic agent. Recurring themes emerge from these studies, which indicate that cfAF can confer immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and pro-growth characteristics to the target cells/tissue with which they come into contact. Another common observation is that cfAF seems to promote a return of cells/tissue to a homeostatic resting state when applied to a model of cell stress or disease. The precise mechanisms through which these effects are mediated have not been entirely defined, but it is clear that cfAF can safely and effectively treat cutaneous wounds and perhaps orthopedic degenerative conditions. Additional applications are currently being investigated, but require further study to dissect the fundamental mechanisms through which its regenerative effects are mediated. By doing so, rational design can be used to fully unlock its potential in the biotechnology lab and in the clinic.
