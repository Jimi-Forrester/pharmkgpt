38474385|t|Potential of Plant-Derived Compounds in Preventing and Reversing Organ Fibrosis and the Underlying Mechanisms.
38474385|a|Increased production of extracellular matrix is a necessary response to tissue damage and stress. In a normal healing process, the increase in extracellular matrix is transient. In some instances; however, the increase in extracellular matrix can persist as fibrosis, leading to deleterious alterations in organ structure, biomechanical properties, and function. Indeed, fibrosis is now appreciated to be an important cause of mortality and morbidity. Extensive research has illustrated that fibrosis can be slowed, arrested or even reversed; however, few drugs have been approved specifically for anti-fibrotic treatment. This is in part due to the complex pathways responsible for fibrogenesis and the undesirable side effects of drugs targeting these pathways. Natural products have been utilized for thousands of years as a major component of traditional medicine and currently account for almost one-third of drugs used clinically worldwide. A variety of plant-derived compounds have been demonstrated to have preventative or even reversal effects on fibrosis. This review will discuss the effects and the underlying mechanisms of some of the major plant-derived compounds that have been identified to impact fibrosis.
