We aimed to compare the prevalence of EEG abnormalities in stroke patients during delirium episodes with periods that did not correspond to delirium. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical EEG reports for stroke patients who received daily delirium assessments as part of a prospective study. We compared the prevalence of EEG features corresponding to patient-days with vs. without delirium, including focal and generalized slowing, and focal and generalized epileptiform abnormalities (EAs). RESULTS: Among 58 patients who received EEGs, there were 192 days of both EEG and delirium monitoring (88% [n = 169] corresponding to delirium). Generalized slowing was significantly more prevalent on days with vs. without delirium (96% vs. 57%, p = 0.03), as were bilateral or generalized EAs (38% vs. 13%, p = 0.03). In contrast, focal slowing (53% vs. 74%, p = 0.11) and focal EAs were less prevalent on days with delirium (38% vs. 48%, p = 0.37), though these differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: We found a higher prevalence of generalized but not focal EEG abnormalities in stroke patients with delirium. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings may reinforce the diffuse nature of delirium-associated encephalopathy, even in patients with discrete structural lesions.
