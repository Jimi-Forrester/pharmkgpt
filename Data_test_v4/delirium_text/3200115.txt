3200115|a|The synthesis of a series of physostigmine analogs, in which the methylcarbamyl group has been substituted with monoalkylcarbamyl, dimethyl- and diethylcarbamyl groups, is reported. These compounds were prepared with the aim of investigating their possible therapeutic effects in the treatment of Alzheimer's type dementia. The new analogs of physostigmine are inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase from Electroforus electricus, with a value of the reactivation constant, k3 smaller than the one of physostigmine. The percentage of anticholinesterase activity in vitro and in vivo, the acute toxicity and some behavioural effects were also evaluated for selected derivatives. The reactivation constant, in vitro, supports the view that the derivatives described would be more suitable for therapeutic use than physostigmine.
