33782665|a|The emergence of age-related chronic diseases within the United States has led to the direct increase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as other neurological diseases which ultimately contribute to the development of dementia within the general population. To be specific, age-related chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol, diabetes, and kidney disease contribute greatly to the advancement and rapid progression of dementia. Furthermore, unmodifiable risk factors such as advancing age and genetics as well as modifiable risk factors such as socioeconomic status, educational attainment, exercise, and diet further contribute to the development of dementia. Current statistics and research show that minority populations such as Hispanic Americans in the United States face the greatest burden of dementia due to the increase in the prevalence of overall population age, predisposing genetics, age-related chronic diseases, low socioeconomic status, as well as poor lifestyle choices and habits. Additionally, Hispanic Americans living within Texas and the rural areas of West Texas face the added challenge of finding appropriate healthcare services. This article will focus upon the research associated with AD as well as the prevalence of AD within the Hispanic American population of Texas and rural West Texas. Furthermore, this article will also discuss the prevalence of age-related chronic diseases, unmodifiable risk factors, and modifiable risk factors which lead to the progression and development of AD within the Hispanic American population of the United States, Texas, and rural West Texas.
