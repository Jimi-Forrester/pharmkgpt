31096601|a|In the search for new anticancer agents, a library of variously substituted 3-methylidenechroman-4-ones was synthesized using Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons methodology. Acylation of diethyl methylphosphonate with selected ethyl salicylates furnished 3-diethoxyphosphorylchromen-4-ones which were next used as Michael acceptors in the reaction with various Grignard reagents. The adducts were obtained as the mixtures of trans and cis diastereoisomers along with a small amount of enol forms. Their relative configuration and preferred conformation were established by NMR analysis. The adducts turned up to be effective Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reagents giving 2-substituted 3-methylidenechroman-4-ones, which were then tested for their possible cytotoxic activity against two leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and NALM-6, and against MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. All new compounds (14a-o) were highly cytotoxic for the leukemic cells and showed a moderate or weak effect on MCF-7 cells. Analog 14d exhibited the highest growth inhibitory activity and was more potent than carboplatin against HL-60 (IC50 = 1.46 +- 0.16 microM) and NALM-6 (IC50 = 0.50 +- 0.05 microM) cells. Further tests showed that 14d induced apoptosis in NALM-6 cells, which was mediated mostly through the extrinsic pathway.
