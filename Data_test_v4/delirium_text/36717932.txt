36717932|a|BACKGROUND: To evaluate the potential of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of matrix metalloproteinases and tissue-type inhibitors (MMP; TIMP), and ratios of MMPs to TIMPs, to function as biomarkers for sporadic or hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). METHODS: CSF concentrations of the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-14, as well as the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3, were determined using immunoassays. These assays were applied to two, independent study groups of sporadic CAA (sCAA) (n = 28/43) and control subjects (n = 40/40), as well as to groups of pre-symptomatic (n = 11) and symptomatic hereditary Dutch-CAA (D-CAA) patients (n = 12), and age-matched controls (n = 22/28, respectively). RESULTS: In the sCAA/control cohorts, inconsistent differences were found for individual MMPs and TIMPs, but MMP-2/TIMP-2 (discovery/validation: p = 0.004; p = 0.02) and MMP-14/TIMP-2 ratios (discovery/validation: p < 0.001; p = 0.04) were consistently decreased in sCAA, compared to controls. Moreover, MMP-14 was decreased in symptomatic D-CAA (p = 0.03), compared to controls. The MMP-14/TIMP-1 (p = 0.03) and MMP-14/TIMP-2 (p = 0.04) ratios were decreased in symptomatic D-CAA compared to controls and also compared to pre-symptomatic D-CAA (p = 0.004; p = 0.005, respectively). CONCLUSION: CSF MMP-2/TIMP-2 and MMP-14/TIMP-2 were consistently decreased in sCAA, compared to controls. Additionally, MMP-14/TIMP-2 levels were also decreased in symptomatic D-CAA, compared to both pre-symptomatic D-CAA and controls, and can therefore be considered a biomarker for sporadic and late-stage hereditary forms of CAA.
