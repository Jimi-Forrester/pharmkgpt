37033752|t|Identifying Predictors of Workplace Violence Against Healthcare Professionals: A Systematic Review.
37033752|a|Understanding the predictors of workplace violence amongst healthcare professionals is important to develop and implement prevention and mitigation strategies. We conducted a systematic review to synthesize the recent evidence on predictors of workplace violence across healthcare settings. The review has been done as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Two electronic databases (PubMed and Google Scholar) were used to search peer-reviewed studies published for the year 2009-2020 to identify studies reporting predictors of workplace violence. The significant predictors were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as proportions in most of the studies and some studies used inferential statistics such as logistic regression analysis, Chi-square test, ANOVA and Student's t-test. A total of 46 studies were identified and overall evidence was graded using an adapted GRADE approach. Some of the moderate quality predictors associated with workplace violence were the patient with a history of mental health disease, psychiatric setting, professional's gender and work experience and evening shift workers. Being a nurse was the only high-quality predictor. Healthcare professionals and administration can identify the predictors relevant to their setting to mitigate episodes of violence against healthcare personnel.
