34944418|t|Microglial Potassium Channels: From Homeostasis to Neurodegeneration.
34944418|a|The growing interest in the role of microglia in the progression of many neurodegenerative diseases is developing in an ever-expedited manner, in part thanks to emergent new tools for studying the morphological and functional features of the CNS. The discovery of specific biomarkers of the microglia phenotype could find application in a wide range of human diseases, and creates opportunities for the discovery and development of tailored therapeutic interventions. Among these, recent studies highlight the pivotal role of the potassium channels in regulating microglial functions in physiological and pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the involvement of the microglial potassium channels in several neurodegenerative diseases and their role as modulators of microglial homeostasis and dysfunction in CNS disorders.
