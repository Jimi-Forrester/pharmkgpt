24163868|a|: This study sought to examine the effect of thermal welding tonsillectomy that reduces pain and length of anesthesia on emergence agitation. A total of 60 patients (age range, 3-6 years) with chronic recurrent tonsillitis with an indication for tonsillectomy were included. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The control group (the CD group) was composed of patients undergoing cold dissection (CD) tonsillectomy. The study group (TW group) included patients undergoing thermal welding (TW) tonsillectomy. All patients were given sevoflurane as an anesthetic agent. For all patients, anesthesia time, operation time, extubation time, Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale, pain scale, nausea/vomiting score, and delivery time were recorded. The duration of anesthesia, operation, and delivery was significantly lower in the TW group as compared with the CD group (P = 0.000 < 0001). The pain and agitation scores were significantly lower in the TW group as compared with the CD group (P = 0.000 < 0001). We assume that, besides reducing pain and allowing surgery without bleeding, the TW tonsillectomy method diminishes emergence agitation induced by anesthetic agents, such as sevoflurane.
