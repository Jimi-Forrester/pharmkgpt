36976711|t|Assessment of Microglial Activation in Alzheimer Disease Using 18F-PBR06 PET.
36976711|a|ABSTRACT: A 69-year-old woman with progressive short-term memory deficits was diagnosed with Alzheimer disease (MMSE 26/30, CDR 0.5) and underwent PET using 18F-PBR06, a second-generation 18-kDa translocator protein ligand, targeting brain microglia and astrocytes. SUV and voxel-by-voxel binding potential maps (using simplified reference tissue method and a cerebellar pseudo-reference region) were generated. Images showed evidence of increased glial activation in biparietal cortices (including bilateral precuneus and posterior cingulate gyri) and bilateral frontal cortices. After 6 years of clinical follow-up, patient progressed to moderate cognitive impairment (CDR 2.0) and required assistance for activities of daily living.
