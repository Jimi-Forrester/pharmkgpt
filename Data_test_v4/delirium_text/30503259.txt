30503259|t|Nicotinamide Promotes Cell Survival and Differentiation as Kinase Inhibitor in Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.
30503259|a|Nicotinamide, the amide form of vitamin B3, is widely used in disease treatments and stem cell applications. However, nicotinamide's impact often cannot be attributed to its nutritional functions. In a vitamin screen, we find that nicotinamide promotes cell survival and differentiation in human pluripotent stem cells. Nicotinamide inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin light chain, suppresses actomyosin contraction, and leads to improved cell survival after individualization. Further analysis demonstrates that nicotinamide is an inhibitor of multiple kinases, including ROCK and casein kinase 1. We demonstrate that nicotinamide affects human embryonic stem cell pluripotency and differentiation as a selective kinase inhibitor. The findings in this report may help researchers design better strategies to develop nicotinamide-related stem cell applications and disease treatments.
