35451141|a|In this paper, we have described the points to be noted when examining the macroscopic findings of the brain of patients with dementia. The characteristics of the macroscopic findings of the brain of patients with dementia are shown in the figure of the outer surface and the cut surface. Gross findings in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease should consider, in addition to the degree of limbic changes, whether the atrophy is diffuse, the degree of ventricular enlargement, and the complications of vascular changes. The macroscopic findings of the brain of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies are characterized by the absence of notable abnormal findings other than the depigmentation of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. In dementia with Lewy bodies, other types of dementia complications should be considered if abnormal findings are present. It should be noted that accurate diagnosis of argyrophilic grain dementia and senile dementia of neurofibrillary tangle type by macroscopic findings alone is often difficult to distinguish from a mild case of Alzheimer's disease and change by physiological aging in particular. In frontotemporal lobar degeneration, changes in the basal ganglia, brain stem, cerebellum and motor neurons should be observed to make a differential diagnosis of various types of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. It is important to understand the areas that are often damaged in different types of dementia and the extent of lesions, and to distinguish each type of dementia. Care should be taken as macroscopic findings are more complex when several types of dementia are mixed. It was shown that accurate understanding of macroscopic findings is essential for understanding clinical symptoms, imaging findings, differential diagnosis of dementia and disease pathogenesis.
