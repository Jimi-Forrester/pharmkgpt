34837494|a|PURPOSE: We investigated the drug use before and after transition to automated multi-dose dispensing (MDD) service among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and compared whether the changes were similar in persons without AD. METHODS: The register-based Finnish nationwide MEDALZ cohort includes 70,718 community-dwelling persons diagnosed with AD during 2005-2011. Each person who initiated MDD was matched in both groups with a comparison person without MDD by age, gender and for persons with AD, also time since AD diagnosis at the start of MDD. The study cohort included 15,604 persons with AD in MDD and 15,604 no-MDD, and 5224 persons without AD in MDD and 5224 no-MDD. Point prevalence of drug use was assessed every 3 months, from 1 year before to 2 years after the start of MDD and compared between persons in MDD to those who did not have MDD. RESULTS: MDD was started on average 2.9 (SD 2.1) years after AD diagnosis. At the start of MDD, the prevalence of drug use increased especially for antipsychotics, antidepressants, opioids, paracetamol and use of >= 10 drugs among persons with and without AD. Prevalence of benzodiazepine use (from 12% 12 months before to 17% at start of MDD), memantine (from 29 to 46%) and >= 3 psychotropics (from 3.2 to 6.0%) increased among persons with AD. Decreasing trend was observed for benzodiazepine-related drugs, urinary antispasmodics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. CONCLUSION: MDD seems to be initiated when use of psychotropics is initiated and the number of drugs increases.
