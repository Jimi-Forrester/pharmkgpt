39833034|t|Dexmedetomidine-associated hypothermia in critical trauma: A case report and literature analysis.
39833034|a|RATIONALE: Hypothermia, defined as a core body temperature below 35 C, is a common and serious complication in severe trauma patients, often worsened by hemorrhage and medical interventions. Dexmedetomidine, an alpha2-adrenergic agonist used for sedation in intensive care units, has known thermoregulatory effects; however, its association with hypothermia in trauma patients remains insufficiently explored. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 40-year-old male with severe polytrauma from a motor vehicle accident presented in distress, with hypotension, tachycardia, and a baseline temperature of 35.8 C. Despite effective management, he developed profound hypothermia, with a recorded temperature dropping below 34.0 C after switching from midazolam to dexmedetomidine for sedation. DIAGNOSES: The patient had multiple bilateral rib fractures, a right-sided pneumothorax, and grade 3 liver and grade 5 splenic injuries, along with orthopedic fractures. His Injury Severity Score signified critical trauma, increasing the risk of complications like hypothermia. INTERVENTIONS: Following stabilization, dexmedetomidine was administered for sedation. Continuous warming interventions were initiated to address hypothermia; however, the temperature continued to decline. Suspecting dexmedetomidine's contribution, its administration was discontinued. OUTCOMES: After stopping dexmedetomidine, the patient's temperature gradually recovered to 36.8 C within 5 hours. He demonstrated improved consciousness and stable vital signs, subsequently undergoing 2 successful orthopedic surgeries and discharging without further hypothermia-related issues. LESSONS: This case highlights dexmedetomidine's potential to induce hypothermia in critically ill trauma patients. It stresses the importance of careful temperature monitoring and proactive thermoregulation during sedative administration in intensive care. Further research is needed to explore the prevalence and mechanisms of dexmedetomidine-associated hypothermia in trauma populations.
