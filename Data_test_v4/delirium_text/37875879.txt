37875879|t|Arterial spin labeling (ASL-MRI) versus fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET) in diagnosing dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
37875879|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia is generally caused by neurodegenerative diseases affecting the brain, which leads to a progressive neurocognitive decline characterized by inability to perform major higher functioning tasks. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan is one of the main imaging tests performed for diagnostic purposes. However, with FDG-PET being quite expensive and not widely available, an attempt to find an alternative is set. Arterial-spin-labelling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI) is an increasingly investigated substitute to FDG-PET for the diagnosis of dementia. Thereby, the main purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare the diagnostic ability of FDG-PET and ASL-MRI in detecting dementia. METHODS: PRISMA checklist for diagnostic test accuracy was employed in outlining this paper. A literature search was done using several search engines including PubMed, Core, and Cochrane. Two researchers (HH and SH) extracted the essential information from all included articles. Risk of bias was evaluated by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool, version 2 (QUADAS-2). A qualitative analysis and summary of studies' results were provided. In addition, a meta-analysis was executed based on the studies which involved sensitivity and specificity measures of diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Fourteen total studies were included in the given review. Qualitative analysis of the articles showed that nine studies demonstrated an overlap between metabolic and perfused brain maps as derived by FDG-PET and ASL-MRI respectively, while the remaining five studies registered significant differences across both modalities, with superiority to FDG-PET. As for the meta-analysis implemented, summary ROC-curve analysis revealed that FDG-PET performed better than ASL-MRI, with pooled sensitivity being significantly higher for FDG-PET. CONCLUSIONS: Comparing the diagnostic value of FDG-PET and ASL-MRI, the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that FDG-PET still has an advantage over ASL-MRI. Such implication could be related to the technical differences relating to both modalities, with ASL-MRI having lower temporal resolution. It's worth mentioning that specificity was rather quite similar among both modalities and some studies found an overridden metabolic and perfused images. These findings call for future research to focus their scope of investigation while exploring the diagnostic value of ASL-MRI.
