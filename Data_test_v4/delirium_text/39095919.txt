39095919|t|Efficacy of tranexamic acid versus placebo in reducing blood loss during burn excisional surgery: a multi-center, double-blind, parallel, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial (TRANEX).
39095919|a|BACKGROUND: Despite an increase in knowledge, blood loss during burn excisional surgery remains a major challenge and is an independent predictor of mortality. During burn surgery, limited measures are available to control the bleeding. Increased fibrinolysis could be one of the contributing factors of blood loss during burn excisional surgery. Tranexamic acid inhibits the fibrinolytic response, and a small body of evidence shows positive effects of tranexamic acid on the volume of blood loss. METHODS: The main objectives of this study are twofold, (1) to investigate whether tranexamic acid reduces blood loss and (2) to investigate the changes in coagulation after burn trauma and during burn excisional surgery. This study is a multicenter double-blind randomized clinical trial in patients scheduled for burn excisional surgery within the Dutch burn centers. All adult patients scheduled for burn surgery with an expected blood loss of >= 250 are eligible for inclusion in this study. The study is powered on a blood loss reduction of 25% in the intervention group. In total, 95 subjects will be included. The intervention group will receive 1500 mg tranexamic acid versus placebo in the other group. Primary endpoint is reduction of blood loss. Secondary endpoints include occurrence of fibrinolysis during surgery, graft take of the split skin graft, and differences in coagulation and blood clot formation. DISCUSSION: This protocol of a randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the efficacy of tranexamic acid in reducing blood loss during burn excisional surgery. Furthermore, this study aims to clarify the coagulation status after burn trauma and during the surgical process.
