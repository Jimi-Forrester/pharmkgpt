36835325|t|DNA Damage and Repair in Eye Diseases.
36835325|a|Vision is vital for daily activities, and yet the most common eye diseases-cataracts, DR, ARMD, and glaucoma-lead to blindness in aging eyes. Cataract surgery is one of the most frequently performed surgeries, and the outcome is typically excellent if there is no concomitant pathology present in the visual pathway. In contrast, patients with DR, ARMD and glaucoma often develop significant visual impairment. These often-multifactorial eye problems can have genetic and hereditary components, with recent data supporting the role of DNA damage and repair as significant pathogenic factors. In this article, we discuss the role of DNA damage and the repair deficit in the development of DR, ARMD and glaucoma.
