35505834|a|Background: The objective of this study was to describe 12-month mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with a reference population with no history of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Nationwide cohort study using electronic health care data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive cases (n= 66,287) and reference group subjects (n=254,969) with linkage to SARS-CoV-2 testing and death records. Findings: People infected with SARS-COV-2 had more than three times the risk of dying over the following year compared with those who remained uninfected (aHR 3 1, 95%CI 2 9-3 3). Short-term mortality (up to 5 weeks post-infection) was significantly higher among COVID-19 group (1623 0/10 000) than in the reference group (118/10 000). For COVID-19 cases aged 60 years or older, increased mortality persisted until the end of the first year after infection, and was related to increased risk for cardiovascular (aHR 2 1, 95%CI 1 8-2 3), cancer (aHR 1 5, 95%CI 1 2-1 9), respiratory system diseases (aHR 1 9, 95%CI 1 2-3 0), and other causes of death (aHR 1 8, 95%CI 1 4-2 2). Interpretation: Increased risk of death from SARS-CoV-2 is not limited to the acute illness: SARS-CoV-2 infection carries a substantially increased mortality in the following 12 months. This excess death mainly occurs in older people and is driven by broad array of causes of death. Funding: Research was carried out with the support of Estonian Research Council (grants PRG1197, PRG198), European Regional Development Fund (RITA 1/02-120) and European Social Fund via IT Academy program.
