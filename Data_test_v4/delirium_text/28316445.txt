28316445|t|Therapeutic leukapheresis in a tertiary care hospital: A case series.
28316445|a|Patients presenting with hyperleukocytosis secondary to acute leukemia, with total leukocyte count or blast count more than 100,000/muL are often considered for leukapheresis, especially if clinical signs of leukostasis are present. Leukostasis is often associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with leukemic processes. The main goal of management of hyperleukocytosis and/or leukostasis is to reduce the blast count before initiation of chemotherapy. Leukapheresis is often used prophylactically to prevent leukostasis or to provide symptomatic relief. We, as transfusion medicine specialists, present our experience of doing therapeutic leukapheresis in patients presenting with hyperleukocytosis with or without presenting features of leukostasis.
