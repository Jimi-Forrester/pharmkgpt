30804943|t|Transcriptome Profile in Hippocampus During Acute Inflammatory Response to Surgery: Toward Early Stage of PND.
30804943|a|Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) are common complications observed in surgical patients, but there are no effective treatments and the detailed mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, transcriptome analysis was performed to investigate the hippocampal changes after surgery and underlying molecular mechanisms of PND. Tibial fracture surgery was performed in 3-4 months old C57BL/6J mice to mimic human orthopedic surgery. We demonstrated that memory consolidation of the hippocampal-dependent trace-fear conditioning task was significantly impaired. By using ELISA, a significant elevated IL-6 was observed both in circulating system and central nervous system and peaked at 6 h post-surgery, but transiently returned to baseline thereafter. Hippocampus were collected at 6 h post-surgery then processed for RNA-Seq. A total of 268 genes were screened differentially expressed between the Surgery and Control group, including 170 up-regulated genes and 98 down-regulated genes. By functional enrichment analysis of differently expressed genes, several KEGG pathways involved in inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and cholinergic synapse were overrepresented. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed 15 dysregulated genes of interest. These results provide a comprehensive insight into global gene expression changes during the acute presence of hippocampal inflammation and a better understanding on early stage of PND.
