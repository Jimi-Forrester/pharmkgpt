38171236|t|Sleep in the intensive and intermediate care units: Exploring related factors of delirium, benzodiazepine use and mortality.
38171236|a|AIM OF THE STUDY: The primary purpose was to examine sleep difficulties and delirium in the Intensive and Intermediate Care Unit. Secondarily, factors impacting night-time sleep duration and quality, mortality, and the impact of benzodiazepine use on sleep outcomes were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study encompassed data from 323 intensive and intermediate care unit admissions collected in the Netherlands, spanning from November 2018 to May 2020. Sleep quality was measured using the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. Night-time sleep duration was nurse-reported. We investigated associations of these sleep outcomes with age, sex, length-of-stay, natural daylight, disease severity, mechanical ventilation, benzodiazepine use, and delirium using Generalized Estimating Equations models. Associations with one-year post-discharge mortality were analyzed using Cox regression. RESULTS: Night-time sleep duration was short (median 4.5 hours) and sleep quality poor (mean score 4.9/10). Benzodiazepine use was common (24 % of included nights) and was negatively associated with night-time sleep duration and quality (B = -0.558 and -0.533, p <.001). Delirium and overnight transfers were negatively associated with sleep quality (B = -0.716 and -1.831, p <.05). The day-to-night sleep ratio was higher in the three days before delirium onset than in non-delirious individuals (p <.05). Age, disease severity and female sex were associated with increased one-year mortality. Sleep quality was negatively, but not-significantly, associated with mortality (p =.070). CONCLUSIONS: Night-time sleep in the critical care environment has a short duration and poor quality. Benzodiazepine use was not associated with improved sleep. Sleep patterns change ahead of delirium onset. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Consistent sleep monitoring should be part of routine nursing practice, using a validated instrument like the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. Given the lack of proven efficacy of benzodiazepines in promoting sleep in critical care settings, it is vital to develop more effective sleep treatments that include non-benzodiazepine medication and sleep hygiene strategies.
