34922123|a|White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) have been related to executive dysfunction, apathy and disinhibition in a wide range of neurological populations. However, this relationship has not been examined in survivors of pediatric brain tumor. The goal of this study was to investigate how executive dysfunction, apathy, and disinhibition relate to WMHs in 31 long-term survivors of pediatric cerebellar brain tumor and 58 controls, using informant-report data from the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale. Total WMH volume was quantified using the Lesion Growth Algorithm. Further, periventricular, and subcortical volumes were identified based on proximity to custom ventricle masks generated in FSL. A ratio of WMH volume to whole brain volume was used to obtain normalized WMH volumes. Additionally, a multivariate regression analysis was performed. On average, informant-report scores were within normal limits and only executive dysfunction was significantly higher in survivors compared to controls (t(47.9) = -2.4, p=.023). Informants reported clinically significant levels of apathy in 32.3% of survivors. Informants also reported clinically significant executive dysfunction in 19.4 % of survivors and clinically significant disinhibition in, again, 19.4 % of survivors. Increased volume of WMHs was positively correlated with executive dysfunction (r = 0.33, p = 0.02) and apathy (r = 0.23, p = .04). Similarly, multivariate regression demonstrated correlations with executive dysfunction (p=.05, FDR corrected) and apathy (p=.05, FDR corrected). Exploratory analysis demonstrated an interaction wherein the relationship between total WMHs and executive dysfunction and apathy depends on whether the participant was a survivor. The current findings indicate that increased WMH volumes are associated with higher ratings of apathy and executive dysfunction, and that these results are likely unique to cerebellar brain tumor survivors. WMH burden may serve as a useful marker to identify survivors at risk of executive dysfunction or increased apathy.
