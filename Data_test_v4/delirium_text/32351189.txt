32351189|t|Current and Future of Alzheimer's Therapy with the Best Approach.
32351189|a|INTRODUCTION: In spite of the steady progress in the understanding of the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for the last 50 years, exceptionally few long-standing drugs are, at present, used for AD therapy. New interventions that either prevent, slow or stop the disease are urgently warranted to overcome the growing AD burden. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the currently existing preclinical and clinical evidence regarding new drug development and biomarkers for better understanding and focused management of AD. This article reviews the various potential and existing targets /receptors with valid biomarkers applied in recent years to address the early-stage tasks of the AD drug discovery process. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the relevant databases to identify studies published in recent years. In conclusion, the new approaches seem to aim at examining the prospective neuroprotective activity of disease-modifying drugs in the presymptomatic phases of AD, using biomarkers that detect progression of the disease before the growth of overt dementia.
