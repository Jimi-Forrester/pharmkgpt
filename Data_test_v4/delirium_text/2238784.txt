2238784|t|[Alzheimer's disease: experience, perception and reactions of patients].
2238784|a|Clinical research into Alzheimer's disease has predominantly focused on standardized assessment of cognitive impairment and behavioral changes. The description of feelings and attempts of adaptation of patients with Alzheimer's disease is a neglected area. Here we present five statements, each given by a patient with Alzheimer's disease, and investigate perception and attempts of adaptation contained in these statements. Important consequences for the care of patients with Alzheimer's disease are discussed.
