8731438|t|Altered mitochondrial membrane fluidity in AD brain.
8731438|a|Oxidative damage on biological membranes has been proposed as a cause of the alterations observed in aging brain and, more severely, in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study we evaluated membrane fluidity of mitochondria extracted from different areas of normal and AD brains by means of fluorescence polarization technique. AD mitochondria showed a significant reduction of membrane fluidity compared to controls except in cerebellum. This might be caused by a greater lipid peroxidation of biological membranes, as suggested by in vitro experiments we performed to this purpose. From these results the possible role of oxidative stress in AD pathogenesis is supported.
