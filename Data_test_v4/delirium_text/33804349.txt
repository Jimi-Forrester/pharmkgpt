33804349|t|The Impact of Depression Symptoms in Patients with Parkinson's Disease: A Novel Case-Control Investigation.
33804349|a|Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease and it is known to cause motor disturbances associated with musculoskeletal problems of the locomotor apparatus, and non-motor symptoms, that are believed to have a harmful effect on health, social functioning and mobility. The aim of this study was to evaluate depression in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) compared to subjects who do not have it. The sample consisted of 124 participants (mean age 69.18 +- 9.12). Patients with PD were recruited from a center of excellence for Parkinson's disease (cases n = 62) and healthy subjects without PD from their relatives and caregivers (control n = 62). The Spanish version of Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) scores and categories were collected. A clear statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) was evident in the BDI scores between both groups. Parkinson's patients presented worse results on the BDI = 15.48 +- 7.24 points compared to healthy subjects with BDI = 7.03 +- 6.99 points. Regarding BDI categories, there were statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) for the greater BDI categories in the Parkinson's group compared with healthy subjects. The depression represents an important potential risk for increased symptoms and negative impact among patients with PD compared with healthy subjects.
