35705503|t|Amyloid- and Tau Imaging in Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury: A Cross-sectional Study.
35705503|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been promoted as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. There is evidence of elevated amyloid-beta and tau, the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, immediately following TBI. It is not clear whether amyloid-beta and tau remain elevated in the chronic period. To address this issue, we assessed amyloid-beta and tau burden in long-term TBI survivors and healthy controls using PET imaging. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, we recruited individuals following a single moderate to severe TBI at least 10 years previously from an inpatient rehabilitation program. A demographically similar healthy control group was recruited from the community. PET data were acquired using 18F-NAV4694 (amyloid-beta) and 18F-MK6240 (tau) tracers. Amyloid-beta deposition was quantified using the Centiloid scale. Tau deposition was quantified using the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in four regions of interest (ROI). As a secondary measure, PET scans were also visually read as positive or negative. We examined PET data in relation to time since injury and age at injury. PET data were analysed in a series of regression analyses. RESULTS: The sample comprised 87 individuals with TBI (71.3% male; 28.7% female; M = 57.53 years, SD = 11.53) and 59 controls (59.3% male; 40.7% female; M = 60.34 years, SD = 11.97). Individuals with TBI did not have significantly higher 18F-NAV4694 Centiloid values (p = 0.067) or 18F-MK6240 tau SUVRs in any ROI (p = <= 0.001; SUVR greater for controls). Visual assessment was consistent with the quantification; individuals with TBI were not more likely than controls to have a positive amyloid-beta (p = 0.505) or tau scan (p = 0.221). No associations were identified for amyloid-beta or tau burden with time since injury (p = 0.057 to 0.332) or age at injury. DISCUSSION: A single moderate to severe TBI was not associated with higher burden of amyloid-beta or tau pathologies in the chronic period relative to healthy controls. Amyloid-beta and tau burden did not show a significant increase with years since injury, and burden did not appear to be greater for those who were older at the time of injury.
