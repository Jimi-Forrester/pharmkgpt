8410072|a|Oxidative polymorphism of debrisoquine has been studied in patients suffering from many spontaneous disorders which show genetic and/or environmental factors in their pathogenesis. To elucidate whether any relationship exists between this genetic polymorphism and the risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD) we determined the oxidative phenotype and metabolic ratio (MR) of debrisoquine (DBQ) in 47 patients with AD or senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT) and 837 healthy controls. The patients were free of drugs during at least the previous 30 days; all the controls were free of drugs. Three patients (6.38%) and 42 controls (5.02%) were classified as poor metabolizers (PM) of DBQ (non-significant difference). The distribution of MR values in the AD/SDAT patients showed non-significant differences when compared with controls. There was no relation between oxidative polymorphism of DBQ and age at onset of the disease. These results suggest that DBQ oxidative genetic polymorphism cannot be considered as a risk factor for developing AD-SDAT.
