39884419|a|Understanding brain health is increasingly important, particularly in light of growing public health challenges related to neurological and psychiatric conditions. These include the rising prevalence of mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety, as well as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Lifestyle factors, including stress, poor diet, and insufficient physical activity, also significantly impact cognitive function. Exploring the perceptions and awareness of brain health among young and middle-aged adults is crucial to developing effective educational programs and awareness campaigns tailored to their specific needs. This study aimed to examine the perceptions and awareness of brain health among Cuban youth, focusing on the factors that shape their understanding and attitudes toward brain well-being. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted, with 1,049 participants voluntarily completing the questionnaire. Using "The Global Brain Health Survey," we assessed participants' conceptions of brain health and analyzed associations between demographic variables and brain health knowledge through logistic regression. Our findings revealed that the social environment was viewed as the most significant factor influencing brain health. Other factors, such as profession, genetics, income, and nutrition, were considered important but to a lesser degree. While participants were generally aware of conditions like Alzheimer's disease and depression, there was a notable gap in understanding the cognitive implications of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, which are prevalent in Cuba. These insights highlight the need for targeted public health initiatives and educational campaigns that promote healthier behaviors and community support, particularly among young adults.
