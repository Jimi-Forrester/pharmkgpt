35881580|t|Delirium and its association with short-term outcomes in younger and older patients with acute heart failure.
35881580|a|Younger patients (18 to 65 years old) are often excluded from delirium outcome studies. We sought to determine if delirium was associated with short-term adverse outcomes in a diverse cohort of younger and older patients with acute heart failure (AHF). We conducted a multi-center prospective cohort study that included adult emergency department patients with confirmed AHF. Delirium was ascertained using the Brief Confusion Assessment Method (bCAM). The primary outcome was a composite outcome of 30-day all-cause death, 30-day all-cause rehospitalization, and prolonged index hospital length of stay. Multivariable logistic regression was performed, adjusting for demographics, cognitive impairment without delirium, and HF risk factors. Older age (>= 65 years old)*delirium interaction was also incorporated into the model. Odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were reported. A total of 1044 patients with AHF were enrolled; 617 AHF patients were < 65 years old and 427 AHF patients were >= 65 years old, and 47 (7.6%) and 40 (9.4%) patients were delirious at enrollment, respectively. Delirium was significantly associated with the composite outcome (adjusted OR = 1.64, 95%CI: 1.02 to 2.64). The older age*delirium interaction p-value was 0.47. In conclusion, delirium was common in both younger and older patients with AHF and was associated with poorer short-term outcomes in both cohorts. Younger patients with acute heart failure should be included in future delirium outcome studies.
