20974842|a|A role for Cu(2+) ions in Alzheimer disease is often disputed, as it is believed that Cu(2+) ions only promote nontoxic amorphous aggregates of amyloid-beta (Abeta). In contrast with currently held opinion, we show that the presence of substoichiometric levels of Cu(2+) ions in fact doubles the rate of production of amyloid fibers, accelerating both the nucleation and elongation of fiber formation. We suggest that binding of Cu(2+) ions at a physiological pH causes Abeta to approach its isoelectric point, thus inducing self-association and fiber formation. We further show that Cu(2+) ions bound to Abeta are consistently more toxic to neuronal cells than Abeta in the absence of Cu(2+) ions, whereas Cu(2+) ions in the absence of Abeta are not cytotoxic. The degree of Cu-Abeta cytotoxicity correlates with the levels of Cu(2+) ions that accelerate fiber formation. We note the effect appears to be specific for Cu(2+) ions as Zn(2+) ions inhibit the formation of fibers. An active role for Cu(2+) ions in accelerating fiber formation and promoting cell death suggests impaired copper homeostasis may be a risk factor in Alzheimer disease.
