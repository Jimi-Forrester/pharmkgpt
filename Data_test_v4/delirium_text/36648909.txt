36648909|t|Multi-Component Interventions in Older Adults Having Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD)-A Review Article.
36648909|a|Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is one of those significant concerns faced by older individuals. Though it is predominantly self-reported, it is not an event that should be overlooked, considering its significant association with cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and so on. This makes it imperative to find ways to manage the event to enhance the cognitive performance of older adults and/or suppress the rate at which cognitive decline results in impairment. While multiple interventions have been used for SCD, multi-component non-pharmacological interventions are beginning to gain more attention among researchers. This is due to how such interventions have effectively contributed to improved cognitive performance across different outcome domains. Against this backdrop, this literature review has been conducted to explore the different multi-component non-pharmacological interventions utilized in managing SCD. Papers from databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and EBSCO were retrieved, with relevant data being extracted on the subject matter to address the objective of this review.
