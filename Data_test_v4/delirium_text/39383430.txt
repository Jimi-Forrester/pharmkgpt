39383430|a|Peripheral regulation emerges as a promising intervention in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hub genes in the peripheral blood of MCI patients from GEO database (GSE63060, GSE63061) were screened using weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA). Meanwhile, behavioral tests, HE staining and Nissl staining were used to detect the memory impairment and histopathological changes in 24-week-old male 3xTg-AD mice. Thioflavin-S and immunohistochemical staining were used to determine the Abeta deposition in both intracellular and extracellular neurons. Subsequently, the MCI-hub genes were verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in the peripheral blood of 3xTg-AD mice. The research revealed ten hub genes associated with MCI were identified WGCNA. Short-term memory loss, intracellular Abeta deposition and limited of extracellular amyloid plaques in 3xTg-AD mice. The qRT-PCR analysis of peripheral blood from these mice revealed significantly down-regulation in the expression levels of ATP5C1, ITGB2, EFTUD2 and RPS27A genes; whereas the expression level of VCP gene was significantly up-regulated. These findings confirmed that 24-week-old male 3xTg-AD mice were a valuable animal model for simulating the early symptomatic stages of AD. Additionally, the peripheral blood MCI-hub genes related to immune response, energy metabolism and ribosomal coding efficiency provide potential biomarkers for this stage.
