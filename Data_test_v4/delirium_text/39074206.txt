39074206|t|Proteostasis as a fundamental principle of Tau immunotherapy.
39074206|a|The microtubule-associated protein Tau is a driver of neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. In this process, Tau initially undergoes subtle changes to its abundance, subcellular localisation and a vast array of post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, that progressively result in the protein's somatodendritic accumulation and dysregulation of multiple Tau-dependent cellular processes. Given the various loss- and gain-of-functions of Tau in disease and the brain-wide changes in the proteome that characterise tauopathies, we asked whether targeting Tau would restore the alterations in proteostasis observed in disease. Therefore, by phage display, we generated a novel pan-Tau antibody, RNJ1, that preferentially binds human Tau and neutralises proteopathic seeding activity in multiple cell lines, and benchmarked it against a clinically tested pan-Tau antibody, HJ8.5 (murine version of tilavonemab). We then evaluated both antibodies, alone and in combination, in the K3 tauopathy mouse model, showing reduced Tau pathology and improvements in neuronal function following 14 weekly treatments, without obtaining synergy for the combination. These effects were more pronounced in female mice. To investigate the molecular mechanisms contributing to improvements in neuronal function, we employed quantitative proteomics, phosphoproteomics and kinase prediction analysis to first establish alterations in K3 mice relative to WT controls at the proteome level. In female K3 mice, we found 342 differentially abundant proteins, which are predominantly involved in metabolic and microtubule-associated processes, strengthening previously reported findings of defects in several functional domains in multiple tauopathy models. We next asked whether antibody-mediated Tau target engagement indirectly affects levels of deregulated proteins in the K3 model. Importantly, both immunotherapies, in particular RNJ1, induced abundance shifts towards a restoration to wild-type levels (proteostasis). A total of 257 of 342 (~75%) proteins altered in K3 were closer in abundance to WT levels after RNJ1 treatment, and 73% after HJ8.5 treatment. However, the magnitude of these changes was less pronounced than that observed with RNJ1, as reflected by a far smaller number of differentially abundant proteins. Furthermore, analysis of the phosphoproteome showed an even stronger restoration effect with RNJ1, with ~82% of altered phosphopeptides in K3 showing a shift to WT levels, and 75% with HJ8.5. Gene set over-representation analysis (ORA) further confirmed that proteins undergoing restoration are involved in biological pathways affected in K3 mice. Together, our study suggests that a Tau immunotherapy-induced restoration of proteostasis links target engagement and treatment efficacy.
