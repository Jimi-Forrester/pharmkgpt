31127782|a|We aimed to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a multidomain intervention including intensive and maintenance programs for reducing the risk of dementia in at-risk older adults. Community-dwelling older adults (aged >=60 years) without dementia but having several risk factors for dementia (N = 32; 89% female; mean age+-standard deviation, 76.8+-4.7 years) were assigned to three parallel programs: intensive plus maintenance (INT+MNT), intensive only (INT-only), and active control. Subjects in INT+MNT and INT-only groups participated in a 4-week intensive group-based lifestyle modification program that focused on physical activity, vascular risk factors, dietary habits, cognitive activities, and social engagement. INT+MNT participants underwent an additional 20-week maintenance program to consolidate modified habits. The modified Australian National University-Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI) score was used as the primary outcome measure for dementia risk. The changes in ANU-ADRI scores exhibited a significant group-by-time interaction: the INT+MNT group showed significant improvement at 24 weeks (beta= -6.05; SE = 1.86; p = 0.002), while the INT-only group did not. Additional exploratory analyses showed that the reduction in ANU-ADRI scores was caused by changes in protective factors rather than in risk factors. The INT + MNT group also showed greater improvement in executive function at 4 and 24 weeks (both p = 0.044), whereas changes in global cognitive function did not reach significance (p = 0.055). A 24-week multidomain dementia prevention involving a maintenance strategy for sustaining modified lifestyle habits reduced the risk of dementia and improved executive function in at-risk older adults.
