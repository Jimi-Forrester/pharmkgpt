33992880|t|A strategy to discover selective alpha-glucosidase/acetylcholinesterase inhibitors from five function-similar citrus herbs through LC-Q-TOF-MS, bioassay and virtual screening.
33992880|a|The lack of direct connection between traditional herbal medicines and multiple biological targets is a bottleneck in herbal research and quality evaluation. To solve this problem, a strategy for the discovery of active ingredients from function-similar herbal medicines based on multiple biological targets was proposed in this article. The technical route includes chromatographic separation, mass spectrometry analysis, enzymatic activity detection, pharmacophore analysis and molecular docking. Five citrus herbs of Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (CRP), Citri Exocarpium Rubrum (CER), Citri Grandis Exocarpium (CGE), Aurantii Fructus Immaturus (AFI) and Aurantii Fructus (AF) were used as the research objects. A total of 136 chemical components were identified from above five herbs based on LC-Q-TOF-MS/MS and database matching. The extracts of the five herbs showed obvious inhibitory effects on alpha-glucosidase and acetylcholinesterase in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, the different types of components in the herbs exhibited selectivity for different targets: flavanone glycosides are effective on alpha-glucosidase but ineffective on acetylcholinesterase; polymethoxyflavonoids are effective on acetylcholinesterase but ineffective on alpha-glucosidase. Furthermore, we found for the first time that the components in citrus herbs exhibit opposite structure-activity relationships on the above two targets. For example, the methoxy group can enhance the activity of compounds on acetylcholinesterase but weaken the activity of compounds on alpha-glucosidase. The selective action is a supplement to the "multi-components, multi-targets" system of herbal medicines. Pharmacophore analysis and molecular docking were applied to explore the interaction between active ingredients and biological targets from the perspective of ligands and receptors, respectively. By combining the above multiple technologies, a strong connection among herbal medicines, chemical components and multiple biological targets was established. This work not only helps to understand the similar function of citrus herbs for the treatment of diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, but also provides selective lead compounds for the development of related drugs. This strategy is also helpful to improve the quality evaluation of citrus herbs from the perspective of biological activity.
