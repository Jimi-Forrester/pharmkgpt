15843464|a|Amyloid diseases encompass >20 medical disorders that include amyloid protein A (AA) amyloidosis, Alzheimer's disease, and type 2 diabetes. A common feature of these conditions is the selective organ deposition of disease-specific fibrillar proteins, along with the sulfated glycosaminoglycan, heparan sulfate. We have generated transgenic mice that overexpress human heparanase and have tested their susceptibility to amyloid induction. Drastic shortening of heparan sulfate chains was observed in heparanase-overproducing organs, such as liver and kidney. These sites selectively escaped amyloid deposition on experimental induction of inflammation-associated AA amyloidosis, as verified by lack of material staining with Congo Red, as well as lack of associated polysaccharide, whereas the same tissues from control animals were heavily infiltrated with amyloid. By contrast, the spleens of transgenic mice that failed to significantly overexpress heparanase contained heparan sulfate chains similar in size to those of control spleen and remained susceptible to amyloid deposition. Our findings provide direct in vivo evidence that heparan sulfate is essential for the development of amyloid disease.
