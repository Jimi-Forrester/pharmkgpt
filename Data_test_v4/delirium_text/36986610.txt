36986610|t|Plant-Derived Bioactive Compounds in the Management of Neurodegenerative Disorders: Challenges, Future Directions and Molecular Mechanisms Involved in Neuroprotection.
36986610|a|Neurodegenerative disorders encompass a wide range of pathological conditions caused by progressive damage to the neuronal cells and nervous-system connections, which primarily target neuronal dysfunction and result in problems with mobility, cognition, coordination, sensation, and strength. Molecular insights have revealed that stress-related biochemical alterations such as abnormal protein aggregation, extensive generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation may lead to damage to neuronal cells. Currently, no neurodegenerative disease is curable, and the available standard therapies can only provide symptomatic treatment and delay the progression of the disease. Interestingly, plant-derived bioactive compounds have drawn considerable attention due to their well-established medicinal properties, including anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antimicrobial properties, as well as neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, and other health benefits. Plant-derived bioactive compounds have received far more attention in recent decades than synthetic bioactive compounds in the treatment of many diseases, including neurodegeneration. By selecting suitable plant-derived bioactive compounds and/or plant formulations, we can fine tune the standard therapies because the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs is greatly enhanced by combinations. A plethora of in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated plant-derived bioactive compounds' immense potential, as proven by their capacity to influence the expression and activity of numerous proteins implicated in oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and aggregation. Thus, this review mostly focuses on the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-aggregation, anti-cholinesterase, and anti-apoptotic properties of several plant formulations and plant-derived bioactive compounds and their molecular mechanisms against neurodegenerative disorders.
