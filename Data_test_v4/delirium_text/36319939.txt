36319939|a|BACKGROUND: Inflammatory responses play key roles in the development and progression of many pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. Accurate quantification of inflammatory factors in saliva would be highly advantageous, given its convenience and non-invasive nature, especially in elderly populations. METHODS: In this study, we measured levels of 10 cytokines, and the pro-inflammatory factor, YKL-40, in plasma and saliva samples from a cohort of nondemented older adults (n = 71; 62% female; 70.3 +- 6.4 years) using sensitive electrochemiluminescence-based immunoassays. RESULTS: We found that the mean levels of all cytokines were higher in saliva compared to plasma and that strong sex differences were observed for both saliva and plasma cytokines in this population. Comparing each cytokine between the two biofluids, we found that levels of interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in blood were significantly correlated with their respective levels in saliva. We further observed that levels of these cytokines in blood were significantly correlated with additional cytokines in saliva, including IL-1beta, IL-10, IL-8, IL12p70 and IL-13. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that inflammatory markers in saliva are associated with those found in circulation, suggesting shared inflammatory mechanisms between these two fluids. The higher levels of cytokines measured in saliva suggest that it might represent a better peripheral fluid to gauge inflammatory processes. Finally, our findings of robust sex differences in several salivary cytokines could have important implications for their potential use as disease biomarkers in the elderly and might be related to sex differences in the prevalence of age-related conditions.
