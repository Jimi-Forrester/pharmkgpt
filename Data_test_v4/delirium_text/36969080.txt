36969080|t|Effect of sarcopenia on postoperative ICU admission and length of stay after hepatic resection for Klatskin tumor.
36969080|a|Background: Hepatic resection of Klatskin tumors usually requires postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) admission because of its high morbidity and mortality. Identifying surgical patients who will benefit most from ICU admission is important because of scarce resources but remains difficult. Sarcopenia is characterised by the loss of skeletal muscle mass and is associated with poor surgical outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively analysed th.e relationship between preoperative sarcopenia and postoperative ICU admission and length of ICU stay (LOS-I) in patients who underwent hepatic resection for Klatskin tumors. Using preoperative computed tomography scans, the cross-sectional area of the psoas muscle at the level of the third lumbar vertebra was measured and normalised to the patient's height. Using these values, the optimal cut-off for diagnosing sarcopenia was determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for each sex. Results: Of 330 patients, 150 (45.5%) were diagnosed with sarcopenia. Patients with preoperative sarcopenia presented significantly more frequently to the ICU (77.3% vs. 47.9%, p < 0.001) and had longer total LOS-I (2.45 vs 0.89 days, p < 0.001). Moreover, patients with sarcopenia showed a significantly higher postoperative length of hospital stay, severe complication rate, and in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: Sarcopenia correlated with poor postoperative outcomes, especially with the increased requirement of postoperative ICU admission and prolonged LOS-I after hepatic resection in patients with Klatskin tumors.
