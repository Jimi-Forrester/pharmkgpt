2898972|t|Alcohol, barbiturate and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndromes: clinical management.
2898972|a|The symptoms and clinical management of alcohol, barbiturate and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndromes are discussed in this article. People who suffer alcohol withdrawal should be admitted to hospital if they have medical or surgical complications or severe symptoms; supportive care and pharmacotherapy, especially diazepam loading, are the essential components of treatment. Barbiturate withdrawal requires pharmacotherapy and admission to hospital for patients who have taken more than 0.4 g/d of secobarbital or an equivalent amount of another barbiturate for 90 days or longer, or 0.6 g/d or an equivalent dose for 30 days or longer, or who have had withdrawal seizures or delirium; phenobarbital loading is recommended. Regular benzodiazepine therapy that has lasted at least 3 months should be gradually stopped. Short-acting agents should be replaced with long-acting ones, such as diazepam, to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Most of these patients can be managed on an outpatient basis.
