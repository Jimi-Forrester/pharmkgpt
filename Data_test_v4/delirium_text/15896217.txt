15896217|a|The features of delirium in patients being hospitalized due to respiratory diseases were investigated. From the inpatients in the respiratory medical ward of Tokyo Metropolitan Hiroo General Hospital over the course of 1 year, the patients who had delirium were diagnosed by a semistructured interview. The total number of subjects was 454, and patients with delirium were 43. Various clinical factors were compared between the delirium group and non-delirium group. In the delirium group, there were many elderly patients of 70 years or older. Moreover, there were many patients who had a chronic respiratory disease, patients in which the respiratory diseases were mutually complicated, and patients in whom other diseases combined with the respiratory disease in the delirium group. There were also many patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and patients with an endotracheal intubation or extubation. Based on the results of a multiple logistic regression analysis, for age, ICU accommodation, and endotracheal intubation, the value of the delirium group was more significant than that of the non-delirium group. In half of the patients from the delirium group, delirium developed within 1 week after hospitalization. In the patients who died in the hospital, however, delirium often developed days after they had been hospitalized. It was suggested that the later developed delirium had a relation to the prognosis.
