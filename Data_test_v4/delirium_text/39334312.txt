39334312|a|BACKGROUND: Comprehensive studies on priority areas for improving geriatric surgery outcomes, inclusive of geriatric-pertinent data, are limited. METHODS: The ACS NSQIP geriatric database (2014-2018) was used to abstract older adults (>=65 years) undergoing inpatient general surgery procedures. Thirty-day complication, functional decline, and mortality rates were analyzed, with a focus on two geriatric-pertinent complications: delirium and new/worsening pressure ulcers. RESULTS: There were 9062 patients; 41.9% were >=75 years. Mean age was 73.9 years. The majority of patients were female (54.0%), White (77.7%), and had independent functional status before surgery (94.0%). Overall 30-day complication, functional decline, and mortality rates were 33.6%, 34.5%, and 3.5%, respectively; failure to the rescue rate was 9.7%. Including geriatric-pertinent complications increased the overall complication rate by 20.4%. Delirium emerged as the leading complication (11.9%), followed by bleeding (11.1%), and wound-related complications (10.1%); these three accounted for 53.7% of complications. Delirium and pressure ulcers were associated with a >50% rate of postoperative functional decline (52.0% and 71.4%, respectively); pressure ulcers were also notable for a 25.5% failure to the rescue rate. Both were also among complications most likely to occur following the 3 most common procedures (colorectal surgery, pancreatic resections, and exploratory laparotomy), which overall accounted for approximately 79.6% of complications, 73.4% of patients experiencing functional decline, and 82.3% of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is the leading complication among older adults undergoing inpatient surgery. Overall, a small number of complications and procedure groups account for most surgical morbidity and mortality among older adults and thus constitute priority areas for outcomes improvement.
