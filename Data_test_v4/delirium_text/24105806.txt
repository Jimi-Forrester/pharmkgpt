24105806|a|The hippocampus is one of the first affected regions in Alzheimer's disease. The left hippocampi of control subjects, patients with mild cognitive impairment and patients with Alzheimer's disease are represented by spherical harmonics. Functional data analysis is used in the hippocampal shape analysis. Functional principal component analysis and functional independent component analysis are defined for multivariate functions with two arguments. A functional linear discriminant function is also defined. Comparisons with other approaches are carried out. Our functional approach gives promising results, especially in shape classification.
