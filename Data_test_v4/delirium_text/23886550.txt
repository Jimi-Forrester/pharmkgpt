23886550|a|Active amyloid-beta (Abeta) immunotherapy is under investigation to prevent or treat Alzheimer disease (AD). We describe here the immunological characterization and protective effect of DNA epitope chimeric vaccines using 6 copies of Abeta1-15 fused with PADRE or toxin-derived carriers. These naked 6Abeta15-T-Hc chimeric DNA vaccines were demonstrated to induce robust anti-Abeta antibodies that could recognize Abeta oligomers and inhibit Abeta oligomer-mediated neurotoxicity, result in the reduction of cerebral Abeta load and Abeta oligomers, and improve cognitive function in AD mice, but did not stimulate Abeta-specific T cell responses. Notably, toxin-derived carriers as molecular adjuvants were able to substantially promote immune responses, overcome Abeta-associated hypo-responsiveness, and elicit long-term Abeta-specific antibody response in 6Abeta15-T-Hc-immunized AD mice. These findings suggest that our 6Abeta15-T-Hc DNA chimeric vaccines can be used as a safe and effective strategy for AD immunotherapy, and toxin-derived carrier proteins are effective molecular adjuvants of DNA epitope vaccines for Alzheimer's disease.
