31818005|a|The main purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) on the quality of life (QoL) and psychosocial functioning of patients with the BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. This survey-based study was conducted using the Blatt-Kupperman Index, the Women's Health Questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and the authors' questionnaire. All calculations were done using Statistica 13.3. The QoL after RRSO was statistically significantly lower in most domains compared with the state before surgery. The greatest decline in the QoL was observed in the vasomotor symptoms domain (d = 0.953) and the smallest in the memory/concentration domain (d = 0.167). We observed a statistically significant decrease in the level of anxiety as a state (d = 0.381), as well as a statistically significant increase in the severity of climacteric symptoms (d = 0.315) and depressive symptoms (d = 0.125). Prophylactic surgeries of the reproductive organs have a negative effect on the QoL and psychosocial functioning of women with the BRCA1/2 mutations, as they increase the severity of depressive and climacteric symptoms. At the same time, these surgeries reduce anxiety as a state, which may be associated with the elimination of cancerophobia.
