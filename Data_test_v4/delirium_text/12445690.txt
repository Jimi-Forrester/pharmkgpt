12445690|t|Retrograde tracing of zinc-enriched (ZEN) neuronal somata projecting to the olfactory bulb.
12445690|a|Zinc ions seem to be important to several neurological functions and have been connected to the pathophysiology of epilepsy, neuronal cell death after seizure or stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. Both epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease are clinical conditions believed to involve the olfactory bulb. The mammalian olfactory bulb is densely innervated by zinc-enriched (ZEN) neurons, and the distribution of the ZEN terminals in the mouse olfactory bulb has previously been described. The aim of this study was to describe the origins of ZEN terminals projecting into the main olfactory bulb of the rat. Selective labeling of ZEN terminals was accomplished by intracerebral infusion of sodium selenide, whereby zinc selenium clusters are created in the ZEN terminals. Some of these clusters move by retrograde axonal transport to the somata where they can be silver-enhanced by autometallography (AMG). After infusion of sodium selenide into the main olfactory bulb, retrogradely labeled ZEN somata were found (1) ipsilaterally in all anterior olfactory nuclei, taenia tecta, piriform cortex and lateral entorhinal cortex, and (2) contralaterally in anterior olfactory nuclei except the external division. The ipsilateral anterior olfactory nucleus had the densest population of ZEN somata, and it was found that these somata originated mainly from pyramidal neurons in layers II and III of each area. The olfactory-related centrifugal afferents to the main olfactory bulb are discussed.
