36768386|t|Lycorine Carbamate Derivatives for Reversing P-glycoprotein-Mediated Multidrug Resistance in Human Colon Adenocarcinoma Cells.
36768386|a|Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major challenge in cancer chemotherapy. Aiming at generating a small library of anticancer compounds for overcoming MDR, lycorine (1), a major Amaryllidaceae alkaloid isolated from Pancratium maritimum, was derivatized. Thirty-one new compounds (2-32) were obtained by chemical transformation of the hydroxyl groups of lycorine into mono- and di-carbamates. Compounds 1-32 were evaluated as MDR reversers, through the rhodamine-123 accumulation assay by flow cytometry and chemosensitivity assays, in resistant human colon adenocarcinoma cancer cells (Colo 320), overexpressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1). Significant inhibition of P-gp efflux activity was observed for the di-carbamate derivatives, mainly those containing aromatic substituents, at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Compound 5, bearing a benzyl substituent, and compounds 9 and 25, with phenethyl moieties, were among the most active, exhibiting strong inhibition at 2 microM, being more active than verapamil at 10-fold higher concentration. In drug combination assays, most compounds were able to synergize doxorubicin. Moreover, some derivatives showed a selective antiproliferative effect toward resistant cells, having a collateral sensitivity effect. In the ATPase assay, selected compounds (2, 5, 9, 19, 25, and 26) were shown to behave as inhibitors.
