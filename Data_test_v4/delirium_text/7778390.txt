7778390|t|[The angioarchitectonics in the areas of greatest brain atrophy in Alzheimer's and Pick's diseases].
7778390|a|Atrophic brain diseases (Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Pick disease, etc.) associated with grave dementia have clinical and neuroanatomical differences. The differences in angioarchitectonics concerned to the degree of vessel arborization, twisting, their direction, as well as congenital anomalies. These changed were more expressed in Alzheimer disease. In Pick disease predominated atrophic changes.
