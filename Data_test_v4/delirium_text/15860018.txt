15860018|a|OBJECTIVE: To review the role of cortical release signs (CRS) in neuropsychiatry. METHOD: A thorough literature review was conducted using Medline and Psychlit databases, and other relevant references available to the authors. RESULTS: A number of neurological abnormalities are reported at elevated rates in neuropsychiatric conditions. CRS are a group of primitive reflexes that are present in the neonate but become inhibited as the infant central nervous system (CNS) develops, only to later re-emerge in the context of CNS disease. The clinical elicitation and interpretation of each CRS is described with reference to its neurobiology. The prevalence of CRS in schizophrenia, affective disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia and other neuropsychiatric illness allows for their use in the clinical management of these patients, including diagnostic assessment, treatment monitoring and prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: A number of issues complicate their interpretation in neuropsychiatric illness, including the apparent high base rate of some CRS in non-clinical populations, their increasing prevalence with age, lack of specificity and uncertainty over what constitutes an 'abnormal' response. In some circumstances, CRS may assist in diagnostic differentiation and illness staging.
