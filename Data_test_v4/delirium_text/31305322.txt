31305322|t|VGF in Cerebrospinal Fluid Combined With Conventional Biomarkers Enhances Prediction of Conversion From MCI to AD.
31305322|a|BACKGROUND: Previous work has suggested that the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of a neural protein involved in synaptic transmission, VGF (a noninitialism), may be altered in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer Disease (AD). The objective of the current work is to examine the potential of CSF levels of a peptide derived from VGF to predict conversion from MCI to AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using multivariate analytical approaches, the performance of the conventional biomarkers (CSF Abeta1-42 and phosphorylated tau +/- hippocampal volume) was compared with the same biomarkers combined with CSF VGF peptide levels in a large publicly available data set from human subjects. RESULTS: It was observed that VGF peptides are lowered in CSF of patients with AD compared with controls and that combinations of CSF Abeta1-42 and phosphorylated tau, hippocampal volume, and VGF peptide levels outperformed conventional biomarkers alone (hazard ratio=2.2 vs. 3.9), for predicting MCI to AD conversion. CONCLUSIONS: CSF VGF enhances the ability of conventional biomarkers to predict MCI to AD conversion. Future work will be needed to determine the specificity of VGF for AD versus other neurodegenerative diseases.
