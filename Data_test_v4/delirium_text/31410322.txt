31410322|t|A Unique Case of Testicular Plasmablastic Lymphoma in a Patient with Human Immunodeficiency Virus.
31410322|a|Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is a rare, aggressive, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma usually arising in the oral cavity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. Here we describe a patient with HIV who presented with cutaneous nodules that were biopsied and found to be positive for PBL, but whose primary source was found to be testicular. This is the first reported case of a patient with HIV who presented with cutaneous nodules that tested positive for PBL, but whose primary source of neoplasm was found to be testicular.
