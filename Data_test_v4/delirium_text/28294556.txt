28294556|t|Unmodified and pyroglutamylated amyloid beta peptides form hypertoxic hetero-oligomers of unique secondary structure.
28294556|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide plays a major role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and occurs in multiple forms, including pyroglutamylated Abeta (AbetapE). Identification and characterization of the most cytotoxic Abeta species is necessary for advancement in AD diagnostics and therapeutics. While in brain tissue multiple Abeta species act in combination, structure/toxicity studies and immunotherapy trials have been focused on individual forms of Abeta. As a result, the molecular composition and the structural features of "toxic Abeta oligomers" have remained unresolved. Here, we have used a novel approach, hydration from gas phase coupled with isotope-edited Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, to identify the prefibrillar assemblies formed by Abeta and AbetapE and to resolve the structures of both peptides in combination. The peptides form unusual beta-sheet oligomers stabilized by intramolecular H-bonding as opposed to intermolecular H-bonding in the fibrils. Time-dependent morphological changes in peptide assemblies have been visualized by atomic force microscopy. Abeta/AbetapE hetero-oligomers exert unsurpassed cytotoxic effect on PC12 cells as compared to oligomers of individual peptides or fibrils. These findings lead to a novel concept that Abeta/AbetapE hetero-oligomers, not just Abeta or AbetapE oligomers, constitute the main neurotoxic conformation. The hetero-oligomers thus present a new biomarker that may be targeted for development of more efficient diagnostic and immunotherapeutic strategies to combat AD.
