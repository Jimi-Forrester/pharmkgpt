35021237|t|[Noise Reduction on the ICU].
35021237|a|Noise pollution in the intensive care unit is not only an omnipresent but also a considerable problem, both for patients and healthcare staff. There are a number of significant sources of noise that are at least partially responsible for the frequent and serious sleep disorders of intensive care unit patients. This has a negative impact on the recovery of intensive care patients and favours the occurrence of delirium, which can be associated with increased overall mortality. This article provides a summary of the current evidence on the occurrence of noise-associated consequences and possible options for reducing noise exposure in the intensive care unit and offers perspectives for improving treatment of intensive care patients.
