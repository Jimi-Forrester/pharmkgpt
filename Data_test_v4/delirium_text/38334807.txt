38334807|a|Hematological malignancies (HM) represent a subset of neoplasms affecting the blood, bone marrow, and lymphatic systems, categorized primarily into leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Their prognosis varies considerably, with a frequent risk of relapse despite ongoing treatments. While contemporary therapeutic strategies have extended overall patient survival, they do not offer cures for advanced stages and often lead to challenges such as acquisition of drug resistance, recurrence, and severe side effects. The need for innovative therapeutic targets is vital to elevate both survival rates and patients' quality of life. Recent research has pivoted towards nuclear receptors (NRs) due to their role in modulating tumor cell characteristics including uncontrolled proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis evasion, invasion and migration. Existing evidence emphasizes NRs' critical role in HM. The regulation of NR expression through agonists, antagonists, or selective modulators, contingent upon their levels, offers promising clinical implications in HM management. Moreover, several anticancer agents targeting NRs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This review highlights the integral function of NRs in HM's pathophysiology and the potential benefits of therapeutically targeting these receptors, suggesting a prospective avenue for more efficient therapeutic interventions against HM.
