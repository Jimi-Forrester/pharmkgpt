37583253|t|Zein-Based Nanoparticles Improve the Therapeutic Efficacy of a TrkB Agonist toward Alzheimer's Disease.
37583253|a|The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/TrkB pathway plays a crucial role in neural plasticity and neuronal survival but is often deficient in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). CF3CN acts as a specific TrkB agonist that displays therapeutic effects in the AD mouse model, but its brain/plasma ratio (B/P ratio) distribution is not satisfactory. To increase its brain exposure, we synthesized several derivatives and employed nanoparticle (NP) formulation to optimize the most potent #2 derivative's in vivo PK profiles. We generated stable #2-loaded zein/lactoferrin composite NPs (#2/zein/LF) using the antisolvent co-precipitation method. In vivo PK studies revealed that nanoencapsulation improved #2's oral bioavailability by approximately 2-fold and significantly enhanced its plasma Cmax and t1/2, but the brain profiles were comparable. Pharmacodynamics showed that #2/zein/LF activates TrkB signaling that phosphorylates asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) T322 and decreases its enzymatic activity, resulting in reduced AEP-cleaved amyloid precursor protein and Tau fragments in the brains of AD mice, correlating with its PK profiles. After 3 months of treatment in 3xTg mice, #2/zein/LF decreased AD pathologies and alleviated cognitive dysfunction. Hence, zein/LF composite nanoencapsulation is a promising drug delivery method for improving the PK profiles of a potential preclinical candidate for treating neurodegenerative diseases.
