37654736|a|Introduction: In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), stroke is a major public health problem and the etiological aspects are poorly studied and documented because of under-medicalization; the syphilitic etiology is rarely mentioned. Patients and methods: We performed a retrospective study of 472 patients hospitalized for ischemic stroke between 2016 and 2021 in the Neurology Department of the University Hospital of Conakry, confirmed by neuroradiological explorations (brain CT, MRI-Angio) and a biological workup including VDRL-TPHA serological reactions in blood and CSF. Results: Syphilitic etiology was retained for six (6) patients (4 men and 2 women) with a mean age of 43 years (extremes 36 and 49 years). The clinical picture was dominated by carotid syndromes: superficial and deep sylvian syndrome, anterior cerebral artery syndrome and vertebro-basilar syndromes and one case of lacunar syndrome.The diagnosis was based on the positivity of serological reactions (VDRL-TPHA) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the presence of a predominantly lymphocytic hypercellularity and a hyperproteinorachy in the CSF in the absence of any other etiology. Conclusion: These neurological vascular syndromes consecutive to a cerebral treponematous attack are often the result of a still poorly conducted management of primary and secondary syphilis in our country.
