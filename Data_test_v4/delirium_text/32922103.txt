32922103|t|Electroacupuncture: A New Approach for Improved Postoperative Sleep Quality After General Anesthesia.
32922103|a|General anesthesia produces a state of drug-induced unconsciousness that is controlled by the extent and duration of administered agents. Whether inhalation or intravenous in formulation, such agents may interfere with normal sleep-wake cycles, impairing postoperative sleep quality and creating complications. Electroacupuncture is a new approach widely applied in clinical practice during recent years. This particular technology helps regulate neurotransmitter concentrations in the brain, lowering norepinephrine and dopamine levels to improve sleep quality. It also alleviates surgical pain that degrades postoperative sleep quality after general anesthesia by downregulating immune activity (SP, NK-1, and COX-1) and upregulating serotonin receptor (5-HT1AR, 5-HT2AR) and endocannabinoid expression levels. However, large-scale, multicenter studies are still needed to determine the optimal duration, frequency, and timing of electroacupuncture for such use.
