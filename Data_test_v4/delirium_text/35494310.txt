35494310|t|High Prevalence of Sleep Disturbance Is Associated with Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome.
35494310|a|Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify an association between Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) sleep scores and other PROMIS domains in patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS). Methods: Patients were retrospectively identified for FAIS pathology, and PROMIS outcomes were assessed at multiple visits. Individual generalized linear mixed-effects models were fit with PROMIS sleep score as the predictor variable, and each subsequent PROMIS metric as the response variable. Additionally, models were fit using a clinically significant dichotomization of PROMIS sleep score to assess differences in average PROMIS scores between those with disrupted sleep (>55) and those with normal sleep (<=55). Results: PROMIS scores at baseline differed between those with and without sleep disturbance. Specifically, higher PROMIS sleep scores were associated with higher anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain intensity, and pain interference scores and lower physical function, and social participation. Conclusions: An association between PROMIS sleep score and other PROMIS outcomes does exist. Sleep disturbance is associated with increased anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain intensity, pain interference and decreased physical function, and social participation when analyzing PROMIS score, as both a continuous and dichotomized variable. Because of the observational design of this study, no causal inference can be made on these results. Level of Evidence: Level III, retrospective comparative trial.
