37385855|a|BACKGROUND: Unresolved surgical inflammation might induce chronic cognitive decline in older adults. Although inflammatory biomarkers have been correlated with perioperative cognitive impairment and delirium, the effects of prolonged inflammation on cognition are not well studied. This prospective cohort study investigated 1-yr dynamics in plasma interleukin-6 levels and executive function. METHODS: Patients undergoing major surgery (n=170) aged >=65 yr completed Trail Making Test B and other neuropsychological assessments with plasma interleukin-6 levels collected on postoperative days 1-9 and 90, and at 1-yr. Mixed-effects analyses were conducted for Trail Making Test B (and other assessments), including interleukin-6 levels, time, and additional confounders (fixed effects), and a random effect for participant. RESULTS: Changes in interleukin-6 levels were associated with changes in Trail Making Test B over 1 yr in a generalised additive model (beta=0.074, P<0.001) supporting that unresolved inflammation impaired executive function. This result was robust to confounders, outlier rejection, and fitting to non-linear models. Changes in interleukin-6 levels also correlated with changes in Trail Making Test A and Controlled Oral Word Association Test. Sensitivity analyses conducted on binary definitions of cognitive decline (>1, >1.5, or >2 standard deviations from baseline) were also associated with interleukin-6 changes. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed resolution of inflammation is associated with cognitive impairment after surgery. Monitoring interleukin-6 might provide an opportunity to intervene with anti-inflammatory therapies in vulnerable patients. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01980511, NCT03124303.
