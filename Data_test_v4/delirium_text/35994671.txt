35994671|t|Selective inhibitors of SARM1 targeting an allosteric cysteine in the autoregulatory ARM domain.
35994671|a|The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrolase (NADase) sterile alpha toll/interleukin receptor motif containing-1 (SARM1) acts as a central executioner of programmed axon death and is a possible therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders. While orthosteric inhibitors of SARM1 have been described, this multidomain enzyme is also subject to intricate forms of autoregulation, suggesting the potential for allosteric modes of inhibition. Previous studies have identified multiple cysteine residues that support SARM1 activation and catalysis, but which of these cysteines, if any, might be selectively targetable by electrophilic small molecules remains unknown. Here, we describe the chemical proteomic discovery of a series of tryptoline acrylamides that site-specifically and stereoselectively modify cysteine-311 (C311) in the noncatalytic, autoregulatory armadillo repeat (ARM) domain of SARM1. These covalent compounds inhibit the NADase activity of WT-SARM1, but not C311A or C311S SARM1 mutants, show a high degree of proteome-wide selectivity for SARM1_C311 and stereoselectively block vincristine- and vacor-induced neurite degeneration in primary rodent dorsal root ganglion neurons. Our findings describe selective, covalent inhibitors of SARM1 targeting an allosteric cysteine, pointing to a potentially attractive therapeutic strategy for axon degeneration-dependent forms of neurological disease.
