26235070|t|Drosophila melanogaster as a Model for Studies on the Early Stages of Alzheimer's Disease.
26235070|a|Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) have been widely used to study the cellular and molecular basis of human neurodegenerative disease. The biological similarities between the human and the fly have been explored successfully to further investigate the pathological basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we discuss transgenic Drosophila models systems and the methodologies that have been employed in the study of AD.
