38076608|a|Advance care planning (ACP) can help reduce end-of-life care challenges for persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia and their care partners. Building on our previous work, we examined the impact of ACP on outpatient/doctor visits in older adults with dementia/impaired cognition and normal cognition. Using datasets from the 2014 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we conducted a cross-sectional study of 17,698 participants aged 51 years and older. Our analyses included survey descriptive and logistic regression procedures. Our findings indicated that having at least one ACP measure was significantly associated with a higher mean number of outpatient visits in both cognition groups. Based on our findings, we recommend considering healthcare access and use as an intervening variable in future ACP research.
