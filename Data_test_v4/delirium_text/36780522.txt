36780522|t|Helminth egg derivatives as proregenerative immunotherapies.
36780522|a|The immune system is increasingly recognized as an important regulator of tissue repair. We developed a regenerative immunotherapy from the helminth Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigen (SEA) to stimulate production of interleukin (IL)-4 and other type 2-associated cytokines without negative infection-related sequelae. The regenerative SEA (rSEA) applied to a murine muscle injury induced accumulation of IL-4-expressing T helper cells, eosinophils, and regulatory T cells and decreased expression of IL-17A in gamma delta (gammadelta) T cells, resulting in improved repair and decreased fibrosis. Encapsulation and controlled release of rSEA in a hydrogel further enhanced type 2 immunity and larger volumes of tissue repair. The broad regenerative capacity of rSEA was validated in articular joint and corneal injury models. These results introduce a regenerative immunotherapy approach using natural helminth derivatives.
