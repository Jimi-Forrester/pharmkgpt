31190768|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder that also involves neuroinflammation in addition to many other features. Icariin (ICA) as one of the active ingredients of Chinese herbal medicine has the immunomodulating function. This study aimed to investigate the immunotherapeutic potential of ICA on AD. Methods: APP/PS1 mice and wild type C57BL/6 mice were subjected to orally ICA administration (60 mg/kg/d) for 8 months. Then, the ethological and biochemical experiments, such as Morris water maze assay, Abeta ELISA, blood T cell flow cytometry, and plasma and brain cytokines array, were conducted to evaluate the effects of ICA administration. Results: ICA significantly improved spatial learning and memory retention in APP/PS1 mice. Long-term application of ICA could also reduce hippocampus Abeta deposition, modulate the differentiation of CD4+ T cells, and modulate the release of inflammatory cytokines in plasma and brain tissue. Conclusion: ICA shows the neuroprotective effects via modulating the CD4+ T lymphocyte-related immuno-inflammatory responses in APP/PS1 mice and may be a promising drug against AD progression.
