8788082|a|Eighteen patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (NINCDS/ADRDA criteria) participated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind study, with a crossover design. The patients had mild or moderate dementia (MMSE = 20.3 +/- 4.6, range 12-28). The trial consisted of two 4-week periods with a 2-week washout period in between. Nicotine was given in the form of dermal plasters. Most of the patients tolerated the highest doses of 21 mg nicotine/24 h, but some received 14 mg/24 h. The effect was monitored with tests of short-term memory, verbal fluency, attention and psychomotor speed. Nicotine was also determined in the blood. Short-term memory improved significantly after 4 weeks of treatment, both on nicotine and placebo (p < 0.05/p < 0.01). The results of our study thus do not indicate that nicotine applied in the form of dermal plasters is of any significance in the treatment of memory deficits in patient with Alzheimer's disease.
