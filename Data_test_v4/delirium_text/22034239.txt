22034239|t|Treating age-related changes in somatotrophic hormones, sleep, and cognition.
22034239|a|Many of the body's systems that function to maintain optimal health and well-being decline with advancing age. Aerobic capacity, muscle mass, and strength all progressively decline. Significant sleep disturbances are associated with increases in morbidity and mortality. Cognition declines, impacting an older individual's ability to function independently. Interventions that could at least stabilize or possibly improve functional capacity, sleep quality, and cognitive function have the theoretical potential to prolong an older individual's ability to live independently, and interest in their possible utility is growing rapidly. One such intervention may be stimulation of the "somatotrophic" axis via growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). Here we review the evidence for such somatotrophic interventions. We also report preliminary findings on the effects of chronic GHRH treatment on the somatotrophic hormones, body composition, functional status, sleep, and cognitive function of healthy older men and women from two major GHRH intervention studies, one recently completed and the other ongoing.
