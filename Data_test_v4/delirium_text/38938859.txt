38938859|t|Association Between Frailty and Management and Outcomes of Acute Myocardial Infarction Complicated by Cardiogenic Shock.
38938859|a|Background: Cardiogenic shock (CS) in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Frailty is a common comorbidity in patients with cardiovascular disease and is also associated with adverse outcomes. The impact of preexisting frailty at the time of CS diagnosis following AMI has not been studied. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of frailty in patients admitted with AMI complicated by CS (AMI-CS) hospitalizations and its associations with in-hospital outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the National Inpatient Sample from 2016 to 2020 and identified all hospitalizations for AMI-CS. We classified them into frail and nonfrail groups according to the hospital frailty risk score cut-off of 5 and compared in-hospital outcomes. Results: A total of 283,700 hospitalizations for AMI-CS were identified. Most (70.8%) occurred in the frail. Those with frailty had higher odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR [aOR]: 2.17, 95% CI: 2.07 to 2.26, P < 0.001), do-not-resuscitate status, and discharge to a skilled nursing facility compared with those without frailty. They also had higher odds of in-hospital adverse events, including intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, acute kidney injury, and delirium. Importantly, AMI-CS hospitalizations in the frail had lower odds of coronary revascularization (aOR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.53-0.58, P < 0.001) or mechanical circulatory support (aOR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.85-0.93, P < 0.001). Lastly, hospitalizations for AMI-CS showed an overall increase from 53,210 in 2016 to 57,065 in 2020 (P trend <0.001), with this trend driven by a rise in the frail. Conclusions: A high proportion of hospitalizations for AMI-CS had concomitant frailty. Hospitalizations with AMI-CS and frailty had higher rates of in-hospital morbidity and mortality compared to those without frailty.
