34256347|a|Whereas energy function in the aging brain and their related neurodegenerative diseases has been explored in some detail, there is limited knowledge about molecular mechanisms and brain networks of energy metabolism during infancy and childhood. In this review we describe current insights on physiological brain energetics at prenatal and neonatal stages, and in childhood. We then describe the main groups of inborn errors of energy metabolism affecting the brain. Of note, scarce basic neuroscience research in this field limits the opportunity for these disorders to provide paradigms of energy utilization during neurodevelopment. Finally, we report energy metabolism disturbances in well-known non-metabolic neurodevelopmental disorders. As energy metabolism is a fundamental biological function, brain energy utilization is likely altered in most neuropediatric diseases. Precise knowledge on mechanisms of brain energy disturbance will open the possibility of metabolic modulation therapies regardless of disease etiology.
