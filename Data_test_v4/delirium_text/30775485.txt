30775485|a|The purpose of this study was to investigate the causes of failure to return to the pre-fracture place of residence at hospital discharge following an operation for a hip fracture and to continue medical treatment for osteoporosis. Herein, we discuss methods for improving discharge protocols for these patients. We examined patients who sustained osteoporotic fractures and were operated on for a hip fracture between 2001 and 2003 (83 males and 386 females; 81.2 +- 9.0 years old) and between 2011 and 2013 (121 males and 462 females; 83.1 +- 9.3 years old). In a follow-up study, we examined patients who moved into our related rehabilitation institution over a 3-year period, from 2011 to 2013. The incidence of hip fractures had increased from 2001-2003 to 2011-2013 in both genders, and it tended to increase in patients greater than 80 years of age in male and 90 years of age in female. The most common destination residence after discharge from the rehabilitation institution was the pre-fracture place of residence. The Barthel Index at discharge from the rehabilitation institution was significantly lager in patients who returned to the pre-fracture place of residence compared to those who returned to nursing home and our hospital. These results suggest improved mobility and ADL level of patients enable them to return to the pre-fracture place of residence. We propose the construction of a feedback system that aids in a medical pass to increase the ambulant consultation rate for orthopedics and prevent fragile fractures.
