38872668|t|Traumatic Vertebral Artery Dissection Without Cervical Spine Injury Treated by Mechanical Thrombectomy.
38872668|a|A 59-year-old female injured in a motor vehicle accident presented with progressively impaired consciousness, and emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed basilar artery occlusion (BAO). Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) was performed immediately and achieved complete recanalization. Contrast-enhanced MRI also indicated right vertebral artery dissection (VAD), and the patient was subsequently diagnosed with artery-to-artery embolism caused by traumatic VAD. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated postoperatively, and there was no VAD or BAO recurrence during the three-month follow-up. This is the first reported case of BAO caused by traumatic VAD in an adult without accompanying cervical vertebral fracture treated using MT.
