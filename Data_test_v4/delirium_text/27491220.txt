27491220|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of Scalp acupuncture on serum neuron specific enolase (NSE) and S-100beta concentrations, and incidence rates of postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive function (POCD) of elderly patients undergoing hip replacement. METHODS: Eighty-four patients undergoing scheduled hip replacement under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) were assigned to the control group (group C) and the scalp acupuncture group (group S) according to random digit table, 42 cases in each group. In group S, scalp acupuncture was additionally performed according to International Standardized Scheme for Scalp Acupuncture. Scalp acupuncture was performed during the operation from the MS1 middle line of forehead [1 cun before Shenting (GV24), including Shenting (GV24)] and MS5 middle line of vertex [from Baihui (DU20) to Qianding (DU21), including Baihui (DU20) and Qianding (DU21)]. The operation time and post-operative length of stay were observed. The midazolam dosage, hemorrhage amount, fluid transfusion amount, urine amount, use rates of ephedrine and atropine during the operation were also observed and compared between the two groups. The occurrence rate of POD and POCD at post-operative day 3 (T1), week 1 (T2), month 3 (T3), and month 6 (T4) were measured. Eighteen patients were randomly selected to collect blood from internal jugular vein before anesthesia t0), immediately after ending the surgery (t1), 6 h after operation (t2), 24 h after operation (t3), and 48 h after operation (t4), respectively. Serum levels of NSE and S-100beta were correspondingly measured. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the operation time, midazolam dosage used during the operation, hemorrhage amount, fluid transfusion amount, urine amount, use rates of ephedrine and atropine (P > 0.05). Compared with group C, the post-operative length of stay was shortened in group S (P < 0.05). The incidence rate of POD and that of POCD at each time point were lower in group S (P < 0.05). The expression level of NSE decreased at t2, t3, and t4, and the expression level of S100beta also decreased at t1, t2, t3, and t4(P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in expression levels of NSE or S100beta between the two groups at other time points (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Scalp acupuncture could attenuate central nervous system lesion and improve POCD of elderly patients undergoing hip replacement.
