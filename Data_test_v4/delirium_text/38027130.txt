38027130|a|Objective: To evaluate the clinical value of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in newly diagnosed ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes (KPD). Methods: A total of 330 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2DM) hospitalized in our department with an average age of 48.72 +- 13.07 years old were selected and divided into T2DM group (193 cases) and KPD group (137 cases) according to whether they were combined with ketosis. According to the quartile level of HbA1c, they were divided into group A (HbA1c < 8.90%, 84 cases), group B (8.90%<=HbA1c < 10.70%, 86 cases), group C (10.70%<=HbA1c <= 12.40%, 85 cases) and group D (HbA1c > 12.40%, 75 cases). The general clinical features, laboratory indicators and islet function of each group were compared. Spearman correlation analysis was used to explore the correlation between HbA1c and beta- Hydroxybutyric acid (beta- HB) and islet function. ROC curve was used to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of HbA1c in diagnosing KPD, and the optimal tangent point was obtained. Results: HbA1c, beta-HB, FFA, RBG, insulin dosage, GSP, OGTT (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3h) in KPD group were significantly higher than those in T2DM group (P< 0.001). HDL-C, IRT (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3h), HOMA-beta, HOMA-IR, HOMA-IS, DeltaC30/DeltaG30, AUC insulin were significantly lower than those in T2DM group (P< 0.001). With the increase of HbA1c level, the incidence of ketosis, beta-HB, FFA and insulin dosage increased, while IRT (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3h), DeltaC30/DeltaG30, AUC insulin, HOMA-beta and HOMA-IS decreased accordingly (P< 0.001). In all newly diagnosed T2DM patients, Spearman correlation analysis showed that HbA1c was positively correlated with beta-HB (r=0.539, P < 0.001), and was negatively correlated with HOMA-beta (r=-0.564, P < 0.001), HOMA-IS (r=-0.517, P < 0.01, P < 0.001), HOMA-IR (r=-0.177, P < 0.001), DeltaC30/DeltaG30 (r=-0.427, P < 0.01) and AUC insulin (r=-0.581, P < 0.001). In ROC curve analysis, the optimal threshold for the diagnosis of KPD was 10.15%, Youden index was 0.616, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.882, sensitivity = 92.70%, specificity = 70.50%. Conclusion: In newly diagnosed T2DM patients, if HbA1c > 10.15%, it is more likely to develop KPD. Monitoring HbA1c level is conducive to timely detection of high-risk individuals with KPD and taking appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence and development of the disease.
