35402235|t|Interplay Between Non-Coding RNAs and Programmed Cell Death Proteins.
35402235|a|Programmed cell death (PDCD) family of proteins includes at least 12 members, function of seven of them being more investigated. These members are PDCD1, PDCD2, PDCD4, PDCD5, PDCD6, PDCD7 and PDCD10. Consistent with the important roles of these proteins in the regulation of apoptosis, dysregulation of PDCDs is associated with diverse disorders ranging from intervertebral disc degeneration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, immune thrombocytopenia, type 1 diabetes, congenital hypothyroidism, Alzheimer's disease to different types of cancers. More recently, the interaction between non-coding RNAs and different members of PDCD family is being discovered. In the current study, we described the functional interactions between PDCDs and two classes of non-coding RNAs, namely microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). miR-21 and miR-183 are two miRNAs whose interactions with PDCDs have been assessed in different contexts. The lncRNAs interaction with PDCDs is mainly assessed in the context of neoplasia indicating the role of MALAT1, MEG3, SNHG14 and LINC00473 in this process.
