36986816|a|N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a derivative of the L-cysteine amino acid, presents antioxidant and mucolytic properties of pharmaceutical interest. This work reports the preparation of organic-inorganic nanophases aiming for the development of drug delivery systems based on NAC intercalation into layered double hydroxides (LDH) of zinc-aluminum (Zn2Al-NAC) and magnesium-aluminum (Mg2Al-NAC) compositions. A detailed characterization of the synthesized hybrid materials was performed, including X-ray diffraction (XRD) and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, infrared and Raman spectroscopies, solid-state 13carbon and 27aluminum nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), simultaneous thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry coupled to mass spectrometry (TG/DSC-MS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and elemental chemical analysis to assess both chemical composition and structure of the samples. The experimental conditions allowed to isolate Zn2Al-NAC nanomaterial with good crystallinity and a loading capacity of 27.3 (m/m)%. On the other hand, NAC intercalation was not successful into Mg2Al-LDH, being oxidized instead. In vitro drug delivery kinetic studies were performed using cylindrical tablets of Zn2Al-NAC in a simulated physiological solution (extracellular matrix) to investigate the release profile. After 96 h, the tablet was analyzed by micro-Raman spectroscopy. NAC was replaced by anions such as hydrogen phosphate by a slow diffusion-controlled ion exchange process. Zn2Al-NAC fulfil basic requirements to be employed as a drug delivery system with a defined microscopic structure, appreciable loading capacity, and allowing a controlled release of NAC.
