33668038|a|Extracellular aggregation of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide into toxic multimers in the brain is a prominent event occurring in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and a large amount of Abeta in the blood is derived from platelets. Thus, we speculated that platelets may play an important role in the process of AD. We first investigated the changes in platelet Abeta secretion with age. Then, we injected platelets from aged amyloid precursor protein APP/PS1 mice into young C57 mice and assessed their memory capacity along with their brain and peripheral blood Abeta expression levels. The Abeta content in mouse platelets increased with age. Exogenously aged APP/PS1 platelets changed the permeability of the blood-brain barrier in vitro, accelerating Abeta deposition in the brain and increasing the Abeta content in peripheral blood, leading to learning and memory deficits in the recipient mice. Subsequently, aspirin was administered to mice as an inhibitor of platelet activation, which effectively alleviated these toxic processes. Finally, we chose an in vitro blood-brain barrier model to explore the possible cytotoxicity of these platelets.
