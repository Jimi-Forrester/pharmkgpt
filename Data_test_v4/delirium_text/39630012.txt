39630012|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. Neurofeedback, a technique that trains brainwaves, has shown promise in addressing cognitive impairments. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a bibliometric analysis to explore the current research on neurofeedback as a treatment for AD. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed based on PRISMA guidelines on 142 papers. Different bibliometric parameters like the author's country, author names, keywords, journal names, and country of citations were analyzed, and a network visualization chart was generated to understand the correlation of Alzheimer-related search terms to neurofeedback. RESULTS: Research is concentrated in Europe and North America, with a significant gap in Asian countries. A growing body of evidence supports the potential benefits of neurofeedback for AD. A strong correlation has been found between neurofeedback and AD-related terms. Clinical trials suggest positive outcomes for neurofeedback in improving cognitive impairments and working memory. CONCLUSION: Neurofeedback shows promise as a potential treatment for AD. Further research and clinical studies are needed to explore the full potential of neurofeedback for enhancing the quality of life for individuals with AD.
