35991172|a|Changes in salivary testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) levels were assessed in elderly Tunisian male patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjected to music therapy and/or physical rehabilitation. Male patients with mild AD (N = 26; age = 76.23 +- 4.27 years; weight: 74.76 +- 5.36 kg) were randomly assigned into four groups for three 60-min sessions per week for 4 months; including Group1 or control group (Co) (n = 6); Group2 (n = 6), participated in physical rehabilitation (PR); Group3 (n = 7), subjected to music therapy (MT) and Group4 (n = 7), participated simultaneously in music therapy and physical rehabilitation (MT + PR). Salivary T levels increased (etap2 = 0.7) and C levels decreased (etap2 = 0.69), significantly (p < 0.001) in the PR, MT and MT + PR groups compared to the Co group respectively. Also, increases in salivary T levels and decreases in C levels in MT + PR group were greater compared to the other groups. MT increased T levels (p < 0.001) and decreased C levels (p < 0.05) to a greater extent than the PR group respectively. Changes in salivary T levels were positively (r = 0.83; p < 0.001) and C levels were negatively (r = -0.86; p < 0.001) correlated in the PR, MT and MT + PR groups with changes in MMSE in AD patients. This study highlights that combination of MT and PR holds potential to treat AD.
