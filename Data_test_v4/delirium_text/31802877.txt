31802877|t|Using Patient Profiles To Guide The Choice Of Antihistamines In The Primary Care Setting In Malaysia: Expert Consensus And Recommendations.
31802877|a|H1-antihistamines are recognized to be effective for conditions such as allergic rhinitis and chronic spontaneous urticaria. However, management of such conditions in the real-world primary care setting may be challenging due to diverse patient-specific considerations, the wide range of antihistamines available, choice of other treatment modalities, and the complexity of interpreting specialist treatment algorithms. Despite regular updates to international guidelines, regional/national surveys of healthcare professionals show a clear gap between guidelines and real-world practice, particularly at the primary care level. This article thus presents the consensus opinion of experts from relevant specialties in Malaysia - allergology, pediatrics, otorhinolaryngology, and dermtology - on harmonizing the use and choice of antihistamines in primary care. Patient profiling is recommended as a tool to guide primary care practitioners in prescribing the appropriate antihistamine for each patient. Patient profiling is a three-step approach that involves 1) identifying the individual's needs; 2) reviewing patient-specific considerations; and 3) monitoring treatment response and referral to specialists in more severe or difficult-to-treat cases. Concurrently, guidelct 3ines should be reviewed and updated periodically to include recommendations that are easily actionable for primary care practitioners.
