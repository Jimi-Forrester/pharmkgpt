38243956|t|Potential Role of Oxidative Stress in the Pathophysiology of Neurodegenerative Disorders.
38243956|a|Neurodegeneration causes premature death in the peripheral and central nervous system. Neurodegeneration leads to the accumulation of oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and the generation of free radicals responsible for nervous disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disorders. Therefore, focus must be diverted towards treating and managing these disorders, as it is very challenging. Furthermore, effective therapies are also lacking, so the growing interest of the global market must be inclined towards developing newer therapeutic approaches that can intercept the progression of neurodegeneration. Emerging evidences of research findings suggest that antioxidant therapy has significant potential in modulating disease phenotypes. This makes them promising candidates for further investigation. This review focuses on the role of oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species in the pathological mechanisms of various neurodegenerative diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disorders and their neuroprotection. Additionally, it highlights the potential of antioxidant-based therapeutics in mitigating disease severity in humans and improving patient compliance. Ongoing extensive global research further sheds light on exploring new therapeutic targets for a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms in the field of medicine and biology targeting neurogenerative disorders.
