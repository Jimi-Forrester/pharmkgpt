28079521|t|Isoform-specific subcellular localization and function of protein kinase A identified by mosaic imaging of mouse brain.
28079521|a|Protein kinase A (PKA) plays critical roles in neuronal function that are mediated by different regulatory (R) subunits. Deficiency in either the RIbeta or the RIIbeta subunit results in distinct neuronal phenotypes. Although RIbeta contributes to synaptic plasticity, it is the least studied isoform. Using isoform-specific antibodies, we generated high-resolution large-scale immunohistochemical mosaic images of mouse brain that provided global views of several brain regions, including the hippocampus and cerebellum. The isoforms concentrate in discrete brain regions, and we were able to zoom-in to show distinct patterns of subcellular localization. RIbeta is enriched in dendrites and co-localizes with MAP2, whereas RIIbeta is concentrated in axons. Using correlated light and electron microscopy, we confirmed the mitochondrial and nuclear localization of RIbeta in cultured neurons. To show the functional significance of nuclear localization, we demonstrated that downregulation of RIbeta, but not of RIIbeta, decreased CREB phosphorylation. Our study reveals how PKA isoform specificity is defined by precise localization.
