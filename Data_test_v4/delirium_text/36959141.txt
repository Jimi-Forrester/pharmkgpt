36959141|a|Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are progressive morbidities that represent a serious health issue in the aging world population. There is a contemporary upsurge in worldwide interest in the area of traditional remedies and phytomedicines are widely accepted by researchers due to their health-promoted effects and fewer side effects. Hesperidin, a flavanone glycoside present in the peels of citrus fruits, possesses various biological activities including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions. In various preclinical studies, hesperidin has provided significant protective actions in a variety of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, depression, neuropathic pain, etc. as well as their underlying mechanisms. The findings indicate that the neuroprotective effects of hesperidin are mediated by modulating antioxidant defence activities and neural growth factors, diminishing apoptotic and neuro-inflammatory pathways. This review focuses on the potential role of hesperidin in managing and treating diverse brain disorders.
