36319108|t|Association of Regional Atrophy With Naming Decline in Primary Progressive Aphasia.
36319108|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative condition that predominantly impairs language. Most investigations of how focal atrophy affects language consider 1 time point compared with healthy controls. However, true atrophy quantification requires comparing individual brains over time. In this observational cohort study, we identified areas where focal atrophy was associated with contemporaneous decline in naming in the same individuals. METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses-related Boston Naming Test (BNT) performance and volume in 22 regions of interests (ROIs) at each time point using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. Longitudinal analysis evaluated changes in BNT performance and change in volume in the same ROIs. RESULTS: Participants (N = 62; 50% female; mean age = 66.8 +- 7.4 years) with PPA completed the BNT and MRI twice (mean = 343.9 +- 209.0 days apart). In cross-sectional left inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis, superior temporal pole, middle temporal gyrus, and inferior temporal gyrus were identified as critical for naming at all time points. Longitudinal analysis revealed that increasing atrophy in the left supramarginal gyrus and middle temporal pole predicted greater naming decline, as did female sex and longer intervals between time points. DISCUSSION: Although cross-sectional analyses identified classic language areas that were consistently related to poor performance at multiple time points, it was not increasing atrophy in these areas that lead to further decline: longitudinal analysis of each person's atrophy over time instead identified nearby but distinct regions where increased atrophy was related to decreasing performance. The results demonstrate that directly examining atrophy (in each individual) over time furthers understanding of decline in PPA and reveal the importance of left supramarginal gyrus and middle temporal pole in maintaining naming when areas normally critical for language degenerate. The novel results provide insight into how the underlying disease progresses to result in the clinical decline in naming, the deficit most common among all 3 PPA variants.
