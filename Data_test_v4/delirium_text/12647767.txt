12647767|t|RT and non-RT methodology for semantic priming research with Alzheimer's disease patients: a critical review.
12647767|a|This paper provides a critical review of RT and non-RT methodology for the conduct of research on semantic priming in Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to elderly normal (EN) individuals. The review is organized by type of semantic priming (or attribute-knowledge) paradigm. Theoretical as well as methodological issues are highlighted insofar as they are relevant to: (1) the design, conduct, and analysis of semantic priming experiments (and closely related types of experiments) with AD compared to EN participants, and (2) the interpretation of findings from these experiments. Recommendations are provided for further research involving semantic priming and related paradigms with AD and certain other neuropsychological populations.
