27031475|t|Aquaporin-4 and Alzheimer's Disease.
27031475|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Although the pathogenesis of AD remains unclear, AD is thought to result from an imbalance in the production and clearance of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta). Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is the major aquaporin in the mammalian brain, is mostly expressed on astrocytic endfeet, and functions as a water transporter. However, the distribution and expression of AQP4 are altered in both AD clinical populations and animal models. Recent studies have revealed that AQP4 is important to the clearance of Abeta in brain via lymphatic clearance, transcytotic delivery, and glial degradation, as well as to the synaptic function. Thus, AQP4 likely plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Further studies would provide new targets for prevention, ultimately leading to improved treatment options for AD.
