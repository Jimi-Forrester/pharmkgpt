11161635|t|Association between Alzheimer's disease and a functional polymorphism in the Myeloperoxidase gene.
11161635|a|A polymorphism in the Myeloperoxidase gene (MPO) has previously been demonstrated to be associated with gender-specific risk in an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) autopsy sample. We have investigated this polymorphism in our own samples of 226 Caucasian cases and 166 controls and 59 Hispanic cases and 75 controls. In Caucasians we find a significant association between MPO genotype and AD (P = 0.03), although we do not observe any effects of gender or any interaction with the APOE gene. Specifically, the MPO GG genotype contributes a 1.57-fold increased risk for AD. In Hispanics there was no effect of MPO genotype, or of MPO genotype in interaction with age or gender, on diagnosis of AD.
