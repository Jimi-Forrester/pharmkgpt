38555465|a|Recent studies have increasingly highlighted the aberrant expression of SLC16A1-AS1 in a variety of tumor types, where it functions as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor in the pathogenesis of different cancers. The expression levels of SLC16A1-AS1 have been found to significantly correlate with clinical features and the prognosis of cancer patients. Furthermore, SLC16A1-AS1 modulates a range of cellular functions, including proliferation, migration, and invasion, through its interactions with diverse molecules and signaling pathways. This review examines the latest evidence regarding the role of SLC16A1-AS1 in the progression of various tumors and explores its potential clinical applications as a novel prognostic and diagnostic biomarker. Our comprehensive review aims to deepen the understanding of SLC16A1-AS1's multifaceted role in oncology, underscoring its potential as a significant biomarker and therapeutic target.
