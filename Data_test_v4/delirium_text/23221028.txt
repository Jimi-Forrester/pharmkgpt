23221028|a|This study examined the short-, mid-, and long-term effects of a motor and multisensory care-based approach on (i) the behavior of institutionalized residents with dementia and (ii) care practices according to staff perspective. In all, 6 residents with moderate to severe dementia (mean age 80.83 +- 10.87 years) and 6 staff members (40 +- 10.87 years old) were recruited. Motor and multisensory stimulation strategies were implemented in residents' morning care. Data were collected with video recordings and focus-group interviews before, immediately after, at 3 months and 6 months after the intervention. The frequency and duration of each resident's behavior were analyzed. Content analysis was also performed. Results showed short-term improvements in residents' communication and engagement, followed by a sustained decline over time. Staff reported to change their practices; however, difficulties related to the institution organization were identified. There is a need to implement long-term strategies and involve institutions at different organizational levels to sustain the results.
