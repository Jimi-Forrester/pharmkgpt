36471454|t|Immunomodulatory biomaterials for implant-associated infections: from conventional to advanced therapeutic strategies.
36471454|a|Implant-associated infection (IAI) is increasingly emerging as a serious threat with the massive application of biomaterials. Bacteria attached to the surface of implants are often difficult to remove and exhibit high resistance to bactericides. In the quest for novel antimicrobial strategies, conventional antimicrobial materials often fail to exert their function because they tend to focus on direct bactericidal activity while neglecting the modulation of immune systems. The inflammatory response induced by host immune cells was thought to be a detrimental force impeding wound healing. However, the immune system has recently received increasing attention as a vital player in the host's defense against infection. Anti-infective strategies based on the modulation of host immune defenses are emerging as a field of interest. This review explains the importance of the immune system in combating infections and describes current advanced immune-enhanced anti-infection strategies. First, the characteristics of traditional/conventional implant biomaterials and the reasons for the difficulty of bacterial clearance in IAI were reviewed. Second, the importance of immune cells in the battle against bacteria is elucidated. Then, we discuss how to design biomaterials that activate the defense function of immune cells to enhance the antimicrobial potential. Based on the key premise of restoring proper host-protective immunity, varying advanced immune-enhanced antimicrobial strategies were discussed. Finally, current issues and perspectives in this field were offered. This review will provide scientific guidance to enhance the development of advanced anti-infective biomaterials.
