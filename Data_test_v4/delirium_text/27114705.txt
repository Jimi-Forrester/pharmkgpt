27114705|a|OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of treatment with inhaled drugs on changes in mood, focusing on depression and anxiety during treatment in patients with newly diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: We prospectively selected new COPD patients from three Seoul National Hospitals. Participants underwent face-to-face interviews to evaluate clinical characteristics and drug use, and completed questionnaires using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at the start of the project, the 4th week, and the 12th week. We compared changes in HADS scores both between inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) users and non-ICS/LABA users, as well as between long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) users and non-LAMA users. The general linear mixed model was applied for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Ninety new COPD patients participated in the study. Of these 90 patients, 84 completed face-to-face interviews. In the univariate analysis, those who were treated by ICS/LABA or LAMA showed a significant increase in HADS-A at the 4-week evaluation (0.73+-2.56, P=0.038), but the statistical significance was lost in the multivariable analysis. No significant difference was found in the change in HADS scores between ICS/LABA users and non-ICS/LABA users, or between LAMA users and non-LAMA users in multivariate general linear mixed model analyses. CONCLUSION: In this prospective observational study, we found no significant effects of inhaled treatment on mood problems among new COPD patients. Further research should be conducted to identify the association between anxiety and depression and inhaled drugs for COPD treatment.
