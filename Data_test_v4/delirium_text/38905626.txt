38905626|t|User Requirements and Perceptions of a Sensor System for Early Stress Detection in People With Dementia and People With Intellectual Disability: Qualitative Study.
38905626|a|BACKGROUND: Timely detection of stress in people with dementia and people with an intellectual disability (ID) may reduce the occurrence of challenging behavior. However, detecting stress is often challenging as many long-term care (LTC) residents with dementia and residents with ID have communication impairments, limiting their ability to express themselves. Wearables can help detect stress but are not always accepted by users and are uncomfortable to wear for longer periods. Integrating sensors into clothing may be a more acceptable approach for users in LTC. To develop a sensor system for early stress detection that is accepted by LTC residents with dementia and residents with ID, understanding their perceptions and requirements is essential. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) identify user requirements for a garment-integrated sensor system (wearable) for early stress detection in people with dementia and people with ID, (2) explore the perceptions of the users toward the sensor system, and (3) investigate the implementation requirements in LTC settings. METHODS: A qualitative design with 18 focus groups and 29 interviews was used. Focus groups and interviews were conducted per setting (dementia, ID) and target group (people with dementia, people with ID, family caregivers, health care professionals). The focus groups were conducted at 3 time points within a 6-month period, where each new focus group built on the findings of previous rounds. The data from each round were used to (further) develop the sensor system. A thematic analysis with an inductive approach was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The study included 44 participants who expressed a positive attitude toward the idea of a garment-integrated sensor system but also identified some potential concerns. In addition to early stress detection, participants recognized other potential purposes or benefits of the sensor system, such as identifying triggers for challenging behavior, evaluating intervention effects, and diagnostic purposes. Participants emphasized the importance of meeting specific system requirements, such as washability and safety, and user requirements, such as customizability and usability, to increase user acceptance. Moreover, some participants were concerned the sensor system could contribute to the replacement of human contact by technology. Important factors for implementation included the cost of the sensor system, added value to resident and health care professionals, and education for all users. CONCLUSIONS: The idea of a garment-integrated sensor system for early stress detection in LTC for people with dementia and people with ID is perceived as positive and promising by stakeholders. To increase acceptability and implementation success, it is important to develop an easy-to-use, customizable wearable that has a clear and demonstrable added value for health care professionals and LTC residents. The next step involves pilot-testing the developed wearable with LTC residents with dementia and residents with ID in clinical practice.
