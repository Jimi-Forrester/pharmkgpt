34776445|t|Longitudinally Increasing Elevated Asymmetric Flortaucipir Binding in a Cognitively Unimpaired Amyloid-Negative Older Individual.
34776445|a|We present the case of a cognitively unimpaired 77-year-old man with elevated, asymmetric, and longitudinally increasing Flortaucipir tau PET despite normal (visually negative) amyloid PET. His atypical tau PET signal persisted and globally increased in a follow-up scan five years later. Across eight years of observations, temporoparietal atrophy was observed consistent with tau PET patterns, but he retained the cognitively unimpaired classification. Altogether, his atypical tau PET signal is not explained by any known risk factors or alternative pathologies, and other imaging findings were not remarkable. He remains enrolled for further observation.
