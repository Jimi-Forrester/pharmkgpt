11149699|t|Non-Alzheimer dementias.
11149699|a|The past decade has seen a considerable resurgence of interest in non-Alzheimer forms of neurodegenerative dementia. Advances in our understanding and classification of these conditions have taken place over a diverse range of disciplines: from genetics and immunohistochemistry to neuropsychology and psychiatry. The aim of this article is to review, from a clinician's perspective, our current understanding of the major degenerative dementias that fall into the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The clinical variants of frontotemporal dementia (semantic dementia, progressive nonfluent aphasia, and dementia of a frontal type), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis associated dementia, corticobasal degeneration, and dementia with Lewy bodies are considered.
