19163481|t|Motion analysis in delirium: a wavelet based approach for sub classification.
19163481|a|The usefulness of motor subtypes of delirium is unclear due to inconsistency in sub-typing methods and a lack of validation with objective measures of motor activity levels. Patients were studied with hyperactive, hypoactive, and mixed presentations of delirium. The patient's activity was determined with 24 hour accelerometer-based monitoring and a continuous wavelet transform was applied with a wavelet deemed suitable to distinguish between these motor presentations. The procedures were well tolerated and motor presentations were readily distinguished using the accelerometry-based measurements.
