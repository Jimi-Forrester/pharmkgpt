31062835|t|Advancing Alzheimer's Disease Treatment: Lessons from CTAD 2018.
31062835|a|The 2018 Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) conference showcased recent successes and failures in trials of Alzheimer's disease treatments. More importantly, the conference provided opportunities for investigators to share what they have learned from those studies with the goal of designing future trials with a greater likelihood of success. Data from studies of novel and non-amyloid treatment approaches were also shared, including neuroprotective and regenerative strategies and those that target neuroinflammation and synaptic function. New tools to improve the efficiency and productivity of clinical trials were described, including biomarkers and machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.
