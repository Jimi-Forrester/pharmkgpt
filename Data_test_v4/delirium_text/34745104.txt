34745104|t|Evaluation of the Molecular Mechanisms of Sepsis Using Proteomics.
34745104|a|Sepsis is a complex syndrome promoted by pathogenic and host factors; it is characterized by dysregulated host responses and multiple organ dysfunction, which can lead to death. However, its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Proteomics, as a biotechnology research area in the post-genomic era, paves the way for large-scale protein characterization. With the rapid development of proteomics technology, various approaches can be used to monitor proteome changes and identify differentially expressed proteins in sepsis, which may help to understand the pathophysiological process of sepsis. Although previous reports have summarized proteomics-related data on the diagnosis of sepsis and sepsis-related biomarkers, the present review aims to comprehensively summarize the available literature concerning "sepsis", "proteomics", "cecal ligation and puncture", "lipopolysaccharide", and "post-translational modifications" in relation to proteomics research to provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of sepsis.
