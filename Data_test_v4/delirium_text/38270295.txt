38270295|t|Interaction between long noncoding RNA and microRNA in lung inflammatory diseases.
38270295|a|BACKGROUND: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a group of RNAs that cannot synthesize proteins, but are critical in gene expression regulation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), the two major family members, are intimately involved in controlling immune response, cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and polarization, and cytokine secretion. Their interactions significantly influence lung inflammatory diseases and could be potential therapeutic targets. OBJECTIVES: The review aims to elucidate the role of ncRNAs, especially the interactions between lncRNA and miRNA in lung diseases, including acute and chronic lung inflammatory diseases, as well as lung cancer. And provide novel insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic methods. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive review of the latest studies on lncRNA and miRNA in lung inflammatory diseases. Our research involved searching through electronic databases like PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. RESULTS: We explain the fundamental characteristics and functions of miRNA and lncRNA, their potential interaction mechanisms, and summarize the newly explorations on the role of lncRNA and miRNA interactions in lung inflammatory diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous lncRNAs and miRNAs have been found to partipicate in all stages of lung inflammatory diseases. While ncRNA-based therapies have been validated and developed, there remain challenges in developing more stable and effective drugs for clinical use.
