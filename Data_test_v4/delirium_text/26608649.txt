26608649|a|BACKGROUND: The prevalence and burden of atherosclerotic (AS) diseases are increasing during the last twenty years. Some studies show a close relationship between overweight and AS, but influence on AS diseases of different weight loss methods are still studying. The purpose of the research was to study the effectiveness of a weight loss program in AS patients in randomized controlled trial, and to develop a conception of evolution of AS. METHODS: A randomized controlled prospective clinical trial including 97 people, from them 71 patients with various AS manifestations. Patients were divided in 2 subgroups for non-drug weight loss program, and conventional drug therapy. The weight loss program included calorie restriction with 100-150 kcal/day, fat-free vegetables, salt diet, and optimum physical activity. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows version 17.0. RESULTS: The weight loss subgroup lost ranging between 7-20% from an initial weight (P = 0.016). Weight loss was achieved due to fatty mass reduction only (P = 0.005). Hemoglobin levels (P < 0.001), bone mineral density (P < 0.001), percentages of water (P = 0.006) and muscle masses (P = 0.0038) were increased in weight loss subgroup. Ejection fraction (P < 0.0001), systolic output (P < 0.0001) were increased in patients with coronary artery disease. The weight loss program led to a decrease in symptomatic drugs doses up to total abolition. A conception of AS was developed. CONCLUSIONS: The weight loss program treated the AS diseases; improved laboratory and instrumental parameters, decreased symptomatic drugs doses. AS development is a logical way of ontogenetic ageing of body fat. TRIAL INTERNATIONAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01700075. TRIAL NATIONAL REGISTRATION: State registration is # 0109RK000079, code is O.0475 at the National Center for Scientific and Technical Information of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
