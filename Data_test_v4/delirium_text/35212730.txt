35212730|t|Improving delirium screening and recognition in UK hospitals: results of a multi-centre quality improvement project.
35212730|a|BACKGROUND: delirium is an acute severe neuropsychiatric condition associated with adverse outcomes, particularly in older adults. However, it is frequently under-recognised. METHODS: this multi-centre quality improvement project utilised a collaborative approach to implementation of changes at sites, with the aim to improve delirium screening, recognition and documentation on discharge summaries. Resources, including delirium guidelines and presentations, were shared between sites, and broad details of local interventions were collected. Three timepoints of data collection (14 March 2018, 14 September 2018 and 13 March 2019) were conducted to assess screening, recognition and documentation of delirium in unscheduled admissions of adults aged >=65 years old. The impact of local interventions and site-specific factors was assessed using logistic regression analysis, adjusting for patient factors. RESULTS: a total of 3,013 patients (mean age 80.2, 53.8% females) were recruited across the three timepoints. Screening for delirium was associated with increased odds of recognition (aOR 4.75, CI 2.98-7.56; P < 0.001); this was not affected by grade/profession of screener. Rates of screening, recognition and discharge documentation improved across the three timepoints of data collection. The presence of a local delirium specialist team was associated with increased rates of screening for delirium (aOR 1.75, CI 1.41-2.18; P < 0.001), and the presence of a geriatric medicine team embedded into the admissions unit was associated with increased recognition rates (aOR 1.78, CI 1.09-2.92; P = 0.022). CONCLUSION: delirium screening is associated with improved recognition. Interventions that strive to improve screening within a culture of delirium awareness are encouraged.
