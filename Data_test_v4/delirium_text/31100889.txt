31100889|t|APOE Variant (rs405509) might Modulate the Effect of Sex and Educational Level on Cognitive Impairment Risk in a Taiwanese Population.
31100889|a|Education, sex, and the APOE-rs405509 variant are associated with Alzheimer's disease and cognitive performance. We investigated if the rs405509 TT, TG, and GG genotypes modulate the effect of sex and education on cognitive impairment in Taiwanese adults. Data on cognitive health (defined by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores) and rs405509 were from Taiwan Biobank. Participants included 2105 men and 2027 women with a mean age of 64 years. Education below university level was significantly associated with lower MMSE scores. The odds ratios (ORs) were 1.82; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38-2.41 for senior high school, 3.39; 95% CI 2.50-4.59 for junior high school, and 11.94; 95% CI 9.91-15.50 for elementary school and below (p-trend < 0.05). The association between MMSE score and sex was significant only in the lowest educational group (elementary and below), with lower odds of having a low MMSE score in men compared to women (OR = 0.51; 95% CI 0.34-0.77). After stratification by rs405509 genotypes, this association was significant only among TT genotype carriers (OR = 0.481; CI = 0.253-0.915). In conclusion, a significant association between MMSE score and sex was observed in the lowest educational group, especially among carriers of rs405509 TT genotypes.
