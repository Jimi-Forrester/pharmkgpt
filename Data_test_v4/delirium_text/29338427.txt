29338427|a|INTRODUCTION: The blood brain barrier is a functional barrier allowing the entry into the brain of only essential nutrients, excluding other molecules. Its structure, although essential to keep the harmful entities out, is also a major roadblock for pharmacological treatment of brain diseases. Several alternative invasive drug delivery approaches, such as transcranial drug delivery and disruption of blood brain barrier have been explored, with limited success and several challenges. Intranasal delivery is a non-invasive methodology, which bypasses the systemic circulation, and, through the intra- and extra- neuronal pathways, provides direct brain drug delivery. Colloidal drug delivery systems, particularly lipidic nanoparticles offer several unique advantages for this goal. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on key brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and provide a detailed overview of the current lipid nanoparticle based treatment options explored thus far. The review also delves into basic preparation, challenges and evaluation methods of lipid drug delivery systems. EXPERT OPINION: Brain diseases present complex pathophysiology, in addition to the practically inaccessible brain tissues, hence according to the authors, a two-pronged approach utilizing new target discovery coupled with new drug delivery systems such as lipid carriers must be adopted.
