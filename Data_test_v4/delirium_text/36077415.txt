36077415|t|A Therapeutic Perspective of HDAC8 in Different Diseases: An Overview of Selective Inhibitors.
36077415|a|Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are epigenetic enzymes which participate in transcriptional repression and chromatin condensation mechanisms by removing the acetyl moiety from acetylated epsilon-amino group of histone lysines and other non-histone proteins. In recent years, HDAC8, a class I HDAC, has emerged as a promising target for different disorders, including X-linked intellectual disability, fibrotic diseases, cancer, and various neuropathological conditions. Selective HDAC8 targeting is required to limit side effects deriving from the treatment with pan-HDAC inhibitors (HDACis); thus, many endeavours have focused on the development of selective HDAC8is. In addition, polypharmacological approaches have been explored to achieve a synergistic action on multi-factorial diseases or to enhance the drug efficacy. In this frame, proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) might be regarded as a dual-targeting approach for attaining HDAC8 proteasomal degradation. This review highlights the most relevant and recent advances relative to HDAC8 validation in various diseases, providing a snapshot of the current selective HDAC8is, with a focus on polyfunctional modulators.
