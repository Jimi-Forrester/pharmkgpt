38265164|t|Mapping racial and ethnic healthcare disparities for persons living with dementia: A scoping review.
38265164|a|INTRODUCTION: We set out to map evidence of disparities in Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias healthcare, including issues of access, quality, and outcomes for racial/ethnic minoritized persons living with dementia (PLWD) and family caregivers. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of the literature published from 2000 to 2022 in PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. The inclusion criteria were: (1) focused on PLWD and/or family caregivers, (2) examined disparities or differences in healthcare, (3) were conducted in the United States, (4) compared two or more racial/ethnic groups, and (5) reported quantitative or qualitative findings. RESULTS: Key findings include accumulating evidence that minoritized populations are less likely to receive an accurate and timely diagnosis, be prescribed anti-dementia medications, and use hospice care, and more likely to have a higher risk of hospitalization and receive more aggressive life-sustaining treatment at the end-of-life. DISCUSSION: Future studies need to examine underlying processes and develop interventions to reduce disparities while also being more broadly inclusive of diverse populations.
