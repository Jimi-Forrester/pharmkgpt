19091287|a|Pituitary apoplexy indicates pituitary adenoma hemorrhage, which could result in acute pituitary insufficiency and mortality. The typical symptoms are headache, visual disturbance, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, and panhypopituitarism. However, cortisol-induced hyperglycemia and acute delirium could be an initial presentation of a pituitary adenoma hemorrhage with stormy release of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone. A 28-year-old woman presented with severe vomiting, irritable state, and delusion. She had medical history of irregular menstrual cycles and marked body weight gain after her second childbirth 8 years ago. She was diagnosed of diabetic ketoacidosis 2 days before this visiting at local medical department. On physical examination, Cushing appearance without definite neurological deficit was disclosed. Further blood tests revealed high blood sugar, cortisol, and adrenocorticotrophic hormone levels without evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis. The brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed pituitary macroadenoma and pituitary hemorrhage. Cushing disease with pituitary apoplexy was then diagnosed. Conservative management with delayed neurosurgery was applied. The patient became clear with normalized cortisol and blood sugar levels soon after. Follow-up computed tomography scan of the brain revealed no progression of tumor bleeding or mass effect. To our knowledge, pituitary apoplexy associated with cortisol-induced hyperglycemia and acute delirium has never been reported before. This case reminds us of pituitary apoplexy and its rare manifestations.
