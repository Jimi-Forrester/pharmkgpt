The aim of the study was to map the trajectory of cognitive recovery during the first week to 90-days post-stroke using serial computerised assessment. METHOD: An observational cohort study recruited consecutive stroke patients admitted to a stroke unit within 48 hours of onset. Cognitive function was assessed using the computerised Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) daily for seven days, then 14, 30 and 90 days post-stroke. The CANTAB measured visual episodic memory and learning, information processing speed, visuo-spatial working memory, complex sustained attention and mental flexibility. Repeated measures MANOVA/ANOVA with Least Squares Difference post-hoc analyses were performed to ascertain significant change over time. RESULT: Forty-eight participants, mean age 73, primarily mild, ischaemic stroke, completed all assessment timepoints. There was a trajectory of early, global cognitive improvement, indicative of a post-stroke delirium, that largely stabilised between 6 and 14-days post-stroke. Change over time was examined within each cognitive test, with one measure stabilising by day 6 (Reaction Time) and others detecting improving performances up to 14 days post-stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Serial, computerised cognitive assessment can effectively map post-stroke cognitive recovery and revealed an early phase of global improvement over 14 days that is evidence for an acute post-stroke delirium. Resolution of post-stroke delirium in the second week following mild stroke indicates more extensive neuropsychological testing may be undertaken earlier than previously thought.
