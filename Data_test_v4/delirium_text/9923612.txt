9923612|a|The human amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) is a member of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene family. The human APLP2 ectodomain (sAPLP2) was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and the recombinant sAPLP2 was purified from the culture medium in a single step by metal-chelating Sepharose chromatography. The neuritotrophic activity of APLP2 was compared to the APP isoforms sAPP695 and sAPP751 on chick sympathetic neurones. APLP2 had neurite outgrowth-promoting activity similar to that of the APP isoforms. This suggests that APP and APLP2 have a similar or related role and supports the idea of a redundancy in function between the APP-gene family proteins.
