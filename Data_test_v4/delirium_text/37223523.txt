37223523|a|There are many complex eye diseases which are the leading causes of blindness, however, the pathogenesis of the complex eye diseases is not fully understood, especially the underlying molecular mechanisms of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation in the eye diseases have not been extensive clarified. Our review summarizes the latest advances in the studies of m6A modification in the pathogenesis of the complex eye diseases, including cornea disease, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, Graves' disease, uveal melanoma, retinoblastoma, and traumatic optic neuropathy. We further discuss the possibility of developing m6A modification signatures as biomarkers for the diagnosis of the eye diseases, as well as potential therapeutic approaches.
