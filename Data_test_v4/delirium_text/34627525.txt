34627525|a|How to sensitively detect early biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is nowadays, one of the major challenges. In this work, Abeta oligomers (AbetaO), one of the AD biomarkers, was analyzed using an electrochemical aptasensor, which was prepared based on thionine (Th) - functionalized three - dimensional carbon nanomaterials (reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)) immobilized DNA-aptamer. Th, a positively charged planar aromatic molecule, form many pi - pi conjugated structures with rGO and MWCNTs, then improving the structural stability, electron transfer and the capacitive properties of Th-rGO-MWCNTs nanocomposites. Under the optimal conditions, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) current responses decreased with the increase of AbetaO concentration. The obtained AbetaO aptasensor presented a wide linear range of 0.0443 pM-443.00 pM and limit of detection (LOD) was 10 fM. Meanwhile, AbetaO aptasensor displayed remarkable stability and selectivity. It has a great potential for early diagnosis of AD in human real serum samples.
