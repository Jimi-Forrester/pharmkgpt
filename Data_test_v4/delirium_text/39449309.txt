39449309|t|Associations between Sleep Duration and Autonomic Nervous System Regulation in Patients with Probable Alzheimer's Disease: A Cross-Sectional Pilot Study.
39449309|a|In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationships between sleep duration and autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation. This cross-sectional pilot study included 27 older patients with probable Alzheimer's disease who were hospitalized at a psychiatric center. We measured heart rate variability to assess ANS regulation at night, evaluated dementia severity via the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, and obtained sleep duration data from sleep diaries maintained by psychiatric nurses. The data were analyzed using repeated-measures generalized linear models with age, sex, dementia severity, hypertension status, and medication use (antipsychotics) as covariates. A sleep duration of 6-9 h per night compared to shorter than 6 h was associated with a greater increase in parasympathetic nervous system activity (p = 0.03), and a sleep duration longer than 9 h was associated with a decrease sympathovagal balance (p = 0.02). In addition, we observed an inverted U-shaped association between sleep duration and ANS regulation. In this pilot study, we demonstrated that a sleep duration of 6-9 h per night may be beneficial for ANS regulation; however, the present study involved only a few participants and had some limitations. Additional research with a larger cohort is needed to confirm these findings.
