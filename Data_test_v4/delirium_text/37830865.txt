37830865|t|The importance of a comprehensive geriatric assessment for older people admitted onto a virtual ward.
37830865|a|A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) provides a holistic assessment for the frail and older person. The CGA considers physical and mental conditions as well as function, environmental and a person's social circumstances. Virtual wards are a new concept within the NHS, and use of virtual wards during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced hospital admissions by 50%. The British Geriatrics Society has set clear guidelines on how virtual wards should be developed within integrated care services via multidisciplinary community rapid response teams to improve patient outcomes. This article considers a logical approach to assessing suitability for admission onto a virtual ward for a patient who required hospital-at-home services. It does this through the use of a theoretical patient case study, in this case involving delirium and urinary tract infection. Frailty and frailty scoring tools are discussed, as are the advantages and disadvantages of a CGA, considering a clear progression through the five domains. It shows how conducting a CGA allows for the development of a problem list to help prioritise the patient's problems and plan accordingly. A critical review of the literature around virtual wards, hospital-at-home services and admission avoidance identified that community rapid response teams were the logical choice to provide a multidisciplinary holistic approach to the older person admitted onto a virtual ward.
