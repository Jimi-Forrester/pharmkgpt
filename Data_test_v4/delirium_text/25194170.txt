25194170|a|OBJECTIVE: Thyroid dysfunction is common during pregnancy and the postpartum period and is known to cause psychiatric disturbances. A woman with Graves' disease and psychosis in the postpartum period is described. METHODS: A 22-year-old woman with Graves' disease developed fluctuating orientation, catatonia, delusions of persecution and auditory hallucinations 3 days following childbirth. RESULTS: The report discusses the clinical presentation. Treatment of both conditions led to the resolution of symptoms. CONCLUSION: Graves' disease with postpartum psychosis may present with delirium, catatonia and prominent auditory hallucinations and responds well to a combination of psychotropic and antithyroid drugs. Thyroid dysfunction should be assessed for and managed adequately in postpartum psychosis.
