32055250|a|BACKGROUND: Inflammation is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of delirium. Since delirium might reduce by anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 fatty acids. Based on this respect, a study was conducted to indicate the effect of omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention of delirium in mechanically ventilated patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. One hundred and sixty-eight mechanically ventilated patients were selected in the investigation. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either 2 g of omega-3 syrup or placebo once a day. Twice daily delirium was assessed due to Confusion Assessment Method and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. The number of days with delirium during the first 10 days of admission was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes had been included duration of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and mortality. RESULTS: Patient-days with delirium (P = 0.032), the number of ICU stay (P = 0.02), and mechanical ventilation (P = 0.042) days in omega-3 group significantly were lower than control group. Mortality was not significantly different between two groups. CONCLUSION: Omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the risk of delirium in mechanically ventilated patients.
