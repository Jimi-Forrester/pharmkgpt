39039219|a|Mild sleep deprivation is widespread in many societies worldwide. Electroencephalography (EEG) microstate analysis provides information on spatial and temporal characteristics of resting brain network, serving as an indicator of neurophysiological activities at rest. This study seeks to investigate potential neural markers in EEG following mild sleep deprivation of a single night using EEG microstate analysis. Six-minute resting EEG was conducted on thirty healthy adults within 6 hours of waking in the morning and after at least 18 h of sleep deprivation. Translated and validated Malay language Karolinska Sleepiness Scale was used to assess the participants' degree of sleepiness. Microstate characteristics analysis was conducted on the final 24 subjects based on four standard microstate maps. Microstate C shows a significant increase in mean duration, coverage and occurrence, while microstate D has significantly higher occurrence after sleep deprivation. This study demonstrates notable changes in resting state EEG microstates following mild sleep deprivation. Present findings deepen our understanding of the brain's spatiotemporal dynamics under this condition and suggest the potential utility of neural markers in this domain as components of composite markers for sleep deprivation.
