24658363|t|Evidence of a novel mechanism for partial gamma-secretase inhibition induced paradoxical increase in secreted amyloid beta protein.
24658363|a|BACE1 (beta-secretase) and alpha-secretase cleave the Alzheimer's amyloid beta protein (Abeta) precursor (APP) to C-terminal fragments of 99 aa (CTFbeta) and 83 aa (CTFalpha), respectively, which are further cleaved by gamma-secretase to eventually secrete Abeta and Aalpha (a.k.a. P3) that terminate predominantly at residues 40 and 42. A number of gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), such as N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), have been developed with the goal of reducing Abeta to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although most studies show that DAPT inhibits Abeta in a dose-dependent manner several studies have also detected a biphasic effect with an unexpected increase at low doses of DAPT in cell cultures, animal models and clinical trials. In this article, we confirm the increase in Abeta40 and Abeta42 in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells treated with low doses of DAPT and identify one of the mechanisms for this paradox. We studied the pathway by first demonstrating that stimulation of Abeta, a product of gamma-secretase, was accompanied by a parallel increase of its substrate CTFbeta, thereby demonstrating that the inhibitor was not anomalously stimulating enzyme activity at low levels. Secondly, we have demonstrated that inhibition of an Abeta degrading activity, endothelin converting enzyme (ECE), yielded more Abeta, but abolished the DAPT-induced stimulation. Finally, we have demonstrated that Aalpha, which is generated in the secretory pathway before endocytosis, is not subject to the DAPT-mediated stimulation. We therefore conclude that impairment of gamma-secretase can paradoxically increase Abeta by transiently skirting Abeta degradation in the endosome. This study adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that preserving gamma-secretase activity, rather than inhibiting it, is important for prevention of neurodegeneration.
