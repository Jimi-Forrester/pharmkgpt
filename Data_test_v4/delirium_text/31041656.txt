31041656|a|The amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, correlated with development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is produced by sequential proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. Alternative proteolytic cleavage of APP by alpha-secretase prevents formation of Abeta peptide and produces a neuroprotective protein, a soluble fragment of APPalpha (sAPPalpha). We previously generated a single-chain variable domain antibody fragment (scFv) that binds APP at the beta-secretase cleavage site and blocks cleavage of APP (iBsec1), and a second scFv which has been engineered to have alpha-secretase-like activity that increases alpha-secretase cleavage of APP (Asec1a) and showed that a bispecific antibody (Diab) combining both iBsec1 and Asec1a constructs protects mammalian cells from oxidative stress. Here, we show that the diabody is an effective therapeutic agent in a mouse model of AD. An apolipoprotein B (ApoB) binding domain peptide was genetically added to the diabody to facilitate transfer across the blood-brain barrier, and a recombinant human adeno-associated virus 2/8 (rAAV2/8) was used as a vector to express the gene constructs in a APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. The diabody increased levels of sAPPalpha, decreased Abeta deposits and levels of oligomeric Abeta, increased neuronal health as indicated by MAP2 and synaptophysin staining, increased hippocampal neurogenesis, and most importantly dramatically increased survival rates compared with untreated mice or mice treated only with the beta-secretase inhibitor. These results indicate that altering APP processing to inhibit beta-site activity while simultaneously promoting alpha-secretase processing provides substantially increased neuronal benefits compared with inhibition of beta-secretase processing alone and represents a promising new therapeutic approach for treating AD.
