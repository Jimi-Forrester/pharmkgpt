8097661|a|Cognitive and histological alterations in human Alzheimer's disease (AD) are correlated with selective neuronal loss in nucleus basalis of Meynert. In search of an animal model of AD-linked neurochemical deficits, we examined the effects of short- (2 weeks) and long- (3 and 6 months) term lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) on somatostatinergic parameters in rat forebrain. NBM lesions were performed by unilateral injection of ibotenic acid into the NBM. Cortical choline-acetyl transferase (ChAT) activity and acetylcholinesterase staining in the NBM remained significantly decreased ipsi- as compared to contralaterally up to 6 months after the placement of the lesion. Somatostatin (SRIF) content was increased by 120% in the ipsilateral frontal cortex 6 months post-lesion but not at shorter time intervals. Levels of neuropeptide Y (which is extensively co-localized with SRIF in the forebrain) were not significantly altered after unilateral NBM lesions at any time point. A 30% decrease in SRIF binding capacity as well as a marked reduction of SRIF inhibition of adenylate cyclase, indicative of a loss of functional SRIF receptors, was observed in ipsilateral versus contralateral frontal cortex on brain tissue homogenates after short-term unilateral NBM lesion. By film radioautography, the loss in SRIF binding sites was localized to both superficial and deep layers of the frontal cortex. This loss persisted up to 3 months but was no longer apparent after 6 months due to a decrease in SRIF binding capacity on the contralateral side.
