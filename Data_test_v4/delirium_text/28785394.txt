28785394|a|In the present case report, the comprehensive management of a bilateral mandibular fracture in a single-humped camel including pre-, peri- and post-operative cares is described. A one-year-old camel with the overhanging of the rostral part of the lower jaw which occurred seven days ago was presented. After clinical and radiographic examinations, a bilateral mandibular fracture at the caudal part of canine teeth was diagnosed. It was decided to repair the fracture surgically under general anesthesia. The camel was restrained in sitting position and was remained in this position during anesthesia and surgery period. After premedication with acepromazine (0.10 mg kg-1) and xylazine (0.20 mg kg-1) intramuscularly, anesthesia was induced using ketamine and diazepam intravenously (2.00 and 0.10 mg kg-1, respectively). Maintenance of anesthesia was performed by repeated doses of xylazine and ketamine intravenously (0.10 and 1.00 mg kg-1, respectively) as needed. After preparation of the oral cavity, the fracture was reduced and an interfragmentary wire and an interdental wire (1.00 mm diameter size) were applied on each side of the mandible for the fixation of fracture segments. After two months, the interdental wires were removed while the interfragmentary wires were left intact. Follow up the camel three months after surgery, showed the full ability of prehension and chewing of roughages by the camel.
