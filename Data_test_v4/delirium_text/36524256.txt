36524256|t|Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis mimicking herpetic encephalomyelitis in a liver transplant patient with anti-GQ1b antibodies.
36524256|a|A woman in her late 70s with a history of liver transplant presented with ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, areflexia, positive Babinski's sign and reduced consciousness. This followed an antecedent illness in the form of a herpes zoster infection. MRI of the brain/spinal cord, cerebrospinal fluid analysis with viral PCR and routine blood tests were normal, and tacrolimus neurotoxicity was ruled out. Serum anti-GQ1b antibodies were positive. A diagnosis of Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis was made, forming part of the continuum that involves Miller-Fisher syndrome, entitled the 'anti-GQ1b syndrome'. Complete recovery ensued without intravenous immunoglobulins or plasma exchange. The role of monitoring anti-ganglioside pattern change to predict or confirm disease recurrence and disease severity is further discussed.
