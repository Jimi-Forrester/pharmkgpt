37913831|t|Associations of olfactory function with brain structural and functional outcomes. A systematic review.
37913831|a|In aging, olfactory deficits have been associated with lower cognition and motor function. Olfactory dysfunction is also one of the earliest features of neurodegenerative disease. A comprehensive review of the neural correlates of olfactive function may reveal mechanisms underlying the associations among olfaction, cognition, motor function, and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we summarize existing knowledge on the relationship between brain structural and functional measures and olfaction in older adults without and with cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's disease. We identified 33 eligible studies (30 MRI/DTI,3 fMRI); 31 were cross-sectional, most assessed odor identification, and few examined multiple brain areas. Lower olfactory function was associated with smaller volumes in the temporal lobe (hippocampus,parahippocampal gyrus,fusiform gyrus), olfactory-related regions (piriform cortex,amygdala,entorhinal cortex), pre- and postcentral gyri, and globus pallidus. During aging, olfactory impairment may be associated with pathology in brain areas important for motor function and cognition, especially memory. Future longitudinal studies that include neuroimaging across different brain areas are warranted to determine the neurobiological changes underlying olfactory changes in the aging brain and the progression of neurodegeneration.
