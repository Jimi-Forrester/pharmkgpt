31467325|a|Misfolding of Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides leads to the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques. Molecular chaperones can facilitate the refolding or degradation of such misfolded proteins. Here, for the first time, we report the unique ability of Lipocalin-type Prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) protein to act as a disaggregase on the pre-formed fibrils of Abeta(1-40), abbreviated as Abeta40, and Abeta(25-35) peptides, in addition to inhibiting the aggregation of Abeta monomers. Furthermore, our proteomics results indicate that L-PGDS can facilitate extraction of several other proteins from the insoluble aggregates extracted from the brain of an Alzheimer's disease patient. In this study, we have established the mode of binding of L-PGDS with monomeric and fibrillar Abeta using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy, Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Our results confirm a direct interaction between L-PGDS and monomeric Abeta40 and Abeta(25-35), thereby inhibiting their spontaneous aggregation. The monomeric unstructured Abeta40 binds to L-PGDS via its C-terminus, while the N-terminus remains free which is observed as a new domain in the L-PGDS-Abeta40 complex model.
