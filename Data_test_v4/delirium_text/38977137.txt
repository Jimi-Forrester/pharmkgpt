38977137|t|Proteome-wide analysis identifies plasma immune regulators of amyloid-beta progression.
38977137|a|While immune function is known to play a mechanistic role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), whether immune proteins in peripheral circulation influence the rate of amyloid-beta (Abeta) progression - a central feature of AD - remains unknown. In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, we quantified 942 immunological proteins in plasma and identified 32 (including CAT [catalase], CD36 [CD36 antigen], and KRT19 [keratin 19]) associated with rates of cortical Abeta accumulation measured with positron emission tomography (PET). Longitudinal changes in a subset of candidate proteins also predicted Abeta progression, and the mid- to late-life (20-year) trajectory of one protein, CAT, was associated with late-life Abeta-positive status in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Genetic variation that influenced plasma levels of CAT, CD36 and KRT19 predicted rates of Abeta accumulation, including causal relationships with Abeta PET levels identified with two-sample Mendelian randomization. In addition to associations with tau PET and plasma AD biomarker changes, as well as expression patterns in human microglia subtypes and neurovascular cells in AD brain tissue, we showed that 31 % of candidate proteins were related to mid-life (20-year) or late-life (8-year) dementia risk in ARIC. Our findings reveal plasma proteins associated with longitudinal Abeta accumulation, and identify specific peripheral immune mediators that may contribute to the progression of AD pathophysiology.
