29353101|a|The objective of this study was to determine the cognitive and functional decline and development of brain injury in individuals progressing from preclinical (beta-amyloid positive cognitively normal) to prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) (beta-amyloid positive mild cognitive impairment [MCI]), and compare this with individuals who progress to MCI in the absence of significant amyloid pathology. Seventy-five cognitively healthy participants who progressed to MCI were followed for 4 years on average and up to 10 years. We tested effects of beta-amyloid (Abeta) on measures of cognition, functional status, depressive symptoms, and brain structure and metabolism. Preclinical AD subjects showed greater cognitive decline in multiple domains and increased cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau levels at baseline while Abeta-negative progressors showed increased rates of white matter hyperintensity accumulation and had a greater frequency of depressive symptoms at baseline. Abeta status did not influence patterns of brain atrophy, but preclinical AD subjects showed greater decline of brain metabolism than Abeta-negative progressors. Several unique features separate the transition from preclinical to prodromal AD from other causes of cognitive decline. These features may facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of AD, especially in clinical trials aimed at halting the progression from preclinical to prodromal AD.
