24150103|t|Clinical profile of Alzheimer's disease: is the age of the patient a decisive factor? Results of the INFLUENCE study.
24150103|a|Epidemiological and clinical studies suggest that dementia patients aged >= 85 years are biologically different from those aged 65-84. This study aimed to assess whether patients (>85 years) have a distinct sociodemographic and clinical profile. Older patients had lower educational achievements, different carer relationships, and were more likely to take memantine/concomitant treatments and be institutionalized. Differences were observed with respect to concomitant disease/other risk factors (depression, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hypertension). Oldest patients had greater impairment (more severe Global Deterioration Scale stage, lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores). Greater concomitant drug use and younger carers associated with older patients suggest higher management and social costs.
