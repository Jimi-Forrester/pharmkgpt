39843233|a|Accumulation of astrocytes around beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques is one of the earliest neuropathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms and significance remain unclear. Cell adhesion molecule protocadherin-gammaC5 (Pcdh-gammaC5) has been reported to implicate in AD. Here we find elevated expression level of Pcdh-gammaC5 in the brain of 5xFAD mice and Abeta-treated astrocytes, and further reveal that Pcdh-gammaC5 deficiency leads to exacerbated Abeta deposition in 5xFAD mice. Deletion of Pcdh-gammaC5 impairs astrocyte migration, astrocytic response to Abeta signaling and Abeta phagocytosis in both cultured astrocytes in vitro and 5xFAD mice in vivo. Both male and female mice were used in this study. Our findings support a model in which increased expression level of Pcdh-gammaC5 promotes astrocyte migration in response to Abeta signaling, engulf and phagocytose neurotoxic Abeta plaques, therefore exerting a critical neuroprotective function in AD.Significance Statement Astrocytes play a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis. Recent evidence identified Pcdh-gammaC5 as a potential early-stage biomarker in the CSF of AD patients. Here by using Pcdhgc5 gene knockout astrocytes, we unravel the essential function of Pcdh-gammaC5 in promoting astrocyte migration and Abeta phagocytosis via PI3K-Akt-actin signaling pathway. By crossing Pcdhgc5 knockout mice and 5xFAD mice, or down regulating astrocytic Pcdh-gammaC5 expression with shRNA, we demonstrate the neuroprotective role of Pcdh-gammaC5 in ameliorating Abeta plaque pathogenesis by regulating astrocyte activity. Our investigation provides new clues in clarifying the underlying mechanisms of AD pathogenesis, especially the critical role of astrocytes in AD.
