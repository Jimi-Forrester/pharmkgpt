36816561|t|Are GABAergic drugs beneficial in providing neuroprotection after traumatic brain injuries? A comprehensive literature review of preclinical studies.
36816561|a|Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) caused by physical impact to the brain can adversely impact the welfare and well-being of the affected individuals. One of the leading causes of mortality and dysfunction in the world, TBI is a major public health problem facing the human community. Drugs that target GABAergic neurotransmission are commonly used for sedation in clinical TBI yet their potential to cause neuroprotection is unclear. In this paper, I have performed a rigorous literature review of the neuroprotective effects of drugs that increase GABAergic currents based on the results reported in preclinical literature. The drugs covered in this review include the following: propofol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, isoflurane, and other drugs that are agonists of GABAA receptors. A careful review of numerous preclinical studies reveals that these drugs fail to produce any neuroprotection after a primary impact to the brain. In numerous circumstances, they could be detrimental to neuroprotection by increasing the size of the contusional brain tissue and by severely interfering with behavioral and functional recovery. Therefore, anesthetic agents that work by enhancing the effect of neurotransmitter GABA should be administered with caution of TBI patients until a clear and concrete picture of their neuroprotective efficacy emerges in the clinical literature.
