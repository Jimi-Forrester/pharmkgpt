36987659|a|BACKGROUND: Using drugs to modulate microglial function may be an effective way to treat disorders, such as depression, that involve impaired neurogenesis. Akebia saponin D (ASD) can cross the blood-brain barrier and exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, so we wondered whether it might influence adult hippocampal neurogenesis to treat depression. METHODS: We exposed C57BL/6 mice to chronic mild stress (CMS) as a model of depression and then gave them ASD intraperitoneally once daily for 3 weeks. We investigated the effects of ASD on microglial phenotype, hippocampal neurogenesis, and animal behavior. The potential role of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) or BDNF-TrkB pathway in the pro-neurogenesis and anti-depressant of ASD was identified using there inhibitors GW9662 and K252a, respectively. The neurogenic effects of ASD-treated microglia were evaluated using conditioned culture methods. RESULTS: We found that CMS upregulated pro-inflammatory factors and inhibited hippocampal neurogenesis in dentate gyrus of mice, while inducing depressive-like behaviors. Dramatically, ASD (40 mg/kg) treatment reprogrammed an arginase (Arg)-1+ microglial phenotype in dentate gyrus, which increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and restored the hippocampal neurogenesis, and partially ameliorated the depressive-like behaviors of the CMS-exposed mice. K252a or neurogenesis inhibitor blocked the pro-neurogenic, anti-depressant effects of ASD. Furthermore, ASD activated PPAR-gamma in dentate gyrus of CMS mice as well as in primary microglial cultures treated with lipopolysaccharide. Blocking the PPAR-gamma using GW9962 suppressed the ASD-reprogrammed Arg-1+ microglia and BDNF expression in dentate gyrus of CMS mice. Such blockade abolished the promoted effects of ASD-treated microglia on NSPC proliferation, survival, and neurogenesis. The pro-neurogenic and anti-depressant effects of ASD were blocked by GW9962. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that ASD acts via the PPAR-gamma pathway to induce a pro-neurogenic microglia in dentate gyrus of CMS mice that can increase BDNF expression and promote NSPC proliferation, survival, and neurogenesis.
