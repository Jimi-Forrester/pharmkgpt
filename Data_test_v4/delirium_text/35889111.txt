35889111|t|The Diagnostic Challenges and Clinical and Serological Outcome in Patients Hospitalized for Suspected Lyme Neuroborreliosis.
35889111|a|The aim of our study was to evaluate the differential diagnosis and clinical/serological outcome to antibiotic treatment in patients hospitalized for suspected Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB). A prospective study included patients hospitalized in a Romanian hospital between March 2011 and October 2012 with neurological symptoms, positive laboratory tests for Borrelia burgdorferi, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and no previous treatment for LNB. A questionnaire was completed for each patient at admission, at the end of treatment, and 3 months later. Patients were treated with antibiotic therapy (ceftriaxone/cefotaxime), irrespective of CSF analysis results. A symptomatic scoring scale was used for the follow-up. Out of the 42 patients included, no patient fulfilled criteria for definite LNB; 7 patients were classified as possible LNB; and in 33 patients, LNB was excluded. Two patients could not be classified (insufficient amount of CSF). Clinical follow-up suggested a better response to therapy in the group of patients with possible LNB than in the group with LNB excluded. The patients' differential diagnosis and serological follow-up are presented. Patients investigated for suspected LNB present diverse clinical manifestations and comorbidities that complicate differential diagnosis. LNB may be misdiagnosed if CSF analysis is not performed.
