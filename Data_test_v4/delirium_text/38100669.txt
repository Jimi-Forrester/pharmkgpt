38100669|t|Compounding and Characterization of Oral Disintegrating Films Containing Memantine Hydrochloride for Geriatrics.
38100669|a|Memantine hydrochloride is commonly prescribed for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. However, the drug is only available in tablet form, a dosage form which is difficult for geriatrics to swallow. This problem is especially difficult for those patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's. This study was therefore aimed to develop and characterize an oral disintegrating film containing memantine hydrochloride using different types and concentrations of polymers. Using the solvent casting method, twelve formulations were developed, which involved manipulations on the type and concentration of the polymer. Afterwards, six formulations were selected to undergo characterization tests. These tests evaluated the films' tensile strength, Young's Modulus, percent elongation, folding endurance, disintegration and dissolution time, content uniformity, moisture loss, and moisture uptake. Polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and pullulan gum were respectively incorporated at different concentrations. The study found that only hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and polyvinyl alcohol formulations developed into acceptable oral disintegrating films. Formulation E (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 50-mg/film), which exhibited optimal mechanical strength, fast disintegration and dissolution, and excellent content uniformity, was identified as the best formula. Although polyvinyl alcohol showed higher mechanical strength, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose films were better at fulfilling the optimal characteristics of an oral disintegrating film. The study showed that the mechanical strength increased proportionally to the polymer concentration in the polyvinyl alcohol film. However, for the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose film, the mechanical strength increased only when hydroxypropyl methylcellulose's concentration was increased from a 40-mg/film to a 50-mg/film but decreased with a 60-mg/film. To summarize, orally disintegrating films containing memantine hydrochloride was developed, characterized, and reasoned to have high potential to be marketed and to increase medication compliance among geriatrics suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
