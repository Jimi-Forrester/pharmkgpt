2816247|t|Treatment of acute nonspecific delirium with i.v. haloperidol in surgical intensive care patients.
2816247|a|Acute delirium may be treated by the alleviation of pain, by the restoration of specific physiological equilibria (by means of oxygen, glucose, vitamins, etc.) or by discontinuing psychotogenic medication. Acute nonspecific delirium can be treated with a specific psychopharmacological agent. Six surgical intensive care patients with acute nonspecific delirium were treated effectively with intravenous haloperidol. A dose of 38 +/- 17 (mean +/- SEM) mg was needed to calm them. Respiratory rate, heart rate and systolic-diastolic arterial blood pressure all significantly decreased returning to normal values. No side effects were recorded.
