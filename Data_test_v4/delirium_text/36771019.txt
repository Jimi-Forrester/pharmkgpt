36771019|t|Stabilization of Anthocyanins from Coffee (Coffea arabica L.) Husks and In Vivo Evaluation of Their Antioxidant Activity.
36771019|a|Coffee (Coffea arabica L.) is one of the most popular and widely consumed products throughout the world, mainly due to its taste, aroma, caffeine content, and natural antioxidants. Among those antioxidants, anthocyanins are one of the most important natural pigments, which can be found in coffee husks. It is widely known that anthocyanins have multiple health benefits partially linked to their antioxidant properties. However, anthocyanins have low stability and are sensitive to all types of changes. In order to prevent its degradation, anthocyanins can be stabilized with nanoparticles. Thus, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the stability of the anthocyanins extracted from coffee husks, using three different extracting agents (ethanol, methanol, and water) and stabilizing them through conjugation with zinc oxide nanoparticles. The anthocyanins extracts were mainly composed of cyanidin-3-rutinoside (97%) and the total phenolic compounds of the fresh extracts were 458.97 +- 11.32 (methanol), 373.53 +- 12.74 (ethanol), and 369.85 +- 15.93 (water) mg GAE/g. On the other hand, the total phenolic compounds of the nanoparticle-anthocyanin conjugates underwent no significant changes after stabilization as the major loss was less than 3%. Furthermore, the percentage of anthocyanins' degradation was less than 5% after 12 weeks of storage. On top of that, fresh anthocyanin extracts and anthocyanin-nanoparticle conjugates exhibited a strong protective effect against oxidative stress and increased the survival rate of Caenorhabditis elegans.
