18457531|a|Vascular cognitive impairment risk factors include stroke, hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis. In the elderly, vascular risk factors occur in the presence of high levels of amyloid in the aging brain. Stroke alters the clinical expression of a given load of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Experimentally, large vessel infarcts or small striatal infarcts are larger in the presence of amyloid. Patients with minor cerebral infarcts and moderate AD lesions will develop the clinical manifestations of dementia. Moreover, there is also an association between other vascular risk factors and the clinical expression of cognitive decline and dementia. The risk of AD is increased in subjects with adult-onset diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atherosclerotic disease and atrial fibrillation. Experimentally, small striatal infarcts in the presence of high levels of amyloid in the brain exhibit a progression in infarct size over time with enhanced degree of cognitive impairment, AD-type pathology and neuroinflammation compared with striatal infarcts or high amyloid levels alone.
