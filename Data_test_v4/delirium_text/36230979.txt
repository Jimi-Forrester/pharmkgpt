36230979|t|Nucleolus and Nucleolar Stress: From Cell Fate Decision to Disease Development.
36230979|a|Besides the canonical function in ribosome biogenesis, there have been significant recent advances towards the fascinating roles of the nucleolus in stress response, cell destiny decision and disease progression. Nucleolar stress, an emerging concept describing aberrant nucleolar structure and function as a result of impaired rRNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis under stress conditions, has been linked to a variety of signaling transductions, including but not limited to Mdm2-p53, NF-kappaB and HIF-1alpha pathways. Studies have uncovered that nucleolus is a stress sensor and signaling hub when cells encounter various stress conditions, such as nutrient deprivation, DNA damage and oxidative and thermal stress. Consequently, nucleolar stress plays a pivotal role in the determination of cell fate, such as apoptosis, senescence, autophagy and differentiation, in response to stress-induced damage. Nucleolar homeostasis has been involved in the pathogenesis of various chronic diseases, particularly tumorigenesis, neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders. Mechanistic insights have revealed the indispensable role of nucleolus-initiated signaling in the progression of these diseases. Accordingly, the intervention of nucleolar stress may pave the path for developing novel therapies against these diseases. In this review, we systemically summarize recent findings linking the nucleolus to stress responses, signaling transduction and cell-fate decision, set the spotlight on the mechanisms by which nucleolar stress drives disease progression, and highlight the merit of the intervening nucleolus in disease treatment.
