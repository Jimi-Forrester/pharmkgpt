34338063|a|BACKGROUND: There is limited information on new onset poststroke dementia (NPSD) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We estimated incidence, cumulative incidence, risk factors and outcome of NPSD at 1 year in Nigerian survivors of a first-ever stroke. METHODS: Hospital-based prospective observational study. Assessments for global cognition, learning, memory, executive and activities of daily life (ADL) functioning were conducted at 3 poststroke timepoints (Baseline, 3- and 12 months). NPSD was ascertained according to the "National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria." Outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (CES-D 10), health related quality of life in stroke patients (HRQOLISP-26) and caregivers strain index (CSI). RESULTS: Among 144 stroke survivors who were free of dementia at baseline, we found a 1-year cumulative incidence of 4.52% (95% C.I = 3.20, 6.39). In multivariate Cox regression analyses, diabetes was associated with NPSD (Hazard Ratio = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.02, 4.35). NPSD at 3 months was independently associated with motor decline [Mean difference (MD) in mRS = 1.6, 95% C.I = 0.9, 2.3)], depression (MD in CES-D = 2.9, 95% C.I = 0.3, 5.4), caregivers burden (MD in CSI = 1.2, 95% C.I = 0.5, 1.8), and poor quality of life (MD in HRQOLISP-26 = -11.2, 95% C.I = -15.7, -6.8) at 1 year. CONCLUSION: Approximately 4.5% of stroke survivors in Nigeria had NPSD at 1 year. Diabetes, which can be prevented, represent a primary prevention target for NPSD and its consequences in SSA.
