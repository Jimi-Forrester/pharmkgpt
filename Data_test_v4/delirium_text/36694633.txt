36694633|t|Aldehyde dehydrogenase in solid tumors and other diseases: Potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
36694633|a|The family of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) contains 19 isozymes and is involved in the oxidation of endogenous and exogenous aldehydes to carboxylic acids, which contributes to cellular and tissue homeostasis. ALDHs play essential parts in detoxification, biosynthesis, and antioxidants, which are of important value for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival in normal body tissues. However, ALDHs are frequently dysregulated and associated with various diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and especially solid tumors. Notably, the involvement of the ALDHs in tumor progression is responsible for the maintenance of the stem-cell-like phenotype, triggering rapid and aggressive clinical progressions. ALDHs have captured increasing attention as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Nevertheless, these require further longitudinal clinical studies in large populations for broad application. This review summarizes our current knowledge regarding ALDHs as potential biomarkers in tumors and several non-tumor diseases, as well as recent advances in our understanding of the functions and underlying molecular mechanisms of ALDHs in disease development. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of ALDHs in diseases, especially in tumor therapy with an emphasis on their clinical implications.
