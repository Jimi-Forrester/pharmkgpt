26598176|t|Postanesthesia Care for the Elderly Patient.
26598176|a|PURPOSE: As the general population lives longer, the perioperative physician is more likely to encounter disease states that increase in incidence in an aging population. This review focuses on anesthetic considerations for rational drug choices during the perioperative care of elderly patients. The primary aim of the review was to identify intraoperative and postanesthetic considerations for diseases associated with advancing age; it includes highlights of the commonly impaired major organs (eg, cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurologic, renal, hepatic systems). We also outline an approach to frequent issues that arise in the immediate postsurgical period while caring for these patients. METHODS: A systematic review was performed on aspects of the perioperative and postoperative periods that relate to the elderly. A list of pertinent key words was derived from the authors, and a PubMed database search was performed. FINDINGS: The anesthesiologist must account for changes in various organ systems that affect perioperative care, including the cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, and central nervous systems. The pharmacokinetic principles frequently differ and are often unpredictable because of anatomic changes and decreased renal and hepatic function. The most important pharmacodynamic consideration is that elderly patients tend to exhibit an exaggerated hypoactivity after anesthesia. IMPLICATIONS: Before surgery, it is essential to identify those patients at risk for delirium and other commonly encountered postanesthesia scenarios. Failure to manage these conditions appropriately can lead to an escalation of care and prolonged hospitalization.
