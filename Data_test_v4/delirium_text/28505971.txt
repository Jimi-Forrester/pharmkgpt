28505971|a|This study examined associations between lipid peroxidation markers and cognition, and associations between these markers and cognitive response to an exercise intervention program, in adults with coronary artery disease at risk of dementia. Lipid peroxidation products were measured in serum in 118 patients (29 possible vascular mild cognitive impairment and 89 controls). Ratios of early- (lipid hydroperoxides, LPH) to late-stage (8-isoprostane, 8-ISO; 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, 4-HNE) lipid peroxidation products were calculated. Cognitive performance was assessed before and at completion of a 24-week exercise intervention program. A global effect of group on lipid peroxidation markers was observed, adjusting for sex, years of education, and cardiopulmonary fitness (main effect of group F (3,102) = 2.957, p = 0.036). Lower lipid peroxidation at baseline, as determined by lower 8-ISO concentration, was associated with greater improvement in verbal memory (F (1, 64) = 4.738, p = 0.03) and executive function (F (1, 64) = 5.219, p = 0.026) performance. Similarly, higher ratios of 8-ISO/LPH (F (1, 65) = 6.592, p = 0.013) and (8-ISO+4-HNE) to LPH (F (1, 65) = 3.857, p = 0.054), were associated with less improvement in executive function performance over a 24-week exercise intervention. Lipid peroxidation may be a biomarker of early vascular cognitive impairment, and elevated lipid peroxidation might limit the cognitive benefits of exercise in this high-risk population.
