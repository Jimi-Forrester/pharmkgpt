37090382|t|From Chronic Alcohol Consumption to Coma: Report of an Uncommon Cause.
37090382|a|Marchiafava-Bignami disease is a rare condition characterized by demyelination of the corpus callosum that can evolve into necrosis. It is associated with thiamine deficiency, chronic alcohol consumption, and less frequently, severe malnutrition. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation - altered mental state and changes in a neurological examination - and on neuroimaging studies, especially magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment with parenteral thiamine is recommended. The authors present a case of a 50-year-old male, with chronic alcohol abuse and malnutrition, admitted to the hospital with an acute form of the Marchiafava-Bignami disease. An early diagnosis and treatment facilitated neurological and cognitive recovery.
