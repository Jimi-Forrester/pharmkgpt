22764386|a|[<sup>18</sup>F]<i>N</i>-(2-benzofuranylmethyl)-<i>N</i>'-[4-(2-fluoroethoxy)benzyl]piperazine, abbreviated as [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>6</b>, is a piperazine derivative synthesized by Moussa et al. for positron emission tomography (PET) of sigma-1 (s1) receptor (1). s1 receptor is a protein that is widely distributed in both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral organs. There are at least two subtypes of s receptors, s1 and s2 receptors. Although the functions of s2 receptor are poorly understood, s1 receptor is believed to act as a modulator of the signal transduction in neurotransmitter systems (2, 3). s1 receptor primarily resides at the interface between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, where it modulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux by acting as a molecular chaperone for type 3 inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptors. s1 receptor can also translocate to the plasma membrane, where it regulates the voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, K<sup>+</sup> channels, and other membrane-bound proteins (1, 2). More and more evidence suggests that s1 receptor is involved in a range of CNS diseases such as affective disorders, psychosis, schizophrenia, substance abuse, Parkinson s disease, and Alzheimer s disease (1, 4). Studies on postmortem human brains have shown that the density of s1 receptor decreased in patients with schizophrenia and Alzheimer s disease (5). Discovery of specific ligands for s1 receptor has further prompted investigations in the imaging and treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases by targeting s1 receptor (3, 4). Noninvasive imaging of s1 receptor <i>in vivo</i> would enable better understanding of the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases as well as how the expression and function of s1 receptors change during disease progression (2). Early in 1998, Baziard-Mouysset et al. synthesized a series of disubstituted 1,4-piperazines, flanked by a chromene ring and a benzyl group (6). Of this series, the simplest compound that contained an unsubstituted benzyl ring displayed high affinity for s receptors (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 3 nM) and negligible off-target activity. Substitution of the benzyl ring was generally detrimental to s binding, with the exception of 4-chloro or 4-methoxy substitution, which marginally improved s receptor binding (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 1 nM and 0.6 nM, respectively). The chromene ring was shown to have little effect on s binding, and it was well tolerated for substitution with a large number of alternate aromatic groups (7). With the 2-benzofurylmethyl group-substituted compound as a lead compound, Moussa et al. generated a series of <i>N</i>-(2-benzofuranylmethyl)-<i>N</i>'-(alkoxybenzyl)piperazines as selective s1 receptor ligands (1, 4, 8). Two compounds in this series, <i>N</i>-(2-benzofuranylmethyl)-<i>N</i>'-[4-(2-fluoroethoxy)benzyl]piperazine (compound <b>6</b>) and <i>N</i>-(benzofuran-2-ylmethyl)-<i>N</i>'-(4'-methoxybenzyl)piperazine (compound <b>13</b>), were further radiolabeled and tested for their feasibilities as imaging probes for s1 receptors. This chapter summarizes the data obtained with [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>6</b>.
