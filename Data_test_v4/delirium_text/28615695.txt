28615695|t|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is regulated via MyD88/NF-kappaB signaling in experimental Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis.
28615695|a|Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis is an intractable disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophic family and found to participate in the immune inflammatory response. In this study, we investigated if activation of the classical inflammatory signaling pathway, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), regulates BDNF expression in experimental S. pneumoniae meningitis. MyD88 knockout (myd88-/-) mice and wild-type littermates were infected intracisternally with S. pneumoniae suspension. Twenty-four hours after inoculation, histopathology of brains was evaluated. Cytokine and chemokine in brains and spleens was analyzed using ELISA. NF-kappaB activation was evaluated using EMSA. Cortical and hippocampal BDNF was assessed using RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. BDNF promoter activity was evaluated using ChIP-PCR. myd88-/- mice showed an obviously weakened inflammatory host response. This diminished inflammation was consistent with worse clinical parameters, neuron injury, and apoptosis. Deficiency in MyD88 was associated with decreased BDNF expression. Furthermore, we identified a valid kappaB-binding site in the BDNF promoter, consistent with activation of NF-kappaB induced by inflammation. To sum up, MyD88/NF-kappaB signaling has a crucial role in up-regulating BDNF, which might provide potential therapeutic targets for S. pneumoniae meningitis.
