29390878|t|Neuroprotective Effects of Betulin in Pharmacological and Transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans Models of Parkinson's Disease.
29390878|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common degenerative disorder of the central nervous system in the elderly. It is characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, as well as by motor dysfunction. Although the causes of PD are not well understood, aggregation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in neurons contributes to this disease. Current therapeutics for PD provides satisfactory symptom relief but not a cure. Treatment strategies include attempts to identify new drugs that will prevent or arrest the progressive course of PD by correcting disease-specific pathogenic process. Betulin is derived from the bark of birch trees and possesses anticancer, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential for betulin to ameliorate PD features in Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans) models. We demonstrated that betulin diminished alpha-syn accumulation in the transgenic C. elegans model. Betulin also reduced 6-hydroxydopamine-induced dopaminergic neuron degeneration, reduced food-sensing behavioral abnormalities, and reversed life-span decreases in a pharmacological C. elegans model. Moreover, we found that the enhancement of proteasomes activity by promoting rpn1 expression and downregulation of the apoptosis pathway gene, egl-1, may be the molecular mechanism for betulin-mediated protection against PD pathology. Together, these findings support betulin as a possible treatment for PD and encourage further investigations of betulin as an antineurodegenerative agent.
