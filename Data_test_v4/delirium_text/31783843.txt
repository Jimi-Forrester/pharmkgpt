31783843|a|BACKGROUND: The dried fruits of Forsythia suspensa has generally been used to clear heat and detoxify in traditional Korean and Chinese medicine. Oxaliplatin is a first-line treatment chemotherapeutic agent for advanced colorectal cancer, but it induces peripheral neuropathy as an adverse side effect affecting the treatment regimen and the patient's quality of life. The present study was conducted to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of an aqueous extract of F. suspensa fruits (EFSF) on oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy. METHODS: The chemical components from EFSF were characterized and quantified using the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector system. The cytotoxicities of anticancer drugs in cancer cells and PC12 cells were assessed by the Ez-Cytox viability assay. To measure the in vitro neurotoxicity, the neurite outgrowth was analyzed in the primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells, and neural PC12 cells that were differentiated with nerve growth factor. To evaluate the in vivo neuroprotective activity, the von Frey test was performed in six-week-old male mice (C57BL/6) receiving EFSF (60-600 mg/kg) in the presence of 20-30 mg/kg cumulative doses of oxaliplatin. Thereafter, the mice were euthanized for immunohistochemical staining analysis with an antibody against PGP9.5. RESULTS: EFSF attenuated the cytotoxic activities of the various anticancer drugs in neural PC12 cells, but did not affect the anticancer activity of oxaliplatin in human cancer cells. Oxaliplatin remarkably induced neurotoxicities including cytotoxicity and the inhibited neurite outgrowth of DRG and neural PC12 cells. However, the co-treatment of EFSF (100 mug/ml) with oxaliplatin completely reversed the oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity. Forsythoside A, the major component of EFSF, also exerted remarkable neuroprotective effects against the oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity. In addition, EFSF (60-200 mg/kg) significantly alleviated the oxaliplatin-induced mechanical allodynia and loss of intra-epidermal nerve fiber to the levels of the vehicle control in the mouse peripheral neuropathy model. CONCLUSIONS: EFSF could be considered a useful herbal medicine for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with oxaliplatin.
