38881515|a|Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is strongly linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, it is found that the injection of chondroitinase ABC (ChABC), mimicking ECM remodeling, into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) reversed short-term memory loss and reduced amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in 5xFAD mice. ECM remodeling also reactivated astrocytes, reduced the levels of aggrecan in Abeta plaques, and enhanced astrocyte recruitment to surrounding plaques. Importantly, ECM remodeling enhanced the autophagy-lysosome pathway in astrocytes, thereby mediating Abeta clearance and alleviating AD pathology. ECM remodeling also promoted Abeta plaque phagocytosis by astrocytes by activating the astrocytic phagocytosis receptor MERTK and promoting astrocytic vesicle circulation. The study identified a cellular mechanism in which ECM remodeling activates the astrocytic autophagy-lysosomal pathway and alleviates AD pathology. Targeting ECM remodeling may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for AD and serve as a reference for the treatment of this disease.
