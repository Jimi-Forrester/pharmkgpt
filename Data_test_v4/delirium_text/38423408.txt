38423408|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multi-factorial degenerative disease, and multi-targeted therapies targeting multiple pathogenic mechanisms should be explored. Shenghui decoction (SHD) is an ancient traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula used clinically to alleviate AD. However, the precise mechanism of action of SHD as a therapeutic agent for AD remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study investigated the neuroprotective properties and potential mechanisms of action of SHD in mitigating AD-like symptoms induced by AlCl3 in a zebrafish model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Active components of SHD were detected using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Zebrafish were exposed to AlCl3 (200 mug/L) for 30 days to establish an AD zebrafish model. AlCl3-exposed zebrafish were treated with SHD or donepezil. Behavioral tests were used to assess learning and memory, locomotor activity, and AD-related anxiety and aggression in AlCl3-exposed zebrafish. Nissl staining and transmission electron microscopy were used to evaluate histological alterations in brain neurons. The concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-alpha; interleukin-1beta, IL-1beta) were quantified using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Markers of oxidative stress and cholinergic activity (acetylcholinesterase, AChE) were detected using biochemical assays. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to detect the protein expression levels of Abeta, p-tau, PSD-95, synaptophysin, TLR4, phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65, p38, and JNK. RESULTS: Fifteen SHD compounds were identified by UPLC-MS/MS analysis. SHD improved AlCl3-induced dyskinesia, learning and memory impairment, anxiety-like behavior, and aggressive behavior in zebrafish. AlCl3-exposed zebrafish showed AD-like pathology, overexpression of Abeta, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, marked neuronal damage, decreased expression of synaptic proteins, synaptophysin, and PSD-95, and impairment of synaptic structural plasticity. These effects were reversed by the SHD treatment. We also observed that SHD ameliorated oxidative stress and decreased AChE activity and inflammatory cytokine levels. These effects are similar to those observed for donepezil. Meanwhile, SHD could decrease the protein expression of TLR4 and inhibit phosphorylation of NF-kappaB, JNK, and p38 MAPK. These results demonstrate that SHD has the potential to exert neuroprotective effects, which may be partly mediated via inhibition of the JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed the therapeutic mechanism of SHD in mitigating AD progression and suggested that SHD is a potent neuroprotectant that contributes to the future development of TCM modernization and broader clinical applications.
