37959202|a|Novel cellular immunotherapies such as T-cell engaging antibodies (TCEAbs) are changing the landscape of treatment for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), especially in the relapsed/refractory (R/R) setting. TCEAbs harness the power of the host immune system to induce killing of tumor cells by binding to both the tumor antigen and the T-cell receptor. Since the approval of blinatumomab for R/R acute lymphoblastic leukemia, there has been significant development in novel TCEAbs. Many of these novel TCEAbs have shown promising effectiveness in R/R DLBCL, with favorable response rates including complete remissions, even in heavily pretreated patients. There are unique therapy-related toxicities with TCEAbs, namely cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity (ICANS), and it is important to both recognize and manage these side effects appropriately. This review examines the development and mechanism of action of these TCEAbs, and the available published data from clinical trials. Their role in the treatment of DLBCL, the management of therapy-related adverse events, and the mechanisms of resistance will also be discussed.
