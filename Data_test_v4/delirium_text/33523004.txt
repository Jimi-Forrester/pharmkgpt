33523004|a|BACKGROUND: Aerobic exercise has shown inconsistent cognitive effects in older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. OBJECTIVE: To examine the immediate and longitudinal effects of 6-month cycling on cognition in older adults with AD dementia. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial randomized 96 participants (64 to cycling and 32 to stretching for six months) and followed them for another six months. The intervention was supervised, moderate-intensity cycling for 20-50 minutes, 3 times a week for six months. The control was light-intensity stretching. Cognition was assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months using the AD Assessment Scale-Cognition (ADAS-Cog). Discrete cognitive domains were measured using the AD Uniform Data Set battery. RESULTS: The participants were 77.4+-6.8 years old with 15.6+-2.9 years of education, and 55% were male. The 6-month change in ADAS-Cog was 1.0+-4.6 (cycling) and 0.1+-4.1 (stretching), which were both significantly less than the natural 3.2+-6.3-point increase observed naturally with disease progression. The 12-month change was 2.4+-5.2 (cycling) and 2.2+-5.7 (control). ADAS-Cog did not differ between groups at 6 (p = 0.386) and 12 months (p = 0.856). There were no differences in the 12-month rate of change in ADAS-Cog (0.192 versus 0.197, p = 0.967), memory (-0.012 versus -0.019, p = 0.373), executive function (-0.020 versus -0.012, p = 0.383), attention (-0.035 versus -0.033, p = 0.908), or language (-0.028 versus -0.026, p = 0.756). CONCLUSION: Exercise may reduce decline in global cognition in older adults with mild-to-moderate AD dementia. Aerobic exercise did not show superior cognitive effects to stretching in our pilot trial, possibly due to the lack of power.
