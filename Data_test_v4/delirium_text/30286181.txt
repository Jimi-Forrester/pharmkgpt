30286181|a|This study evaluates whether intrathecal MVIIA injection after spinal cord injury (SCI) elicits neuroprotective effects. The test rats were randomly distributed into six groups- sham, placebo, MVIIA 2.5 muM, MVIIA 5 muM, MVIIA 10 muM, and MVIIA 20 muM-and were administered the treatment four hours after SCI. After the optimal MVIIA dose (MVIIA 10 muM) was defined, the best time for application, one or four hours, was analyzed. Locomotor hind limb function and side effects were assessed. Forty-eight hours after the injury and immediately after euthanasia, spinal cord segments were removed from the test rats. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and glutamate release were investigated. To examine the MVIIA mechanism of action, the gene expressions of pro-apoptotic (Bax, nNOS, and caspase-3, -8, -9, -12) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-xl) factors in the spinal cord tissue samples were determined by real-time PCR, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were also investigated. Application of intrathecal MVIIA 10 muM four hours after SCI prompted a neuroprotective effect: neuronal death decreased (22.46%), oxidative stress diminished, pro-apoptotic factors (Bax, nNOS, and caspase-3, -8) were expressed to a lesser extent, and mitochondrial viability as well as anti-apoptotic factor (Bcl-xl) expression increased. These results suggested that MVIIA provided neuroprotection through antioxidant effects. Indeed, superoxide dismutase (188.41%), and glutathione peroxidase (199.96%), reductase (193.86%), and transferase (175.93%) expressions increased. Therefore, intrathecal MVIIA (MVIIA 10 muM, 4 h) application has neuroprotective potential, and the possible mechanisms are related to antioxidant agent modulation and to intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways.
