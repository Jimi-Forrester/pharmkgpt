38770525|t|EEG biomarkers analysis in different cognitive impairment after stroke: an exploration study.
38770525|a|Stroke is a cerebrovascular illness that brings about the demise of brain tissue. It is the third most prevalent cause of mortality worldwide and a significant contributor to physical impairment. Generally, stroke is triggered by blood clots obstructing the brain's blood vessels, or when these vessels rupture. And, the cognitive impairment's evaluation and detection after stroke is crucial research issue and significant project. Thus, the objective of this work is to explore an potential neuroimage tool and find their EEG biomarkers to evaluate and detect four cognitive impairment levels after stroke. In this study, power density spectrum (PSD), functional connectivity map, and one-way ANOVA methods were proposed to analyze the EEG biomarker differences, and the number of patient participants were thirty-two human including eight healthy control, mild, moderate, severe cognitive impairment levels, respectively. Finally, healthy control has significant PSD differences compared to mid, moderate and server cognitive impairment groups. And, the theta and alpha bands of severe cognitive impairment groups have presented consistent superior PSD power at the right frontal cortex, and the theta and beta bands of mild, moderated cognitive impairment (MoCI) groups have shown significant similar superior PSD power tendency at the parietal cortex. The significant gamma PSD power difference has presented at the left-frontal cortex in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) groups, and severe cognitive impairment (SeCI) group has shown the significant PSD power at the gamma band of parietal cortex. At the point of functional connectivity map, the SeCI group appears to have stronger functional connectivity compared to the other groups. In conclusion, EEG biomarkers can be applied to classify different cognitive impairment groups after stroke. These findings provide a new approach for early detection and diagnosis of cognitive impairment after stroke and also for the development of new treatment options.
