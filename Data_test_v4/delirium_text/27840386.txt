27840386|t|Association of the LOX-1 rs1050283 Polymorphism with Risk for Atherosclerotic Cerebral Infarction and its Effect on sLOX-1 and LOX-1 Expression in a Chinese Population.
27840386|a|AIMS: The interaction between lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-1 (LOX-1) and oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) has been viewed as an important pathogenic factor for cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to explore the association of a functional polymorphism rs1050283 in the 3'-untranslated region of the LOX-1 gene with atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI) susceptibility, and we also investigated the effects of the rs1050283 polymorphism on LOX-1 expression and serum levels of sLOX-1 in patients with ACI. METHODS: A case-controlled study was performed in 526 patients with ACI and 640 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed by DNA sequencing method. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to determine the level of LOX-1 expression. Serum levels of sLOX-1 were quantified using ELISA according to the manufacturer's instruction. RESULTS: The results of the present study showed that the frequency of rs1050283 T allele was significantly higher in patients with ACI than in healthy controls. We also found that the rs1050283 polymorphism T allele was associated with increased LOX-1 expression at mRNA and protein levels in patients with ACI. Furthermore, we also observed that among patients with ACI, those with the rs1050283 T allele showed an increased serum level of sLOX-1. CONCLUSION: Our research demonstrated that the rs1050283 T allele of LOX-1 is strongly associated with an increased risk for ACI in a Chinese population, which also affects levels of LOX-1 and sLOX-1.
