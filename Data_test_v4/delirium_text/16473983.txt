16473983|a|OBJECTIVE: This analysis examined whether patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) tolerate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). METHOD: Thirty patients with AD were randomized to CPAP or sham CPAP and completed sleep, depression, and quality-of-life questionnaires. Participants could choose to continue treatment after the trial. RESULTS: Patients wore CPAP for 4.8 hours per night. More depressive symptoms were associated with worse adherence (rS=-0.37; N=30, p<0.04). Patients who continued using CPAP had fewer depressive symptoms (t [19]=2.45, p=0.02) and better adherence (t [19]=2.32, p=0.03) during the trial. CONCLUSION: Patients with AD with obstructive sleep apnea can tolerate CPAP. Adherence and long-term use may be more difficult among those patients with more depressive symptoms.
