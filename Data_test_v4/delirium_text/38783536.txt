38783536|a|BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine (METH) is a psychostimulant substance with highly addictive and neurotoxic effects, but no ideal treatment option exists to improve METH-induced neurocognitive deficits. Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived exosomes have raised many hopes for treating neurodegenerative sequela of brain disorders. This study aimed to determine the therapeutic potential of MSCs-derived exosomes on cognitive function and neurogenesis of METH-addicted rodents. METHODS: Male BALB/c mice were subjected to chronic METH addiction, followed by intravenous administration of bone marrow MSCs-derived exosomes. Then, the spatial memory and recognition memory of animals were assessed by the Barnes maze and the novel object recognition test (NORT). The neurogenesis-related factors, including NeuN and DCX, and the expression of Iba-1, a microglial activation marker, were assessed in the hippocampus by immunofluorescence staining. Also, the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB, were evaluated by western blotting. RESULTS: The results showed that BMSCs-exosomes improved the time spent in the target quadrant and correct-to-wrong relative time in the Barnes maze. Also, NORT's discrimination index (DI) and recognition index (RI) were improved following exosome therapy. Additionally, exosome therapy significantly increased the expression of NeuN and DCX in the hippocampus while decreasing the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB. Besides, BMSC-exosomes down-regulated the expression of Iba-1. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that BMSC-exosomes mitigated METH-caused cognitive dysfunction by improving neurogenesis and inhibiting neuroinflammation in the hippocampus.
