35800818|t|Successful Management of a Patient With a History of Postoperative Delirium Undergoing Cardiac Surgery With an Erector Spinae Plane Block and Multimodal Analgesia: A Case Report.
35800818|a|Perioperative delirium is an acute confusional state with fluctuating levels of consciousness, which can be precipitated by opioid-based anesthetics and inadequate pain control, especially in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We seek to minimize opioid usage to avoid postoperative delirium in a patient with multiple risk factors undergoing aortic valve replacement. We used cardiac enhanced recovery after surgery protocols (ERAS-C), which include multimodal analgesia and regional anesthesia via bilateral erector spinae plane (ESP) blocks. Our observations suggest that bilateral ESP blocks and cardiac ERAS protocols offer a potential option to manage pain and control risk factors in patients at high risk of postoperative delirium undergoing cardiac surgery.
