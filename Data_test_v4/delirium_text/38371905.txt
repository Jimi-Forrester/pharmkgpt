38371905|a|The goal of this clinical research was to determine the relationship between carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), cardiovascular risk factors, and neuro-cognitive function in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and were on stable combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART). This is a cross-sectional study performed at a single center, including 149 patients who visited the anti-retroviral therapy center of our tertiary care hospital. Among the PLHIV of our research, 62.4% had at least one associated cardiovascular risk factor, and 61.1% of them had abnormally high cIMT (>= 0.9 mm on any one side, p = 0.035). These factors and being the male gender (p = 0.028) were associated with a greater Framingham 10-year risk percentage. Hypercholesterolemia was observed in 30.9% of the PLHIV and a higher body mass index (>= 25 kg/m2) was found in 26.8% of them. The cognitive impairment was milder in 71.8% of cases and moderate in 9.4% of PLHIV. The Chi-square test revealed that a higher proportion of participants who had lower HDL-C levels (p = 0.045), smokers (p = 0.029), systolic blood pressure >= 140 mmHg (p = 0.012), and lower educational status (p = 0.017) had a poorer cognitive performance. In our sample population, a higher prevalence of elevated cIMT, cardiovascular risk factors, and mild and moderate cognitive deficiency was observed in PLHIV, who were on stable cART. However, routine assessment of the neuropsychological functions and management of modifiable risk factors are not performed in our patients. Further exploration of the relationship between cardiovascular risks, cIMT, and cognitive impairment in PLHIV is essential to formulate the guidelines and delay the onset of neurocognitive disorders in these patients.
