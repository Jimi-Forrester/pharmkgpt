35949300|a|Objectives: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common brain dysfunction following sepsis. Due to the beneficial effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy on anxiety, an extreme and early manifestation of SAE, we hypothesized that MSCs-derived conditioned medium (CM) may be able to attenuate anxiety in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis. Materials and Methods: Rats were assigned into 4 groups: sham, CLP, MSC, and CM. All animals, except in the sham group, underwent the CLP procedure to induce sepsis. Two hours after sepsis induction, the rats in MSC and CM groups, received 1x106 MSCs and CM derived from the same number of cells, respectively. 48 hr after the treatments, anxiety-related behaviors were assessed, and brain and right hippocampal tissues were collected. Results: MSCs and CM enhanced the percentages of open arm entries and time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze and the time spent in the light side of the light-dark box. MSCs and CM decreased the Evans blue content and decreased the IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels in the brain tissue samples. Reductions in the expression of 5-HT2A receptors and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and an increase in the expression of 5-HT1A receptors in the hippocampal tissue samples were observed in the MSC and CM groups. Conclusion: MSCs and MSCs-derived CM attenuated anxiety-related behaviors to an equal extent by reducing inflammation, modifying 5-HT receptor expression changes, and inhibiting the ERK pathway. Therefore, MSCs-derived CM may be considered a promising therapy for comorbid anxiety in septic patients.
