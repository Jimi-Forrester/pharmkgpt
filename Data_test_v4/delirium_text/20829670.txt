20829670|t|Five-year survival after Helicobacter pylori eradication in Alzheimer disease patients.
20829670|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative condition. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection (Hp-I) could improve survival in a Greek cohort of AD patients, in a 5-year follow-up. METHOD: Forty-six patients diagnosed with probable AD were enrolled in the analysis. Study population was classified into 3 groups: patients for whom Hp eradication treatment was successful; those for whom eradication of Hp had failed, they refused, and/or were noncompliant with eradication therapy; and those who were Hp negative at baseline. Cox proportional hazards model was built with all-cause mortality as the dichotomous outcome. RESULTS: During the 5-year follow-up [47.19+-15.11 mo (range 12 to 60)], overall 21 patients died and 25 patients remained alive. Patients who died were older and exhibited lower mean MMSE score compared with the patients still alive. Successful eradication of Hp-I was associated with a significantly lower mortality risk [HR (95% CI)=0.287 (0.114-0.725), P=0.008]. The results were similar in adjusted and unadjusted models, for age and MMSE at baseline. CONCLUSION: Hp eradication regimen in AD patients is associated with a higher 5-year survival rate.
