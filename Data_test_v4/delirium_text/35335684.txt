35335684|t|Subgingival Periopathogens Assessment and Clinical Periodontal Evaluation of Gastric Cancer Patients-A Cross Sectional Pilot Study.
35335684|a|Oral microbiota have shown a higher bacterial diversity in patients with cancers of the digestive tract, with higher levels of periopathogens. Recent studies have shown that Fusobacterium links to gastro-intestinal neoplastic tissue and accelerates its progression, as well as worsening patient outcome. The present pilot study was carried out between February and December 2020 to evaluate the possible association between the abundance of some periopathogens (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythia) in subgingival plaque and periodontal status with characteristics of gastric cancer. The study was performed on a sample of 24 patients with gastric cancer from the 1st Department of Surgery and Department of Gastroenterology within the Clinical County Hospital of Emergency of Craiova, Romania. The patients' oral cavity was examined, gingival crevicular samples were collected, and signs of periodontal disease were recorded. On the histopathological exam, the differentiation grade and size of the tumour were registered. Our results showed that, from the periopathogens studied, the most abundant bacteria were F. nucleatum followed by T. forsythia in all groups. In our present study, the strong correlation between tumour dimension and all periodontal parameters but also between tumour dimension and F. nucleatum could suggest a positive association between periodontal disease, tumoral growth and periopathogens implication in this process.
