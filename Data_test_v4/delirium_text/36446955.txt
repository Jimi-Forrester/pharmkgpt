36446955|t|The immunopathology of B lymphocytes during stroke-induced injury and repair.
36446955|a|B cells, also known as B lymphocytes or lymphoid lineage cells, are a historically understudied cell population with regard to brain-related injuries and diseases. However, an increasing number of publications have begun to elucidate the different phenotypes and roles B cells can undertake during central nervous system (CNS) pathology, including following ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. B cell phenotype is intrinsically linked to function following stroke, as they may be beneficial or detrimental depending on the subset, timing, and microenvironment. Factors such as age, sex, and presence of co-morbidity also influence the behavior of post-stroke B cells. The following review will briefly describe B cells from origination to senescence, explore B cell function by integrating decades of stroke research, differentiate between the known B cell subtypes and their respective activity, discuss some of the physiological influences on B cells as well as the influence of B cells on certain physiological functions, and highlight the differences between B cells in healthy and disease states with particular emphasis in the context of ischemic stroke.
