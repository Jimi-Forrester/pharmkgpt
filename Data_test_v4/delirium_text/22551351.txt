22551351|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is linked to the aberrant assembly of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). The (21)AEDVGSNKGA(30) segment, Abeta(21-30), forms a turn that acts as a monomer folding nucleus. Amino acid substitutions within this nucleus cause familial forms of AD. To determine the biophysical characteristics of the folding nucleus, we studied the biologically relevant acetyl-Abeta(21-30)-amide peptide using experimental techniques (limited proteolysis, thermal denaturation, urea denaturation followed by pulse proteolysis, and electron microscopy) and computational methods (molecular dynamics). Our results reveal a highly stable foldon and suggest new strategies for therapeutic drug development.
