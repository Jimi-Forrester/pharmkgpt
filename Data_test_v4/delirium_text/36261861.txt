36261861|a|BACKGROUND: Limited information exists comparing the perioperative complications of the different inflammatory arthropathies (IAs) after total hip arthroplasty (THA). Our study was aimed to (1) compare perioperative complications and (2) determine the most common complications between the different IA subtypes compared with patients with primary osteoarthritis (OA) undergoing primary THA and (3) find whether the difference in postoperative complications also exists between different IA after THA. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to identify patients with Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and primary OA undergoing unilateral THA between 2005 and 2014. Preoperative diagnosis, comorbidities, and postoperative complications were determined using the International Classification of Disease Clinical Modification version 9 codes. The prevalence of perioperative complications was compared between patients with IA and primary OA and between patients with different IA. RESULTS: When compared with patients with primary OA, patients with RA had significantly more postoperative surgical and medical complications. Yet there are just several medical complications differences exist between PA and primary OA or AS and primary OA, including stroke and acute renal failure for psoriatic arthritis and urinary tract infection and pneumonia for AS. What is more, there were also several differences in perioperative medical complications seen in patients with different IA. CONCLUSION: Except for patients with RA, the differences in perioperative complications was small between patients with IA and primary OA and between patients with different types of IA.
