36079038|t|Cognitive Performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test and Retinal Structural and Functional Measures in Glaucoma.
36079038|a|Background: Glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness, is classified as a neurodegenerative disease, and its incidence increases with age. Pathophysiological changes, such as the deposition of amyloid-beta plaques in the retinal ganglion cell layer, as well as neuropsychological changes, including cognitive decline, have been reported in glaucoma. However, the association between cognitive ability and retinal functional and structural measures in glaucoma, particularly glaucoma subtypes, has not been studied. We studied the association between cognitive ability and the visual field reliability indices as well as the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) count estimates in a cohort of glaucoma patients. Methods: A total of 95 eyes from 61 glaucoma patients were included. From these, 20 were normal-tension glaucoma (NTG), 25 were primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), and 16 were glaucoma suspects. All the participants had a computerised Humphrey visual field (HVF) assessment and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan and were administered the written Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. RGC count estimates were derived based on established formulas using the HVF and OCT results. A MoCA cut-off score of 25 and less was designated as cognitive impairment. Student's t-test was used to assess differences between the groups. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess the association between MoCA scores and retinal structural and functional measures. Results: Significant associations were found between MoCA scores and the false-negative and pattern standard deviation indices recorded on the HVF (r = -0.19, r = -0.22, p < 0.05). The mean IOP was significantly lower in the cognitively impaired group (i.e., MOCA <= 25) (13.7 +- 3.6 vs. 15.7 +- 4.5, p < 0.05). No significant association was found between RGC count estimates and MoCA scores. Analysis of these parameters in individual glaucoma subtypes did not reveal any group-specific significant associations either.
