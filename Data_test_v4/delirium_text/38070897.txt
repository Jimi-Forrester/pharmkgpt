38070897|t|Effect of percutaneous cerebral oximetry-guided anaesthetic management on postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting: study protocol for a single-centre prospective randomised controlled trial in a tertiary academic hospital in China.
38070897|a|INTRODUCTION: Postoperative delirium is a prominent and clinically important complication in older adults after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, resulting in prolonged hospital stay, long-term cognitive impairment and increased morbidity and mortality. Many studies have shown that cerebral desaturation is associated with increased risk of postoperative delirium during on-pump cardiac surgery. However, few studies have focused on the effect of optimising regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) on postoperative delirium during off-pump CABG. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether intraoperative anaesthetic management based on percutaneous cerebral oximetry monitoring decreases the incidence of postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing off-pump CABG. METHODS: This single-centre randomised controlled trial will randomly assign 200 patients to the intervention group or the control group at a ratio of 1:1. The patients in the intervention group will be observed by percutaneous cerebral oximetry monitoring that the desaturation (a drop of more than 20% from baseline value or rSO2 less than 55% for >60 consecutive seconds at either probe) during the procedure triggered the intervention strategies, while the cerebral oximetry data of the control group will be hidden from the clinical team and patients will be anaesthetised by the usual anaesthetic management. The primary outcome will be the incidence of postoperative delirium during the first 7 days after off-pump CABG. Delirium will be comprehensively evaluated by the combination of the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit. The secondary outcomes will include the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury and myocardial infarction during the hospital stay, as well as the intensive care unit and hospital length of stay. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Fuwai Hospital (No 2022-1824). Written informed consent will be obtained from each patient or their legal representatives before enrolment. The results of this trial will be published in an international peer-reviewed scientific journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2300068537.
