37370025|a|The NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a protein complex that regulates innate immune responses by activating caspase-1 and the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18. Multiple studies have demonstrated the importance of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the development of immune and inflammation-related diseases, including arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and other autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. This review first explains the activation and regulatory mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Secondly, we focus on the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in various inflammation-related diseases. Finally, we look forward to new methods for targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome to treat inflammation-related diseases, and provide new ideas for clinical treatment.
