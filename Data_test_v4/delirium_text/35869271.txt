35869271|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) which ultimately forms plaques. These Abeta deposits can be induced in APP transgenic mouse models by prion-like seeding. It has been widely accepted that anosmia and hyposmia occur during the early stages of AD, even before cognitive deficits are present. In order to determine the impact of seed-induced Abeta deposits on olfaction, we performed intracerebral injections of seed-competent brain homogenate into the olfactory bulb of young pre-depositing APP transgenic mice. Remarkably, we observed a dramatic olfactory impairment in those mice. Furthermore, the number of newborn neurons as well as the activity of cells in the mitral cell layer was decreased. Notably, exposure to an enriched environment reduced Abeta seeding, vivified neurogenesis and most importantly reversed olfactory deficits. Based on our findings, we conclude that altered neuronal function as a result of induced Abeta pathology might contribute to olfactory dysfunction in AD.
