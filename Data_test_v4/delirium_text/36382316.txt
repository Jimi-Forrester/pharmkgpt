36382316|t|An Unusual Case of Acute Confusion in an Elderly Man: Pituitary Apoplexy With Lateral Rectus Palsy.
36382316|a|Often, the provisional diagnosis for an elderly patient who arrives at the hospital with confusion is presumed to be delirium stemming from confusion usually caused by an infectious cause. The famous mnemonic PINCH ME signifies the ruling out of pain, infection (that usually has a urinary cause), constipation, dehydration, medication (particularly narcotics), and the environment (factors triggering confusion in a patient with a background of dementia). However, we report a rare case of sudden confusion in an elderly male with no previous history of cognitive impairment. This is the first ever reported case to the best of our knowledge of a patient that presented with sudden confusion, impaired extraocular mobility, and spontaneous cranial hemorrhage that was ultimately determined to be due to a hypothalamic and/or a pituitary cause. It signifies a need for prompt evaluation to arrive at an early diagnosis. Additionally, we hope this case report would serve as a guide to look beyond the current mnemonic of PINCH ME and instead to a new mnemonic of 'PINCH ME HOT' where the latter most mnemonic connotes the need to look at a hypothalamic/pituitary, ocular, or traumatic origin for the delirium.
