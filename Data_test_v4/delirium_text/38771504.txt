38771504|t|An overview of the efficacy of inhaled curcumin: a new mode of administration for an old molecule.
38771504|a|INTRODUCTION: Curcumin is a polyphenol with a variety of pharmacological actions. Despite its therapeutic effects and well-known safety profile, the utility of curcumin has been limited due to its deprived physical, chemical, and pharmacokinetic profile resulting from limited solubility, durability, prompt deterioration and pitiable systemic availability. Employment of an amalgamated framework integrating the potential advantages of a nanoscaffold alongside the beneficial traits of inhalational drug delivery system beautifully bringing down the restricting attributes of intended curative interventions and further assures its clinical success. AREAS COVERED: Current review discussed different application of inhalable nanocurcumin in different medical conditions. Lung diseases have been the prime field in which inhalable nanocurcumin had resulted in significant beneficial effects. Apart from this several lung protective potentials of the inhaled nanocurcumin have been discussed against severe pulmonary disorders such as pulmonary fibrosis, radiation pneumonitis and IUGR induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Also, application of the disclosed intervention in the clinical management of COVID-19 and Alzheimer's Disease has been discussed. EXPERT OPINION: In this portion, the potential of inhalable nanocurcumin in addressing various medical conditions along with ongoing advancements in nanoencapsulation techniques and the existing challenges in transitioning from pre-clinical models to clinical practice has been summarized.
