34879643|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the surgical outcomes of partial pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PPSO) in patients with thoracolumbar fractures and compare the outcomes of PPSO for burst fractures with those for posttraumatic kyphosis (PTK). METHODS: From June 2013 to May 2019, 20 consecutive adult patients underwent PPSO for thoracolumbar fractures at the levels of T10 to L2. Of these patients, 10 underwent surgery for acute fractures (burst fractures), and 10 for sequelae of thoracolumbar fractures (PTK). Outcomes of PPSO were evaluated and compared between the groups. RESULTS: Twenty patients (each 10 patients of burst fractures and PTK) with a mean age of 64.7+-11.1 years were included. The mean follow-up period was 21.8+-11.0 months. The mean correction of the thoracolumbar angle was -34.9 +-18.1  (from 37.8 +-20.5 preoperatively to 2.8 +-15.2  postoperatively). The mean angular correction at the PPSO site was -38.4 +-13.6  (from 35.5 +-13.6  preoperatively to -2.9 +-14.1  postoperatively). The mean preoperative sagittal vertical axis was 93.5+-6.7 cm, which was improved to 37.6+-35.0 cm postoperatively. The mean preoperative kyphotic angle at the PPSO site was significant greater in patients with PTK (44.8 +-7.2 ) than in patients with burst fractures (26.2 +-12.2 , p=0.00). However, the mean postoperative PPSO angle did not differ between the two groups (-5.9 +-15.7  in patients with burst fractures and 0.2 +-12.4  in those with PTK, p=0.28). The mean angular correction at the PPSO site was significantly greater in patients with PTK (-44.6 +-10.7 ) than in those with burst fractures (-32.1 +-13.7 , p=0.04). The mean operation time was 188.1+-37.6 minutes, and the mean amount of surgical bleeding was 1030.0+-533.2 mL. There were seven cases of perioperative complications occurred in five patients (25%), including one case (5%) of neurological deficit. The operation time, surgical bleeding, and complication rates did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: In cases of burst fracture, PPSO provided enough spinal cord decompression without corpectomy and produced sagittal correction superior to that achieved with corpectomy. In case of PTK, PPSO achieved satisfactory curve correction comparable to that achieved with conventional PSO, with less surgical time, less blood loss, and lower complication rates. PPSO could be a viable surgical option for both burst fractures and PTK.
