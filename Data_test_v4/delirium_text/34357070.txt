34357070|a|The central nervous system was classically perceived as anatomically and functionally independent from the other visceral organs. But in recent decades, compelling evidence has led the scientific community to place a greater emphasis on the role of gut microbes on the brain. Pathological observations and early gastrointestinal symptoms highlighted that gut dysbiosis likely precedes the onset of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The delicate balance in the number and functions of pathogenic microbes and alternative probiotic populations is critical in the modulation of systemic inflammation and neuronal health. However, there is limited success in restoring healthy microbial biodiversity in AD and PD patients with general probiotics interventions and fecal microbial therapies. Fortunately, the gut microflora is susceptible to long-term extrinsic influences such as lifestyle and dietary choices, providing opportunities for treatment through comparatively individual-specific control of human behavior. In this review, we examine the impact of restrictive diets on the gut microbiome populations associated with AD and PD. The overall evidence presented supports that gut dysbiosis is a plausible prelude to disease onset, and early dietary interventions are likely beneficial for the prevention and treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases.
