32021878|t|Expression of Neprilysin in Skeletal Muscle by Ultrasound-Mediated Gene Transfer (Sonoporation) Reduces Amyloid Burden for AD.
32021878|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation in the brain is considered to be one of the major pathological changes in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neprilysin (NEP) is a zinc metallopeptidase that efficiently degrades Abeta. However, conventional approaches for increasing NEP levels or inducing its activation via viral-vector gene delivery have been shown to be problematic due to complications involving secondary toxicity, immune responses, and/or low gene transfer efficiency. Thus, in the present study, a physical and tractable NEP gene-delivery system via ultrasound (US) combined with microbubbles was developed for AD therapy. We introduced the plasmid, human NEP (hNEP), into skeletal muscle of 6-month-old amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) AD mice. Interestingly, we found a significantly reduced Abeta burden in the brain at 1 month after the delivery of overexpressed hNEP into skeletal muscle. Moreover, hNEP-treated AD mice exhibited improved performance in the Morris water maze compared to that of untreated AD mice. In addition, there were no apparent injuries in the injected muscle or in the lungs or kidneys at 1 month after the delivery of hNEP into skeletal muscle. These findings suggest that the introduction of hNEP into skeletal muscle via US represents an effective and safe therapeutic strategy for ameliorating AD-like symptoms in APP/PS1 mice, which may have the potential for clinical applications in the future.
