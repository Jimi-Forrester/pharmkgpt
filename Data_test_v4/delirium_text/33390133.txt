33390133|a|BACKGROUND: Currently, the pharmacological management of Alzheimer's disease is based on several chemical structures, represented by acetylcholinesterase and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor ligands, with still unclear molecular mechanisms and severe side effects. For this reason, a challenge for Alzheimer's disease treatment remains to identify new drugs with reduced side effects. Recently, the natural compounds, particularly, certain chemical compounds identified in the essential oil of peppermint, sage, grapes, sea buckthorn, have increased interest as possible therapeutics. OBJECTIVES: In this paper, we have summarized data from the recent literature on several chemical compounds extracted from Salvia officinalis L., with therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: In addition to the wide range of experimental methods performed in vivo and in vitro, we also presented some in silico studies of medicinal compounds. RESULTS: Through this mini-review, we presented the latest information regarding the therapeutic characteristics of natural compounds isolated from Salvia officinalis L. in Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: Thus, based on the information presented, we can say that phytotherapy is a reliable therapeutic method in a neurodegenerative disease.
