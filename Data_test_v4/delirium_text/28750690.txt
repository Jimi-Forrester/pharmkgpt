28750690|t|Increased Abeta42-alpha7-like nicotinic acetylcholine receptor complex level in lymphocytes is associated with apolipoprotein E4-driven Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
28750690|a|BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE4) genotype is a prominent late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factor. ApoE4 disrupts memory function in rodents and may contribute to both plaque and tangle formation. METHODS: Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot detection were used to determine: 1) the effects of select fragments from the apoE low-density lipoprotein (LDL) binding domain and recombinant apoE subtypes on amyloid beta (Abeta)42-alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) interaction and tau phosphorylation in rodent brain synaptosomes; and 2) the level of Abeta42-alpha7nAChR complexes in matched controls and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia due to AD with known APOE genotypes. RESULTS: In an ex vivo study using rodent synaptosomes, apoE141-148 of the apoE promotes Abeta42-alpha7nAChR association and Abeta42-induced alpha7nAChR-dependent tau phosphorylation. In a single-blind study, we examined lymphocytes isolated from control subjects, patients with MCI and dementia due to AD with known APOE genotypes, sampled at two time points (1 year apart). APOE epsilon4 genotype was closely correlated with heightened Abeta42-alpha7nAChR complex levels and with blunted exogenous Abeta42 effects in lymphocytes derived from AD and MCI due to AD cases. Similarly, plasma from APOE epsilon4 carriers enhanced the Abeta42-induced Abeta42-alpha7nAChR association in rat cortical synaptosomes. The progression of cognitive decline in APOE epsilon4 carriers correlated with higher levels of Abeta42-alpha7nAChR complexes in lymphocytes and greater enhancement by their plasma of Abeta42-induced Abeta42-alpha7nAChR association in rat cortical synaptosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that increased lymphocyte Abeta42-alpha7nAChR-like complexes may indicate the presence of AD pathology especially in APOE epsilon4 carriers. We show that apoE, especially apoE4, promotes Abeta42-alpha7nAChR interaction and Abeta42-induced alpha7nAChR-dependent tau phosphorylation via its apoE141-148 domain. These apoE-mediated effects may contribute to the APOE epsilon4-driven neurodysfunction and AD pathologies.
