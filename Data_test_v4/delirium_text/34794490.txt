34794490|a|Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has yielded impressive outcomes and transformed treatment algorithms for hematological malignancies. To date, five CAR T-cell products have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Nevertheless, some significant toxicities pose great challenges to the development of CAR T-cell therapy, most notably cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Understanding the mechanisms underlying these toxicities and establishing prevention and treatment strategies are important. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms underlying CRS and ICANS and provide potential treatment and prevention strategies.
