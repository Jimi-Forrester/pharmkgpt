36432206|t|Fractionation and Extraction Optimization of Potentially Valuable Compounds and Their Profiling in Six Varieties of Two Nicotiana Species.
36432206|a|There is an increasingly urgent call to shift industrial processes from fossil fuel feedstock to sustainable bio-based resources. This change becomes of high importance considering new budget requirements for a carbon-neutral economy. Such a transformation can be driven by traditionally used plants that are able to produce large amounts of valuable biologically relevant secondary metabolites. Tobacco plants can play a leading role in providing value-added products in remote areas of the world. In this study, we propose a non-exhaustive list of compounds with potential economic interest that can be sourced from the tobacco plant. In order to optimize extraction methodologies, we first analyzed their physico-chemical properties using rapid solubility tests and high-resolution microfractionation techniques. Next, to identify an optimal extraction for a selected list of compounds, we compared 13 different extraction method-solvent combinations. We proceeded with profiling some of these compounds in a total of six varieties from Nicotiana tabacum and Nicotiana rustica species, identifying the optimal variety for each. The estimated expected yields for each of these compounds demonstrate that tobacco plants can be a superior source of valuable compounds with diverse applications beyond nicotine. Among the most interesting results, we found high variability of anatabine content between species and varieties, ranging from 287 to 1699 microg/g. In addition, we found that CGA (1305 microg/g) and rutin (7910 microg/g) content are orders of magnitude lower in the Burley variety as compared to all others.
