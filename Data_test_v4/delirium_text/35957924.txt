35957924|t|Hip Fracture Surgery in Severe Aortic Stenosis: A Study of Factors Affecting Mortality.
35957924|a|Background: In elderly patients with hip fracture, the prevalence of severe aortic stenosis (valve area <1 cm2) is close to 5%. Few studies have evaluated the prognostic role of aortic stenosis in hip fracture surgery and none has considered the effects of the postoperative setting (intensive care unit vs general ward) on clinical outcome. Purpose: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the factors affecting mortality in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing surgery for hip fracture. We also evaluated whether postoperative monitoring in the intensive care unit may affect the prognosis in comparison to return to the general ward after surgery. Patients and Methods: All 2274 patients referred for hip fracture to our tertiary teaching hospital between January 1 2015 and December 31 2019 were screened for the presence of severe aortic stenosis, defined by an aortic valve area <1.0 cm2. Results: The study included 66 patients (27 males, 39 females) with a mean+-SD age of 85+-7 years. The average time between trauma and surgery was 2.6+-3 days. The mean aortic valve area was 0.74+-0.15 cm2. Seven patients died during hospitalization (10.4%). Diabetes, having two or more comorbidities, a low degree of autonomy, heart failure, history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, postoperative delirium and pulmonary hypertension were associated with poorer outcome. In logistic multivariate analysis, the number of diseases and values of pulmonary artery pressure were the only independent factors related to mortality. In hospital mortality (12 and 9%, respectively) and complication rates were not statistically different between patients referred to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring and patients returned to the general ward after surgery. Conclusion: In patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, severe aortic stenosis is associated with high hospital mortality, and two or more comorbidities and pulmonary hypertension are associated with a worse prognosis. The postoperative setting (intensive care unit or general ward) does not affect outcome.
