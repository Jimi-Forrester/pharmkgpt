38491912|a|BACKGROUND: With the availability of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is important for clinicians to have tests to aid in AD diagnosis, especially when the presence of amyloid pathology is a criterion for receiving treatment. METHODS: High-throughput, mass spectrometry-based assays were used to measure %p-tau217 and amyloid beta (Abeta)42/40 ratio in blood samples from 583 individuals with suspected AD (53% positron emission tomography [PET] positive by Centiloid > 25). An algorithm (PrecivityAD2 test) was developed using these plasma biomarkers to identify brain amyloidosis by PET. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for %p-tau217 (0.94) was statistically significantly higher than that for p-tau217 concentration (0.91). The AUC-ROC for the PrecivityAD2 test output, the Amyloid Probability Score 2, was 0.94, yielding 88% agreement with amyloid PET. Diagnostic performance of the APS2 was similar by ethnicity, sex, age, and apoE4 status. DISCUSSION: The PrecivityAD2 blood test showed strong clinical validity, with excellent agreement with brain amyloidosis by PET.
