33953963|a|The exact mechanism of retinal ganglion cell loss in the pathogenesis of glaucoma is yet to be understood. Mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction have been linked to Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and autosomal dominant optic atrophy, as well as to brain neurodegenerative diseases. Recent evidence shows that, in conditions where mitochondria are damaged, a sustained inflammatory response and downstream pathological inflammation may ensue. Mitochondrial damage has been linked to the accumulation of age-related mitochondrial DNA mutations and mitochondrial dysfunction, possibly through aberrant reactive oxygen species production and defective mitophagy. The present review focuses on how mitochondrial dysfunction may overwhelm the ability of neurons and glial cells to adequately maintain homeostasis and how mitochondria-derived DAMPs trigger the immune system and induce neurodegeneration.
