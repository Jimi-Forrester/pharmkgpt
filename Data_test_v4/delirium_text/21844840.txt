21844840|a|Salicylaldehyde 2-chlorobenzoyl hydrazone (H(2)LASSBio-466), salicylaldehyde 4-chlorobenzoyl hydrazone (H(2)LASSBio-1064) and their complexes [Zn(LASSBio-466)H(2)O](2) (1) and [Zn(HLASSBio-1064)Cl](2) (2) were evaluated in animal models of peripheral and central nociception, and acute inflammation. All studied compounds significantly inhibited acetic acid-induced writhing response. Upon coordination the anti-nociceptive activity was favored in the complex 1. H(2)LASSBio-466 inhibited only the first phase of the formalin test, while 1 was active in the second phase, like indomethacin, indicating its ability to inhibit nociception associated with the inflammatory response. Hence coordination to zinc(II) altered the pharmacological profile of H(2)LASSBio-466. H(2)LASSBio-1064 inhibited both phases but this effect was not improved by coordination. The studied compounds did not increase the latency of response in the hot plate model, indicating their lack of central anti-nociceptive activity. All compounds showed levels of inhibition of zymosan-induced peritonitis comparable or superior to indomethacin, indicating an expressive anti-inflammatory profile.
