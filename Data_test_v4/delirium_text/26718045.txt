26718045|t|11 Reversible methylation of protein phosphatase 2A.
26718045|a|PP2A has been shown to be methylated at the C-terminal leucine residue of the catalytic subunit by a specific 38 kDa methyltransferase (LCMT1) and demethylated by a specific 44-kDa methylesterase (PME-1). This reversible methylation does not seem to drastically change the PP2A activity but is shown to be a modulating factor in the binding of the third regulatory subunit. The structure of LCMT1 is solved and a model for the catalysis of the methylation reaction is presented. By purifying the PP2A-methylesterase, inactive dimeric (PP2AiD) and trimeric (PP2AiT55) holoenzymes were found to be associated with PME-1. Activation of this inactive complex is possible by the action of a ubiquitous and highly conserved activatory protein, PTPA. The function of PME-1in this system seems to be independent of its demethylating activity. A large proportion of cellular PP2A is found methylated and the subject of regulation. Aberrant (de)methylation seems to be involved in the causes of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and diabetes.
