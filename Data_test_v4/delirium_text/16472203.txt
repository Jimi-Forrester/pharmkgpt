16472203|t|Environment, physical activity, and neurogenesis: implications for prevention and treatment of Alzhemier's disease.
16472203|a|Age is the biggest risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, as the population ages it becomes more critical to find ways to avoid the debilitating cost of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Some of the non-invasive strategies that can potentially slow down the mental decline associated with aging are exercise and use of multi-sensory environmental stimulation. The beneficial effects of both exercise and multi-sensory environmental stimulation have been well-documented, thus it is possible that these strategies can either provide neuroprotection or increase resistance to the development of age-related cognitive problems.
