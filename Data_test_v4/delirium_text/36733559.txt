36733559|t|Heat Stroke Leading to a Fatal Outcome.
36733559|a|Heat stroke (HS) can cause several physiological changes in the body. In its most severe form, it can cause multi-organ failure including encephalopathy, circulatory shock, liver failure, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and rhabdomyolysis among others. HS is a preventable condition; however, it can be life-threatening in severe forms. We present a case of HS in a 54-year-old male, with rapidly progressive multi-organ failure and a fatal outcome along with a brief literature review.
