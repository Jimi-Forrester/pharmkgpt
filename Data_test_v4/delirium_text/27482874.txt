27482874|t|Use of Daily Interruption of Sedation and Early Mobility in US Hospitals.
27482874|a|Although the Awakening and Breathing Coordination, Delirium assessment, and Early exercise/mobility (ABCDE) bundle may be effective, individual components of ABCDE may not be implemented as intended. We examined the use of daily interruption of sedation (DIS) and early mobility, looking for an association between these bundle elements. Despite the growing use of DIS and early mobility, the two do not seem to be adopted together, with serious implications for the effectiveness of the ABCDE bundle.
