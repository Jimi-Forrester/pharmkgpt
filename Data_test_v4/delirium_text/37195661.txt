37195661|t|Receipt of Medications for Chronic Disease During the First 2 Years of the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Enrollees in Fee-for-Service Medicare.
37195661|a|Importance: During the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, inpatient and ambulatory care declined dramatically. Little is known about prescription drug receipt during this period, particularly for populations with chronic illness and with high risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes and decreased access to care. Objective: To investigate whether receipt of medications was maintained during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic among older people with chronic diseases, particularly Asian, Black, and Hispanic populations and people with dementia, who faced pandemic-related care disruptions. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used a 100% sample of US Medicare fee-for-service administrative data from 2019 to 2021 for community-dwelling beneficiaries aged 65 years or older. Population-based prescription fill rates were compared for 2020 and 2021 vs 2019. Data were analyzed from July 2022 to March 2023. Exposure: The COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures: Age- and sex-adjusted monthly prescription fill rates were calculated for 5 groups of medications commonly prescribed for chronic disease : angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), oral diabetes medications, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medications, and antidepressants. Measurements were stratified by race and ethnicity group and dementia diagnosis. Secondary analyses measured changes in the proportion of prescriptions dispensed as a 90-day or greater supply. Results: Overall, the mean monthly cohort included 18 113 000 beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 74.5 [7.4] years; 10 520 000 females [58.1%]; 587 000 Asian [3.2%], 1 069 000 Black [5.9%], 905 000 Hispanic [5.0%], and 14 929 000 White [82.4%]); 1 970 000 individuals (10.9%) were diagnosed with dementia. Across 5 drug classifications, mean fill rates increased by 2.07% (95% CI, 2.01% to 2.12%) in 2020 and decreased by 2.61% (95% CI, -2.67% to -2.56%) in 2021 compared with 2019. Fill rates decreased by less than the mean overall decrease for Black enrollees (-1.42%; 95% CI, -1.64% to -1.20%) and Asian enrollees (-1.05%; 95% CI, -1.36% to -0.77%) and people diagnosed with dementia (-0.38%; 95% CI, -0.54% to -0.23%). The proportion of fills dispensed as 90-day or greater supplies increased during the pandemic for all groups, with an increase per 100 fills of 3.98 fills (95% CI, 3.94 to 4.03 fills) overall. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that, in contrast to in-person health services, receipt of medications for chronic conditions was relatively stable in the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic overall, across racial and ethnic groups, and for community-dwelling patients with dementia. This finding of stability may hold lessons for other outpatient services during the next pandemic.
