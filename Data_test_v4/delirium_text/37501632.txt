37501632|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease and related-dementias progress over time and result in cognitive decline, loss of independence, and behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD) that can lead to nursing home placement. Research has focused on examining the effects of nursing home placement on the family caregiver; however, their experiences are less understood. We sought to investigate the experiences and perceptions of family caregivers of nursing home residents with dementia. The objective was to create a conceptual model that explains the complex nature of family caregiver experience. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study is part of a larger randomized controlled trial. Following a grounded theory approach, we completed 30 in-depth, one-on-one interviews with family caregivers of nursing home residents with dementia. Data analysis followed an iterative process that employed open, axial, and selective coding. RESULTS: Our conceptual model depicts the interrelationship between contributing factors that interrelate and impact family caregiver satisfaction with nursing home care. Six factors contribute to family caregiver satisfaction: family caregiver interactions with nursing home staff; staff management of resident behavioral symptoms; nursing home context; family caregiver knowledge of dementias; family caregiver strain; and the resident experience. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings revealed family caregiver experiences that are unique to the institutional nursing home setting and not reflected in prior work focusing on experiences within community-based settings.Understanding family caregiver experiences and the contributors to how satisfaction in care is perceived, may foster collaboration and teamwork among families and staff.
