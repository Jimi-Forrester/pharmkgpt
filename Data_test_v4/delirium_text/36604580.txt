36604580|t|Serum microRNA as a potential biomarker for the activity of thyroid eye disease.
36604580|a|The aim of this study is to characterize the microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures in patients with thyroid eye disease (TED) and identify miRNA biomarkers of disease activity. Total RNA was isolated from the sera of patients with TED (n = 10) and healthy controls (HCs, n = 5) using the miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit. The NanoString assay was used for the comprehensive analysis of 798 miRNA expression profiles. Analysis of specific miRNA signatures, mRNA target pathway analysis, and network analysis were performed. Patients with TED were divided into two groups according to disease activity: active and inactive TED groups. Differentially expressed circulating miRNAs were identified and tested using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) tests in the validation cohort. Among the 798 miRNAs analyzed, 173 differentially downregulated miRNAs were identified in TED patients compared to those in the HCs. Ten circulating miRNAs were differentially expressed between the active and inactive TED groups and regarded as candidate biomarkers for TED activity (one upregulated miRNA: miR-29c-3p; nine downregulated miRNAs: miR-4286, miR-941, miR-571, miR-129-2-3p, miR-484, miR-192-5p, miR-502-3p, miR-597-5p, and miR-296-3p). In the validation cohort, miR-484 and miR-192-5p showed significantly lower expression in the active TED group than in the inactive TED group. In conclusion, the expression levels of miR-484 and miR-192-5p differed significantly between the active and inactive TED groups, suggesting that these miRNAs could serve as circulating biomarkers of TED activity, however, these findings need to be validated in further studies.
