29891780|t|The Role of Procalcitonin in the Diagnosis of Meningitis: A Literature Review.
29891780|a|OBJECTIVE: To review the current published literature on the use of procalcitonin as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in adult patients with meningitis. METHODS: We conducted a PubMed search to identify all relevant publications regarding the diagnostic and prognostic value of serum procalcitonin in patients with a known or suspected central nervous system infection. We also reviewed the bibliographies of all identified manuscripts in an attempt to identify additional relevant references. RESULTS: A significant body of evidence suggests that serum procalcitonin has a promising role and can be a useful biomarker in the assessment of patients with meningitis. CONCLUSIONS: Our literature review suggests that data on the role of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) procalcitonin are limited, whereas serum procalcitonin (S-PCT) is probably a useful tool in the evaluation of patients with a known or suspected central nervous system infection and can help distinguish between bacterial and viral meningitis.
