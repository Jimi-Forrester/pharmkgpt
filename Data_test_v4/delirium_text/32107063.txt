32107063|a|Several studies have investigated the differential vulnerability of hippocampal subfields during aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Results were often contradictory, mainly because these works were based on concatenations of cross-sectional measures in cohorts with different ages or stages of AD, in the absence of a longitudinal design. Here, we investigated 327 participants from a population-based cohort of nondemented older adults with a 14-year clinical follow-up. MRI at baseline and 4 years later were assessed to measure the annualized rates of hippocampal subfields atrophy in each participant using an automatic segmentation pipeline with subsequent quality control. On the one hand, CA4 dentate gyrus was significantly more affected than the other subfields in the whole population (CA1-3: -0.68%/year; subiculum: -0.99%/year; and CA4-DG: -1.39%/year; p < 0.0001). On the other hand, the annualized rate of CA1-3 atrophy was associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's clinical syndrome over time, independently of age, gender, educational level, and ApoE4 genotype (HR = 2.0; CI 95% 1.4-3.0). These results illustrate the natural history of hippocampal subfields atrophy during aging and AD by showing that the dentate gyrus is the most vulnerable subfield to the effects of aging while the cornu-ammonis is the primary target of AD pathophysiological processes, years before symptom onset.
