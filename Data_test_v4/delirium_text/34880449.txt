34880449|a|One of the central aims in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is the identification of clinically relevant drug targets. A plethora of potential molecular targets work very well in preclinical model systems both in vitro and in vivo in AD mouse models. However, the lack of translation into clinical settings in the AD field is a challenging endeavor. Although it is long known that N-terminally truncated and pyroglutamate-modified Abeta (AbetapE3) peptides are abundantly present in the brain of AD patients, form stable and soluble low-molecular weight oligomers, and induce neurodegeneration in AD mouse models, their potential as drug target has not been generally accepted in the past. This situation has dramatically changed with the report that passive immunization with donanemab, an AbetapE3-specific antibody, cleared aymloid plaques and stabilized cognitive deficits in a group of patients with mild AD in a phase II trial. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of generation of AbetapE, its biochemical properties, and the intervention points as a drug target in AD.
