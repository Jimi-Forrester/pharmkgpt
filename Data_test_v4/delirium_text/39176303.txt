39176303|a|In an era of 'big data', we propose that a collaborative network approach will drive a better understanding of the mechanisms of delirium, and more rapid development of therapies. We have formed the International Delirium Pathophysiology & Electrophysiology Network for Data sharing (iDEPEND) group with a key aim to 'facilitate the study of delirium pathogenesis with electrophysiology, imaging, and biomarkers including data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation'. Our initial focus is on studies of electrophysiology as we anticipate this methodology has great potential to enhance our understanding of delirium. Our article describes this principle and is used to highlight the endeavour to the wider community as we establish key stakeholders and partnerships.
