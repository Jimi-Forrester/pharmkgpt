36310229|t|Cross-Seeding Assay in the Investigation of the Amyloid Core of Prion Fibrils.
36310229|a|Amyloidogenesis, self-propagation of protein or peptide monomers to amyloid fibrils, has been linked to incurable pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and prion diseases. Investigations of amyloid structures and how monomers are transformed through seeding are therefore crucial for developing therapeutics toward these diseases. Here we describe a cross-seeding method to explore the amyloid core in prion fibrils that uses preformed amyloid fibrils as a seed to induce the transformation of other protein or peptide monomers to amyloid fibrils.
