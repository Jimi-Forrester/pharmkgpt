39435240|t|Healthcare Provider's Preferences on Open Versus Restricted Visiting Hours in Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
39435240|a|BACKGROUND: The increasing consideration of open visiting hours in intensive care units (ICUs) has presented implementation challenges. Recognizing the invaluable insights of healthcare providers, this study aimed to assess their perspectives on the potential impact of altering ICU visiting policies on patient care. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  In a single-institution, cross-sectional study, a five-point Likert survey was administered to healthcare providers working in a surgical ICU to assess their perceptions of open and restricted visiting hours. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the responses. RESULTS: Ninety-three healthcare providers participated, including nurses (53%), resident physicians (23%), and other healthcare professionals. The majority (81%) did not believe that open ICU visiting hours would enhance patient-centered care. Providers expressed concerns that open visitation could lead to increased provider stress (89%), physical barriers to patient access (80%), disruption in workflow (90%), and provider burnout (76%). Conversely, they perceived that restricted visitation would preserve patient privacy (87%), promote better healing for patients (64%), reduce provider stress (81%), and improve workflow (95%). Nurses were more likely than resident physicians to perceive that open ICU hours would alleviate familial stress (p=0.022). Additionally, both nurses and other healthcare providers recognized the potential for open ICU hours to improve communication between patient families and healthcare teams (p<0.05). Notably, there were no significant differences among providers in perceptions of the impact of open versus restricted visitation on provider stress, workflow, or other factors (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This survey reveals a negative perception of open ICU visiting hours among healthcare providers in a surgical ICU, with concerns that such a change could increase stress for both patients and providers. These findings underscore the potential challenges and negative impacts of implementing open visiting hours in this setting, emphasizing the need for careful consideration and further research to inform policy decisions and visitation practices.
