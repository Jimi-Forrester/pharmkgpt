38045339|a|Aging can be associated with the accumulation of hypobranched glycogen molecules (polyglucosan bodies, PGBs), particularly in astrocytes of the hippocampus. While PGBs have a detrimental effect on cognition in diseases such as adult polyglucosan body disease and Lafora disease, the underlying mechanism and clinical relevance of age-related PGB accumulation remains unknown. Here, we have investigated the genetic basis and functional impact of age-related PGB accumulation in 32 fully sequenced BXD-type strains of mice which exhibit a 400-fold variation in PGB burden in 16-18 month old females. We mapped a major locus controlling PGB density in the hippocampus to chromosome 1 at 72-75 Mb (linkage of 4.9 -logP), which we defined as the Pgb1 locus. To identify potentially causal gene variants within Pgb1 , we generated extensive hippocampal transcriptome datasets and identified two strong candidate genes for which mRNA correlates with PGB density- Smarcal1 and Usp37 . In addition, both Smarcal1 and Usp37 contain non-synonymous allele variations likely to impact protein function. A phenome-wide association analysis highlighted a trans-regulatory effect of the Pgb1 locus on expression of Hp1bp3 , a gene known to play a role in age-related changes in learning and memory. To investigate the potential impact of PGBs on cognition, we performed conditioned fear memory testing on strains displaying varying degrees of PGB burden, and a phenome-wide association scan of ~12,000 traits. Importantly, we did not find any evidence suggesting a negative impact of PGB burden on cognitive capacity. Taken together, we have identified a major modifier locus controlling PGB burden in the hippocampus and shed light on the genetic architecture and clinical relevance of this strikingly heterogeneous hippocampal phenotype.
