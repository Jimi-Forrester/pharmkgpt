34839208|t|Structural brain network correlations with amyloid burden in elderly individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease.
34839208|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a long preclinical phase during which beta-amyloid accumulates in the brain without cognitive impairment. However, the pattern of brain network alterations in this early stage of the disease remains to be clarified. In this study we examined the relationships between regional brain network indices and beta-amyloid deposits. Twenty-four elderly subjects with the APOE4 allele underwent both a 1.5-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and a positron emission tomography (PET) scan using [18F]Florbetapir. We computed network metrics such as the degree, betweenness centrality, and clustering coefficient, and examined the relationships between the beta-amyloid accumulation and these regional brain network connectivity metrics. We found a significant positive correlation between the global standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of [18F]Florbetapir and the betweenness centrality in the left parietal region. However, there were no significant correlations between the SUVR score and other network indices or the regional gray matter volume. Our data suggest a relationship between the beta-amyloid accumulation and the regional brain network connectivity in subjects at risk of AD. The brain connectome may provide an adjunct biomarker for the early detection of AD.
