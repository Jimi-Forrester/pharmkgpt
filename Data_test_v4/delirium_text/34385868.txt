34385868|a|In this study, a new series of Mannich bases, 3-(aminomethyl)-6-{3-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]acryloyl}-2( 3H )-benzoxazolones ( 1a-g ), were synthesized by the Mannich reaction. Inhibitory effects of the newly synthesized compounds towards carbonic anhydrases (CAs) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymes were evaluated to find out new potential drug candidate compounds. According to the inhibitory activity results, Ki values of the compounds 1 and 1a-g were in the range of 12.3 +- 1.2 to 154.0 +- 9.3 nM against hCA I, and they were in the range of 8.6 +- 1.9 to 41.0 +- 5.5 nM against hCA II. Ki values of acetazolamide (AZA) that was used as a reference compound were 84.4 +- 8.4 nM towards hCA I and 59.2 +- 4.8 nM towards hCA II. Ki values of the compounds 1 and 1a-g were in the range of 35.2 +- 2.0 to 158.9 +- 33.5 nM towards AChE. Ki value of Tacrine (TAC), the reference compound, was 68.6 +- 3.8 nM towards AChE. Furthermore, docking studies were done with the most potent compounds 1d , 1g , and 1f (in terms of hCA I, hCA II, and AChE inhibition effects, respectively) to determine the binding profiles of the series with these enzymes. Additionally, the prediction of ADME profiles of the compounds pointed out that the newly synthesized compounds had desirable physicochemical properties as lead compounds for further studies.
