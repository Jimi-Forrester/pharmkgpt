33116892|t|GSTM3 Function and Polymorphism in Cancer: Emerging but Promising.
33116892|a|Cancer is a major cause of human mortality; however, the molecular mechanisms and proteomic biomarkers that cause tumor progression in malignant tumors are either unknown or only partially revealed. Glutathione S-transferases mu3 (GSTM3), which belongs to a family of xenobiotic detoxifying phase II enzymes, is associated with carcinogen detoxification and the metabolism of exogenous electrophilic substances. It has been reported that GSTM3 has different polymorphisms in various tumor cells and regulates tumorigenesis, cell invasion, metastasis, chemoresistance, and oxidative stress. Deep research into the regulatory mechanisms involved in disorders of GSTM3 expression and the function of GSTM3 in different cancers may facilitate improvements in cancer prevention and targeted therapy. The combination of GSTM3 with other family members can regulate the carcinogenesis and susceptibility to different cancers in humans. GSTM3 also regulates the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and participates in oxidative stress-mediated pathology. Here, we provide a general introduction to GSTM3 in order to better understand the role of GSTM3 in cancer.
