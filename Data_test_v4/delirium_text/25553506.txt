25553506|a|BACKGROUND: This prospective and randomized study was designed to compare safety, potential complications, and patient and examiner satisfaction of 2 anesthetic combinations - etomidate-remifentanil and propofol-remifentanil - in elderly patients undergoing diagnostic gastroscopy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A group of 720 patients, aged 60-80 years, scheduled for diagnostic gastroscopy under sedation were prospectively randomized. After 0.4-0.6 mug kg-1 of remifentanil was infused, etomidate or propofol was administered. Patients in the etomidate group received doses of etomidate at 0.1-0.15 mg kg-1 followed by 4-6 mg. Patients in the propofol group received doses of propofol at 1-2 mg kg-1 followed by 20-40 mg. Physiological indexes were evaluated for the 715 of 720 patients that completed the treatment. The onset time, duration time, and discharge time were recorded. Physicians, anesthetists, and patients were surveyed to assess their satisfaction. RESULTS: Systolic pressure and diastolic pressure decreased significantly after the procedure in the propofol group (P<0.001). The average heart rate was significantly lower in the propofol group (P<0.05). No periods of desaturation (SpO2 <95%) were observed in either group. The onset time was earlier in the etomidate group (P=0.00). All adverse events, with the exception of myoclonus, were greater in the propofol group, and physician and patient satisfaction in both groups was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Etomidate-remifentanil administration for sedation and analgesia during gastroscopy resulted in more stable hemodynamic responses and less adverse events in older patients.
