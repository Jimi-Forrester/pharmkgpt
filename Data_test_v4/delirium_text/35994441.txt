35994441|a|BACKGROUND: During follow-up, patients severely affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), show symptoms of Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) such as cognitive impairment, psychological disability, and neuromuscular deconditioning. In COVID-19 pandemic, it is a priority to develop multidisciplinary post-acute care services to address the long-term multisystemic impact of COVID-19. RESEARCH QUESTION: Which are the most relevant multisystemic sequelae in severe post-COVID-19 patients? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Observational chart review study that included adult patients discharged from a referral hospital for respiratory diseases in Mexico after recovering from severe COVID-19 disease from December 23, 2020, to April 24, 2021. Data were collected from 280 of 612 potentially eligible patients to evaluate persistent symptoms and compare sequelae in patients who required intubation, using a standardized questionnaire of symptoms, in addition to findings reported during the face-to-face health assessment. Univariable and multivariate analyses were performed for the association among the requirement of IMV and the long-term persistence of symptoms. RESULTS: 280 patients were included. The median age was 55 (range, 19 to 86) years, and 152 (54.3%) were men. The mean length of hospital stay was 19 (SD, 14.1) days. During hospitalization 168 (60%) participants received IMV. A large proportion of these patients reported fatigue (38.7%), paresthesia (35.1%), dyspnea (32.7%) and headache (28%); meanwhile only 3 (1.8%) of them were asymptomatic. Patients who required intubation were more likely to have neuropsychiatric (67.3% vs 55.4%; OR, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.08 to 2.97]) and musculoskeletal involvement (38.7% vs. 25.9%; OR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.12 to 3.27]), adjusted for age,sex and hospitalization time. INTERPRETATION: The proportion of patients requiring intubation was 60%, reporting persistent symptoms in 98% of them. Neuropsychiatric and musculoskeletal symptoms were the most predominant symptoms in these patients, with a significant difference. Post-COVID-19 syndrome is a frequent problem in patients who required IVM. Physicians in ICU and in care of COVID-19 patients should be aware of this syndrome in order to avoid more complications.
