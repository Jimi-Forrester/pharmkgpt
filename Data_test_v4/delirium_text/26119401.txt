26119401|a|The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as a key energy sensor in a wide variety of tissues. This kinase has been a major drug target for metabolic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes) and cancers. For example, metformin (an activator of AMPK) is a first-line diabetes drug that protects against cancers. Abnormal regulation of AMPK has been implicated in several brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and stroke. Given the emerging importance of neurodegenerative diseases in our aging societies, this review features the recent studies that have delineated the functions of AMPK in brain diseases and discusses their potential clinical implications or roles as drug targets in brain diseases.
