36920637|t|Clonal Hematopoiesis and the Heart: a Toxic Relationship.
36920637|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) refers to the expansion of hematopoietic stem cell clones and their cellular progeny due to somatic mutations, mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs), or copy number variants which naturally accumulate with age. CH has been linked to increased risk of blood cancers, but CH has also been linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: A combination of clinical outcome studies and mouse models have offered strong evidence that CH mutations either correlate with or cause atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, aortic aneurysm, myocardial infarction, stroke, aortic stenosis, poor outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or orthotopic heart transplant, death or need of renal replacement therapy secondary to cardiogenic shock, death from cardiovascular causes at large, and enhance anthracycline cardiac toxicity. Mechanistically, some adverse outcomes are caused by macrophage secretion of IL-1beta and IL-6, neutrophil invasion of injured myocardium, and T-cell skewing towards inflammatory phenotypes. CH mutations lead to harmful inflammation and arterial wall invasion by bone marrow-derived cells resulting in poor cardiovascular health and outcomes. Blockade of IL-1beta or JAK2 signaling are potential avenues for preventing CH-caused cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
