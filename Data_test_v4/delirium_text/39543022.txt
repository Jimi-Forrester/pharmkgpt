39543022|t|The Contribution of the Renin-Angiotensin System to Alzheimer's Disease.
39543022|a|The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is becoming increasingly recognised as a biochemical pathway relevant to the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). RAS involvement in AD was initially linked to AD via numerous genetic association studies and more recent Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), and in some cases in relation to classical hallmarks of AD pathology. Since these initial findings, which will be summarised here, several complementary areas of research are converging in support of what has been proposed as the Angiotensin Hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease. This hypothesis proposes how the RAS and disease-associated changes to the normal balance between opposing regulatory pathways within RAS warrant careful consideration in the pathogenesis of AD and its pathology. We discuss some of these in relation to RAS-targeting therapeutics, originally developed for the treatment of cardiovascular conditions, and how they might be repurposed as interventions for AD.
