35636906|a|Postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or long coronavirus disease (COVID) is an emerging syndrome characterized by multiple persisting or newly emergent symptoms following the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For affected patients, these prolonged symptoms can have a relapsing and remitting course and may be associated with disability and frequent health care utilization. Although many symptom-driven treatments are available, management remains challenging and often requires a multidisciplinary approach. This article summarizes the emerging consensus on definitions, epidemiology, and pathophysiology of long COVID and discusses what is understood about prevention, evaluation, and treatment of this syndrome.
