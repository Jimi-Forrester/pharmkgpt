38293017|a|More than one million people in the United States and over 38 million people worldwide are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) greatly improves the health of people living with HIV (PLWH); however, the increased life longevity of PLWH has revealed consequences of HIV-associated comorbidities. HIV can enter the brain and cause inflammation even in individuals with well-controlled HIV infection. The quality of life for PLWH can be compromised by cognitive deficits and memory loss, termed HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND). HIV-associated dementia is a related but distinct diagnosis. Common causes of dementia in PLWH are similar to the general population and can affect cognition. There is an urgent need to identify treatments for the aging PWLH population. We previously developed AI-based biomedical literature mining systems to uncover a potential novel connection between HAND the renin-angiotensin system (RAAS), which is a pharmacological target for hypertension. RAAS-targeting anti-hypertensives are gaining attention for their protective benefits in several neurocognitive disorders. To our knowledge, the effect of RAAS-targeting drugs on the cognition of PLWH development of dementia has not previously been analyzed. We hypothesized that exposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) that cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) reduces the risk/occurrence of dementia in PLWH. We report a retrospective cohort study of electronic health records (EHRs) to examine the proposed hypothesis using data from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, in which a primary outcome of dementia was measured in controlled cohorts of patients exposed to BBB-penetrant ACEi versus those unexposed to BBB-penetrant ACEi. The results reveal a statistically significant reduction in dementia diagnosis for PLWH exposed to BBB-penetrant ACEi. These results suggest there is a potential protective effect of BBB ACE inhibitor exposure against dementia in PLWH that warrants further investigation.
