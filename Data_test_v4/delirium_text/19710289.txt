19710289|a|The undertreatment of postoperative pain in older adults with delirium is attributed, in part, to the inability to complete self-report pain assessment instruments. Patients' loss of verbal skills to self-report pain and the lack of reliable and valid postoperative pain assessment instruments for use in older adults with delirium prompted the design of a study to identify common and subtle behavioral indicators of pain. Sixteen experienced registered nurses participating in four focus groups identified behavioral indicators of pain.Transcript analysis resulted in 89 behaviors indicative of pain. Seven researchers with expertise in pain and cognitive impairment in older adults reached 80% agreement on 22 behavioral indicators. The behavioral indicators were classified within one of four pain behavior categories (nonverbal cues/behaviors, vocalizations, facial expressions, and change in usual behavior), and each behavioral indicator was identified as common or subtle. Findings provide evidence of content validity for the pain behaviors.
