38790420|t|Mechanism of Microwave Radiation-Induced Learning and Memory Impairment Based on Hippocampal Metabolomics.
38790420|a|The brain is complex and metabolically active, and the detection of metabolites plays an important role in brain development and diseases. Currently, there is a lack of research on the metabolic spectrum changes in learning and memory impairment, and hippocampal damage induced by microwave radiation from the metabolic perspective. Aiming to provide sensitive indicators for microwave radiation-induced brain damage and establish a foundation for understanding its injury mechanisms, this study employed non-targeted metabolomics to investigate metabolic fluctuations and key metabolic pathway alterations in rats' hippocampal tissue after microwave radiation. The memory and spatial exploration abilities of rats decreased after radiation. The postsynaptic densities were thickened in the MW group. The cholesterol sulfate, SM(d16:1/24:1(15Z)), and linoelaidylcarnitine were significantly increased after radiation, whereas etrahydrocorticosterone, L-phenylalanine, and histamine were significantly decreased after radiation. These metabolites were enriched in signaling pathways related to the inflammatory mediator regulation of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. These findings indicate that microwave radiation causes spatial learning and memory dysfunction in rats and structural damage to hippocampal tissue.
