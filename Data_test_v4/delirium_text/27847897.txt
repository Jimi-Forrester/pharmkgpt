27847897|a|In 2012, surviving sepsis campaign came out with updated international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock. Paradoxically, there are no specific guidelines for management of sepsis in the elderly, although the elderly are more predisposed to sepsis, and morbidity and mortality related to sepsis. Sepsis in the elderly is, more often than not, complicated by clinical conundrums such as congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute kidney injury (AKI), delirium, dementia, ambulatory dysfunction, polypharmacy, malglycemia, nutritional deficiencies, and antibiotic resistance. Also, with recurrent admissions to the hospital and widespread use of antibiotics, the elderly are more susceptible to Clostridium difficile colitis.
