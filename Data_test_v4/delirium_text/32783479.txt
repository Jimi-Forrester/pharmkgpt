32783479|a|Resistiveness to care is very common among patients of dementia as these patients do not take medicines, meals or bath very easily. Indeed, it is a very challenging task for health caregivers and there is a significant rise in time and cost involved in managing dementia patients. Amongst different factors, the type of communication between resident dementia patients and health caregivers is an important contributing factor in the development of resistiveness to care. Elderspeak (baby talk) is a type of communication in which health caregivers adjust their language and style while interacting with elderly and dependent patients. It involves the use of short sentences, simple grammar, slow and high pitch voice, repeating phrases to provide a comfortable and friendly environment to patients. Most of the time, caregivers tend to adapt elderspeak as they handle weak and fragile older patients for routine activities. Although elderspeak is meant to provide support, warmth and care to patients, yet patients perceive elderspeak as patronizing and it induces negative feelings about self-esteem. Scientists have found a correlation between the development of resistiveness to care and the extent of elderspeak in communication. Therefore, there have been strategies to develop alternative communication strategies by avoiding the use of elderspeak. Moreover, the beneficial effects of such communications have been documented as it improves the quality of life, reduces aggression, agitation and psychosocial symptoms. The present review discusses the scientific studies discussing the use of elderspeak in communication and development of resistiveness to care in resident patients of dementia.
