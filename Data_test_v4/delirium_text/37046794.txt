37046794|a|The clinical significance of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) cannot be understated. Not only does it infect approximately 90% of the world's population, but it is also associated with numerous pathologies. Diseases linked to this virus include hematologic malignancies such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, primary CNS lymphoma, and NK/T-cell lymphoma, epithelial malignancies such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric cancer, autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Graves' disease, and lupus. While treatment for these disease states is ever evolving, much work remains to more fully elucidate the relationship between EBV, its associated disease states, and their treatments. This paper begins with an overview of EBV latency and latency-associated proteins. It will then review EBV's contributions to select hematologic malignancies with a focus on the contribution of latent proteins as well as their associated management.
