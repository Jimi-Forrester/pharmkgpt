26684808|a|Impaired renal function is regarded as a risk factor for vascular disease, and is associated with an increasing pulse wave velocity. Both renal dysfunction and arterial stiffness are associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. However, there have been few studies that have evaluated the relationship between albuminuria and arterial stiffness and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated renal dysfunction and arterial stiffness in AD, as compared to normal controls, patients with subjective memory impairment (SMI), and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Case-control comparisons were made between 29 patients with AD, 27 with MCI, 14 with SMI, and 25 healthy controls. All patients underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessments. The urine albumin/creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were determined. Pulse wave velocity and the ankle-brachial index were used to evaluate arterial stiffness. The urine albumin/creatinine ratio and eGFR were significantly different in patients with AD, compared with the results from cognitive normal controls. The pulse wave velocity was increased and the ankle-brachial index was decreased in AD. The eGFR was well correlated with other indices and decreasing eGFR was independently associated with cognitive decline. In conclusion, albuminuria, a decreased glomerular filtration rate, an increased pulse wave velocity, and a decreased ankle-brachial index were associated with AD. These finding suggests that impaired renal functions and arterial stiffness are related to AD, in which a vascular mechanism plays a prominent role in the cognitive dysfunction associated with the disease.
