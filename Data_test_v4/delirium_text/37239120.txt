37239120|t|Behavioral and Psychiatric Symptoms in Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Comprehensive Overview.
37239120|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is defined as an altered brain structure or function produced by an external force. Adults surviving moderate and severe TBI often experience long-lasting neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric disorders (NPS). NPS can occur as primary psychiatric complications or could be an exacerbation of pre-existing compensated conditions. It has been shown that changes in behavior following moderate to severe TBI have a prevalence rate of 25-88%, depending on the methodology used by the different studies. Most of current literature has found that cognitive behavioral and emotional deficit following TBI occurs within the first six months whereas after 1-2 years the condition becomes stable. Identifying the risk factors for poor outcome is the first step to reduce the sequelae. Patients with TBI have an adjusted relative risk of developing any NPS several-fold higher than in the general population after six months of moderate-severe TBI. All NPS features of an individual's life, including social, working, and familiar relationships, may be affected by the injury, with negative consequences on quality of life. This overview aims to investigate the most frequent psychiatric, behavioral, and emotional symptoms in patients suffering from TBI as to improve the clinical practice and tailor a more specific rehabilitation training.
