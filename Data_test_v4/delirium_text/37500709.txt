37500709|t|Association between enhanced carbonyl stress and decreased apparent axonal density in schizophrenia by multimodal white matter imaging.
37500709|a|Carbonyl stress is a condition featuring increased rich reactive carbonyl compounds, which facilitate the formation of advanced glycation end products including pentosidine. We previously reported the relationship between enhanced carbonyl stress and disrupted white matter integrity in schizophrenia, although which microstructural component is disrupted remained unclear. In this study, 32 patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and 45 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers (HC) were recruited. We obtained blood samples for carbonyl stress markers (plasma pentosidine and serum pyridoxal) and multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging measures of white matter microstructures including apparent axonal density (intra-cellular volume fraction (ICVF)) and orientation (orientation dispersion index (ODI)), and inflammation (free water (FW)). In SCZ, the plasma pentosidine level was significantly increased. Group comparison revealed that mean white matter values were decreased for ICVF, and increased for FW. We found a significant negative correlation between the plasma pentosidine level and mean ICVF values in SCZ, and a significant negative correlation between the serum pyridoxal level and mean ODI value in HC, regardless of age. Our results suggest an association between enhanced carbonyl stress and axonal abnormality in SCZ.
