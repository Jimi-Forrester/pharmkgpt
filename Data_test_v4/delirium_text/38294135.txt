38294135|a|INTRODUCTION: Time spent at home may aid in understanding recovery following traumatic brain injury (TBI) among older adults, including those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). We examined the impact of ADRD on recovery following TBI and determined whether socioeconomic disadvantages moderated the impact of ADRD. METHODS: We analyzed Medicare beneficiaries aged >=65 years diagnosed with TBI in 2010-2018. Home time was calculated by subtracting days spent in a care environment or deceased from total follow-up, and dual eligibility for Medicaid was a proxy for socioeconomic disadvantage. RESULTS: A total of 2463 of 20,350 participants (12.1%) had both a diagnosis of ADRD and were Medicaid dual-eligible. Beneficiaries with ADRD and Medicaid spent markedly fewer days at home following TBI compared to beneficiaries without either condition (rate ratio 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64, 0.69). DISCUSSION: TBI resulted in a significant loss of home time over the year following injury among older adults with ADRD, particularly for those who were economically vulnerable. HIGHLIGHTS: Remaining at home after serious injuries such as fall-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important goal for older adults. No prior research has evaluated how ADRD impacts time spent at home after TBI. Older TBI survivors with ADRD may be especially vulnerable to loss of home time if socioeconomically disadvantaged. We assessed the impact of ADRD and poverty on a novel DAH measure after TBI. ADRD-related disparities in DAH were significantly magnified among those living with socioeconomic disadvantage, suggesting a need for more tailored care approaches.
