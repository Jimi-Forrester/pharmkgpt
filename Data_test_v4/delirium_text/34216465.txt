34216465|t|Making Sense of Patient-Derived iPSCs, Transdifferentiated Neurons, Olfactory Neuronal Cells, and Cerebral Organoids as Models for Psychiatric Disorders.
34216465|a|The improvement of experimental models for disorders requires a constant approximation towards the dysregulated tissue. In psychiatry, where an impairment of neuronal structure and function is assumed to play a major role in disease mechanisms and symptom development, this approximation is an ongoing process implicating various fields. These include genetic, animal, and post-mortem studies. To test hypotheses generated through these studies, in vitro models using non-neuronal cells such as fibroblasts and lymphocytes have been developed. For brain network disorders, cells with neuronal signatures would, however, represent a more adequate tissue. Considering the limited accessibility of brain tissue, research has thus turned towards neurons generated from induced pluripotent stem cells as well as directly induced neurons, cerebral organoids, and olfactory neuroepithelium. Regarding the increasing importance and amount of research using these neuronal cells, this review aims to provide an overview of all these models to make sense of the current literature. The development of each model system and its use as a model for the various psychiatric disorder categories will be laid out. Also, advantages and limitations of each model will be discussed, including a reflection on implications and future perspectives.
