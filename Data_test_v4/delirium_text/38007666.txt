38007666|t|Elevated Ghrelin Promotes Hippocampal Ghrelin Receptor Defects in Humanized Amyloid-beta Knockin Mice During Aging.
38007666|a|BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence has revealed that dysregulation of the hormone ghrelin and its receptor, growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, defective GHSR function and resultant hippocampal ghrelin resistance are linked to hippocampal synaptic injury in AD paradigms. Also, AD patients exhibit elevated ghrelin activation. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of hippocampal GHSR dysfunction and the relevance of ghrelin elevation to hippocampal ghrelin resistance in AD-relevant pathological settings are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: In the current study, we employed a recently established mouse line of AD risk [humanized amyloid beta knockin (hAbeta KI mice), also referred to as a mouse model of late-onset AD in previous literature] to further define the role of ghrelin system dysregulation in the development of AD. METHODS: We employed multidisciplinary techniques to determine the change of plasma ghrelin and the functional status of GHSR in hAbeta KI mice as well as primary neuron cultures. RESULTS: We observed concurrent plasma ghrelin elevation and hippocampal GHSR desensitization with disease progression. Further examination excluded the possibility that ghrelin elevation is a compensatory change in response to GHSR dysfunction. In contrast, further in vitro and in vivo results show that agonist-mediated overstimulation potentiates GHSR desensitization through enhanced GHSR internalization. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that circulating ghrelin elevation is a pathological event underlying hippocampal GHSR dysfunction, culminating in hippocampal ghrelin resistance and resultant synaptic injury in late-onset AD-related settings.
