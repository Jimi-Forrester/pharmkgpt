38435163|t|Position-Dependent Intrathecal Baclofen System Catheter Failure Resulting in Debilitating Spasticity: A Case Report.
38435163|a|An intrathecal baclofen pump (ITB) can provide significant relief from excessive spasticity and pain that is difficult to control. However, it is not without its drawbacks. We present a case of a young quadriplegic male who underwent ITB pump placement, suffering four years of transient episodes of severe spasticity with withdrawal symptoms. Multiple adjustments were made to his ITB pump dosing without relief. Extensive workup including interrogation of the pump, serial abdominal radiographs, and fluoroscopic catheter dye study revealed no abnormalities. Intraoperatively, it was discovered that the initial catheter anchoring occurred directly adjacent to the vertebrae, leading to a position-dependent catheter occlusion. He underwent the replacement of his ITB pump and catheter. During surgical revision, emphasis was placed on reducing the length of the catheter outside the spine, anchoring to the supraspinous fascia with avoidance of bony prominences or post-laminectomy sites. After surgery, the patient's spasticity improved, and at the eight-month follow-up, he had no complications, resulting in a mean baclofen dose of 300.2 mug/day. This report highlights the potential risk of life-threatening intrathecal baclofen withdrawal secondary to postural changes, providing technical considerations to prevent recurrences. It also raises awareness regarding patients who are more susceptible to transient catheter occlusion after a spinal cord injury.
