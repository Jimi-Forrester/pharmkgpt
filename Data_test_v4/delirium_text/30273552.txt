30273552|a|Compounds targeted for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have consistently failed in clinical trials despite evidence for target engagement and pharmacodynamic activity. This questions the relevance of compounds acting at current AD drug targets - the majority of which reflect the seminal amyloid and, to a far lesser extent, tau hypotheses - and limitations in understanding AD causality as distinct from general dementia. The preeminence of amyloid and tau led to many alternative approaches to AD therapeutics being ignored or underfunded to the extent that their causal versus contributory role in AD remains unknown. These include: neuronal network dysfunction; cerebrovascular disease; chronic, local or systemic inflammation involving the innate immune system; infectious agents including herpes virus and prion proteins; neurotoxic protein accumulation associated with sleep deprivation, circadian rhythm and glymphatic/meningeal lymphatic system and blood-brain-barrier dysfunction; metabolic related diseases including diabetes, obesity hypertension and hypocholesterolemia; mitochondrial dysfunction and environmental factors. As AD has become increasingly recognized as a multifactorial syndrome, a single treatment paradigm is unlikely to work in all patients. However, the biomarkers required to diagnose patients and parse them into mechanism/disease-based sub-groups remain rudimentary and unvalidated as do non-amyloid, non-tau translational animal models. The social and economic impact of AD is also discussed in the context of new FDA regulatory draft guidance and a proposed biomarker-based Framework (re)-defining AD and its stages as part of the larger landscape of treating dementia via the 2013 G8 initiative to identify a disease-modifying therapy for dementia/AD by 2025.
