38056216|t|Disease trajectories in older adults with non-AD pathologic change and comparison with Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology: A longitudinal study.
38056216|a|Based on the 'AT(N)' system, individuals with normal amyloid biomarkers but abnormal tauopathy or neurodegeneration biomarkers are classified as non-Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologic change. This study aimed to assess the long-term clinical and cognitive trajectories of individuals with non-AD pathologic change among older adults without dementia, comparing them to those with normal AD biomarkers and AD pathophysiology. Analyzing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data, we evaluated clinical outcomes and conversion risk longitudinally using mixed effects models and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. We found that compared to individuals with A-T-N-, those with abnormal tauopathy or neurodegeneration biomarkers (A-T + N-, A-T-N + , and A-T + N + ) had a faster rate of cognitive decline and disease progression. Individuals with A-T + N + had a faster rate of decline than those with A-T + N-. Additionally, in individuals with the same baseline tauopathy and neurodegeneration biomarker status, the presence of baseline amyloid could accelerate cognitive decline and clinical progression. These findings provide a foundation for future studies on non-AD pathologic change and its comparison with AD pathophysiology.
