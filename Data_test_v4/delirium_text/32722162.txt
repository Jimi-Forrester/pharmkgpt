32722162|t|Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Interventions for the Elderly: A Scoping Review from 2015-2019.
32722162|a|In this study, a scoping review method is used to review the distribution and trends in health promotion research and explore the use and contribution of eHealth technologies in health promotion in the elderly. The study includes six search databases: PubMed, CINAHL, the CochraneLibrary, EMBASE, PubPsych, and ERIC (EBSCOhost), and studies published from January 2015 to October 2019, written in English, were included and analyzed. The findings of the study reveal that the amount of literature on promoting health for the elderly has increased, and some specific types of interventions are still favored in current health promotion efforts for older adults. The most commonly used methods were found to be health promotion (n = 322), followed by screening (n = 264), primary prevention (n = 114), and finally social support (n = 72). Beyond the above interventions, eHealth technology is also used in health promotion activities to prevent the elderly from falling and to improve home safety, etc. However, although the application of eHealth technology has been applied in areas such as fall prevention, mental health promotion, and home security monitoring, it is still immature, and thus more rigorous research is needed in different areas, especially in older populations, various professions, women, and people with dementia.
