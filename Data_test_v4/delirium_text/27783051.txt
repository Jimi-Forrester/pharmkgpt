27783051|a|Several studies have investigated the relationship between non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) and peripheral brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in schizophrenia patients. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to review the efficacy of NPIs on peripheral serum and plasma BDNF in subjects with schizophrenia (including schizoaffective disorder). Meta-analyses were conducted to examine the effects of NPIs on blood BDNF levels by using the standardized mean differences (SMDs) between the intervention groups and controls. In total, six randomized controlled trials with 289 participants were included. Of them, five studies used exercise, physical training or diet products. One study used cognitive training. Overall, the BDNF levels in the NPI group increased significantly compared with the control groups (SMD = 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.07 to 1.83, p = 0.03). Subgroup analyses indicated beneficial effects of a non-exercise intervention on peripheral BDNF levels (SMD = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.74, p = 0.01). Meta-regression analyses showed that the completion rate influenced the variation in SMD (p = 0.01). Despite insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion, our results suggest that use of NPIs as adjunctive treatments, specifically non-exercise interventions, may affect positively serum or plasma BDNF in patients with schizophrenia.
