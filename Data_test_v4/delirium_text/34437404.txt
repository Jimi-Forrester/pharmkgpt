34437404|t|Pathological and Therapeutic Approach to Endotoxin-Secreting Bacteria Involved in Periodontal Disease.
34437404|a|It is widely recognized that periodontal disease is an inflammatory entity of infectious origin, in which the immune activation of the host leads to the destruction of the supporting tissues of the tooth. Periodontal pathogenic bacteria like Porphyromonas gingivalis, that belongs to the complex net of oral microflora, exhibits a toxicogenic potential by releasing endotoxins, which are the lipopolysaccharide component (LPS) available in the outer cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. Endotoxins are released into the tissues causing damage after the cell is lysed. There are three well-defined regions in the LPS: one of them, the lipid A, has a lipidic nature, and the other two, the Core and the O-antigen, have a glycosidic nature, all of them with independent and synergistic functions. Lipid A is the "bioactive center" of LPS, responsible for its toxicity, and shows great variability along bacteria. In general, endotoxins have specific receptors at the cells, causing a wide immunoinflammatory response by inducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the production of matrix metalloproteinases. This response is not coordinated, favoring the dissemination of LPS through blood vessels, as well as binding mainly to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expressed in the host cells, leading to the destruction of the tissues and the detrimental effect in some systemic pathologies. Lipid A can also act as a TLRs antagonist eliciting immune deregulation. Although bacterial endotoxins have been extensively studied clinically and in a laboratory, their effects on the oral cavity and particularly on periodontium deserve special attention since they affect the connective tissue that supports the tooth, and can be linked to advanced medical conditions. This review addresses the distribution of endotoxins associated with periodontal pathogenic bacteria and its relationship with systemic diseases, as well as the effect of some therapeutic alternatives.
