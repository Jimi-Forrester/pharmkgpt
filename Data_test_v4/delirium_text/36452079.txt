36452079|a|Background: Yaks are animals that have lived in plateau environments for generations. Yaks can adapt to the hypoxic plateau environment and also pass this adaptability on to the next generation. The lungs are the most important respiratory organs for mammals to adapt to their environment. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells play an important role in vascular remodeling under hypoxia, but the genetic mechanism underpinning the yak's ability to adapt to challenging plateau conditions is still unknown. Methods: A tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics study together with an RNA-seq transcriptome analysis were carried out on pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) that had been grown for 72 hours in both normoxic (20% O2) and hypoxic (1% O2) environments. RNA and TP (total protein) were collected from the hypoxic and normoxic groups for RNA-seq transcriptome sequencing and TMT marker protein quantification, and RT-qPCR validation was performed. Results: A total of 17,711 genes and 6,859 proteins were identified. Further, 5,969 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 531 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the comparison group, including 2,924 and 186 upregulated genes and proteins and 3,045 and 345 down-regulated genes and proteins, respectively. The transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that 109 DEGs and DEPs were highly positively correlated, with 77 genes showing the same expression trend. Nine overlapping genes were identified in the HIF-1 signaling pathway, glycolysis / gluconeogenesis, central carbon metabolism in cancer, PPAR signaling pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, and cholesterol metabolism (PGAM1, PGK1, TPI1, HMOX1, IGF1R, OLR1, SCD, FABP4 and LDLR), suggesting that these differentially expressed genes and protein functional classifications are related to the hypoxia-adaptive pathways. Overall, our study offers abundant data for further analysis of the molecular mechanisms in yak PASMCs and their adaptability to different oxygen concentrations.
