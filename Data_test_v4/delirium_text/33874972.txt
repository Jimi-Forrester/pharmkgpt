33874972|a|Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is considered an age-dependent chronic communicating hydrocephalus associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) malabsorption; however, the aetiology of ventricular enlargement in iNPH has not yet been elucidated. There is accumulating evidence that support the hypothesis that various alterations in CSF dynamics contribute to ventricle dilatation in iNPH. This review focuses on CSF dynamics associated with ventriculomegaly and summarises the current literature based on three potential aetiology factors: genetic, environmental and hydrodynamic. The majority of gene mutations that cause communicating hydrocephalus were associated with an abnormal structure or dysfunction of motile cilia on the ventricular ependymal cells. Aging, alcohol consumption, sleep apnoea, diabetes and hypertension are candidates for the risk of developing iNPH, although there is no prospective cohort study to investigate the risk factors for iNPH. Alcohol intake may be associated with the dysfunction of ependymal cilia and sustained high CSF sugar concentration due to uncontrolled diabetes increases the fluid viscosity which in turn increases the shear stress on the ventricular wall surface. Sleep apnoea, diabetes and hypertension are known to be associated with the impairment of CSF and interstitial fluid exchange. Oscillatory shear stress to the ventricle wall surfaces is considerably increased by reciprocating bidirectional CSF movements in iNPH. Increased oscillatory shear stress impedes normal cilia beating, leading to motile cilia shedding from the ependymal cells. At the lack of ciliary protection, the ventricular wall is directly exposed to increased oscillatory shear stress. Additionally, increased oscillatory shear stress may be involved in activating the flow-mediated dilation signalling of the ventricular wall. In conclusion, as the CSF stroke volume at the cerebral aqueduct increases, the oscillatory shear stress increases, promoting motor cilia shedding and loss of ependymal cell coverage. These are considered to be the leading causes of ventricular enlargement in iNPH.
