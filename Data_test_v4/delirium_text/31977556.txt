31977556|a|CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is effective in refractory/relapsed (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). This review focuses on achievements, current obstacles, and future directions in CAR-T research. A high complete remission rate of 68% to 93% could be achieved after anti-CD19 CAR-T treatment for B-ALL. Cytokine release syndrome and CAR-T-related neurotoxicity could be managed. In view of difficulties collecting autologous lymphocytes, universal CAR-T is a direction to explore. Regarding the high relapse rate after anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy, the main solutions have been developing new targets including CD22 CAR-T, or CD19/CD22 dual CAR-T. Additionally, some studies showed that bridging into transplant post-CAR-T could improve leukemia-free survival. Some patients who did not respond to CAR-T therapy were found to have an abnormal conformation of the CD19 exon or trogocytosis. Anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy for R/R B-ALL is effective. From individual to universal CAR-T, from one target to multi-targets, CAR-T-cell has a chance to be off the shelf in the future.
