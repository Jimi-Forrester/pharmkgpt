3047545|a|The neurologic evaluation of an individual cardiac transplant recipient often does not lead to a succinct bedside diagnosis. There are few consistent clinical observations. The onset of seizures in the early postoperative period is associated with embolic cerebral infarction. Seizures occur most commonly, however, as a neurotoxic manifestation of cyclosporine. The onset of an acute delirium or psychosis in the first week after cardiac transplantation usually has multiple causative factors and is reversible. A postoperative brachial plexopathy or mononeuropathy can be identified with a neurologic examination, confirmed by appropriate electrophysiologic testing and is usually reversible. The onset of periorbital inflammation, ophthalmoplegia, and nasal turbinate or sinus invasion and necrosis is consistent with phycomycosis. Most patients, however, present with nonspecific findings of impaired mentation with or without focal neurologic signs. These patients require a fairly systematic search for potentially treatable neurologic complications (see Table 3). In a medically stable patient an aggressive diagnostic approach, at times including stereotaxic brain aspirate or biopsy, is indicated. In the severely ill patient with multiple organ failure, empirical therapy for the most probable treatable disorder is justified.
