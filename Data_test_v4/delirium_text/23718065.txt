23718065|t|[Correction of metabolic disorders during treatment of alcohol-induced liver injuries in patients with acute alcoholic intoxication].
23718065|a|A total of 103 patients with acute alcoholic intoxication were examined and treated for alcohol-induced hepatic lesions. It was shown that remaxol reduced severity of metabolic disorders associated with hypoxic conditions and active lipid peroxidation and thereby decreased the frequency of alcoholic delirium to 10.8% (n=7) compared with ademetionine (10.8%, n=22). Improvement of metabolism resulted in the reduction of stay in the intensive therapy ward by 5.6+/-0.3 and 7.3+/-0.6 days after remaxol and ademetionine therapy respectively). The total duration of treatment decreased by 9.0+/-0.4 and 11.8+/-1.1 days. The use of remaxol reduced the cost of the treatment by 21.7% compared with ademetionine.
