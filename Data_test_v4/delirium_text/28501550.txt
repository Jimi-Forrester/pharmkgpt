28501550|t|Type 2 diabetes alters hippocampal gamma oscillations: A potential mechanism behind impaired cognition.
28501550|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been associated with cognitive decline, dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Remarkably, the pathophysiological mechanisms behind this are still mostly unknown. Cognition and memory formation are associated with gamma oscillations in hippocampal neuronal networks and fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV+ IN) play a key role in these processes.
