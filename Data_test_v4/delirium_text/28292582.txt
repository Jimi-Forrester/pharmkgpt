28292582|a|OBJECTIVE: To improve the management of geriatric pluripathologic patients in Catalonia, the identification of chronic complex patient (PCC) or patients with advanced chronic disease (MACA) has been promoted. Patients with exacerbated chronic diseases are promoted to be admitted in subacute units (SG) located in intermediate hospitals and specialized in geriatric care, as an alternative to acute hospital. The results of the care process in patients identified as PCC/MACA in SG have not been evaluated. DESIGN: Descriptive-comparative, cross-sectional, and quantitative study. LOCATION: SG located in intermediate care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients admitted in the SG during 6months. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: We compared baseline characteristics (demographic, clinical and geriatric assessment data), results at discharge and 30days post-discharge between PCC/MACA patients versus other patients. RESULTS: Of 244 patients (mean age+-SD=85,6+-7,5; 65.6%women), 91 (37,3%) were PCC/MACA (PCC=79,1%, MACA=20,9%). These, compared with unidentified patients, had greater comorbidity (Charlson index=3,2+-1,8 vs 2,0; p=0,001) and polypharmacy (9,5+-3,7 drugs vs 8,1+-3,8; p=0,009). At discharge, the return to usual residence and mortality were comparable. PCC/MACA had higher mortality adding the mortality at 30day post-discharge (15,4% vs 8%; p=0,010). In a multi-variable analysis, PCC/MACA identification (p=0,006), as well as a history of dementia (p=0,004), was associated with mortality. Although PCC/MACA patients had higher readmission rate at 30day (18,7% vs 10,5%; p=0,014), in the multivariable analyses, only male, polypharmacy, and heart failure were independently associated to readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Despite having more comorbidity and polypharmacy, the outcomes of patients identified as PCC/MACA at discharge of SG, were comparable with other patients, although they experienced more readmissions within 30days, possibly due to comorbidity and polypharmacy.
