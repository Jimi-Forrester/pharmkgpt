29723220|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine if cognitive dysfunction in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) derives from an inflammatory process with continuing disease activity, and increased levels of autoantibodies and inflammatory molecules in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). METHODS: 100 randomly selected patients participating in an inception SLE cohort were studied. At entry into the cohort, a standardized medical history and extensive laboratory tests profile, including autoantibodies were completed. Follow-up occurred every 3-6 months with assessment of lupus characteristics, comorbidities, and treatment. After a mean follow-up of six-years, cross-sectional evaluation of cognitive function was done with standardized tests, and in a subset of patients an extended profile of autoantibodies, cytokines and chemokines was measured in serum and CSF. RESULTS: At enrollment into the cohort, patients were 26.4+-8.2 years of age and lupus duration 5.3+-3.7 months. Moderate/severe cognitive dysfunction was diagnosed in 16 patients; in comparison to patients with normal cognitive function, they had lower education 9 vs. 12 years (P = 0.006), higher body mass index 26.7 vs. 24.3 (P = 0.03), positive IgG anticardiolipin antibodies 50% vs 18% (P = 0.009), and a higher median number of concomitant NPSLE syndromes 3 vs. 1, (P = 0.04). The prevalence of cardiovascular-risk factors, other auto-antibodies, lupus activity, treatment, and incidence of critical events did not differ. In serum and CSF, the levels of autoantibodies, cytokines and chemokine were similar, only CCL2 was elevated in CSF [886.1 (374.9-1439.7) vs. 515.8 (3.2-1958.2) pg/mL, P = 0.04]. CONCLUSION: Scant evidence of inflammation in SLE patients with cognitive dysfunction was observed. Only a higher prevalence of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies in serum and increased levels of CCL2 in CSF were detected.
