660204|t|Comparative simultaneous measurement of cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and blood serotonin levels in delirium tremens and clozapine-induced delirious reaction.
660204|a|Cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and total blood serotonin levels were measured simultaneously in 11 female patients with delirium tremens and nine schizophrenic women with clozapine-induced acute delirium. Both groups had significantly raised levels of 5HIAA in CSF and significantly reduced blood 5HT levels as compared with normal control subjects, symptom-free alcoholics, or clozapine-treated schizophrenics. The two delirious groups were not distinguishable from each other in respect of their CSF 5HIAA or blood 5HT values. After clinical recovery both values returned to normal levels.
