36936788|a|Mitochondrial calcium overload contributes to neurodegenerative disease development and progression. We recently reported that loss of the mitochondrial sodium/calcium exchanger (NCLX), the primary mechanism of mCa2+ efflux, promotes mCa2+ overload, metabolic derangement, redox stress, and cognitive decline in models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether disrupted mCa2+ signaling contributes to neuronal pathology and cognitive decline independent of pre-existing amyloid or tau pathology remains unknown. Here, we generated mice with neuronal deletion of the mitochondrial sodium/calcium exchanger (NCLX, Slc8b1 gene), and evaluated age-associated changes in cognitive function and neuropathology. Neuronal loss of NCLX resulted in an age-dependent decline in spatial and cued recall memory, moderate amyloid deposition, mild tau pathology, synaptic remodeling, and indications of cell death. These results demonstrate that loss of NCLX-dependent mCa2+ efflux alone is sufficient to induce an Alzheimer's disease-like pathology and highlights the promise of therapies targeting mCa2+ exchange.
