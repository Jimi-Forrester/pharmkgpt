39030949|a|BACKGROUND: Depression is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) but is underrecognized clinically. Although systematic screening is a recommended strategy to improve depression recognition in primary care practice, it has not been widely used in PD care. METHODS: The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) was implemented at 5 movement disorders clinics to screen PD patients. Sites developed processes suited to their clinical workflow. Qualitative interviews with clinicians and patients provided information on feasibility, acceptability, and perceived utility. RESULTS: Prior to implementation, depression screening was recorded in 12% using a formal instrument; 64% were screened informally by clinical interview, and no screening was recorded in 24%. Of 1406 patients seen for follow-up care during the implementation period, 88% were screened, 59% using the GDS-15 (self-administered in 51% and interviewer administered in 8%), a nearly 5-fold increase in formal screening. Lack of clinician or staff time and inability to provide the GDS-15 to the patient ahead of the visit were the most commonly cited reasons for lack of screening using the GDS-15; 378 (45%) patients completing the GDS-15 screened positive for depression, and 137 were enrolled for a 12-month prospective follow-up. Mean GDS-15 scores improved from 8.8 to 7.0 (P < 0.0001) and the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire emotional subscore from 42.2 to 36.7 (P = 0.0007). CONCLUSIONS: Depression screening in PD using a formal instrument can be achieved at much higher levels than is currently practiced, but there are barriers to implementing this in clinical practice. An individual site-specific process is necessary to optimize screening rates.
