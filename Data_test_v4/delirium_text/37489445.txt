37489445|t|Actigraphy Analysis of Sleep Associates with Salivary IL-6 Concentration in Institutionalized Older Individuals.
37489445|a|Sleep disorders are common in older individuals and are most prevalent in those who are institutionalized. Sleep complaints are often comorbid with medical and neuro-psychiatric illness and associated with polypharmacy. Various studies show an association between sleep disorders and altered levels of inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6. In this study, an objective sleep analysis was performed using actigraphy, and IL-6 measurements in saliva in 61 older people residing in long-term nursing homes (72.1% women). Almost half (49.2%) of the people had no or mild cognitive impairment, and the rest suffered from moderate to severe dementia, mainly due to Alzheimer's disease (25 out of 31 individuals). A significant correlation was found between salivary IL6 and sleep parameters; e.g., less salivary IL-6 had significantly (p < 0.05) worse sleep efficiency and more night awakenings. In turn, actigraphy detected alterations in people with dementia in average sleep time, daily bedtime, and average daily time out of bed. There was no significant correlation between these sleep patterns and the total number of psychotropic drugs. No significant differences were found in salivary IL-6 between individuals with or without dementia. These results should be considered in future research with institutionalized people to detect sleep disturbances and to establish interventions aimed to improve sleep quality.
