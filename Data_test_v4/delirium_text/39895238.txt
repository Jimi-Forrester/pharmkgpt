39895238|t|Prioritization Patterns of Nurses in the Management of a Patient With Delirium: Results of a Q-Methodology Study.
39895238|a|Nurses are required to decide on priorities; however, how they prioritize the interventions toward patients with delirium is still unclear. Therefore, expanding the knowledge on (a) how nurses prioritize interventions to manage episodes of delirium and (b) the underlying prioritization patterns were the aims of this study. The Q-methodology was applied in 2021. A systematic review to identify the recommended interventions for patients with delirium was performed, and a nominal group technique was used to select those interventions that are applicable in daily practice (35 out of 96 identified). Then, using a specific scenario, 56 clinical nurses working in hospital medical (n = 31), geriatric (n = 15), and postacute (n = 10) units were asked to order the 35 interventions (from -4 the lowest to +4 the highest priority) using a Q-sort table. Averages (confidence interval at 95%) were calculated at the group level, and a by-person factor analysis was applied to discover underlying patterns of prioritization at the overall and at the individual levels. At the group level, "Ensuring a safe environment (e.g., reducing bed height)" was ranked as the highest priority (2.29 out of four); at the individual level, three prioritization patterns accounting for a total variance of 50.21% have emerged: "Individual needs-oriented" (33.82% variance explained; 41 nurses); "Prevention-oriented" (8.47%; five nurses); and "Cognitive-oriented" (7.92%; six nurses). At the group level, nurses prioritize safety while caring for patients with delirium; however, at the individual level, they follow three different patterns of prioritization oriented toward diverse aspects, suggesting uncertainty in the actions to be taken-with potential implications for patients.
