39478015|a|This study investigated the role of mitochondrial dynamics in postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and assessed the therapeutic potential of mitochondrial modulation, particularly through the inhibition of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) with Mdivi-1. Our findings indicated that DRP1 inhibition substantially mitigated neuroinflammation mediated by microglial cells, contributing to improved cognitive function in POCD models. The administration of Mdivi-1 led to a notable decrease in mitochondrial fission, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential, all of which correlate with diminished neuroinflammation, as evidenced by lower NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)/ interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) expression in microglial cells. Importantly, Mdivi-1 treatment was also found to enhance synaptic plasticity, increasing synaptic spine density in the hippocampal region of POCD mice. This improvement in mitochondrial health and synaptic integrity was paralleled by enhanced cognitive performance, as demonstrated in Y-maze tests. These results underscored the critical role of mitochondrial dynamics in the pathophysiology of POCD and suggested that targeting mitochondrial dysfunction, specifically through DRP1 inhibition, could be an effective approach for POCD treatment.
