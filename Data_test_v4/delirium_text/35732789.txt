35732789|a|Global warming increases heatstroke incidence. After heatstroke, patients exhibit neurological symptoms, suggesting cerebellar damage. However, the potential long-term adverse outcomes are poorly understood. We studied the cerebellum after heatstroke in mouse heatstroke models. In this study, motor coordination disorder significantly appeared 3 weeks after heatstroke and gradually improved to some extent. Although white matter demyelination was detected at 1 and 3 weeks after heatstroke in the cerebellum, it was not found in the corpus callosum. The Purkinje cell numbers significantly decreased at 1, 3, and 9 weeks after heatstroke. The intensity of synaptophysin and postsynaptic density-95 temporarily appeared to attenuate at 3 weeks after heatstroke; however, both appeared to intensify at 9 weeks after heatstroke. Motor coordination loss occurred a few weeks after heatstroke and recovered to some extent. Late-onset motor impairment was suggested to be caused by cerebellar dysfunctions morphologically assessed by myelin staining of cerebellar white matter and immunostaining of Purkinje cells with pre- and postsynaptic markers. Purkinje cell number did not recover for 9 weeks; other factors, including motor coordination, partially recovered, probably by synaptic reconstruction, residual Purkinje cells, and other cerebellar white matter remyelination. These phenomena were associated with late-onset neurological deficits and recovery after heatstroke.
