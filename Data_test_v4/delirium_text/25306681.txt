25306681|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine for treatment of delirium in cardiac surgery. METHODS: We performed an open, prospective comparative study in 60 patients, who received surgery on the heart or major vessels under general anaesthesia. In the early postoperative period, all patients suffered from delirium. All patients were divided into two groups. The patients in group-I (30 patients) received dexmedetomidine (0.2-1.4 mcg/kg/ hour), 20 of them received dexmedetomidine only and 10 received a combination of dexmedetomidine with haloperidol and midazolam. Patients in group-2 received haloperidol 5 mg 3 times a day intramuscularly and 0.1 mg/kg intravenously separately and in combination with benzodiazepines (midazolam, relanium). All patients received analgesia with ketoprofen 100 mg each 12 hours and trimeperidin 20 mg intramuscularly. RESULTS: In 67% of all patients the symptoms of delirium occurred on the 1st or 2nd day after surgery. A hyperactive type of delirium dominated (> 77%). The average lasting time of delirium was 26.5 hours in group-I and 36.3 hours in group-2 (p = 0.001). Spontaneous breathing occurred in 26 patients (87%) out of group-I and in 18 patients (60%) out of group-2 (p = 0.04). The duration of stay in the ICU was 2.73 days in group-I and 3.5 days in group-2 (p = 0.04). Dexmedetomidine provided an average target level of sedation better according to RASS-scale (p = 0.001). 10 patients (33%) of group-I and 12 patients (40%) of group-2 received opioids (p = 0.8). Bradycardia as a side effect predominated in group-I (p = 0.01). Respiratory depression predominated in group-I (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine provides an average target level of sedation, decreases duration of delirium and duration of stay in the ICU. Dexmedetomidine does not cause depression of respiration which allows keeping a verbal contact with patients and improving a diagnostics of pain syndrome. The most common side effect of the dexmedetomidine use is a dose-depending bradycardia.
