22664153|t|Claudin expression profile separates Alzheimer's disease cases from normal aging and from vascular dementia cases.
22664153|a|We have reported earlier that tight-junction proteins are detectable by standard immunohistochemistry in the brain parenchyma, namely in the cell bodies of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Here we show, by projection to latent structures - discriminate analysis (PLS-DA), that the immunohistochemical detection profile of tight junction proteins clearly distinguishes the AD cases from healthy aging controls and from the cases of dementia with a predominantly vascular pathology underlying the symptoms (vascular dementia, VaD; cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, CADASIL; and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, CAA). Our findings might be valuable in the perspective of developing biomarkers for AD.
