37371372|t|Effect of Obesity and Osteocalcin on Brain Glucose Metabolism in Healthy Participants.
37371372|a|We evaluated the effects of obesity and osteocalcin on glucose metabolism in the brain. A total of 179 healthy men were enrolled in this study. After preprocessing positron emission tomography images, including by performing coregistration, spatial normalization, and smoothing, regression analysis was conducted to identify the correlation between body mass index, osteocalcin, and brain glucose metabolism. Body mass index was positively correlated with brain glucose metabolism in the anterior lobe of the right cerebellum, the anterior and posterior lobes of the left cerebellum, the right middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 9), the right cingulate gyrus (Brodmann area 32), the right anterior cingulate (Brodmann area 32), the left middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 10), and the subgyral area of the left frontal lobe. Osteocalcin was negatively correlated with glucose metabolism in the anterior lobe of the left cerebellum. Body mass index was positively correlated with brain glucose metabolism in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. Osteocalcin levels were negatively correlated with brain glucose metabolism in the left cerebellum.
