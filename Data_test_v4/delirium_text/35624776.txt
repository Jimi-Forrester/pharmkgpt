35624776|t|Phenolic Content and Antioxidant Activity in Fruit of the Genus Rosa L.
35624776|a|Throughout history, people of different cultures have acknowledged the relationship between food properties and health. The pseudo-fruits of different Rosa species contain high levels of vitamin C and other beneficial biological active agents such as phenolics, and others. The purpose of the research was to determine the variability of the phenolic compound profiles in the fruit of different species of Rosa L. and to evaluate the antioxidant activity of fruit extracts in vitro. The total contents of phenolics, flavonoids, procyanidins, and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives were performed using the spectrophotometric method. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of individual phenolics in rosehip samples was carried out by applying the HPLC method. The largest amounts of phenolic compounds 26.49 +- 1.32 mg GRE/g were found in rosehip samples of the Rosa pisocarpa species. (+)-Catechin was the predominant phenolic compound in rosehip fruit samples, and the highest content 522.48 +- 26.12 microg/g was found in rosehip samples of the Rosa subcanina species. A strong correlation was found between the total amount of phenolic compounds determined in rosehip extracts and the radical scavenging and reducing the activity of their extracts in vitro (r = 0.759 and 0.761, accordingly, p < 0.001).
