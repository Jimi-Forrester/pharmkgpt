38369926|t|On hallucinations and memory: the relationship between hallucinations and autobiographical overgenerality in Alzheimer's Disease.
38369926|a|OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with autobiographical overgenerality (i.e. a tendency of patients to retrieve general rather than specific personal memories). AD has also been associated with hallucinations. We investigated the relationship between autobiographical overgenerality and hallucinations in AD. METHODS: We invited 28 patients with mild AD to retrieve autobiographical memories, and we also evaluated the occurrence of hallucinations in these patients. RESULTS: Analysis demonstrated significant correlations between hallucinations and autobiographical overgenerality in the patients. CONCLUSION: AD patients who are distressed by hallucinations may demonstrate autobiographical overgenerality as a strategy to avoid retrieving distressing information that may be related with hallucinations. However, hallucinations as observed in our study can be attributed to other factors such as the general cognitive decline in AD.
