25449301|a|Numerous aromatic small molecule modulators of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) monomer aggregation and neurotoxicity have been identified with the ultimate goal of Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. Determining binding sites of these modulators on Abeta monomer is an important topic in the mechanistic understanding of AD pathology and drug development. However, Abeta monomer binding sites have been reported for only a very limited number of Abeta modulators. In this article, we present a convenient method for determining aggregation-modulating polycyclic aromatic small molecule ligand binding sites on Abeta monomer using immunostaining with a panel of Abeta sequence-specific antibodies. To validate our technique, we first examined one modulating aromatic ligand, Congo Red, with known binding sites, which yielded consistent results with previous findings. Then, using the same technique, binding sites on Abeta of four known Abeta monomer aggregation modulators, Erythrosin B, Eosin Y, Phloxine B, and Rose Bengal, were determined. The identified ligand binding sites were also confirmed by a separate fluorescence quenching-based assay using a panel of overlapping Abeta sub-fragments. The technique described here greatly increases researchers' ability to determine the Abeta monomer binding site(s) of aggregation-modulating aromatic small molecule ligands and to screen for new ligands that bind specific regions on Abeta.
