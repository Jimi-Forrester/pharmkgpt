31111909|a|Although extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MFs) have been classified as a possible carcinogen for humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), their biological effects and underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Our previous study indicated that ELF-MF exposure influenced the relative permittivity of the saline solution, suggesting that the MF exposure altered physical properties of the solution. To explore the biophysical mechanism of ELF-MF-induced biological effects, this study examined the effects of 50 Hz sinusoidal MF at 0-4.0 mT on the permittivity of culture medium with phase-interrogation surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing. Then, the biological effects of MF pre-exposed culture medium on cell viability, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and genetic stabilities were analyzed using Cell Counting Kit-8, western blot, flow cytometry, gammaH2AX foci formation, and comet assay. The results showed that SPR signals were decreased under MF exposure in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and the decreased SPR signals were reversible when the exposure was drawn off. However, MF pre-exposed culture medium did not significantly change cell viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species level, activation of the MARK signaling pathways, or genetic stabilities in human amniotic epithelial cells (FL cells). In conclusion, our data suggest that the relative permittivity of culture medium was influenced by 50 Hz MF exposure, but this change did not affect the biological processes in FL cells.
