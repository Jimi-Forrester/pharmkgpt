27809287|t|Cx43 Mediates Resistance against MPP+-Induced Apoptosis in SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells via Modulating the Mitochondrial Apoptosis Pathway.
27809287|a|Neuronal apoptosis in the substantia nigra par compacta (SNpc) appears to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. However, the mechanisms responsible for the death of dopaminergic neurons are not fully understood yet. To explore the apoptotic mechanisms, we used a well-known parkinsonian toxin, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+), to induce neuronal apoptosis in the human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cell line. The most common method of interaction between cells is gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) mediated by gap junctions (GJs) formed by transmembrane proteins called connexins (Cx). Modulation of GJIC affects cell viability or growth, implying that GJIC may have an important role in maintaining homeostasis in various organs. Here, we hypothesized that increasing the level of the gap junction protein Cx43 in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells could provide neuroprotection. First, our experiments demonstrated that knocking down Cx43 protein by using Cx43-specific shRNA in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells potentiated MPP+-induced neuronal apoptosis evident from decreased cell viability. In another experiment, we demonstrated that over-expression of Cx43 in the SH-SY5Y cell system decreased MPP+-induced apoptosis based on the MTT assay and reduced the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the release of cytochrome C based on Western blot analysis. Taken together, our results suggest that Cx43 could mediate resistance against MPP+-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells via modulating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.
