34826792|t|Integrated Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging in clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
34826792|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease which seriously endangers the health of the aged, is the most common etiology of senile dementia. With the increasing progress of neuroimaging technology, more and more imaging methods have been applied to study Alzheimer's disease. The emergence of integrated PET/MRI (Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a major advance in multimodal molecular imaging with many advantages on the structure of resolution and contrast of image over computed tomography (CT), PET and MRI. PET/MRI is now used stepwise in neurodegenerative diseases, and also has broad prospect of application in the early diagnosis of AD. In this review, we emphatically introduce the imaging advances of AD including functional imaging and molecular imaging, the advantages of PET/MRI over other imaging methods and prospects of PET/MRI in AD clinical diagnosis, especially in early diagnosis, clinical assessment and prediction on AD.
