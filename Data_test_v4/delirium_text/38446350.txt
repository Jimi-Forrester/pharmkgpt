38446350|t|Therapeutic potential of saffron in brain disorders: From bench to bedside.
38446350|a|Saffron is a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus L., which has been used for centuries as a coloring and flavoring agent, as well as a source of medicinal compounds. Saffron contains various bioactive constituents, such as crocin, crocetin, safranal, picrocrocin, and kaempferol, that have shown potential benefits for human health. Among them, crocin is the most abundant and characteristic constituent of saffron, responsible for its bright red color and antioxidant properties. One of the most promising applications of saffron and its constituents is in the prevention and treatment of neurological disorders, such as depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other brain disorders. Saffron and its constituents have been reported to exert neuroprotective effects through various mechanisms, such as modulating neurotransmitters, enhancing neurogenesis, reducing neuroinflammation, regulating oxidative stress, activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway, and modulating epigenetic factors. Several clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of saffron and its constituents in improving cognitive function, mood, and other neurological outcomes. In this review, we summarize the current evidence on the therapeutic potential of saffron and its constituents in neurological disorders, from bench to bedside. We also discuss the challenges and future directions for the development of saffron-based therapies for brain health.
