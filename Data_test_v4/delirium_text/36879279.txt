36879279|t|Grayken lessons: between a rock and a hard place? A 37-year-old man with acute liver injury while enrolled in a managed alcohol program for severe alcohol use disorder.
36879279|a|Managed alcohol programs aim to reduce health and social harms associated with severe alcohol use disorder. Here, we describe a young man with severe alcohol use disorder enrolled in a managed alcohol program, who was admitted to hospital with acute liver injury. Fearing that alcohol was contributing, the inpatient care team discontinued the managed alcohol dose in hospital. He was ultimately diagnosed with cephalexin-induced liver injury. After consideration of risks, benefits, and alternative options, the patient and care team jointly decided to restart managed alcohol after hospital discharge. With this case, we describe managed alcohol programs and summarize the emerging evidence-base, including eligibility criteria and outcome measures; we explore clinical and ethical dilemmas in caring for patients with liver disease within managed alcohol programs; and we emphasize principles of harm reduction and patient-centered care when establishing treatment plans for patients with severe alcohol use disorder and unstable housing.
