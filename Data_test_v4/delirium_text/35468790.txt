35468790|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with frailty get more and more attention in clinical practice. Yet, no large-scale studies have explored the impact of frailty on the perioperative acute medical and surgical complications following TJA. what is more, comorbid diseases may lead, at least additively, to the development of frailty. There also no studies to find the possible interaction between comorbidity and frailty on the postoperative complications after TJA. METHODS: Discharge data of 2,029,843 patients who underwent TJA from 2005 to 2014 from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, which was analyzed using cross-tabulations and multivariate regression modeling. Frailty was defined based on frailty-defining diagnosis clusters from frailty-defining diagnosis indicator of Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups. RESULTS: Among patients who underwent total joint replacement surgeries, 50,385 (2.5%) were identified as frail. Frailty is highly associated with old age, especially for those over the age of 80, meanwhile females and black races have a high Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) of >= 3, together with emergency/urgent admission and teaching hospital. While comorbidity is associated with greater odds of acute medical complications, and frailty has a better predictive effect on in-hospital deaths, acute surgical complications. Furthermore, frailty did not show an enhancement in the predictive power of the Charlson comorbidity score for postoperative complications or in-hospital deaths but postoperative LOS and hospitalization costs. CONCLUSION: Frailty can be used to independently predicted postoperative surgical and medical complications, which also has a synergistic interaction with comorbidity for patients who are preparing to undergo TJA.
