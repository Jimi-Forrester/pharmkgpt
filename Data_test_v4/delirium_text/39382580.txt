39382580|a|PURPOSE: Metabolism and bioenergetics in the central nervous system play important roles in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we employed a multimodal imaging approach to assess oxygenation changes in the spinal cord of the transgenic M83 murine model of PD overexpressing the mutated A53T alpha-synuclein form in comparison with non-transgenic littermates. METHODS: In vivo spiral volumetric optoacoustic tomography (SVOT) was performed to assess oxygen saturation (sO2) in the spinal cords of M83 mice and non-transgenic littermates. Ex vivo high-field T1-weighted (T1w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 9.4T was used to assess volumetric alterations in the spinal cord. 3D SVOT analysis and deep learning-based automatic segmentation of T1w MRI data for the mouse spinal cord were developed for quantification. Immunostaining for phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (pS129 alpha-syn), as well as vascular organization (CD31 and GLUT1), was performed after MRI scan. RESULTS: In vivo SVOT imaging revealed a lower sO2SVOT in the spinal cord of M83 mice compared to non-transgenic littermates at sub-100 mum spatial resolution. Ex vivo MRI-assisted by in-house developed deep learning-based automatic segmentation (validated by manual analysis) revealed no volumetric atrophy in the spinal cord of M83 mice compared to non-transgenic littermates at 50 mum spatial resolution. The vascular network was not impaired in the spinal cord of M83 mice in the presence of pS129 alpha-syn accumulation. CONCLUSION: We developed tools for deep-learning-based analysis for the segmentation of mouse spinal cord structural MRI data, and volumetric analysis of sO2SVOT data. We demonstrated non-invasive high-resolution imaging of reduced sO2SVOT in the absence of volumetric structural changes in the spinal cord of PD M83 mouse model.
