37915889|a|Background: The number of frail patients of advanced age with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) undergoing hemodialysis is increasing globally. Here we evaluated a frailty screening program of ESKD patients starting hemodialysis, and subsequent multidisciplinary interventions. Methods: This was a prospective observational study of ESKD patients in a hemodialysis program. Patients were evaluated for frailty (Fried frail phenotype) before and after a 12-month period. Patients followed standard clinical practice at our hospital, which included assessment and multidisciplinary interventions for nutritional (malnutrition-inflammation score, protein-energy wasting), physical [short physical performance battery (SPPB)] and psychological status. Results: A total of 167 patients (mean +- standard deviation age 67.8 +- 15.4 years) were screened for frailty, and 108 completed the program. At screening, 27.9% of the patients were frail, 40.0% pre-frail and 32.1% non-frail. Nutritional interventions (enrichment, oral nutritional supplements, intradialytic parenteral nutrition) resulted in stable nutritional status for most frail and pre-frail patients after 12 months. Patients following recommendations for intradialytic, home-based or combined physical exercise presented improved or stable in SPPB scores after 12 months, compared with those that did not follow recommendations, especially in the frail and pre-frail population (P = .025). A rate of 0.05 falls/patient/year was observed. More than 60% of frail patients presented high scores of sadness and anxiety. Conclusions: Frailty screening, together with coordinated interventions by nutritionists, physiotherapists, psychologists and nurses, preserved the health status of ESKD patients starting hemodialysis. Frailty assessment helped in advising patients on individual nutritional, physical or psychological needs.
