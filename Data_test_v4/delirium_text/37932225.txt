37932225|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the impact of different types of complications on long-term survival following total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 926 patients who underwent total gastrectomy between 2008 and 2016 were included. Patients were divided into the morbidity and no-morbidity groups, and long-term survival was compared between the 2 groups. The prognostic impact of postoperative morbidity was assessed using a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, which accounted for other prognostic factors. In the multivariate model, the effects of each complication on survival were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 229 patients (24.7%) developed postoperative complications. Patients with postoperative morbidity showed significantly worse overall survival (OS) (5-year, 65.0% vs. 76.7%, P<0.001) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) (5-year, 74.2% vs. 83.1%, P=0.002) compared to those without morbidity. Multivariate analysis adjusting for other prognostic factors showed that postoperative morbidity remained an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.442; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.136-1.831) and CSS (HR, 1.463; 95% CI, 1.063-2.013). There was no significant difference in survival according to the severity of complications. The following complications showed a significant association with unfavorable long-term survival: ascites (HR, 1.868 for OS, HR, 2.052 for CSS), wound complications (HR, 2.653 for OS, HR, 2.847 for CSS), and pulmonary complications (HR, 2.031 for OS, HR, 1.915 for CSS). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative morbidity adversely impacted survival following total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Among the different types of complications, ascites, wound complications, and pulmonary complications exhibited significant associations with long-term survival.
