From the viewpoint of psychiatric diagnosis, the most common psychiatric conditions experienced by cancer patients are adjustment disorders, major depression, and delirium.

Psychotropic medication including benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and major antipsychotics are usually provided depending on each patient's symptoms. This review focuses on the psychiatric disorders experienced by cancer patients and provides an overview regarding appropriate pharmacological interventions for psychiatric disorders among cancer patients.
