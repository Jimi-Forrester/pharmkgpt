25079801|a|BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging techniques combined with computational neuroanatomy have been playing a role in the investigation of healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The definition of normative rules for brain features is a crucial step to establish typical and atypical aging trajectories. OBJECTIVE: To introduce an unsupervised pattern recognition method; to define multivariate normative rules of neuroanatomical measures; and to propose a brain abnormality index. METHODS: This study was based on a machine learning approach (one class classification or novelty detection) to neuroanatomical measures (brain regions, volume, and cortical thickness) extracted from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)'s database. We applied a nu-One-Class Support Vector Machine (nu-OC-SVM) trained with data from healthy subjects to build an abnormality index, which was compared with subjects diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and AD. RESULTS: The method was able to classify AD subjects as outliers with an accuracy of 84.3% at a false alarm rate of 32.5%. The proposed brain abnormality index was found to be significantly associated with group diagnosis, clinical data, biomarkers, and future conversion to AD. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that one-class classification may be a promising approach to help in the detection of disease conditions. Our findings support a framework considering the continuum of brain abnormalities from healthy aging to AD, which is correlated with cognitive impairment and biomarkers measurements.
