16644743|t|Safety, biodistribution, and dosimetry of 123I-IMPY: a novel amyloid plaque-imaging agent for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
16644743|a|UNLABELLED: (123)I-IMPY (6-iodo-2-(4'-dimethylamino-)phenyl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine) is a novel radiopharmaceutical that selectively binds to Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid plaques. As a first step toward validating this radiopharmaceutical as an imaging biomarker for AD, we measured the whole-body biokinetics and radiation dosimetry of (123)I-IMPY in AD patients and cognitively normal control subjects. The pharmacologic safety profile of the compound was simultaneously assessed. METHODS: The sample included 9 subjects ranging in age from 44 to 80 y. Whole-body images were obtained for each subject (mean +/- SD, 9.0 +/- 3.2 scans per subject) for up to 48 h after the intravenous administration of 185 MBq (5 mCi) of (123)I-IMPY. The fraction of administered activity in 12 regions of interest was quantified from the attenuation-corrected geometric mean counts in conjugate views. Multiexponential functions were iteratively fit to each time-activity curve using a nonlinear, least-squares regression algorithm. These curves were numerically integrated to yield cumulated activity values for source organs. Radiation doses were then estimated with the MIRD technique. RESULTS: The radiotracer had no pharmacologic effects (produced no changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or laboratory results) on any of the subjects. Radiation dosimetry estimates indicated that the dose-limiting organ was the gallbladder, which received an average of 0.135 mGy/MBq (range, 0.075-0.198 mGy/MBq). The effective dose equivalent and effective dose for (123)I-IMPY were 0.042 +/- 0.003 mSv/MBq and 0.035 +/- 0.001 mSv/MBq, respectively. The mean effective dose for (123)I-IMPY was similar to that for (111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (0.035 mGy/MBq), less than half that for (111)In-pentetreotide (0.81 mGy/MBq), and approximately twice that for (123)I-IMP (0.018 mGy/MBq). No significant differences were found between men and women or between AD patients and control subjects. CONCLUSION: (123)I-IMPY may be a safe radiotracer with appropriate biokinetics for imaging amyloid plaques in AD patients.
