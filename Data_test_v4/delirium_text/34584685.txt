34584685|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is one of the most common but severe perioperative complications. Autonomic activity evaluated by heart rate variability (HRV) has been recently reported as a useful tool for prediction and for early detection of delirium in acute care medicine, especially in postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) patients. We hypothesized that HRV, by 3-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), one day prior to surgery might correlate with the presence of postoperative delirium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was cohort prospective pilot study. We measured preoperative HRV and postoperative delirium in patients who underwent surgery for elective esophageal cancer. ECG of the participants was performed for 10 min 6-12 h preceding surgery. Postoperatively, patients were admitted to the ICU or critical care unit and stayed for at least 3 days. Delirium was diagnosed by psychiatrist rounds twice a day. RESULTS: Delirium was assessed for 3 days after surgery and 30 patients performed the study. Seven patients developed delirium during their ICU stay, while the remaining twenty-three did not. After HRV analysis, the preoperative high frequency power in delirium patients was significantly lower than that in non-delirium patient. Other parameters of HRV, including lower frequency power, total power and the ratio showed no statistically significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSION: The results of current study demonstrated that preoperative measurement of HRV may be a useful predictor of delirium. Further investigation could pave the way to a non-invasive, minimally stressful method of predicting postoperative delirium.
