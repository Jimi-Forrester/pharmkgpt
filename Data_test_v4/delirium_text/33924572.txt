33924572|t|Significant Impact of Coffee Consumption on MR-Based Measures of Cardiac Function in a Population-Based Cohort Study without Manifest Cardiovascular Disease.
33924572|a|Subclinical effects of coffee consumption (CC) with regard to metabolic, cardiac, and neurological complications were evaluated using a whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol. A blended approach was used to estimate habitual CC in a population-based study cohort without a history of cardiovascular disease. Associations of CC with MRI markers of gray matter volume, white matter hyperintensities, cerebral microhemorrhages, total and visceral adipose tissue (VAT), hepatic proton density fat fraction, early/late diastolic filling rate, end-diastolic/-systolic and stroke volume, ejection fraction, peak ejection rate, and myocardial mass were evaluated by linear regression. In our analysis with 132 women and 168 men, CC was positively associated with MR-based cardiac function parameters including late diastolic filling rate, stroke volume (p < 0.01 each), and ejection fraction (p < 0.05) when adjusting for age, sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, Low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides, cholesterol, and alcohol consumption. CC was inversely associated with VAT independent of demographic variables and cardiovascular risk factors (p < 0.05), but this association did not remain significant after additional adjustment for alcohol consumption. CC was not significantly associated with potential neurodegeneration. We found a significant positive and independent association between CC and MRI-based systolic and diastolic cardiac function. CC was also inversely associated with VAT but not independent of alcohol consumption.
