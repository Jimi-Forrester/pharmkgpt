35563200|t|Molecular Pharmacology of Inflammation Resolution in Atherosclerosis.
35563200|a|Atherosclerosis is one of the most important problems of modern medicine as it is the leading cause of hospitalizations, disability, and mortality. The key role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis is the imbalance between the activation of inflammation in the vascular wall and the mechanisms of its control. The resolution of inflammation is the most important physiological mechanism that is impaired in atherosclerosis. The resolution of inflammation has complex, not fully known mechanisms, in which lipid mediators derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play an important role. Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) represent a group of substances that carry out inflammation resolution and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. SPMs include lipoxins, resolvins, maresins, and protectins, which are formed from PUFAs and regulate many processes related to the active resolution of inflammation. Given the physiological importance of these substances, studies examining the possibility of pharmacological effects on inflammation resolution are of interest.
