8547370|t|A flexible system of detection for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
8547370|a|Brief methods for detecting Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are widely used in epidemiological and clinical research, and, increasingly, for clinical purposes in health care settings, such as primary medical care and geriatric evaluation and management (GEM) units. There are many instruments from which to choose for these purposes, but they have generally been developed in isolation. Little is known about the gains in precision (incremental validity) from using more than one instrument in an integrated manner in the process of detection, nor has there been a systematic evaluation of the usefulness of being able to choose from a repertoire of instruments to suit specific screening contexts. The key characteristics of the techniques featured here, namely, brevity and ease of administration, allow such assessments to find a place in many different contexts. This paper presents findings supporting specific recommendations for a limited battery of brief screening techniques for detection of dementia, that can be tailored, standing alone or in combinations, to optimally suit particular requirements of (i) precision, or (ii) style of administration.
