35997202|a|AIM: Care dependence has been scarcely investigated in coronary heart disease patients after percutaneous coronary intervention. This study aimed to investigate the association between frailty, self-efficacy, combined effects of frailty and self-efficacy, mental health, and care dependence in coronary heart disease patients after percutaneous coronary intervention. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Data from 400 patients after percutaneous coronary intervention were collected from 2017-2020. Logistic regression model and mediating analysis were used to identify the association between frailty, self-efficacy, combined effects of frailty and self-efficacy, and care dependence. RESULTS: Patients with frailty and self-efficacy tended to have severe care dependence symptoms. There was no correlation between frailty symptoms, self-efficacy, and care dependence in patients without symptoms of anxiety or depression. But in patients with anxiety or depression symptoms, there is a strong correlation between frailty symptoms, lower self-efficacy, and care dependence. Mental health played an inhibitory effect on frailty and care dependence.
