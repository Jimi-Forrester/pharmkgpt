29773015|t|Caffeine: A Potential Protective Agent Against Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's Disease.
29773015|a|Over the past few decades, caffeine has been well recognized as a stimulant whose effects can be detected particularly in the central nervous system. A stimulating effect of caffeine has been found useful in treating patients with many neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is reported to be a rapidly increasing public health problem with lack of a remedial treatment. However, the assumed protective effects of caffeine against AD are of huge interest. This study substantiates caffeine's role as a potential prevention agent against AD through several epidemiological studies. More than 75% of available study reports support the opinion that caffeine has a favorable effect against cognitive decline and AD. Moreover, other studies have discussed the effect of caffeine drinking and concluded several positive effects on cognitive functioning. The present study, however, focuses more on the potential mechanisms by which caffeine diminishes effects as well as delays the onset of AD.
