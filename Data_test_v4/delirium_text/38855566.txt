38855566|a|Nausea and vomiting are common experiences and are often dreaded more than pain. This review discusses blonanserin, mirtazapine, and isopropyl alcohol as antiemetics. Blonanserin, an atypical antipsychotic with a high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3 receptors and serotonin receptor 5-HT2A, has less of a risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects. Transdermal blonanserin, available in Korea, Japan, and China in a small number of trials, has improved nausea in patients not responding to standard antiemetics. Mirtazapine is a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant that has been used for multiple symptoms besides depression. There is little evidence that mirtazapine improves anorexia or nausea in advanced cancer but is as effective as olanzapine in reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Isopropyl alcohol aromatherapy has been successfully used in the emergency department for nausea and vomiting with an onset to benefit more rapidly than standard antiemetics. Isopropyl alcohol prep pads can be used for home-going antiemetic therapy and as a bridge to treating acute nausea until standard antiemetics take effect.
