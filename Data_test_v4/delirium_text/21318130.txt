21318130|t|Spectroscopic Characterization of Intermolecular Interaction of Amyloid beta Promoted on GM1 Micelles.
21318130|a|Clusters of GM1 gangliosides act as platforms for conformational transition of monomeric, unstructured amyloid beta (Abeta) to its toxic beta-structured aggregates. We have previously shown that Abeta(1-40) accommodated on the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface of lyso-GM1 or GM1 micelles assumes alpha-helical structures under ganglioside-excess conditions. For better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the alpha-to-beta conformational transition of Abeta on GM1 clusters, we performed spectroscopic characterization of Abeta(1-40) titrated with GM1. It was revealed that the thioflavin T- (ThT-) reactive beta-structure is more populated in Abeta(1-40) under conditions where the Abeta(1-40) density on GM1 micelles is high. Under this circumstance, the C-terminal hydrophobic anchor Val(39)-Val(40) shows two distinct conformational states that are reactive with ThT, while such Abeta species were not generated by smaller lyso-GM1 micelles. These findings suggest that GM1 clusters promote specific Abeta-Abeta interactions through their C-termini coupled with formation of the ThT-reactive beta-structure depending on sizes and curvatures of the clusters.
