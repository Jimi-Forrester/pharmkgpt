36428877|t|Vascular Aging and Damage in Patients with Iron Metabolism Disorders.
36428877|a|Vascular aging is a physiological, multifactorial process that involves every type of vessel, from large arteries to microcirculation. This manifests itself as impaired vasomotor function, altered secretory phenotype, deteriorated intercellular transport function, structural remodeling, and aggravated barrier function between the blood and the vascular smooth muscle layer. Iron disorders, particularly iron overload, may lead to oxidative stress and, among other effects, vascular aging. The elevated transferrin saturation and serum iron levels observed in iron overload lead to the formation of a non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) fraction with high pro-oxidant activity. NTBI can induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which induce lipid peroxidation and mediate iron-related damage as the elements of oxidative stress in many tissues, including heart and vessels' mitochondria. However, the available data make it difficult to precisely determine the impact of iron metabolism disorders on vascular aging; therefore, the relationship requires further investigation. Our study aims to present the current state of knowledge on vascular aging in patients with deteriorated iron metabolism.
