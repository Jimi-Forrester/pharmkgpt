25405533|a|Highly expressed Erythropoietin Receptor (EPO-R) has been detected in several nonhematopoietic hypoxic cells, including cells from different brain areas in response to many different types of cell injury. In brain, hypoxia-ischemia (HI) can induce a wide spectrum of biologic responses, where inflammation and apoptosis are the main protagonists. Inflammation, as a primary brain insult, can induce a chronic hypoxic condition, producing the continuous cycle of inflammation-hypoxia that increases the apoptotic-cell number. It has also been demonstrated that administration of erythropoietin (EPO) prevented the neuronal death induced by HI, as well as the induction of lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus in a rodent model of Alzheimer's disease. Anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and/or cell-proliferative effects of EPO, have been observed in all type of cells expressing EPO-R, resulting in a potential tool for neuroprotection, neuroreparation, or neurogenesis of brain damaged areas. The nasal route is an alternative way of drugs administration that has been successfully exploited for bypassing the blood brain barrier, and subsequently delivering EPO and other molecules to central nervous system. Intranasal administration of EPO could be a new therapeutic opportunity in several brain damages that includes hypoxia, inflammation, neurodegenerative process, and apoptosis.
