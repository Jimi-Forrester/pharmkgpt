36833405|t|Impacts of Eccentric Resistance Exercise on DNA Methylation of Candidate Genes for Inflammatory Cytokines in Skeletal Muscle and Leukocytes of Healthy Males.
36833405|a|Physical inactivity and a poor diet increase systemic inflammation, while chronic inflammation can be reduced through exercise and nutritional interventions. The mechanisms underlying the impacts of lifestyle interventions on inflammation remain to be fully explained; however, epigenetic modifications may be critical. The purpose of our study was to investigate the impacts of eccentric resistance exercise and fatty acid supplementation on DNA methylation and mRNA expression of TNF and IL6 in skeletal muscle and leukocytes. Eight non-resistance exercise-trained males completed three bouts of isokinetic eccentric contractions of the knee extensors. The first bout occurred at baseline, the second occurred following a three-week supplementation of either omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid or extra virgin olive oil and the final bout occurred after eight-weeks of eccentric resistance training and supplementation. Acute exercise decreased skeletal muscle TNF DNA methylation by 5% (p = 0.031), whereas IL6 DNA methylation increased by 3% (p = 0.01). Leukocyte DNA methylation was unchanged following exercise (p > 0.05); however, three hours post-exercise the TNF DNA methylation decreased by 2% (p = 0.004). In skeletal muscle, increased TNF and IL6 mRNA expression levels were identified immediately post-exercise (p < 0.027); however, the leukocyte mRNA expression was unchanged. Associations between DNA methylation and markers of exercise performance, inflammation and muscle damage were identified (p < 0.05). Acute eccentric resistance exercise is sufficient to induce tissue-specific DNA methylation modifications to TNF and IL6; however, neither eccentric training nor supplementation was sufficient to further modify the DNA methylation.
