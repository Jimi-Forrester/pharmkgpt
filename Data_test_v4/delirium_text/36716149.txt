36716149|t|NOVA1 acts on Impact to regulate hypothalamic function and translation in inhibitory neurons.
36716149|a|We describe a patient haploinsufficient for the neuronal RNA binding protein NOVA1 who developed a behavioral motor hyperactivity disorder, suggesting a role of NOVA1 in postnatal motor inhibition. To investigate Nova1's action in adult Gad2+ inhibitory neurons, we generated a conditional Nova1-null mouse (Nova1-cKOGad2-cre). Strikingly, the phenotypes of these mice show many similarities to the NOVA1 haploinsufficient patient and identify a function of Nova1 in the hypothalamus. Molecularly, Nova1 loss in Gad2-positive neurons alters downstream expression of Impact mRNA, along with a subset of RNAs encoding electron transport chain-related factors and ribosomal proteins. NOVA1 stabilizes Impact mRNA by binding its 3' UTR, antagonizing the actions of miR-138 and miR-124. Together, these studies demonstrate actions of NOVA1 in adult hypothalamic neurons, mechanisms by which it functions in translation and metabolism, including through direct binding to Impact mRNA, and illuminate its role in human neurologic disease.
