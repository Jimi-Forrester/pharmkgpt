38539079|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia is often associated with Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (NPS) such as agitation, depression, hallucinations, anxiety, that can cause distress for the resident with dementia in long-term care settings and can impose emotional burden on the environment. NPS are often treated with psychotropic drugs, which, however, frequently cause side effects. Alternatively, non-pharmacological interventions can improve well-being and maintain an optimal quality of life (QoL) of those living with dementia. Other QoL related outcomes, such as pain, discomfort and sleep disruption are relevant outcomes in music trials as well. Music therapy is a non-pharmacological intervention that can reduce NPS and improve well-being, and its associated symptoms in dementia. METHODS: The research will be conducted at eight nursing home facilities of a health care organization in the Netherlands. A sample size of 30 in each group (experimental and control group) is required, totalling 60 residents increased to 80 when considering expected drop out to follow up. The participants in the intervention group receive 30 min of individual music therapy (MT) in their own room by a music therapist twice a week for 12 weeks. The participants in the control group will receive 30 min of individual attention in their own room by a volunteer twice a week for 12 weeks. Assessments will be done at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks. An independent observer, blinded for the intervention or control condition, will assess directly observed well-being (primary outcome) and pain (secondary outcome) before and after the sessions. Nurses will assess other secondary outcomes unblinded, i.e., perceived quality of life and NPS, both assessed with validated scales. The sleep duration will be indirectly assessed by a wrist device called MotionWatch. Information about psychotropic drug use will be derived from electronic medical chart review. DISCUSSION: The main purpose of this study is to assess the effects of individual music therapy on directly observed well-being controlled for individual attention in nursing home residents with dementia with NPS. The outcomes refer to both short-term and long-term effects consistent with therapeutic goals of care for a longer term. We hope to overcome limitations of previous study designs such as not blinded designs and music facilitators that were not only music therapists but also occupational therapists and nurses. This study should lead to more focused recommendations for practice and further research into non-pharmacological interventions in dementia such as music therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered at the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal in the Netherlands Trial Registration number NL7708, registration date 04-05-2019.
