RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of data from COVID-19 Supplements of Medicare Current Beneficiary Surveys administered in Summer (N = 11,114, unweighted) and Fall (N = 9686, unweighted) 2020, and Winter 2021 (N = 11,107, unweighted). Binary logistic regression was used to model for adjusted odds of self-reports of being unable to access different types of care. RESULTS: In three time periods from March 2020 through March/April 2021 beneficiaries with diabetes plus MCC combinations reported being unable to get medical care, compared to beneficiaries with diabetes alone. Notably, patterns persisted at the 12-month mark with beneficiaries with diabetes plus cancer (OR = 1.24), and diabetes plus cancer/stroke (OR = 2.53) experiencing increased odds of being unable to get care because of COVID-19, compared to beneficiaries with diabetes alone. By March/April 2021 beneficiaries with diabetes plus COPD (OR = 1.08), diabetes plus stroke (OR = 1.49), and diabetes plus Alzheimer's (OR = 1.09) experienced increased odds of being unable to get treatment for ongoing conditions. Beneficiaries with diabetes plus Alzheimer's (OR = 1.40) also experienced increased odds of being unable to get a regular check-up 12 months into the pandemic. Finally, members of racial/ethnic minority groups experienced increased odds of being unable to obtain services at various times during the pandemic compared to non-Hispanic Whites, with increased odds persisting at 12 months for non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: Beneficiaries with MCC, and minorities, experienced increased odds of being unable to obtain some services during COVID-19, even when controlling for similar diabetes and MCC combinations. Work remains for providers and public health systems to dismantle and reimagine systems to provide equitable access to care.
