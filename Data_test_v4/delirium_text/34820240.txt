34820240|t|A Case of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura After Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech) COVID-19 Vaccine.
34820240|a|Vaccination is now considered the best measure in minimizing the morbidity and mortality from the Covid-19 pandemic. Almost all the vaccines are considered safe except for minor and occasional side effects. Some of the commonly reported complications from the COVID-19 vaccines are vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)/thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome/vaccine-induced pro-thrombotic immune thrombocytopenia syndrome. In this case report, we present a case of a 75-year-old female who had an uncomplicated first and second vaccine dose but developed VITT after the booster dose of the vaccine. The patient was treated with dexamethasone and platelet transfusions. So far no such cases have been reported after the third (booster) dose of the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine. With this case report, we present the case of the patient and discuss the literature related to vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia.
