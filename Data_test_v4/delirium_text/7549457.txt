7549457|t|Delirium associated with mianserin.
7549457|a|Delirium may develop in vulnerable subjects under normal doses of psychotropic drugs. The occurrence of delirium in patients treated with tricyclic antidepressants is attributed to the anticholinergic activity of these drugs. Mianserin, characterized by low anticholinergic activity, has been recommended for treatment of depression in elderly patients. We report five cases of delirium in elderly patients treated with mianserin. The incidence of organo-mental side effects associated with this drug may be higher than previously reported.
