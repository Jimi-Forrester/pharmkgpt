38833116|t|Insights into AlphaFold's breakthrough in neurodegenerative diseases.
38833116|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by impairment in neurons' functions, and complete loss, leading to memory loss, and difficulty in learning, language, and movement processes. The most common among these NDs are Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), although several other disorders also exist. These are frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral syndrome (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and others; the major pathological hallmark of NDs is the proteinopathies, either of amyloid-beta (Abeta), tauopathies, or synucleinopathies. Aggregation of proteins that do not undergo normal configuration, either due to mutations or through some disturbance in cellular pathway contributes to the diseases. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) have proven to be successful in the diagnosis and treatment of various congenital diseases. DL approaches like AlphaFold (AF) are a major leap towards success in CNS disorders. This 3D protein geometry modeling algorithm developed by DeepMind has the potential to revolutionize biology. AF has the potential to predict 3D-protein confirmation at an accuracy level comparable to experimentally predicted one, with the additional advantage of precisely estimating protein interactions. This breakthrough will be beneficial to identify diseases' advancement and the disturbance of signaling pathways stimulating impaired functions of proteins. Though AlphaFold has solved a major problem in structural biology, it cannot predict membrane proteins-a beneficial approach for drug designing.
