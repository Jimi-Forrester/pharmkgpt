32832007|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Amyloid beta- (Abeta-) induced mitochondrial dysfunction may be a primary process triggering all the cascades of events that lead to AD. Therefore, identification of natural factors and endogenous mechanisms that protect neurons against Abeta toxicity is needed. In the current study, we investigated whether alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), as a natural product, would increase insulin and IGF-I (insulin-like growth factor I) release from astrocytes. Moreover, we explored the protective effect of astrocytes-derived insulin/IGF-I on Abeta-induced neurotoxicity, with special attention paid to their impact on mitochondrial function of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. The results showed that ALA induced insulin and IGF-I secretion from astrocytes. Our findings demonstrated that astrocyte-derived insulin/insulin-like growth factor I protects differentiated SH-SY5Y cells against Abeta 1-42-induced cell death. Moreover, pretreatment with conditioned medium (CM) and ALA-preactivated CM (ALA-CM) protected the SH-SY5Y cells against Abeta 1-42-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, increasing mitochondrial biogenesis, restoring the balance between fusion and fission processes, and regulation of mitophagy and autophagy processes. Our study suggested that astrocyte-derived insulin/insulin-like growth factor I suppresses Abeta 1-42-induced cytotoxicity in the SH-SY5Y cells by protecting against mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, the neuroprotective effects of CM were intensified by preactivation with ALA.
