35671352|t|Optimized Administration of the M4 PAM VU0467154 Demonstrates Broad Efficacy, but Limited Effective Concentrations in Mecp2+/- Mice.
35671352|a|Hypofunction of cholinergic circuits and diminished cholinergic tone have been associated with the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (RTT). Specifically, deletion of Mecp2 in cholinergic neurons evokes the same social and cognitive phenotypes in mice seen with global Mecp2 knockout, and decreased choline acetyltransferase activity and vesamicol binding have been reported in RTT autopsy samples. Further, we recently identified significant decreases in muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype 4 (M4) expression in both the motor cortex and cerebellum of RTT patient autopsies and established proof of concept that an acute dose of the positive allosteric modulator (PAM) VU0467154 (VU154) rescued phenotypes in Mecp2+/- mice. Here, we expand the assessment of M4 PAMs in RTT to address clinically relevant questions of tolerance, scope of benefit, dose response, chronic treatment, and mechanism. We show that VU154 has efficacy on anxiety, social preference, cognitive, and respiratory phenotypes in Mecp2+/- mice; however, the therapeutic range is narrow, with benefits seen at 3 mg/kg concentrations, but not 1 or 10 mg/kg. Further, sociability was diminished in VU154-treated Mecp2+/- mice, suggestive of a potential adverse effect. Compound efficacy on social, cognitive, and respiratory phenotypes was conserved with a 44-day treatment paradigm, with the caveat that breath rate was moderately decreased with chronic treatment in Mecp2+/+ and Mecp2+/- mice. VU154 effects on respiratory function correlated with an increase in Gsk3beta inhibition in the brainstem. These results identify the core symptom domains where efficacy and adverse effects may present with M4 administration in RTT model mice and advocate for the continued evaluation as potential RTT therapeutics.
