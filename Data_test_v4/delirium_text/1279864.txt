1279864|t|Sulfated glycoprotein 2: new relationships of this multifunctional protein to neurodegeneration.
1279864|a|Sulfated glycoprotein 2 (SGP-2) from rat, and similar molecules from cow, dog, human, pig, ram and quail are known by 11 or more acronyms. SGP-2 is associated with the responses of brain and other tissues to injury; it and related molecules are also normally secreted by the adrenal gland, the liver and the testes. The mRNA of this protein is found in increased levels in Alzheimer's disease. In rats, after perforant path or excitotoxin lesions, levels of the protein or mRNA are elevated in astrocytes, and also in neurons. In rats, brain SGP-2 is regulated by gonadal and adrenal steroids. However, these increases after brain lesions may relate to a function that is associated with the human protein, namely that of inhibiting complement-mediated cell lysis. Other activities suggested for SGP-2 are lipid transport and cell-cell interactions, which are consistent with sequence data that predict binding of dinucleotides, heparin and lipids. The emerging neurobiology of SGP-2 encompasses the subjects of cell death, synaptic remodelling, neuroendocrinology and neurodegenerative diseases.
