33847072|a|INTRODUCTION: Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric condition in the general hospital population. Thus, the goal of the present study is to extend the use of diagnostic tools for delirium by developing and validating a Mandarin version of the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). METHODS: Participants were sampled from two general Mackay Memorial Hospital locations in Taipei and Danshui. Board-certified psychiatrists assessed patients using the MDAS, confusion assessment method (CAM), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Another consultation-liaison psychiatrist confirmed the diagnosis of delirium. We assessed the reliability and validity of the MDAS, and the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the optimal cut-off point for identifying delirium. RESULTS: Of the 61 patients assessed, 29 were diagnosed with delirium. The mean MDAS score was 16.7 for delirium patients and 4.1 for nondelirium patients. The MDAS has good internal consistency, with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.912. Interrater reliability was 0.996 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.992-0.998). The diagnostic cut-off value for the Mandarin version of the MDAS was 9, with a high sensitivity (93.1%) and specificity (96.9%). Factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure; these factors accounted for 58.37% and 14.42% of the variance. A high correlation was found between the MDAS and the CAM scores (r = -0.849, p < .001) as well as the MMSE (r = -0.875, p < .001). DISCUSSION: The Mandarin MDAS exhibited good reliability and validity for assessing general hospital patients.
