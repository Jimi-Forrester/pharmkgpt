19821615|a|Inhibition of gamma-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a prime target for the development of therapeutics for treating Alzheimer's disease; however, complete inhibition of this activity would also impair the processing of many other proteins, including the APP homologues, amyloid precursor-like protein (APLP) 1 and 2. To prevent unwanted side effects, therapeutically useful gamma-secretase inhibitors should specifically target APP processing while sparing cleavage of other gamma-substrates. Thus, since APLP1 and APLP2 are more similar to APP than any of the other known gamma-secretase substrates and have important physiological roles in their own right, we reasoned that comparison of the effect of gamma-secretase inhibitors on APLP processing should provide a sensitive indicator of the selectivity of putative inhibitors. To address this issue, we have optimized microsome and cell culture assays to monitor the gamma-secretase proteolysis of APP and APLPs. Production of the gamma-secretase-generated intracellular domain (ICD) occurs more rapidly from APLP1 than from either APLP2 or APP, suggesting that APLP1 is a better gamma-substrate and that substrate recognition is not restricted to the highly conserved amino acid sequences surrounding the epsilon-site. As expected, the well-characterized gamma-secretase modulator, fenofibrate, did not inhibit ICD release, whereas a related compound, FT-9, inhibited gamma-secretase both in microsomes and in whole cells. Importantly, FT-9 displayed a preferential effect, inhibiting cleavage of APP much more effectively than cleavage of APLP1. These findings suggest that selective inhibitors can be developed and that screening of compounds against APP and APLPs should assist in this process.
