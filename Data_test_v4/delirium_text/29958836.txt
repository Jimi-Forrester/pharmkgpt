29958836|a|Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a constitutively active kinase, involved in regulation of multiple physiological processes. In brain, changes in GSK-3 signaling are related to neurodegenerative issues, including Alzheimer's disease. Due to the wide range of GSK-3 cellular targets, a therapeutic use of the enzyme inhibitors entails significant risk of side effects. Thus, altering the ratio of specific pool of GSK-3 or specific substrates instead of changing the global activity of GSK-3 in brains might be a more appropriate strategy. This paper provides a comprehensive data on abundances of proteins involved in GSK-3 signaling in three regions of young and old mouse brains. It might help to identify novel protein targets with the highest therapeutic potential for treatment of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.
