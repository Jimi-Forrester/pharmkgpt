37861875|t|A novel set of volatile urinary biomarkers for late-life major depressive and anxiety disorders upon the progression of frailty: a pilot study.
37861875|a|Mood and anxiety disorders are frequent in the elderly and increase the risk of frailty. This study aimed to identify novel biomarkers of major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety in the elderly. We examined 639 participants in the community-dwelling Otassha Study (518 individuals considered healthy control, 77 with depression, anxiety, etc.), mean age 75 years, 58.4% of female. After exclusion criteria, we analyzed VOCs from 18 individuals (9 healthy control, 9 of MDD/agoraphobia case). Urinary volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were profiled using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Six urinary VOCs differed in the absolute area of the base peak between participants with MDD and/or agoraphobia and controls. High area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) values were found for phenethyl isothiocyanate (AUC: 0.86, p = 0.009), hexanoic acid (AUC: 0.85, p = 0.012), texanol (AUC: 0.99, p = 0.0005), and texanol isomer (AUC: 0.89, p = 0.005). The combined indices of dimethyl sulfone, phenethyl isothiocyanate, and hexanoic acid, and texanol and texanol isomer showed AUCs of 0.91 (p = 0.003) and 0.99 (p = 0.0005) and correlated with the GRID-HAMD and the Kihon Checklist (CL score), respectively. These VOCs may be valuable biomarkers for evaluating MDD and/or agoraphobia in the elderly.
