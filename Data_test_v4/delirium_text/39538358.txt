39538358|a|OBJECTIVES: Delirium is a prominent symptom of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) and is highly prevalent in septic patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, being closely connected with raised mortality rates. Acute hyperglycemia (AH) has been recognized as a separate risk factor for delirium and a worse prognosis in critically sick patients. Nevertheless, the exact contribution of AH to the advancement of SAE is still unknown. METHODS: This research retrospectively evaluated the connection between blood glucose levels (BGLs) and the incidence of delirium and death rates in septic patients in the ICU of a tertiary comprehensive hospital. In addition, a septic rat model was induced through cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), after which continuous glucose infusion was promptly initiated via a central venous catheter post-surgery to evaluate the potential implications of AH on SAE. Next, septic rats were assigned to four groups based on target BGLs: high glucose group (HG, >= 300 mg/dL), moderate glucose group (MG, 200-300 mg/dL), normal glucose group (NG, < 200 mg/dL), and a high glucose insulin-treated group (HI, 200-300 mg/dL) receiving recombinant human insulin treatment (0.1 IU/kg/min). The sham group (SG) received an equivalent volume of saline infusion and denoted the NG group. The effects of AH on neuroinflammation and cognitive function in septic rats were evaluated using behavioral tests, histopathological examination, TUNEL staining, ELISA, and Western blot. The effects of glucose levels on microglial activation and glucose metabolism following lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mug/mL) exposure were assessed using CCK8 assay, qRT-PCR, Western blot, and ELISA. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that AH during sepsis was a separate risk factor for delirium and assisted in predicting delirium occurrence. AH raised the levels of systemic and central inflammatory cytokines in septic rats, promoting neuronal apoptosis, blood-brain barrier disruption, and cognitive impairment. In addition, both in vivo and in vitro, an elevated glucose challenge increased the ChREBP, HIF-1alpha, glycolytic enzymes, and inflammatory cytokines expressions in microglia after exposure to CLP or LPS. CONCLUSIONS: These results collectively suggest that hyperglycemia can exacerbate neuroinflammation and delirium by enhancing microglial glycolysis under septic conditions, potentially mediated by upregulation of the ChREBP/HIF-1alpha signaling pathway.
