38845733|a|Objectives: Alongside non-pharmacological intervention, pharmacotherapy particularly with atypical antipsychotics is assumed to be effective for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Methods: This retrospective study investigated the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapy including antipsychotics in outpatients or inpatients with BPSD. Results: Of all Alzheimer-type dementia (AD) patients with BPSD initiating treatment between March and August 2011, a total of 102 patients available for 12-month follow-up comprised the subjects in this chart review. Of these, 68 (66.7%) continued treatment in the ambulatory or inpatient setting, with their MMSE scores improved from 17.3 +- 3.6 at baseline to 18.3 +- 3.53, 17.9 +- 3.80 and 17.0 +- 4.14 after 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. In contrast, their NPI scores were significantly different from 11.7 +- 11.2 at baseline to 4.86 +- 5.40, 3.56 +- 4.65 and 2.27 +- 3.77 after 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. Of the 36 inpatients available for follow-up, 27 (75%) on concurrent antipsychotics (chlorpromazine [CP] equivalent, 162.2 mg) at baseline remained on concurrent antipsychotics (CP equivalent, 212.5 mg) after 12 months, while, of the 66 outpatients available for follow-up, 13 (19.7%) on concurrent antipsychotics (CP equivalent, 93.4 mg) at baseline remained on concurrent antipsychotics (CP equivalent, 113.0 mg) after 12 months. Conclusions: Study results confirmed the effectiveness and safety of the study treatment in Japanese AD patients with BPSD for up to 12 months. How best to incorporate antipsychotics into the treatment of BPSD in clinical settings lies in the hands of us Japanese clinicians.
