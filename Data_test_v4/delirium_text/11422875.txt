11422875|t|Sleep-wake rhythm during stay in an intensive care unit: a week's long-term recording of skin potentials.
11422875|a|To monitor the sleep-wake cycle of patients during their stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), we tried continuous and long-term recording of skin potential (SP) levels in patients after surgery. A graph of the week-long SP showed the sleep-wake pattern to be evident until the fourth day. It disappeared beginning on the fifth day, resulting finally in delirium with a relatively high mean SP level. In another record, the administration of sedative agents to calm the excitement lowered the mean SP level and suppressed SP responses evoked by frequent day and night treatment or nursing care. Continuous monitoring of arousal level by SP will be of help in prevention of ICU syndrome.
