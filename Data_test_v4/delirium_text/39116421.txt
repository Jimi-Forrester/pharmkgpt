39116421|a|Several risk factors contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including genetics, metabolic health, cardiovascular history, and diet. It has been observed that women appear to face a higher risk of developing AD. Among the various hypotheses surrounding the gender disparity in AD, one pertains to the potential neuroprotective properties of estrogen. Compared to men, women are believed to be more susceptible to neuropathology due to the significant decline in circulating estrogen levels following menopause. Studies have shown, however, that estrogen replacement therapies in post-menopausal women do not consistently reduce the risk of AD. While menopause and estrogen levels are potential factors in the elevated incidence rates of AD among women, this review highlights the possible roles estrogen has in other pathways that may also contribute to the sex disparity observed in AD such as olfaction, sleep, and glymphatic functionality.
