35430902|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the utility of the Mild Behavioral Impairment-Checklist (MBI-C) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) to capture NPS in subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia. METHODS: In this cross-sectional memory clinic study, linear regression models compared MBI-C (n = 474) and NPI-Q (n = 1040) scores in relation to Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. RESULTS: MBI prevalence was 37% in subjective cognitive decline, 54% in mild cognitive impairment, and 62% in dementia. Worse diagnostic status was associated with higher MBI-C and NPI-Q score (P < .001), lower MoCA (P < .001), and greater age (P < .001). Higher MBI-C (beta -.09; 95% CI -.13, -.05) and NPI-Q (beta -.17; 95% CI -.23, -.10) scores were associated with lower MoCA scores, with psychosis most strongly associated (beta -1.11; 95% CI -1.56, -.65 vs beta -1.14; 95% CI -1.55, -.73). CONCLUSIONS: The MBI-C captures global and domain-specific NPS across cognitive stages. Both the MBI-C and NPI-Q have utility in characterizing NPS.
