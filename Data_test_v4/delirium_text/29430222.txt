29430222|t|Long-Term Colon Stent Patency for Obstructing Colorectal Cancer Combined with Bevacizumab.
29430222|a|Self-expanding metal stents can be considered as initial treatment for malignant large bowel obstruction in the palliative setting. It is suggested that systemic anti-angiogenic therapy increases the risk of stent perforation. We report a 65-year-old woman with a metastatic, obstructing colon tumor who has been successfully treated with stent placement and chemoimmunotherapy consisting of capecitabine and bevacizumab for 8 years.
