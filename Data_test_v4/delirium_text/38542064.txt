38542064|a|Recent evidence indicates that experimental brain ischemia leads to dementia with an Alzheimer's disease-like type phenotype and genotype. Based on the above evidence, it was hypothesized that brain ischemia may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease. Brain ischemia and Alzheimer's disease are two diseases characterized by similar changes in the hippocampus that are closely related to memory impairment. Following brain ischemia in animals and humans, the presence of amyloid plaques in the extracellular space and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles was revealed. The phenomenon of tau protein hyperphosphorylation is a similar pathological feature of both post-ischemic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, the phosphorylated Thr231 motif in tau protein has two distinct trans and cis conformations and is the primary site of tau protein phosphorylation in the pre-entanglement cascade and acts as an early precursor of tau protein neuropathology in the form of neurofibrillary tangles. Based on the latest publication, we present a similar mechanism of the formation of neurofibrillary tangles after brain ischemia as in Alzheimer's disease, established on trans- and cis-phosphorylation of tau protein, which ultimately influences the development of tauopathy.
