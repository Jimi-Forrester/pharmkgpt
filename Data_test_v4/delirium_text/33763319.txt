33763319|a|We present a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in a 46-year-old white female from a state psychiatric hospital who also tested positive for coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2) infection after re-introduction of her home antipsychotics medication. She presented with confusion and altered mental status likely secondary to delirium from COVID-19 infection. Clozapine and risperidone were initially held on admission and restarted after continuing agitation on day two. She began to have increased restlessness with rising creatinine kinase (CK) levels, peaking on day seven with sudden fever, hypertension, and tachycardia. The diagnosis of NMS was confirmed, antipsychotic medication was held, and appropriate treatment was administered. The mechanism explaining the occurrence of NMS in COVID-19 patients is still unclear, but COVID-19 infection may be a risk factor for this presentation. The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 as a risk factor for NMS is still uncertain and needs to be investigated further. However, if their infection status is known, patients should be given neuroleptics with caution and carefully considered for the development of this rare condition.
