30117120|a|Curcumin (CUR), a natural polyphenolic compound, is considered as one of the most potential candidates against Alzheimer disease (AD) by targeting multiple pathologies such as amyloid-beta, tau phosphorylation, and oxidative stress. Poor physicochemical profile and oral bioavailability (BA) are the major contributors to its failure in clinical trials. Lack of success in numerous drug clinical trials for the treatment of AD urges the need of repositioning of CUR. To overcome its limitation and enhance oral BA, Novel CUR Formulation (NCF) was developed using self-nanomicellizing solid dispersion strategy which displayed 117-fold enhancement in oral BA of CUR. NCF was tested using SH-SY5Y695 APP human neuroblastoma cell line against the cytotoxicity induced by copper metal ion, H2O2, and Abeta42 oligomer and compared with CUR control. The safety and efficacy of NCF on mice AD-like behavioral deficits (open field, novel objective recognition, Y-maze, and Morris water maze tests) were assessed in transgenic AD (APPSwe/PS1deE9) mice model. In SH-SY5Y695 APP human neuroblastoma cell line, NCF showed better safety and efficacy against the cytotoxicity due to the significantly enhancement of cellular uptake. It not only prevents the deterioration of cognitive functions of the aged APPSwe/PS1deE9 mice during aging but also reverses the cognitive functions to their much younger age which is also better than the currently available approved options. Moreover, NCF was proved as well tolerated with no appearance of any significant toxicity via oral administration. The results of the study demonstrated the potential of NCF to improve the efficacy of CUR without compromising its safety profile, and pave the way for clinical development for AD.
