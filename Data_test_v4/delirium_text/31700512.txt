31700512|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment (CI) increases cardiac mortality among very elderly patients. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients is considered a favorable strategy for decreasing cardiac mortality. Here, we investigated the influence of CI on cardiac mortality after PCI in very elderly patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational analysis of patients who received PCI between 2012 and 2014 at the South Miyagi Medical Center, Japan. IHD patients over 80 years old who underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination for CI screening during hospitalization and/or who had been diagnosed with CI were included. Participants were divided into CI and non-CI groups, and cardiac mortality and incidence of adverse cardiac events in a 3-year follow-up period were compared between groups. Statistical analyses were performed using the t-test, chi2 test, and multivariable Cox regression analysis, with major comorbid illness and conventional cardiac risk factors as confounders. RESULTS: Of 565 patients, 95 were included (41 CI, 54 non-CI). Cardiac mortality during the follow-up period was significantly higher in the CI group (36%) compared with the non-CI group (13%) (OR = 4.3, 95% CI: 1.56-11.82, P < 0.05). CI was an independent cardiac prognostic factor after PCI and, for CI patients, living only with a CI partner was an independent predictor of cardiac death within three years. CONCLUSIONS: CI significantly affected cardiac prognosis after PCI in very elderly patients, particularly those living with a CI partner. To improve patients' prognoses, social background should be considered alongside conventional medical measures.
