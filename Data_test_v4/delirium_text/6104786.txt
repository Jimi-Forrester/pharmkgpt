6104786|t|[beta-Blockers as adjuvant therapy in delirium tremens (author's transl)].
6104786|a|Tachycardia in delirium tremens is often not adequately controlled by present delirium therapy but it can be treated with beta-receptor blockers. The favorable effect on the disorder expressed as adrenergic tachycardia due to raised excretion of catecholamine during delirium tremens is shown by pindolol (Visken) in a series of 14 patients. A favorable effect on the hypertensive circulatory condition in delirium tremens was also shown by certain ECG changes beyond those of tachycardia. In one case, a severe anaphylactic reaction occurred after the i. v. application of pindolol. No other side-effects were observed.
