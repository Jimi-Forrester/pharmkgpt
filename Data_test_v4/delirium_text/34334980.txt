METHODS: Institutional records of the arthroplasty cases, operated between 1st March to 31 August of 2019 (Group A, pre-Covid) and 2020 (Group B, pandemic year) were compared retrospectively over numerous parameters including the complications within six weeks of surgery. RESULTS: There was a significant drop (by 82.53 %) in the total number of arthroplasty surgeries in Group B (62) as compared with Group A (355). Average number of arthroplasties per month were 59.17 +- 12.93 and 10.67 +- 13.29 in Group A and Group B respectively (p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in postoperative complication rate 7/355 (1.97 %) in Group A vs 7/62 (11.29 %) in Group B during pandemic (p < 0.002), along with a higher 30-days mortality rate 2/355 (3.22 %) vs 2/62 (0.56 %). Pandemic year also saw an increased readmission rate (4.83 %) vs (0.56 %) and postoperative ICU transfer rate (1.61 %) vs (0.56 %) in comparison with pre-Covid year. CONCLUSION: In the pandemic, arthroplasty services got severely affected at our center. With nearly six fold increase in complication rates, higher 30-days mortality and increased readmission rates, caution is advised in resuming arthroplasty surgeries without robust evaluation of cases. Whether undetected Covid-19 infection or poor pre-existing disease control due to lockdown can be linked to these results is a matter of further research with larger multicenter studies.
