32127990|t|Mikania Micrantha Improved Memory Perform on Dementia Model.
32127990|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this research is to explore the existing natural resources in Jambi province which has potential as anti-dementia agent. So that will be many natural resources that can be a potential product in reducing the unwanted effects of dementia as a degenerative disorder that is currently an inevitable elderly disease. by investigating with various plants in Jambi that have activities as anti-dementia is expected more and more natural resources that can be used as neuron-protection and or neuron-curative. AIM: The purpose of this study is to find plants and / or compounds that are useful as neuroprotection. METHODS: Dementia model is formed by diabetic test animals. The test group consisted of extract group, three fractions (hexane, ethyl acetate and butanol fraction at dose 500 mg/Kg BB p.o) and one group of antidiabetic drugs glibenclamide, and the group of normal animal test animals was tested with Radial arm maze (RAM) for seven days before alloxan induced to obtain dementia model. RESULTS: The results showed that extract and ethyl acetate fraction at dose 500 mg/Kg BW gave a positive effect on memory improvement based on animal performance on RAM tool during a testing time (P < 0, 05) with LSD statistical analysis. CONCLUSION: The extract and ethyl acetate fraction of Mikania micrantha showed good potential for improving the performance of animal memory in RAM devices representing dementia models.
