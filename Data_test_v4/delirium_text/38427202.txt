38427202|t|cCOG Web-Based Cognitive Assessment Tool.
38427202|a|Cognitive testing is an essential part of clinical diagnostics and clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease. Digital cognitive tests hold a great opportunity to provide more versatile and cost-efficient patient pathways through flexible testing including at home. In this work, we describe a web-based cognitive test, cCOG, that can be used in screening, differential diagnosis, and monitoring the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.
