39857789|t|Periodontal Indices as Predictors of Cognitive Decline: Insights from the PerioMind Colombia Cohort.
39857789|a|Background: Poor oral health and periodontitis have been epidemiologically linked to cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in older adults. However, specific metrics directly linking these clinical signs are exceedingly limited. Methods: To address this gap and develop novel tools to help clinicians identify individuals at risk of cognitive decline, we established the PerioMind Colombia Cohort, comprising elderly Colombian subjects who underwent comprehensive neurocognitive and periodontal evaluations. Results: The results revealed that subjects diagnosed with MCI exhibited significantly higher scores in specific periodontal indices, including gingival erythema and pocket depth parameters. The predictive model identified positive associations with MCI, with gingival erythema showing the strongest correlation, followed by the presence of periodontitis and variations in pocket depth measurements. Additionally, lower educational attainment was associated with a higher likelihood of being classified in the periodontitis-MCI group. Conclusions: Here, we show that specific altered periodontal metrics are associated with MCI diagnosis, and the generated results provide defined metric ranges for identifying individuals at risk. Upon validation in larger cohorts, the findings reported here could offer dental practitioners and clinicians innovative tools to identify individuals at risk of MCI and age-related dementias through routine oral health assessments, thereby enabling more accessible and highly sought-after early intervention strategies in both developing and developed countries.
