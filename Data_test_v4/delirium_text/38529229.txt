38529229|t|Risk factors for recurrence of periprosthetic joint infection following operative management: a cohort study with average 5-year follow-up.
38529229|a|Background: Periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) remain challenging to eradicate even after surgical management, which in most cases involves either debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR) or single- or two-staged revision. The purpose of this study is to determine predictors of PJI recurrence after operative management for PJI, and to determine differences in recurrence-free survival between DAIR and staged revision. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of revision hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries due to PJI between 2011 and 2018 at an academic hospital. Any patient undergoing revision surgery for PJI was included except if the index surgery information was unknown. The primary outcome was confirmed PJI recurrence. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was utilized to determine the relationship between the predictor variables and outcome variable. Log rank testing was used to compare recurrence-free survival between DAIR and staged revision. Results: A total of 89 patients (91 joints) underwent revision surgery due to PJI. Younger age and presence of a sinus tract were statistically significant for risk of PJI recurrence. A multivariable logistic regression model including both variables was significant for predicting recurrence of PJI (chi2=10.2, P=0.006). Survival was not significantly different between patients who underwent DAIR versus a staged revision. Conclusions: Younger patients and those with a chronic sinus tract are at significantly higher risk of recurrent PJI. This study also demonstrated that PJI can be successfully managed in the majority of cases with DAIR or staged revision.
