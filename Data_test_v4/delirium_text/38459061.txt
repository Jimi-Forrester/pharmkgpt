38459061|t|Association of dietary live microbe intake with various cognitive domains in US adults aged 60 years or older.
38459061|a|The purpose of this study was to explore whether dietary live microbe intake is associated with various cognitive domains using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011 to 2014. And the specific relationship between low, medium and high dietary live microbe intake groups and cognitive ability of the elderly. Dietary live microbe intake was calculated from 24-h diet recall interviews. Cognitive function was assessed using the number symbol substitution test (DSST, which measures processing speed), the animal fluency test (AFT, which measures executive function), the Alzheimer's Registry sub-test (CERAD, which measures memory), and the Composite Z-score, which adds the Z-values of individual tests. Multiple linear regression models and restricted cubic bar graphs were used to investigate the relationship between live microbe intake and cognitive performance. A total of 2,450 participants aged 60 or older were included. Live microbe intake was positively correlated with cognitive ability on the whole. Specifically, when the intake of low, medium and high live microbe was > 2640 g, > 39 g and > 0 g respectively, the CERAD, DSST, AFT and compositive-Z score of the subjects increased with the increase of microbial intake (P < 0.05). In American adults age 60 or older, higher intakes of live microbes were associated with better cognitive performance, especially after a certain amount was reached.
