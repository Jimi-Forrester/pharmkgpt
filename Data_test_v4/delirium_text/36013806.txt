36013806|t|Magnesium for Implants: A Review on the Effect of Alloying Elements on Biocompatibility and Properties.
36013806|a|An attempt is made to cover the whole of the topic of biodegradable magnesium (Mg) alloys with a focus on the biocompatibility of the individual alloying elements, as well as shed light on the degradation characteristics, microstructure, and mechanical properties of most binary alloys. Some of the various work processes carried out by researchers to achieve the alloys and their surface modifications have been highlighted. Additionally, a brief look into the literature on magnesium composites as also been included towards the end, to provide a more complete picture of the topic. In most cases, the chronological order of events has not been particularly followed, and instead, this work is concentrated on compiling and presenting an update of the work carried out on the topic of biodegradable magnesium alloys from the recent literature available to us.
