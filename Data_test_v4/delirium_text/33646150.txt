33646150|t|Distinct Profile Differences in Subjective Cognitive Decline in the General Public Are Associated with Metacognition, Negative Affective Symptoms, Neuroticism, Stress, and Poor Quality of Life.
33646150|a|BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is increasingly recognized in both the clinical and research arenas as a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Although SCD is etiologically heterogeneous and potentially treatable, in comparison to MCI and Alzheimer's disease, SCD remains poorly characterized with its clinical relevance often questioned. OBJECTIVE: This study's aim was to improve the characterization of SCD within the general public. METHODS: Individuals with SCD were compared to those without via a battery of measures. RESULTS: Both the SCD and the non-SCD group correlational analysis identified significant relationships between worse SCD, worse metacognitive dysfunction, negative affective symptoms, and greater levels of stress. The SCD group displayed additional correlational relationships between Cognitive Change Index (Self report) (CCI-S) scores, higher neuroticism scores, and poorer quality of life (QoL). Partial correlation analysis in the SCD group suggests CCI-S scores, anxiety, depression, and metacognition are intercorrelated. Ad hoc analyses using metacognition as the grouping variable found that those experiencing worse metacognitive dysfunction were significantly more likely to experience poorer SCD, psychological and social QoL, greater levels of anxiety, depression, stress, and neuroticism. CONCLUSION: The emerging pattern from the analysis indicates that SCD appears associated with sub-clinical negative affective difficulties, metacognitive, and other psycho-social issues, and poorer QoL. Dysfunctional cognitive control at a meta-level may impact someone's ability to rationally identify cognitive changes, increase worry about cognitive changes, and allow such changes to impact their lives more than those with superior metacognitive control. Findings could impact SCD assessment, monitoring, early intervention, and ultimately reducing risk of further decline.
