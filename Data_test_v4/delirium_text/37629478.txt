37629478|t|Addressing Symptom Burden and Palliative Care Needs in Cystic Fibrosis: A Narrative Review of the Literature.
37629478|a|Among people with cystic fibrosis (CF), illness burden is multifaceted, and symptoms may fluctuate in intensity across a lifespan. Caregivers of people with CF may also experience distressing symptoms. Recent developments in CF care, including the availability of highly effective modulator therapies (HEMTs) and new palliative care guidelines promoting palliative care screening may help alleviate symptoms. The objective of this review was to present a narrative view of the recent literature on symptom burden in CF, new screening approaches informed by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) palliative care guidelines, and early data from studies examining the impact of HEMTs on CF symptom burden. A review of the relevant literature was conducted using Google Scholar and PubMed. Included articles covered approaches to burden assessment in CF and other chronic illnesses, epidemiology of CF symptom burden, the impact of HEMTs on symptom burden, and the CFF palliative care guidelines. A primary palliative care model implementing the CFF guidelines was also described. Results of this review show that while recent developments in CF care have led to a reduction in physical symptoms, mental health symptoms remain prevalent. Ongoing screening and triage can ensure that physical symptoms, psychological symptoms, social needs, practical problems, and communication concerns are addressed by care teams.
