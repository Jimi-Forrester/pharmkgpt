33863274|a|BACKGROUND: Unintended weight loss and the reduction in appetite are common phenomenon among older people. Reduced appetite has been linked to medication related reductions in saliva production, reduced taste ability and poor oral health. Poor appetite can result in reduced nutrient intake ensuing weight loss. It is possible that poor appetite is a mediating step on the causal pathway between oral health and weight loss. This study investigates whether poor oral health and loss of appetite are related to weight loss. METHODS: This is an observational study where data were obtained from the Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project (CHAMP). Information on socio-demographics, appetite and health related behavior was collected by self-completed questionnaire. Intraoral assessment was conducted by calibrated oral health therapists. Height and weight were measured by trained staff. Regression analysis investigated associations between oral health and appetite as risk factors for weight loss. RESULTS: Participants included 542 community dwelling older males. 99 older men (18.3%) experienced 5% or more weight loss over 3 years. Men who lost weight from baseline had lower BMI and lower body weight, had higher prevalence of frailty and depression, reported poorer appetite, and had fewer teeth (13.8 +- 9.5) than those who did not lose weight (16.3 +- 9.3). Before adjustment, the prevalence ratio (PR) for weight loss was 1.76 (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.19-2.59) for participants with 0-19 natural teeth present compared to those with 20 or more teeth. When adding appetite and other variables to the model, the PR for number of teeth and weight loss was unchanged: 1.78 (95% CI, 1.06-3.00). The mediation analysis showed that the indirect effect of appetite on the association between number of natural teeth on weight loss was not found to be significant. CONCLUSION: This study found that number of natural teeth present and appetite are independently related to weight change among elderly men in Australia. Tooth loss can increase the risk of swallowing difficulty leading to change in food preference, avoidance of foods and a decrease in energy intake. Our study showed the importance of oral health interventions to encourage maintenance of 20 or more natural teeth in older people.
