37978407|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare the surgical trauma and outcomes between oblique lateral interbody fusion (OLIF) and posterior fixation and posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with fixation for adult degenerative scoliosis (ADS). METHODS: We included ADS patients who underwent OLIF with fixation or PLIF with fixation treatment from June 2020 to December 2022. The preoperative and postoperative spinal pelvic parameters were measured using X-rays. Clinical symptoms were measured using the Oswestry Disability Index and a visual analog scale. We recorded operation time, intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion, albumin infusion, surgical fixation segment, surgical osteotomy segment, time, and drainage volume. RESULTS: Forty patients with ADS were included: 20 with OLIF with posterior fixation and 20 with PLIF matched for age, sex, pelvic incidence, and Cobb angle with the OLIF group. There were no significant differences in age, gender, BMI, preoperative spinal parameters, or preoperative clinical symptoms between the groups (p > 0.05). There were no statistical differences in postoperative spinal parameters or clinical symptoms (p > 0.05). Patients in the OLIF group had less intraoperative blood loss (p < 0.01) and fewer intraoperative blood transfusions (p < 0.001) than the posterior surgery group. The number of fixed segments was fewer (p < 0.01), and there were fewer total osteotomy segments (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: OLIF with posterior fixation surgery can achieve the same corrective effect and efficacy as a posterior internal fusion with fixation surgery for treating ADS. OLIF with posterior fixation surgery causes less trauma and reduces the number of fixation segments.
