DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind study. SETTING: Hospitalized patients. PATIENTS: Healthy men or women aged >=18 years with moderate or severe pain (score >=2 on a 4-point Likert scale) and >=4 on the 11-point numerical pain rating scale following surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Study medication was initiated after surgery and was given for 48 hours. OUTCOMES: The primary efficacy variable was mean sum of the pain intensity difference (SPID) scores from the postsurgical baseline. RESULTS: Five hundred twenty-two subjects were randomized; 31 (5.9%) discontinued, including 19 (3.6%) for adverse events. The mean total morphine equivalent dose (MED) was 182.7 mg from Q8003 12 mg/8 mg, 92.4 mg for morphine 12 mg, and 92.1 mg for oxycodone 8 mg. SPID from baseline over 24 hours and SPID from baseline over 48 hours were significantly (P < 0.02) higher for Q8003 12 mg/8 mg vs morphine 12 mg or oxycodone 8 mg. Significantly (P < 0.015) fewer subjects in the Q8003 group required ibuprofen rescue medication, used lower doses of rescue medication, and had a longer median time to first use of rescue medication. Oxygen desaturation <90% occurred in 5.3% with Q8003, 2.8% with morphine 12 mg, and 2.3% with oxycodone 8 mg, and the cumulative median dose at first desaturation was twofold greater with Q8003. CONCLUSION: Q8003 provided superior efficacy to its individual components at twice the MED with only a modest increase in the incidence of adverse events.
