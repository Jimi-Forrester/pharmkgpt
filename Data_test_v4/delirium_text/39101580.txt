39101580|t|Exploring the link between dystrophic microglia and the spread of Alzheimer's neuropathology.
39101580|a|Genetics and other data modalities indicate that microglia play a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, but details of microglia's disease-driving influence are poorly understood. Microglial cells can be parsed into subtypes based on their histologic appearance. One microglia subtype, termed dystrophic microglia, is characterised structurally by fragmented processes and cytoplasmic decay, and their presence has been associated with ageing and neurodegeneration. Recent studies suggest that the interaction between tau proteins and amyloid-beta might induce dystrophic changes in microglia, potentially linking amyloid-beta and tau pathologies to their effects on these microglia. We developed a study of human brains to test the hypothesis that dystrophic microglia are involved in AD progression. We speculated that if their presence is unique to AD neuropathologic change (ADNC), they would be substantially more common in ADNC than in neurodegenerative diseases characterised by other proteinopathies, e.g., alpha-synuclein or TDP-43 pathology. Our analyses used histologically stained sections from five human brain regions of 64 individuals across six disease states, from healthy controls to advanced AD stages, including comparative conditions such as Lewy Body Disease (LBD) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC). Using stereological sampling and digital pathology, we assessed ramified, hypertrophic, and dystrophic microglia populations. We found a significant increase in dystrophic microglia in areas early affected by ADNC, suggesting a disease-specific role in neuropathology. Mediation analysis and structural equation modelling suggest dystrophic microglia may impact the regional spread of ADNC. In the mediation model, tau was found to be the initiating factor leading to the development of dystrophic microglia, which then was associated with the spread of amyloid-beta and tau. These results suggest that a loss of microglia's protective role could contribute to the spread of ADNC and indicate that further research into preserving microglial function may be warranted.
