Many neurodegenerative diseases are included in them, for example, stroke, brain trauma, spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Given that central nervous system tissue has very limited, if any, regenerative capacity, it is of utmost importance to limit the damage caused by neuronal death. During the past decade, considerable progress has been made in understanding the process of cell death. In this article, we review the causes and mechanisms of neuronal-cell death, especially as it pertains to the caspases family of proteases associated with cell death. The results may be helpful to the experimental research and clinical application of neurodegenerative diseases.
