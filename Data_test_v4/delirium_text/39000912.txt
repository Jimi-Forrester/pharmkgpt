39000912|t|An Overall Automated Architecture Based on the Tapping Test Measurement Protocol: Hand Dexterity Assessment through an Innovative Objective Method.
39000912|a|The present work focuses on the tapping test, which is a method that is commonly used in the literature to assess dexterity, speed, and motor coordination by repeatedly moving fingers, performing a tapping action on a flat surface. During the test, the activation of specific brain regions enhances fine motor abilities, improving motor control. The research also explores neuromuscular and biomechanical factors related to finger dexterity, revealing neuroplastic adaptation to repetitive movements. To give an objective evaluation of all cited physiological aspects, this work proposes a measurement architecture consisting of the following: (i) a novel measurement protocol to assess the coordinative and conditional capabilities of a population of participants; (ii) a suitable measurement platform, consisting of synchronized and non-invasive inertial sensors to be worn at finger level; (iii) a data analysis processing stage, able to provide the final user (medical doctor or training coach) with a plethora of useful information about the carried-out tests, going far beyond state-of-the-art results from classical tapping test examinations. Particularly, the proposed study underscores the importance interdigital autonomy for complex finger motions, despite the challenges posed by anatomical connections; this deepens our understanding of upper limb coordination and the impact of neuroplasticity, holding significance for motor abilities assessment, improvement, and therapeutic strategies to enhance finger precision. The proof-of-concept test is performed by considering a population of college students. The obtained results allow us to consider the proposed architecture to be valuable for many application scenarios, such as the ones related to neurodegenerative disease evolution monitoring.
