31911834|t|delta-secretase in neurodegenerative diseases: mechanisms, regulators and therapeutic opportunities.
31911834|a|Mammalian asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) is a cysteine protease that cleaves its protein substrates on the C-terminal side of asparagine residues. Converging lines of evidence indicate that AEP may be involved in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and frontotemporal dementia. AEP is activated in the aging brain, cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) and promotes the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta). We renamed AEP to delta-secretase to emphasize its role in APP fragmentation and Abeta production. AEP also cleaves other substrates, such as tau, alpha-synuclein, SET, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43, generating neurotoxic fragments and disturbing their physiological functions. The activity of delta-secretase is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. Here, we review the recent advances in the role of delta-secretase in neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on its biochemical properties and the transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of its activity, and discuss the clinical implications of delta-secretase as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.
