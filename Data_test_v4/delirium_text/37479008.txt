37479008|t|Evidence of Disturbed Insulin Signaling in Animal Models of Alzheimer's Disease.
37479008|a|Since glucose reuptake by neurons is mostly independent of insulin, it has been an intriguing question whether insulin has or not any roles in the brain. Consequently, the identification of insulin receptors in the central nervous system has fueled investigations of insulin functions in the brain. It is also already known that insulin can influence glucose reuptake by neurons, mostly during activities that have the highest energy demand. The identification of high density of insulin receptors in the hippocampus also suggests that insulin may present important roles related to memory. In this context, studies have reported worse performance in cognitive tests among diabetic patients. In addition, alterations in the regulation of central insulin pathways have been observed in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In fact, some authors have proposed AD as a third type of diabetes and recently, our group proposed insulin resistance as a common link between different AD hypotheses. Therefore, in the present narrative review, we intend to revise and gather the evidence of disturbed insulin signaling in experimental animal models of AD.
