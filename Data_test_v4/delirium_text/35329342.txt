35329342|t|Contextualizing the Chronic Care Model among Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic Men with Chronic Conditions.
35329342|a|Middle-aged and older men of color with chronic conditions have low utilization of preventive health services. In the context of the Chronic Care Model (CCM), the objective of this study was to identify perceptions about being informed, activated patients and having productive interactions in healthcare settings among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic middle-aged and older men with chronic health conditions in the United States. Using an internet-based survey deployed nationally using a Qualtrics panel, data were collected from a sample of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic men aged 40 years and older with one or more self-reported chronic conditions (n = 2028). Chi-square tests and one-way ANOVAs were used to describe this national sample by race/ethnicity and age group (40-64 years and >=65 years). Results suggest that most health-related factors differed more on age than by race/ethnicity. Younger age groups reported less preventive care, greater barriers to self-care, mental health issues, and risky behavior. Findings from this study provide insight into the health status and healthcare utilization of racial/ethnic men with one or more chronic conditions. Results may help inform prevention and treatment interventions for middle-aged and older men of color.
