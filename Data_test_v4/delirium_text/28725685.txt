28725685|t|G-Force PD: a global initiative in coordinating stem cell-based dopamine treatments for Parkinson's disease.
28725685|a|Translating new cell-based therapies to the clinic for patients with neurodegenerative disorders is complex. It involves pre-clinical testing of the cellular product and discussions with several regulatory agencies, as well as ethical debates. In an attempt to support efforts around the world, we set up a global consortium that brings together the major funded teams working on developing a stem cell-derived neural transplantation therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD). This consortium, G-Force PD, involves teams from Europe, USA, and Japan, and has already met on two occasions to discuss common problems, solutions, and the roadmap to the clinic. In this short review, we lay out the brief history and rationale for this initiative and discuss some of the issues that arose in our most recent meeting (May 2015) as we consider undertaking first-in-human clinical trials with stem cell-derived neurons for PD.
