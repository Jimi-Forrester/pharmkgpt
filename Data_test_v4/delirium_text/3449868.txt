3449868|t|Psychopathology of organic mental disorders due to infections in the antibiotics era. Stability of syndromes and classification.
3449868|a|104 patients diagnosed as having an organic mental disorder due to infection were classified according to DSM III criteria. The vast majority of patients (76%) fulfilled the criteria of delirium, 6% that of organic hallucinosis, while others had to be classified as affective, personality or delusional syndrome. We found a great instability of syndromes causing classification problems. A classification rule is suggested, which we called 'compromise of clinical reality'.
