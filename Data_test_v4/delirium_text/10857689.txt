10857689|a|This study was designed to examine whether 10 AD patients with diffuse lesions and an early semantic deficit could comprehend the meaning of pantomimes and symbolic gestures. We especially wanted to determine the relationship between pantomime recognition and production. The tasks involved naming or showing an understanding (e.g., circumlocutions) of the pantomimes executed by the examiner and producing pantomimes to verbal command or to imitation. The results showed no significant relationship between pantomime comprehension and pantomime production. However, 60% of AD patients performed poorly compared to controls on the Gesture Recognition task. Gesture comprehension was highly correlated with a measure of global cognitive impairment (3MS). The data are consistent with the proposed separation of comprehension and action production systems in a cognitive model of praxis. Gesture comprehension may be diffusely distributed and thus preserved in the early stages of AD as in circumscribed lesions of the left parietal lobe.
