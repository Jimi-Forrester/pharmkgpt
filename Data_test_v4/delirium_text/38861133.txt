38861133|t|Effect of obstructive sleep apnea on postoperative delirium: a system review and meta-analysis.
38861133|a|PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on postoperative delirium (PD), and evaluate the effectiveness of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy on PD among OSA patients. METHODS: We systematically searched Embase, Cochrane Library and PubMed databases from their establishment to November 27, 2022. A random-effects approach was employed to determine aggregated results. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were carried out to investigate heterogeneity. RESULTS: Sixteen eligible studies were included in the analysis. Thirteen studies revealed that OSA significantly elevated the likelihood of developing PD (OR = 1.71; 95%CI = 1.17 to 2.49; p = 0.005). Subgroup analysis according to delirium assessment scales showed that OSA did not exhibit an association with the incidence of PD assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit (OR = 1.14; 95%CI = 0.77 to 1.67; p = 0.51) but enhanced the likelihood of developing PD evaluated with other measurement scales (OR = 2.15; 95%CI = 1.44 to 3.19; p = 0.0002). Three additional studies explored the impact of PAP treatment on PD among OSA individuals, indicating no significant reduction in PD incidence with PAP use (OR = 0.58; 95%CI = 0.13 to 2.47; p = 0.46). CONCLUSIONS: OSA may not be a risk factor for PD in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, but may increase the likelihood of developing PD among individuals receiving regular care in the ward postoperatively. The efficacy of PAP therapy in decreasing PD incidence among OSA patients remains debatable.
