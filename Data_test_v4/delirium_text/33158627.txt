33158627|a|Human beings are social in nature and maintaining social interactions, relationships and intimacy are fundamental needs of older adults (OAs) living in assisted living (AL) communities. Yet, these very basic human needs have been impeded by quarantine mandates imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The socialization aspect offered in AL, allows for an integration of the whole person: body, mind, and spirit and is beneficial in mitigating the development of co-morbidities and negative patient outcomes. Additionally, the authenticity of home comes from the caring interactions provided by an interprofessional health care staff. Utilizing the 4 M Framework, created by The John A. Hartford Foundation and Institute of Healthcare Improvement, the authors describe simple direct bedside interventions of low cost, and high patient-centered value which front-line nursing and caregiver staff can employ to maintain social connections, interactions, mentation, function and mobility among residents they care for, and care about, in AL communities.
