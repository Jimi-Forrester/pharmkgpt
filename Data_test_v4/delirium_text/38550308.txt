38550308|t|A Focused Review of Gamma Neuromodulation as a Therapeutic Target in Alzheimer's Spectrum Disorders.
38550308|a|The aging population of the world is increasing at an unprecedented rate which is expected to lead to a corresponding unparalleled increase in age related diseases. Of particular concern are the large number of older adults expected to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD), which will require extraordinary local, national and worldwide healthcare resources. In this context, innovative interventions are needed urgently to delay AD onset and thereby give our healthcare systems time to prepare and provide meaningful care to our aging populations. This focused review discusses the crucial role of frontal gamma oscillations as a therapeutic target to delay or ameliorate cognitive decline in AD. Frontal gamma oscillations, including from prefrontal cortical areas, serve as a biomarker for working memory and other cognitive functions, and their impairment is observed before clinical symptoms manifest. This review evaluates evidence from animal models and human subjects to highlight the correlation between gamma wave abnormalities and cognitive deterioration. Furthermore, the review summarizes 11 clinical studies using neuromodulation techniques designed to stimulate gamma oscillations in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients, including transcranial electrical stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and rhythmic sensory stimulation. These interventions have shown promise in mitigating early-stage cognitive decline, as evidenced by improved performance on memory tests, increased gamma oscillatory responses, and some have even shown reduced brain atrophy. These early studies suggest that treatments that strengthen frontal gamma oscillatory responses through neuromodulation are a promising approach to delay cognitive decline, that may serve as an adjunct to other therapies or as a standalone treatment in some populations.
