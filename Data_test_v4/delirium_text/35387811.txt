35387811|a|OBJECTIVE: Blood-based biomarkers for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are a 'Holy Grail' of AD research. Growing evidence shows that levels of apolipoproteins and various inflammation-related factors are altered in the peripheral blood of patients with AD. The purpose of this study was to clear and definite whether these biomarkers are differentially expressed at the early stages of AD, and could be a biomarker as an early diagnosis of the disease. DESIGN: Observation study. SETTING: This study was a part of the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline, an ongoing prospective cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03370744) that centres on Xuanwu Hospital (Beijing, China) in cooperation with an alliance of 94 hospitals from 50 cities across China. PARTICIPANTS: In the present study, 416 right-handed Chinese Han subjects were recruited through standardised public advertisements from 2014 to 2019. OUTCOME MEASURES: Concentrations of plasma apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein CIII (ApoCIII), apolipoprotein E (ApoE), A-2-macroglobulin (A2M), complement C3 (C3) and complement factor H (FH) were determined using a commercial multiplex Luminex-based panel in normal controls (NC), subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment and AD groups. RESULTS: For individual analysis, pairwise comparisons showed that: (1) For SCD versus NC, no biomarker showed significant difference; (2) For amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) versus NC, levels of ApoCIII, ApoE, A2M, C3 and FH increased significantly; and (3) For AD versus NC, amounts of C3 increased. For models differentiating clinical groups, discriminant analysis was performed by including all protein markers, age, sex, genotype and education level in the model. This approach could distinguish between patients with aMCI (area under the curve (AUC): 0.743) and AD (AUC: 0.837) from NC. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that concentrations of certain apolipoproteins and inflammation-related factors are altered at the early stage of AD, and could be useful biomarkers for early diagnosis.
