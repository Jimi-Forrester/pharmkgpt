28270981|a|The optical properties of amyloid fibers are often distinct from those of the source protein in its non-fibrillar form. These differences can be utilized for label-free imaging or characterization of such structures, which is particularly important for understanding amyloid fiber related diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. We demonstrate that two amyloid forming proteins, insulin and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG), show intrinsic fluorescence with emission spectra that are dependent on the excitation wavelength. Additionally, a new fluorescence peak at about 430 nm emerges for beta-LG in its amyloid state. The shift in emission wavelength is related to the red edge excitation shift (REES), whereas the additional fluorescence peak is likely associated with charge delocalization along the fiber backbone. Furthermore, the spherulitic amyloid plaque-like superstructures formed from the respective proteins were imaged label-free with confocal fluorescence, multiphoton excitation fluorescence (MPEF), and second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. The latter two techniques in particular yield images with a high contrast between the amyloid fiber regions and the core of amorphously structured protein. Strong multiphoton absorption (MPA) for the amyloid fibers is a likely contributor to the observed contrast in the MPEF images. The crystalline fibrillar region provides even higher contrast in the SHG images, due to the inherently ordered non-centrosymmetric structure of the fibers together with their non-isotropic arrangement. Finally, we show that MPEF from the insulin spherulites exhibits a spectral dependence on the excitation wavelength. This behavior is consistent with the REES phenomenon, which we hypothesize is the origin of this observation. The presented results suggest that amyloid deposits can be identified and structurally characterized based on their intrinsic optical properties, which is important for probe-less and label-free identification and characterization of amyloid fibers in vitro and in complex biological samples.
