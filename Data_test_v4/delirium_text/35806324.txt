35806324|a|Less than 50 years since tau was first isolated from a porcine brain, its detection in femtolitre concentrations in biological fluids is revolutionizing the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. This review highlights the molecular and technological advances that have catapulted tau from obscurity to the forefront of biomarker diagnostics. Comprehensive updates are provided describing the burgeoning clinical applications of tau as a biomarker of neurodegeneration. For the clinician, tau not only enhances diagnostic accuracy, but holds promise as a predictor of clinical progression, phenotype, and response to drug therapy. For patients living with neurodegenerative disorders, characterization of tau dysregulation could provide much-needed clarity to a notoriously murky diagnostic landscape.
