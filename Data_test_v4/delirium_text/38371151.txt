38371151|t|Ureterocolic Fistula Involving a Native Kidney and the Sigmoid Colon in a Renal Transplant Recipient.
38371151|a|A ureterocolic fistula in a renal transplant patient is a rare complication. Even rarer is a ureterocolic fistula involving a native kidney in a patient with a functional, ipsilateral transplanted kidney, with no prior cases published in the English literature. In the current case report, we describe a patient with a previously successful right renal transplant, who presented three years later with a ureterocolic fistula involving the right native kidney and the sigmoid colon.
