30320578|t|Early Candidate Urine Biomarkers for Detecting Alzheimer's Disease Before Amyloid-beta Plaque Deposition in an APP (swe)/PSEN1dE9 Transgenic Mouse Model.
30320578|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable age-associated neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by irreversible progressive cognitive deficits and extensive brain damage. The identification of candidate biomarkers before amyloid-beta plaque deposition occurs is therefore of great importance for the early intervention of AD. Urine, which is not regulated by homeostatic mechanisms, theoretically accumulates changes associated with AD earlier than cerebrospinal fluid and blood. In this study, an APP (swe)/PSEN1dE9 transgenic mouse model was used to identify candidate biomarkers for early AD. Urine samples were collected from 4-, 6-, and 8-month-old transgenic mouse models, and the urinary proteomes were profiled using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The levels of 29 proteins differed significantly between wild type and 4-month-old mice, which had not started to accumulate amyloid-beta plaques. Among these proteins, 13 have been associated with the mechanisms of AD, while 9 have been suggested as AD biomarkers. Our results indicated that urine proteins enable detection of AD before amyloid-beta plaque deposition, which may present an opportunity for intervention.
