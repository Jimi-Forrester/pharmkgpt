1300146|t|Gallyas-Schiff stain for senile plaques.
1300146|a|Gallyas technique was modified by a direct application of Schiff's reagent after physical development, resulting in distinctive staining of amyloid deposits in argyrophilic structures. With this modified method, senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease are clearer. This method is easy to perform and suitable for routine neuropathological examination.
