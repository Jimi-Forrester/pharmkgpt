22800403|t|Providing delirium education for family caregivers of older adults.
22800403|a|Using the Knowledge to Action Process, an education session was developed to teach families of older adults about delirium. Seven sessions were held with 16 eligible participants. A significant increase in delirium knowledge was found following education, and many participants believed others should receive similar education. At follow up, most participants were able to recall information related to risk factors and signs of delirium. Families of older adults form a common communication link for their relatives between health care providers across settings; providing education to family caregivers may in part provide a solution to the problem of delirium.
