38612908|t|Oxidative Effects in Early Stages of Embryo Development Due to Alcohol Consumption.
38612908|a|Alcohol, a widely consumed drug, exerts significant toxic effects on the human organism. This review focuses on its impact during fetal development, when it leads to a spectrum of disorders collectively termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Children afflicted by FASD exhibit distinct clinical manifestations, including facial dysmorphism, delayed growth, and neurological and behavioral disorders. These behavioral issues encompass diminished intellectual capacity, memory impairment, and heightened impulsiveness. While the precise mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced fetal damage remain incompletely understood, research indicates a pivotal role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are released during alcohol metabolism, inciting inflammation at the cerebral level. Ethanol metabolism amplifies the generation of oxidant molecules, inducing through alterations in enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems responsible for cellular homeostasis. Alcohol consumption disrupts endogenous enzyme activity and fosters lipid peroxidation in consumers, potentially affecting the developing fetus. Addressing this concern, administration of metformin during the prenatal period, corresponding to the third trimester of human pregnancy, emerges as a potential therapeutic intervention for mitigating FASD. This proposed approach holds promise for ameliorating the adverse effects of alcohol exposure on fetal development and warrants further investigation.
