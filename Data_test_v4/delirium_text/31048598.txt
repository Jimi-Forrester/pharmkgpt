31048598|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With the ageing population, there is an increasing number of patients with a neurocognitive disorder (NCD) who undergo surgical procedures. The aim of this review is to highlight the epidemiology of preoperative NCD. RECENT FINDINGS: New guidelines have defined NCD into mild NCD and major NCD consistent with terminology from the wider clinical community. Several assessment tools have been used in the preoperative setting to identify patients with evidence of cognitive decline. NCD prior to surgery remains a major risk factor postoperative delirium. SUMMARY: Cognitive dysfunction is common prior to surgery. Awareness of dysfunction, especially when taking care of older adults, is critical given the high risk of complications in this population.
