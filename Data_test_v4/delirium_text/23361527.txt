23361527|t|Detailed cognitive function and use of drugs with anticholinergic properties in older people: a community-based cross-sectional study.
23361527|a|BACKGROUND: Many potentially inappropriate drugs prescribed to older people have anticholinergic properties and may therefore be harmful. Drugs with anticholinergic properties (DAPs) are associated with cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to study the profile of various cognitive functions related to current use of DAPs. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Helsinki, Finland, and included 400 home-dwelling individuals aged 75-90 years without major clinical dementia but with a history of stable atherosclerotic disease who were participants of the DEBATE (Drugs and Evidence-Based Medicine in the Elderly) study. The cognition of the users (n = 295) and non-users (n = 105) of DAPs was measured with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) test battery. RESULTS: Use of DAPs was statistically significantly associated with a low score in verbal fluency, in naming, and on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). In the logistic regression analysis, the difference remained for low verbal fluency (odds ratio [OR] 1.84, 95 % CI 1.02-3.32; p = 0.044) and naming (OR 1.81, 95 % CI 1.09-3.00; p = 0.021) but not for MMSE score after adjusting for age, sex and education. CONCLUSIONS: Performances for verbal fluency and naming were poorer in DAP users than in non-users, suggesting a possible impairment of executive functioning and semantic memory. The dimensions of the CERAD test assessing episodic memory-the subtests that are the most sensitive in terms of detecting early Alzheimer's disease-did not show differences between users and non-users of DAPs.
