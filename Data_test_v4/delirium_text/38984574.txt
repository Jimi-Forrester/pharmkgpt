38984574|a|Neurodegenerative disorders represent a set of advancing, severe, and incapacitating conditions impacting millions globally, with a rising prevalence. Despite concerted efforts and an enhanced understanding of the intricate pathophysiology of neurodegeneration, the quest for effective treatments remains unfulfilled. Consequently, there exists a pressing clinical necessity for the exploration of innovative therapeutic approaches. Alpha-mangostin has exhibited beneficial effects in alleviating the severity of neurodegenerative disorders, primarily attributed to its antioxidant properties. Alpha-mangostin showcases diverse pharmacological effects, encompassing anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour, and antioxidant effects. Consequently, it has surfaced as a promising remedy with both prophylactic and restorative impacts on various neurodegenerative ailments. Recent research has illuminated the therapeutic targets of alpha-mangostin, suggesting its potential utility in addressing neurodegeneration. This review showcases the neuroprotective effects of alpha-mangostin. Drawing from numerous preliminary studies and taking into account the compound's remedial effects, the primary focus is on its role as a health-giving compound for the therapy of diseases associated with the degeneration of the nervous system. Given the substantial evidence supporting its efficacy in various experimental models, this review advocates for further investigations, with a special highlight on elucidating neuroprotective mechanisms and conducting clinical trials to validate its effectiveness in managing Alzheimer's disease as well as Parkinson's disease.
