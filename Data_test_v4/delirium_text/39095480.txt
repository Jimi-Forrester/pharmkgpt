39095480|a|Apolipoprotein D (ApoD), a lipocalin transporter of small hydrophobic molecules, plays an essential role in several neurodegenerative diseases. It was reported that increased immunostaining for ApoD of glial cells surrounding dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons was observed in the brains of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Although preliminary findings supported the role of ApoD in neuroprotection, its derivation and effects on the degeneration of nigral DAergic neurons are largely unknown. In the present study, we observed that ApoD levels released from astrocytes were increased in PD models both in vivo and in vitro. When co-cultured with astrocytes, due to the increased release of astrocytic ApoD, the survival rate of primary cultured ventral midbrain (VM) neurons was significantly increased with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridillium ion (MPP+) treatment. Increased levels of TAp73 and its phosphorylation at Tyr99 in astrocytes were required for the increased ApoD levels and its release. Conditional knockdown of TAp73 in the nigral astrocytes in vivo could aggravate the neurodegeneration in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated PD mice. Our findings reported that astrocyte-derived ApoD was essential for DAergic neuronal survival in PD models, might provide new therapeutic targets for PD.
