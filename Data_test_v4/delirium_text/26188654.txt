26188654|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is a major cause of disability and dependency amongst older people. AD drugs approved so far are symptomatic treatments and are not thought to affect the underlying disease process. Trials conducted with agents aiming to slow or stop disease progression in patients with AD have all failed, perhaps because they were tested too late in the disease process. Therefore, there has been a move towards prevention of AD. This paper presents an overview of trials testing pharmacological interventions for sporadic AD prevention. Those tested to date were initially developed for the treatment of AD or for the treatment of other conditions, rather than being specifically developed for AD prevention. Associated issues, such as evidence of 'proof-of-concept,' doses and safety, are discussed. A major shift has taken place in the methodology of AD prevention trials since the results of the first trials were published in the 1990s. New directions that are currently being considered in ongoing or future prevention trials are discussed, in terms of endpoints, target populations, and study design. The use of AD-specific drugs to prevent AD in high-risk individuals is currently limited by a lack of validated predictive and surrogate markers. Population approaches, such as lifestyle changes, are an alternative strategy that could be of public health interest, but may provide only limited benefits for individuals. The best chance of preventing AD may come from a combination of individual and population prevention approaches.
