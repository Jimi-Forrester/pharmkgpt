33145322|a|Approximately 18,000 patients annually in the United States are diagnosed with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. These patients have numerous and complex symptoms, including pain, dysphagia, malnutrition and psychological symptoms due to location of the tumor and required treatments, and patients benefit from a comprehensive approach to care to effectively support their physical, emotional and spiritual needs. Palliative care is a medical subspecialty that focuses on providing comprehensive care for patients with any kind of advanced or serious illness to allow them to live well and fully for as long as possible in the face of that illness. In recent years, palliative care has become more widely available to patients with esophageal cancer and this is beneficial for patients with esophageal cancer given the severity of symptoms and complexities of needs. Primary oncology providers should provide basic palliative care including symptom management and clear communication, and palliative care specialists can provide additional support to extend the care of the primary clinician and treat the advanced and complex physical and psychological symptoms, as well as engaging in advance care planning. This paper outlines the key components of high-quality palliative care, including advanced care planning, symptom management and psychosocial support.
