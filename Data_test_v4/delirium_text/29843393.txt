29843393|a|BACKGROUND: Tocotrienol and tocopherol are known to prevent numerous degenerative diseases. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) with alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TF) on the antioxidant status of healthy individuals aged between 50 and 55 years. METHODS: Volunteers were divided into groups receiving placebo (n = 23), alpha-TF (n = 24) and TRF (n = 24). Fasting venous blood samples were taken at baseline (0 month), 3 months and 6 months of supplementation for the determination of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities as well as for reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) concentrations. RESULTS: CAT and GPx were unaffected by TRF and alpha-TF supplementations. SOD activity increased significantly after six months of TRF supplementation. Analysis by gender showed that only female subjects had significant increases in SOD and GPx activities after six months of TRF supplementation. GPx activity was also significantly higher in females compared to males after six months of TRF supplementation. The GSH/GSSG ratio increased significantly after six months of TRF and alpha-TF supplementation in only the female subjects. CONCLUSION: TRF and alpha-TF supplementation exhibited similar effects to the antioxidant levels of older adults with TRF having more significant effects in females.
