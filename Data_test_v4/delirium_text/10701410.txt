10701410|a|POSSIBLE INFLAMMATORY MECHANISMS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the brain including possibly inflammatory mechanisms, as illustrated by the presence of activated microglial cells in the periphery of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and the subsequent release of proinflammatory mediators with neurotoxic potency. RATIONALE FOR NSAID USE: Although not firmly demonstrated, the rationale for the prescription of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) as neuroprotective agents in AD lies on epidemiological data having shown a reduced risk of developing AD in patients on long-term therapy with NSAIDs (non selective cyclo-oxygenase [COX] inhibitors). RATIONALE FOR THE USE OF SELECTIVE COX-2 INHIBITORS: The rationale for the prescription of selective COX-2 inhibitors as neuroprotective drugs in AD lies on: Epidemiological data having shown a reduced risk of developing AD in patients treated with anti-inflammatory doses of classical NSAIDs (inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2) but not with antithrombotic doses of aspirin (selective inhibition of COX-1), Cellular experiments, Demonstration of a better gastro-intestinal (GI) safety profile with selective COX-2 inhibitors than with classical NSAIDs in short-term studies, allowing a possible long-term use in AD. BEFORE PRESCRIBING: COX-2 may have an ambivalent functionality in the brain since the basal production of prostaglandins through COX-2 may participate in neuronal homeostasis whereas the expression of COX-2 is associated with brain development. Classical NSAIDs are ineffective in reducing the formation of senile plaque and neurofibrillary tangles in AD, which is consistent with an ability to reduce inflammation associated with activation of microglia but illustrates their failure to suppress the degenerative process. Prophylactic use of selective COX-2 NSAIDs can be considered on the basis of their good GI safety after 6 months of marketing in United States but need to be confirmed for a longer time. CURRENT TRIALS: Clinical studies focusing on both the prevention and the slowing down of early AD are under way with two recently launched selective COX-2 inhibitors, celecoxib and rofecoxib.
