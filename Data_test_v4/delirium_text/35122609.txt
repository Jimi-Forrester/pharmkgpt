35122609|a|Numerous challenges are confronted when it comes to the recognition of therapeutic agents for treating complex neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The perplexing pathogenicity of AD embodies cholinergic dysfunction, amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation, neurofibrillary tangle formation, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial disruption along with vicious production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating oxidative stress. In this frame of reference, drugs with multi target components could prove more advantageous to counter complex pathological mechanisms that are responsible for AD progression. For as much as, medicinal plant based pharmaco-therapies are emerging as potential candidates for AD treatment keeping the efficacy and safety parameters in terms of toxicity and side effects into consideration. Huperzine A (Hup A) is a purified alkaloid compound extracted from a club moss called Huperzia serrata. Several studies have reported both cholinergic and non-cholinergic effects of this compound on AD with significant neuroprotective properties. The present review convenes cumulative demonstrations of neuroprotection provided by Hup A in in vitro, in vivo, and human studies in various pathologies. The underlying molecular mechanisms of its actions have also been discussed. However, more profound evidence would certainly promote the therapeutic implementation of this drug thus furnishing decisive insights into AD therapeutics and various other pathologies along with preventive and curative management.
