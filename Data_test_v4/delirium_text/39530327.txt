39530327|a|The National Genomics Data Center (NGDC), which is a part of the China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB), offers a comprehensive suite of database resources to support the global scientific community. Amidst the unprecedented accumulation of multi-omics data, CNCB-NGDC is committed to continually evolving and updating its core database resources through big data archiving, integrative analysis and value-added curation. Over the past year, CNCB-NGDC has expanded its collaborations with international databases and established new subcenters focusing on biodiversity, traditional Chinese medicine and tumor genetics. Substantial efforts have been made toward encompassing a broad spectrum of multi-omics data, developing innovative resources and enhancing existing resources. Notably, new resources have been developed for single-cell omics (scTWAS Atlas), genome and variation (VDGE), health and disease (CVD Atlas, CPMKG, Immunosenescence Inventory, HemAtlas, Cyclicpepedia, IDeAS), biodiversity and biosynthesis (RefMetaPlant, MASH-Ocean) and research tools (CCLHunter). All resources and services are publicly accessible at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn.
