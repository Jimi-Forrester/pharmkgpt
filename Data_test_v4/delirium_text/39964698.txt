39964698|t|The Association Between Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and the Incidence of Delirium in Critically Ill Patients: A Systematic Review.
39964698|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate the: 1) correlation between the maintenance or cessation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during hospitalization and the incidence of delirium among critically ill patients; 2) evaluate the effectiveness of utilizing SSRIs as a potential intervention for managing delirium in critically ill adults; and 3) evaluate the effects of continuing SSRIs in patients who were previously prescribed these medications on incidence of delirium or withdrawal symptoms manifesting as delirium. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, PsycInfo, and ProQuest Central, and additional studies identified from reference lists and relevant systematic reviews. STUDY SELECTION: Studies included adults 18 years old and older with critical illness necessitating ICU care administered SSRIs during their hospital stay, where delirium and/or adverse effects were reported as outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: Two team members extracted data from included studies into evidence tables, which were subsequently discussed to synthesize and align the extracted findings. Extraction criteria included study population and the type of control or comparison group, exposures, primary and secondary outcome measures, results, and implications. We used Study Quality Assessment Tools provided by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and National Institutes of Health public websites along with the TREND checklist to evaluate the quality of articles and analyze for bias. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers analyzed the studies' risk for bias. Analysis followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria used in Cochrane systematic reviews. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist to design and report the study. CONCLUSIONS: The cessation of SSRIs in patients who were previously prescribed these medications is associated with an increased incidence of delirium or withdrawal symptoms manifesting as delirium. Continuing these medications in the setting of critical illness may mitigate the risk of delirium. Further investigation is warranted into the impact of SSRIs on delirium in patients not taking these medications prior to ICU admission.
