35264623|a|Dementia is associated with a high risk of death and hospitalization among patients on hemodialysis (HD). We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in 421 patients on maintenance HD across nine facilities and investigated whether decreased handgrip strength was associated with decreased cognitive function. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Japan (MoCA-J) score and handgrip strength were measured. The mean age was 69.8 +- 11.2 years, and the median dialysis vintage 74.5 (IQR 30-150) months. The median MoCA-J score was 25 (IQR 21-27), and MCI was confirmed in 245 (58.2%) patients. Both the MoCA-J score and MoCA-J executive score were associated with age, history of cerebrovascular disease (CVA), and handgrip strength after adjustments. We found, among patients on HD aged under 70 years with a history of CVA, a handgrip strength < 90% (25.2 kg in males and 16.2 kg in females) correlated with significantly lower MoCA-J scores. A high prevalence of MCI and decreased handgrip strength were observed in patients on HD. Handgrip strength may be useful for the easy detection of MCI. A decrease in handgrip strength would allow for the early detection of MCI, especially among patients on HD aged under 70 years with a history of CVA.
