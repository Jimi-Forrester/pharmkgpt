33417993|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to be the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the diagnostic predictive markers for MCI patients are still unclear. Here we have identified the brain function activity changes in MCI patients by using the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). A total of 28 MCI patients and 38 age- and gender-matched healthy controls from the Wuxi Mental Health Center were recruited, and their abnormal spontaneous brain activities in the MCI were examined. The results showed that, compared with the healthy controls, MCI patients exhibited reduced regional homogeneity (ReHo) in the right superior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, left angular gyrus and superior marginal gyrus. In addition, the correlation analysis revealed that ReHo in these regions were not correlated with the AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive score in MCI. We concluded abnormalities in the right superior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, left angular gyrus and superior marginal gyrus with MCI, suggesting that the right language network may be impaired in MCI, which may provide a better understanding of dementia progression and potentially comprehensive treatment in MCI.
