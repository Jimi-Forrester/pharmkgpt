30241254|a|PURPOSE: Limited data describe the delivery of palliative care services in low- and middle-income countries. We describe delivery of care by the Trivandrum Institute of Palliative Sciences (TIPS) in Trivandrum, India. METHODS: Administrative records were used to describe case volumes, setting of care, and organizational expenditures. An estimate of cost per clinical encounter was derived by dividing 2016 monthly clinical expenditures by the number of patient visits. Costs are reported in US dollars and are corrected for Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development purchasing power parity (PPP). RESULTS: A total of 11,620 new patients were seen at TIPS during 2007 to 2016; 59% had cancer. The average annual growth rate in case volumes was 18% (480 new patients in 2007 and 1,882 in 2016). The proportion of patients with cancer increased over time from 56% in 2014 to 66% in 2016 ( P < .001). During 2014 to 2016, outpatient visits increased 26% (from 8,524 to 10,732), inpatient days increased 49% (from 1,763 to 2,625), inpatient visits at other hospitals increased 41% (from 248 to 417), and home visits increased 57% (from 3,951 to 6,186). Total clinical expenditures in 2016 were $288,489 (PPP corrected, $5.1 million). Between 2014 and 2016, the cost of delivering care increased by 74%. The mean cost per clinical encounter in 2016 was $15 (PPP corrected, $263). CONCLUSION: Demand for palliative care services has increased substantially, with an increasing proportion related to cancer. The organization of clinical services by TIPS may serve as a model for the development of other palliative care programs in low- and middle-income countries.
