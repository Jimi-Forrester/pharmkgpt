38370675|a|Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common inflammatory neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in young adults and results in progressive neurological defects. The relapsing-remitting phenotype (RRMS) is the most common disease course in MS and may progress to the progressive form (PPMS). Objectives: There is a gap in knowledge regarding whether the relapsing form can be distinguished from the progressive course or healthy subjects (HS) based on an altered serum metabolite profile. In this study, we performed global untargeted metabolomics with the 2D GCxGC-MS platform to identify altered metabolites between RRMS, PPMS, and HS. Methods: We profiled 235 metabolites in the serum of patients with RRMS (n=41), PPMS (n=31), and HS (n=91). A comparison of RRMS and HS patients revealed 22 significantly altered metabolites at p<0.05 (false discovery rate [FDR]=0.3). The PPMS and HS comparisons revealed 28 altered metabolites at p<0.05 (FDR=0.2). Results: Pathway analysis using MetaboAnalyst revealed enrichment of four metabolic pathways in both RRMS and PPMS (hypergeometric test p<0.05): 1) galactose metabolism; 2) amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism; 3) phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis; and 4) aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis. The Qiagen IPA enrichment test identified the sulfatase 2 (SULF2) (p=0.0033) and integrin subunit beta 1 binding protein 1 (ITGB1BP1) (p=0.0067) genes as upstream regulators of altered metabolites in the RRMS vs. HS groups. However, in the PPMS vs. HS comparison, valine was enriched in the neurodegeneration of brain cells (p=0.05), and heptadecanoic acid, alpha-ketoisocaproic acid, and glycerol participated in inflammation in the CNS (p=0.03). Conclusion: Overall, our study suggested that RRMS and PPMS may contribute metabolic fingerprints in the form of unique altered metabolites for discriminating MS disease from HS, with the potential for constructing a metabolite panel for progressive autoimmune diseases such as MS.
