22034255|t|Behavioral disturbances in dementia.
22034255|a|Psychological symptoms and behavioral abnormalities are common and prominent characteristics of dementia. They include symptoms such as depression, anxiety psychosis, agitation, aggression, disinhibition, and sleep disturbances. Approximately 30% to 90% of patients with dementia suffer from such behavioral disorders. There are complex interactions between cognitive deficits, psychological symptoms, and behavioral abnormalities. A large number of standardized, reliable, and well-validated instruments for assessing the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia have been developed in order to evaluate the efficacy of treatment. Neurodegenerative processes in various brain areas, particularly in the frontotemporal cortex and limbic regions, leading to cholinergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic neurotransmitter dysfunctions constitute the biological matrix of behavioral symptoms, whereas psychological factors and personality traits play a modifying role. A large number of pharmacological, psychoeducational, psychotherapeutic, and social strategies have been developed to improve the quality of life of patients and their caregivers.
