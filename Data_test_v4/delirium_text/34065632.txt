34065632|t|Postpartum Psychosis after Traumatic Cesarean Delivery.
34065632|a|An emergency cesarean delivery can be a traumatic childbirth experience for a woman and a risk factor for postpartum psychosis, especially in a patient with a history of bipolar disorder. This article describes the case of a pregnant woman with an unknown history of bipolar disorder who developed an acute psychotic reaction during the procedure of an emergency caesarian section and switched to mania. The purpose of this case study is for perinatal health care professionals to identify suspicious symptoms and promptly refer to psychiatric services so as to ensure the mother's and the newborn's safety. This case study highlights the importance of assessing women with bipolar disorder or a previous psychotic episode for the risk of psychiatric complications in pregnancy and after childbirth. Midwifery education on perinatal mental health is crucial for the detection of suspicious symptoms and early referral to a specialist.
