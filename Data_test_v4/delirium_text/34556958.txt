34556958|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep restores physiology and neurochemical components of our body and is essential for physical and mental health. Sleep disorders (SDs) are associated with insulin resistance and metabolic disorders. The association between SDs and diabetes needs to be understood in the Indian population. PURPOSE: The purpose was to investigate the association between SD and diabetes in the Indian population. METHODS: As a part of nationwide Niyantrita Madhumeha Bharata Abhiyaan-2017 (NMB-2017), a cross-sectional study was conducted and data was collected from seven zones of India, after screening through the Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS). The sleep quality was assessed on a scale of 1 to 4 (very good = 1, very bad = 4). The time taken to fall asleep (sleep latency) was assessed on a scale of 0 to 5 ("0" = nil and "5" = >1.5 h). Stress was assessed by the perceived stress scale. RESULTS: Bad sleep quality was positively (odds ratio 1.055, CI [1.001, 1.113], and P < .01) associated with self-reported known diabetes. Increased time taken to fall in sleep (sleep latency) was associated significantly with IDRS high risk (odds ratio 1.085, CI [1.008, 1.168], and P = .01), with an average sleep latency /time takes to fall in sleep (maximum range 5 [>1.5 h], mode 2 [10 to 30 min]) minutes. Moderate stress was significantly associated with bad sleep quality (odds ratio 1.659). CONCLUSION: A positive association of bad sleep quality and stress with diabetes, and an increased sleep latency in the IDRS high-risk population point to the role of modifiable risk factors. Behavioral modification and stress reduction by using yoga may be beneficial in the better management of diabetes.
