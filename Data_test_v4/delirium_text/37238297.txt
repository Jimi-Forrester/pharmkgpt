37238297|t|Clinical Applications of TSPO PET for Glioma Imaging: Current Evidence and Future Perspective-A Systematic Review.
37238297|a|Our aim was to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature concerning the clinical applications of positron emission computed tomography (PET) with radiopharmaceuticals targeting the translocator protein (TSPO) in gliomas. A literature search for studies about TSPO PET in the last 10 years (from 2013 to February 2023) was carried out on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science using the following keywords: "PET" AND "Gliomas" AND "TSPO". The Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist for diagnostic test studies was used for testing the quality of selected papers. Ten articles were selected, encompassing 314 glioma patients submitted to PET/CT (9/10) or PET/MRI (1/10) with TSPO ligands. Among the various available TSPO tracers, the most frequently used was the third-generation ligand, [18F]-GE-180. TSPO PET results were useful to identify anaplastic transformation in gliomas and for the prognostic stratification of patients bearing homogeneous genetic alterations. When compared to amino-acid PET, TSPO PET with [18F]-GE-180 presented superior image quality and provided larger and only partially overlapping PET-based volumes. Although biased by some issues (i.e., small sample size, most of the studies coming from the same country), preliminary applications of TSPO PET were encouraging. Further studies are needed to define implications in clinical practice and shape the role of TSPO PET for patients' selection for potential TSPO-targeted molecular therapies.
