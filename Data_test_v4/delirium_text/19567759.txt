19567759|t|Dexmedetomidine and the reduction of postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery.
19567759|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a neurobehavioral syndrome caused by the transient disruption of normal neuronal activity secondary to systemic disturbances. OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated the effects of postoperative sedation on the development of delirium in patients undergoing cardiac-valve procedures. METHODS: Patients underwent elective cardiac surgery with a standardized intraoperative anesthesia protocol, followed by random assignment to one of three postoperative sedation protocols: dexmedetomidine, propofol, or midazolam. RESULTS: The incidence of delirium for patients receiving dexmedetomidine was 3%, for those receiving propofol was 50%, and for patients receiving midazolam, 50%. Patients who developed postoperative delirium experienced significantly longer intensive-care stays and longer total hospitalization. CONCLUSION: The findings of this open-label, randomized clinical investigation suggest that postoperative sedation with dexmedetomidine was associated with significantly lower rates of postoperative delirium and lower care costs.
