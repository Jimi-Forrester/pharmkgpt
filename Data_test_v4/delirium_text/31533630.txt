31533630|a|BACKGROUND: Uncoordinated interprofessional communication in nursing homes increases the risk of polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use. This may lead to augmented frequency of adverse drug events, hospitalizations and mortality. The aims of this study were (1) to improve interprofessional communication and medication safety using a combined intervention and thus, (2) to improve medication appropriateness and health-related outcomes of the included residents. METHODS: The single-arm interventional study (2014-2017) was conducted in Muenster, Germany and involved healthcare professionals and residents of nursing homes. The intervention consisted of systematic education of participating healthcare professionals and of a structured interprofessional medication review which was performed via an online communication platform. The primary endpoint was assessed using the Medication Appropriateness Index MAI. Secondary endpoints were: cognitive performance, delirium, agitation, mobility, number of drugs, number of severe drug-drug interactions and appropriateness of analgesics. Outcomes were measured before, during and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inference-statistical methods. RESULTS: Fourteen general practitioners, 11 pharmacists, 9 nursing homes and 120 residents (n = 83 at all testing times) participated. Overall MAI sum-score decreased significantly over time (mean reduction: -7.1, CI95% -11.4 - - 2.8; median = - 3.0; dCohen = 0.39), especially in cases with baseline sum-score >= 24 points (mean reduction: -17.4, CI95% -27.6 - - 7.2; median = - 15.0; dCohen = 0.86). MAI sum-score of analgesics also decreased (dCohen = 0.45). Mean number of severe drug-drug interactions rose slightly over time (dCohen = 0.17). The proportion of residents showing agitated behavior diminished from 83.9 to 67.8%. Remaining secondary outcomes were without substantial change. CONCLUSION: Medication appropriateness increased particularly in residents with high baseline MAI sum-scores. Cognitive decline of participating residents was seemingly decelerated when compared with epidemiologic studies. A controlled trial is required to confirm these effects. Interprofessional interaction was structured and performance of medication reviews was facilitated as the online communication platform provided unlimited and consistent access to all relevant and updated information.
