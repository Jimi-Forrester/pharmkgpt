37103365|t|Marine-Derived Lead Fascaplysin: Pharmacological Activity, Total Synthesis, and Structural Modification.
37103365|a|Fascaplysin is a planar structure pentacyclic alkaloid isolated from sponges, which can effectively induce the apoptosis of cancer cells. In addition, fascaplysin has diverse biological activities, such as antibacterial, anti-tumor, anti-plasmodium, etc. Unfortunately, the planar structure of fascaplysin can be inserted into DNA and such interaction also limits the further application of fascaplysin, necessitating its structural modification. In this review, the biological activity, total synthesis and structural modification of fascaplysin will be summarized, which will provide useful information for pharmaceutical researchers interested in the exploration of marine alkaloids and for the betterment of fascaplysin in particular.
