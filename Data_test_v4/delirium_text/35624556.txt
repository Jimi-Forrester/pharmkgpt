35624556|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common complication among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is important to prevent the occurrence of delirium in critically ill patients. AIM: This review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions and determine what combination of these is effective in preventing delirium among Intensive Care Unit patients. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: This review follows the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta Analysis statements for Network Meta-Analysis (PRISMA-NMA). Data sources included the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature., MEDLINE, and Cochrane library databases. The integrated data were investigated with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI), using the random-effects Mantel-Haenszel model. Data were considered significant when p < 0.05. Furthermore, to reveal what combination of care is effective, we performed a network meta-analysis estimated OR, 95% CI. RESULTS: We identified three randomized controlled trials and eight controlled before-after trials (11 in total, with 2549 participants). The pooled data from 11 trials of multicomponent intervention had a significant effect on delirium prevention (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.76, p < 0.001). As a result of network meta-analysis, two bundles were effective compared to the control group in reducing the incidence of delirium: a) the combination of sleep promotion (SP), cognitive stimulation (CS), early mobilization (EM), pain control (PC), and assessment (AS) (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.35-0.64, p < 0.002), and b) the combination of SP and CS (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.75, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that non-pharmacological interventions, particularly multicomponent interventions, helped to prevent delirium in critically ill patients. In the network meta-analysis, the most effective care combination for reducing incidence of delirium was found to be multicomponent intervention, which comprises SP-CS-EM-PC-AS, and SP-CS. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: These findings reveal an efficient combination of multicomponent interventions for preventing delirium, which may be a very important prerequisite in planning care programs in the future.
