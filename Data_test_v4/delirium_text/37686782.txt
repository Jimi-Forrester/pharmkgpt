37686782|a|Avenanthramides (Avns) and their derivatives, a group of polyphenolic compounds found abundantly in oats (Avena sativa Linn.), have emerged as promising candidates for neuroprotection due to their immense antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), characterized by the progressive degeneration of neurons, present a significant global health burden with limited therapeutic options. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in cell survival, growth, and metabolism, making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. The dysregulation of PI3K signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various NDDs including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Avns have been shown to modulate PI3K/AKT signaling, leading to increased neuronal survival, reduced oxidative stress, and improved cognitive function. This review explores the potential of Avn polyphenols as modulators of the PI3K signaling pathway, focusing on their beneficial effects against NDDs. Further, we outline the need for clinical exploration to elucidate the specific mechanisms of Avn action on the PI3K/AKT pathway and its potential interactions with other signaling cascades involved in neurodegeneration. Based on the available literature, using relevant keywords from Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science, our review emphasizes the potential of using Avns as a therapeutic strategy for NDDs and warrants further investigation and clinical exploration.
