38829029|a|ABSTRACT: Kava consumption is a traditional practice in Polynesian and Micronesian cultures. It has recently gained popularity in the United States for therapeutic and recreational use. We report the following case. A man presented to the emergency department after a fall while intoxicated on kava. He was medically admitted for altered mental status, facial and clavicle fractures, and hyponatremia. Psychiatry was consulted for management of delirium. On interview, he reported consuming escalating amounts of kava for weeks despite attempts to stop. He was diagnosed with acute kava withdrawal with hyperactive delirium, treated with phenobarbital load (860 mg) and taper (390 mg). Continuous dexmedetomidine drip to hospital day 3 treated sympathetic activation and breakthrough agitation. By day 4, his delirium resolved and remained in remission until discharge. We performed a systematic review for reports of kava withdrawal, returning 9 studies. Eight assessed withdrawal symptoms after cessation of a low controlled dose of kava extract with no symptoms noted. One reported a case series of heavy kava users with seizure-like events. No publications discussed treatment of kava withdrawal. To our knowledge, this is the first publication to describe kava withdrawal syndrome and its effective treatment with phenobarbital.
