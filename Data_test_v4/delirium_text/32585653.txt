32585653|t|Sweetening the "Sweet Spot" of Dementia.
32585653|a|Alzheimer's disease is singularly tragic in that it may rob patients of much or all of their personal identity. Some persons fear this outcome so much that they talk of wanting to find the "sweet spot," a time midway in the course of ever-increasing dementia, during which they are able to foresee a possible loss of identity in sufficient time to end their life before they lose the capacity to choose to do so, and before further devastation occurs. This article presents the belief of some experts that patients always retain a basic, core underlying awareness. Practical approaches that careproviders and caregivers can take to maximize patients' quality of life are discussed. The possibility that patients and loved ones can find meaning in last months and years of life is emphasized.
