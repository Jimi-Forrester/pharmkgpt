35162524|t|Urinary Incontinence and Its Association with Physical and Psycho-Cognitive Factors: A Cross-Sectional Study in Older People Living in Nursing Homes.
35162524|a|Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common geriatric syndrome affecting bladder health and is especially prevalent in nursing homes (NHs). The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of UI and its associated factors in five Spanish NHs. UI (measured with Minimum Data Set 3.0), sociodemographic, and health-related variables were collected. Chi-square (or Fisher's) or Student's t-test (or Mann Whitney U) for bivariate analysis were used, with Prevalence Ratio (PR) as an association measure. The prevalence of UI was 66.1% (CI:95%, 53.6-77.2) in incontinent (n = 45, mean age 84.04, SD = 7.7) and continent (n = 23, mean age 83.00, SD = 7.7) groups. UI was significantly associated with frailty (PR = 1.84; 95%CI 0.96-3.53), faecal incontinence (PR = 1.65; 95%CI 1.02-2.65), anxiety (PR = 1.64; 95%CI 1.01-2.66), physical performance (PR = 1.77; 95%CI 1.00-3.11), and cognitive state (PR = 1.95; 95%CI 1.05-3.60). Statistically significant differences were found between incontinent and continent NH residents for limitations in activities of daily living (ADL), mobility, quality of life, sedentary behaviour, and handgrip strength. It can be concluded that two out of three of the residents experienced UI, and significant associated factors were mainly physical (sedentary behaviour, frailty, physical performance, ADL limitations, mobility, faecal incontinence, and handgrip strength) followed by psycho-cognitive factors (cognition, anxiety, and quality of life).
