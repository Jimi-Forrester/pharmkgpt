16412632|t|BACE-1 inhibitory activities of new substituted phenyl-piperazine coupled to various heterocycles: chromene, coumarin and quinoline.
16412632|a|The protease beta-secretase plays a central role in the synthesis of pathogenic amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report a new series of analogues based on the phenyl-piperazine scaffold coupled to various heterocyclic moieties, which demonstrate improved inhibitory activities on BACE-1 (FRET assay) compared to already known naphthyl counterparts. The obtained results suggest further structural modifications to access to more potent BACE-1 inhibitors.
