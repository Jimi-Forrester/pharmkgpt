37606910|a|Spinal cord injuries, for which there are limited effective treatments, result in enduring paralysis and hypoesthesia due, in part, to the inhibitory microenvironment that develops and limits regeneration/sprouting, especially during chronic stages. Recently, we discovered that targeted enzymatic modulation of the inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) component of the extracellular and perineuronal net (PNN) matrix via Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) rapidly restores robust respiratory function to the previously paralyzed hemi-diaphragm after remarkably long times post-injury (up to 1.5 years) following a cervical level 2 lateral hemi-transection. Importantly, ChABC treatment at cervical level 4 in this chronic model also elicited rapid improvements in gross upper arm function. In the present study, we sought to further optimize and elucidate the capacity for nerve sprouting and/or regeneration to restore crude as well as fine motor control of the forearm and digits at lengthy chronic stages post-injury. However, instead of using ChABC, we utilized a novel and more clinically relevant systemic combinatorial treatment strategy designed to both reduce and overcome inhibitory CSPGs simultaneously and spatially extensively. Following a three-month upper cervical spinal hemi-lesion using adult female Sprague Dawley rats, we show that the combined treatment had a profound effect on functional recovery of the chronically paralyzed forelimb and paw, specifically during walking as well as precision movements of the digits. The regenerative and immune system related events that we describe deepen our basic understanding of the crucial role of CSPG mediated inhibition via the PTPsigma receptor in constraining functional synaptic plasticity at lengthy time-points following SCI, hopefully leading to clinically relevant translational benefits.
