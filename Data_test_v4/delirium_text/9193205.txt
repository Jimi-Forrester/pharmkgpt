9193205|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the reliability and stability of a standardized road test for healthy aging people and those with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). DESIGN: A prospective study involving patients with DAT and age-matched healthy controls in which subjects' driving performance was evaluated by several raters in an initial and a follow-up road test. SETTING: Urban medical school and urban highways and streets. SUBJECTS: A convenience sample of 58 controls, 36 subjects with very mild DAT, and 29 subjects with mild DAT. RESULTS: Analysis of road test ability of controls (2 subjects [3%] failed the test), very mild DAT subjects (7 subjects [19%] failed), and mild DAT subjects (12 subjects [41%] failed) disclosed a significant association between driving performance and dementia status (chi 2[4] = 20.65 [N = 123]; P < .001; Kendall tau-b = 0.306). Interrater reliability for assessment of driving performance ranged from kappa = 0.85 to 0.96. One-month test-retest stability on the road test was 0.76 (quantitative scoring) and 0.53 (clinical judgment). CONCLUSIONS: Dementia adversely affects driving performance even in its mild stages, although some persons with DAT seem to drive safely for some time after disease onset. A traffic-interactive, performance-based road test that examines cognitive behaviors provides an accurate and reliable functional assessment of driving ability.
