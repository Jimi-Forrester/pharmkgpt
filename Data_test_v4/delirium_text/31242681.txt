31242681|a|The methodology from the "RightTimePlaceCare" study of dementia care was tested locally in terms of relevance, acceptability and attrition. Comparing persons with dementia (PwDs) receiving home care (HC) with PwDs living in nursing homes (NHs), in urban versus rural areas, regarding their health conditions and informal caregiver burden was also done. Standardized measurements regarding sociodemographic, and physical and mental health was used. Questions related to legal guardianship were added. Interviews were conducted with PwDs and their caregivers in HC (n = 88) and in NHs (n = 58). Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used. The attrition rate was higher in HC. In the bivariate regression model, for HC and NH, living at home was significantly associated with more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (p <= 0.001) and being cared by a spouse (p = 0.008). In NH, the informal caregivers were significantly younger (p = 0.003) and living in rural areas (p = 0.007) and more often in paid work (p <= 0.001). In the multivariate regression model, informal caregivers were significantly younger (p = 0.007) when caring for a PwD in an NH and caregiver burden was significantly higher in HC and in urban areas (p = 0.043). Legal guardianship was very low. Professionals should acknowledge that PwDs in HC have more behavioural problems and caregivers in urban areas report higher caregiver burden.
