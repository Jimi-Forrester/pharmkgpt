37174211|t|Influence of Age on Associations of Occlusal Status and Number of Present Teeth with Dementia in Community-Dwelling Older People in Japan: Cross-Sectional Study.
37174211|a|While occlusal status has been reported to be related to cognitive function, little is known about the influence of age on that relationship. The present study examined the associations of tooth loss and occlusal status with dementia in the older people, as well as the effects of age on those relationships. A total of 196 older participants (median age: 84 years) were enrolled. Occlusal status was assessed using functional tooth units (FTU), calculated based on the number of paired natural or artificial teeth. Logistic regression analysis was then performed using dementia as the objective variable, and FTU or number of teeth as explanatory variables. The results showed that higher FTU was associated with lower risk of dementia. Furthermore, when stratified by median age, the association was greater for those aged less than 84 years. On the other hand, there was no significant association of number of present teeth with dementia. These results suggest that the risk of dementia is lower for individuals with better occlusion and that occlusal factor may have a greater effect on dementia onset in younger older people. It is thus recommended that both occlusal function and age be incorporated as factors in programs developed for dementia prevention.
