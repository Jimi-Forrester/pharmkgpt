37458208|a|BACKGROUND: Autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy is a novel autoimmune disease of central nervous system (CNS). It is unclear whether Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is related to autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics of patients with autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy. METHODS: The clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of patients are presented. The levels of GFAP in CSF were detected by ELISA. T and B cell subsets in CSF were detected by flow cytometry. GFAP-IgG in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were tested by cell-based assay (CBA) and tissue-based assay (TBA). RESULTS: All three patients had fever, cognitive dysfunction, limb weakness, and positive GFAP-IgG with EBV infection in CSF. Enteric glia cells may involve in this disease. Typical imaging findings include the gadolinium enhancement of linear perivascular radial perpendicular to the ventricle, meningeal enhancement (especially in midbrain interpeduncal fossa), longitudinally extensive lesions involving spindle cords, and more T2/Flair-hyperintense lesions in the periventricular white matter at late stage. The patients had poor response to antiviral treatment and strong response to steroid pulse therapy. CONCLUSION: EBV could induce CNS autoimmune response in autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy. The detection of GFAP-IgG and EBV may facilitate the early diagnosis in these patients.
