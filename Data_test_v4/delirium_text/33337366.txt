33337366|t|tRNA-Derived Fragments in Alzheimer's Disease: Implications for New Disease Biomarkers and Neuropathological Mechanisms.
33337366|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia caused by irreversible neurodegeneration, with the onset mechanisms elusive. tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tRFs), a recently discovered family of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), have been found to associate with many human diseases, including infectious, metabolic, and neurological diseases. However, whether tRFs play a role in human AD development is not known. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore whether tRFs are involved in human AD. METHODS: Thirty-four postmortem human hippocampus samples were used. The expression of Drosha, Dicer, and angiogenin (ANG), three ribonucleases responsible for the biogenesis of sncRNAs, was determined by qRT-PCR and western blot. The tRFs in the hippocampus was detected by qRT-PCR or northern blot. We also used qRT-PCR to quantify NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 2 (NSun2) and polyadenylation factor I subunit 1 (CLP1), two tRNA modification enzymes. RESULTS: tRFs derived from a subset of tRNAs are significantly altered in the hippocampus of AD patients. The expression change of some tRFs showed age- and disease stage-dependent. ANG is significantly enhanced in AD, suggesting its role in inducing tRFs in AD. The expression of NSun2 in AD patients younger than 65 was significantly decreased. According to a previous report supporting NSun2-mediated tRNA methylation modification making tRNA less susceptible to ANG-mediated cleavage, our results suggested that the decrease in NSun2 may make tRNAs less methylated and subsequently enhanced tRF production from ANG-mediated tRNA cleavage. CONCLUSION: Our studies demonstrated for the first time the involvement of tRFs in human AD.
