39064631|t|Diet Supplemented with Special Formula Milk Powder Promotes the Growth of the Brain in Rats.
39064631|a|This investigation was to study the effects of different formula components on the brain growth of rats. Fifty male SD rats were randomly divided into five groups: a basic diet group; a 20% ordinary milk powder group; a 20% special milk powder group; a 30% ordinary milk powder group; and a 30% special milk powder group by weight. LC-MS was used to detect brain lipidomics. After 28 days of feeding, compared with the basic diet group, the brain/body weights of rats in the 30% ordinary milk powder group were increased. The serum levels of 5-HIAA in the 30% ordinary milk powder group were lower than in the 20% ordinary milk powder group. Compared with the basic diet group, the expressions of DLCL, MePC, PI, and GM1 were higher in the groups with added special milk powder, while the expressions of LPE, LdMePE, SM, and MGTG were higher in the groups with added ordinary milk powder. The expression of MBP was significantly higher in the 20% ordinary group. This study found that different formula components of infant milk powder could affect brain growth in SD rats. The addition of special formula infant milk powder may have beneficial effects on rat brains by regulating brain lipid expression.
