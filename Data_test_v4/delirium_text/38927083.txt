38927083|t|Translational Medicine in Acute Ischemic Stroke and Traumatic Brain Injury-NeuroAiD Trials, from Traditional Beliefs to Evidence-Based Therapy.
38927083|a|Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are two severe neurological events, both being major causes of death and prolonged impairment. Their incidence continues to rise due to the global increase in the number of people at risk, representing a significant burden on those remaining impaired, their families, and society. These molecular and cellular mechanisms of both stroke and TBI present similarities that can be targeted by treatments with a multimodal mode of action, such as traditional Chinese medicine. Therefore, we performed a detailed review of the preclinical and clinical development of MLC901 (NeuroAiDTMII), a natural multi-herbal formulation targeting several biological pathways at the origin of the clinical deficits. The endogenous neurobiological processes of self-repair initiated by the brain in response to the onset of brain injury are often insufficient to achieve complete recovery of impaired functions. This review of MLC901 and its parent formulation MLC601 confirms that it amplifies the natural self-repair process of brain tissue after AIS or TBI. Following AIS and TBI where "time is brain", many patients enter the post-acute phase with their functions still impaired, a period when "the brain needs time to repair itself". The treatment goal must be to accelerate recovery as much as possible. MLC901/601 demonstrated a significant reduction by 18 months of recovery time compared to a placebo, indicating strong potential for facilitating the improvement of health outcomes and the more efficient use of healthcare resources.
