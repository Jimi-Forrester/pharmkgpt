37329431|a|This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various scoring systems in predicting in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients admitted to the internal medicine ward. We conducted a prospective collection of clinical data from patients admitted to the Internal Medicine Unit at Santa Maria Nuova Hospital in Florence, Italy, with confirmed pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. We calculated three scoring systems: the CALL score, the PREDI-CO score, and the COVID-19 in-hospital Mortality Risk Score (COVID-19 MRS). The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. : A total of 681 patients were enrolled in the study, with a mean age of 68.8 +- 16.1 years, and 54.8% of them were male. Non-survivors had significantly higher scores in all prognostic systems compared to survivors (MRS: 13 [12- 15] vs. 10 [8-12]; CALL: 12 [10-12] vs. 9 [7-11]; PREDI-CO: 4 [3-6] vs. 2 [1-4]; all p<0.001). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis yielded the following area under the curve (AUC) values: MRS 0.85, CALL 0.78, PREDI-CO 0.77. The addition of Delirium and IL6 to the scoring systems improved their discriminative ability, resulting in AUC values of 0.92 for MRS, 0.87 for CALL, and 0.84 for PREDI-CO. The mortality rate increased significantly across increasing quartiles (p<0.001). In conclusion the COVID-19 in-hospital Mortality Risk Score (MRS) demonstrated reasonable prognostic stratification for patients admitted to the internal medicine ward with SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia. The inclusion of Delirium and IL6 as additional prognostic indicators in the scoring systems enhanced their predictive performance, specifically in determining in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients.
