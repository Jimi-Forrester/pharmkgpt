36821079|a|INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine whether the administration of liposomal bupivacaine decreased opioid use and delirium in patients sustaining a hip fracture. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with hip fracture from September 2018 to October 2019 was performed through our institution's hip fracture registry. A liposomal bupivacaine cocktail was administered intraoperatively. Opioid requirement was determined for postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. Delirium was identified through chart review. Visual analog scale pain scores were averaged for postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. Four groups were analyzed: patients who received liposomal bupivacaine and IV acetaminophen, patients who only received IV acetaminophen, patients who only received liposomal bupivacaine, and control patients whose data were collected before this intervention. Continuous data were compared using a one-way analysis of variance or Student t-test, as applicable. Categorical data were compared using the Fisher exact test. Significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: One hundred nine patients met the inclusion criteria for the study with a mean age of 81.2 years. Eighty-two patients (75.2%) received intraoperative liposomal bupivacaine during the study year. Intravenous opioid requirement was markedly different among all four groups in all postoperative days. Oral opioid requirement and pain scores were not different between groups on any postoperative day. A notable decrease in IV opioid requirement in all postoperative days was seen in the Intervention groups (day 1 P < 0.001, day 2 P = 0.002, and day 3 P = 0.030). There existed a trend toward decreased delirium rates in the Intervention groups compared with the No Intervention group (23.9% vs. 32.8%, P = 0.272). CONCLUSION: The inclusion of liposomal bupivacaine in our institution's novel pain protocol led to notable decreases in opioid requirement in all postoperative days studied with a trend toward decreased delirium rates as well.
