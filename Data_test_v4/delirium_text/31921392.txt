31921392|t|In vitro and in silico insights into tyrosinase inhibitors with (E)-benzylidene-1-indanone derivatives.
31921392|a|Tyrosinase is a key enzyme responsible for melanin biosynthesis and is effective in protecting skin damage caused by ultraviolet radiation. As part of ongoing efforts to discover potent tyrosinase inhibitors, we systematically designed and synthesized thirteen (E)-benzylidene-1-indanone derivatives (BID1-13) and determined their inhibitory activities against tyrosinase. Among the compounds evaluated, BID3 was the most potent inhibitor of mushroom tyrosinase (IC50 = 0.034 microM, monophenolase activity; IC50 = 1.39 microM, diphenolase activity). Kinetic studies revealed that BID3 demonstrated a mixed type of tyrosinase inhibition with K i value of 2.4 microM using l-DOPA as a substrate. In silico molecular docking simulations demonstrated that BID3 can bind to the catalytic and allosteric sites of tyrosinase to inhibit enzyme activity which confirmed in vitro experimental studies between BID3 and tyrosinase. Furthermore, melanin contents decreased and cellular tyrosinase activity was inhibited after BID3 treatment. These observations revealed that BID3 is a potent tyrosinase inhibitor and potentially could be used as a whitening agent for the treatment of pigmentation-related disorders.
