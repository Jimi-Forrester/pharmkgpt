30207235|a|BACKGROUND: Neurological disorders constitute a growing worldwide concern due to the progressive aging of the population and the risky behavior they represent. Herbal medicines have scientific relevance in the treatment of these pathologies. One of these substances, Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), is the main active compound present in the root of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge, a Chinese medicinal herb with neuroprotective properties. OBJECTIVE: In the present study we performed a systematic review that sought to comprehend the neuroprotective effect presented by AS-IV in experimental models of neurological disorders. METHODS: This study is a systematic review, where an electronic search in United States National Library of Medicine (PubMed), Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), Scopus, Web of Science, Medline via Proquest and Periodicos Capes databases covering the years between 2007 and 2017, using "Astragaloside IV" and "Neurodegenerative diseases"; "Astragaloside IV" and " Neurological disorders" as reference terms was made. RESULTS: A total of 16 articles were identified, in which the efficacy of AS-IV was described in experimental models of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cerebral ischemia and autoimmune encephalomyelitis, by improving motor deficits and/or neurochemical activity, especially antioxidant systems, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study indicate that the administration of AS-IV can improve behavioral and neurochemical deficits largely due to its antioxidant, antiapoptotic and antiinflammatory properties, emerging as an alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurological disorders.
