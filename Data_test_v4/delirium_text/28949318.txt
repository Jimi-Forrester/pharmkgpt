28949318|t|Psychogeriatric Diagnoses in Old People's Homes and Negative Health Behavior.
28949318|a|BACKGROUND: The study was designed as a gerontologic-public health analysis of the relationship between the leading and accompanying psychogeriatric diagnoses and negative health behaviors recorded in the old people's home users, with the aim to evaluate and redefine gerontologic-public health priorities and geroprophylactic measures, with special reference to persons suffering from Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. SUBJECT AND METHODS: Gerontologic-public health indicators obtained by monitoring health care needs of the elderly in specific institutional primary health care at 10 old people's homes (N=1185) in Croatia in 2013 were analyzed using the professional methodology developed at Department of Health Gerontology, Andrija Stampar Teaching Institute of Public Health (Registry List 1 that refers to monitoring specific primary health care needs of elderly at old people's homes). RESULTS: Study results revealed that essential arterial hypertension was the principal (leading) principal diagnosis in the old people's home users as of 2013, accounting for 13% of all leading diagnoses recorded in the elderly in institutional health care. In the study population, psychogeriatric diagnoses were recorded among the first five accompanying and leading diagnoses. Refusal of occupational therapy was the most common unfavorable health behavior recorded in the old people's home users, accounting for 22%, followed by poor personal and environmental hygiene (19%), physical inactivity (18%), mental inactivity (15%), obesity (13%) and smoking (5%) of 861 unfavorable behaviour characteristics recorded in study subjects. Study results showed the leading diagnoses in the old people's home users (such as circulatory system diseases, hip fracture, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus) to be associated with negative health behaviors that can be considered as risk factors for the development or progression of the disease, in psychogeriatric patients in particular. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained by gerontological-public health indicator analysis indicate that programs of geroprophylaxis, gerontologic and psychogeriatric measures should be implemented in old people's homes as a priority, with day centers for Alzheimer's disease patients. It is necessary to identify and evaluate risk factors for the occurrence of preventable diseases, change the negative health behaviors in the elderly, and apply the nutritional-gerontologic dietary standards at old people's homes including follow up of dietary intake of nutrients such as vitamins and mineral, with special reference to psychogeriatric patients.
