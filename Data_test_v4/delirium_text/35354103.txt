35354103|a|Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease that accounts for 70-80% of dementia in the elderly. According to recent clinical data, the incidence of the disease is exponentially increasing with age. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1) is an important molecule involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease due to its early role in the amyloid cascade. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by BACE1 is the rate-limiting step leading to the production and aggregation of amyloid-beta plaques. A number of natural products are being identified as non-competitive BACE1 inhibitors. In Ayurveda, Medhya rasayana is a group of medicinal herbs, specifically used for managing neurological disorders and is known to be effective in improving cognitivity and intellect. This study aimed to analyze the pharmacological activity of bio-active compounds in Medhya rasayana plants against BACE1, employing structure-based docking approach. 11 compounds out of 876 were identified as potential hits, based on docking scores, binding energies, and interactions with the critical residues of BACE1. Possible neurological activities of these compounds were predicted using PASS server. Out of the 11 compounds screened, two compounds, 'Convolidine' from the plant Convolvulus pleuricaulis Choisy and 'N-(4-hydroxybutyl) phthalimide' from Glycyrrhiza glabra satisfied the pharmacological parameters of Lipinski rule of filtering and ADMET prediction. The binding stability of these compounds against BACE1 was confirmed by molecular dynamic simulation and post dynamic MM/GBSA calculations. Detailed analysis of the interaction with the critical amino acids in the active site revealed the possible inhibitory potential of these compounds of medicinal plant origin against BACE1.
