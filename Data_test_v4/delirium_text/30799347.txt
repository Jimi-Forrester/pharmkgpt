30799347|t|Patient Health Questionnaire-2 Screening for Depressive Symptoms in Japanese Outpatients with Heart Failure.
30799347|a|Objective Depression is common in patients with heart failure (HF) and is a possible risk factor for adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of depression assessed by the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and the effect of depression on outcomes in Japanese outpatients with HF. Methods This sub-analysis of a prospective observational study assessed 976 patients with HF (mean age 66+-13 years; 26.7% female; 42.7% with an ischemic etiology). Depression was defined as a PHQ-2 score >=3. The main composite outcome was death from any cause or hospitalization due to worsening HF. PHQ-2 items were extracted from the PHQ-9 results. To evaluate the association of PHQ-2 scores with outcomes, Cox proportional hazards models were evaluated. Results Fifty-seven (5.8%) patients were diagnosed with depression. During a median follow-up of 21 months, the incidence rates for death from any cause and hospitalization due to worsening HF in patients with and without depression were 2.2 vs. 0.9 per 100 person-years and 6.7 vs. 1.6, p<0.001, respectively. There was a higher incidence of the main outcome in patients with depression than in those without depression (p<0.001). After adjustment for conventional risk factors, depression (PHQ-2 >=3) was an independent predictor of the main outcome (hazard ratio 2.41, 95% confidence interval 1.14-4.67, p=0.022), and a score for item 1 of the PHQ-2 (loss of interest or pleasure) >=2 was also an independent risk factor (hazard ratio 3.57, 95% confidence interval 1.85-6.46, p<0.001). Conclusion Depression as assessed by the PHQ-2 was identified in 5.8% of Japanese outpatients with HF and was associated with outcomes.
