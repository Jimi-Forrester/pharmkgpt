35645982|t|Neuroplasticity of Glioma Patients: Brain Structure and Topological Network.
35645982|a|Glioma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults. It accounts for about 75% of such tumors and occurs more commonly in men. The incidence rate has been increasing in the past 30 years. Moreover, the 5-year overall survival rate of glioma patients is < 35%. Different locations, grades, and molecular characteristics of gliomas can lead to different behavioral deficits and prognosis, which are closely related to patients' quality of life and associated with neuroplasticity. Some advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologies can explore the neuroplasticity of structural, topological, biochemical metabolism, and related mechanisms, which may contribute to the improvement of prognosis and function in glioma patients. In this review, we summarized the studies conducted on structural and topological plasticity of glioma patients through different MRI technologies and discussed future research directions. Previous studies have found that glioma itself and related functional impairments can lead to structural and topological plasticity using multimodal MRI. However, neuroplasticity caused by highly heterogeneous gliomas is not fully understood, and should be further explored through multimodal MRI. In addition, the individualized prediction of functional prognosis of glioma patients from the functional level based on machine learning (ML) is promising. These approaches and the introduction of ML can further shed light on the neuroplasticity and related mechanism of the brain, which will be helpful for management of glioma patients.
