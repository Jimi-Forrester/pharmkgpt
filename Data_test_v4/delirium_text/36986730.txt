36986730|t|The In Vitro, Ex Vivo, and In Vivo Effect of Edible Oils: A Review on Cell Interactions.
36986730|a|Consumption of edible oils is a significant part of the dietary pattern in the developed and developing world. Marine and vegetable oils are assumed to be part of a healthy food pattern, especially if one takes into account their potential role in protecting against inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome due to the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids and minor bioactive compounds. Exploring the potential effect of edible fats and oils on health and chronic diseases is an emerging field worldwide. This study reviews the current knowledge of the in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo effect of edible oils in contact with various cell types and aims to demonstrate which nutritional and bioactive components of a variety of edible oils present biocompatibility, antimicrobial properties, antitumor activity, anti-angiogenic activity, and antioxidant activity. Through this review, a wide variety of cell interactions with edible oils and their potential to counteract oxidative stress in pathological conditions are presented as well. Moreover, the gaps in current knowledge are also highlighted, and future perspectives on edible oils and their health benefits and potential to counteract a wide variety of diseases through possible molecular mechanisms are also discussed.
