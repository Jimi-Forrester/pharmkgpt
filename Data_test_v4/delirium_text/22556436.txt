22556436|t|Clinical profile and outcome of bipolar disorder patients receiving electroconvulsive therapy: a study from north India.
22556436|a|BACKGROUND: Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is used quite frequently among the bipolar patients in developing countries, very little data are available with regard to its effectiveness from the developing countries. AIM: A retrospective case note review was carried out of bipolar disorder patients who were given ECT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Details of demographic and clinical profile, indications for ECT, response patterns, adverse effects, etc. were recorded. RESULTS: Among all the patients who received ECT, 18% were diagnosed to have bipolar disorder. ECT was administered most commonly for mania with psychotic symptoms, followed by severe depression with psychotic symptoms. Comorbid physical problems were seen in many patients. Nearly 90% of patients in both the subgroups showed more than 50% response (based on reduction in the standardized rating scales) with ECT. Few patients (22%) reported some kind of side effects. CONCLUSIONS: ECT is useful in the management of acute phase of mania and depression.
