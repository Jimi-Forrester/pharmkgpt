38343771|a|Mesenchymal stem cell-based therapies have been studied for spinal cord injury (SCI) treatment due to their paracrine action upon damaged tissues. MSCs neuroregenerative role may relate to the contents of their secretome in anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth-permissive factors. We propose using the secretome of MSCs isolated from the adipose tissue-adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) as a cell-free based therapy for SCI. In vivo studies were conducted in two SCI models, Xenopus laevis and mice, after complete spinal cord transection. Our results on both models demonstrated positive impacts of ASC secretome on their functional recovery which were correlated with histopathological markers of regeneration. Furthermore, in our mice study, secretome induced white matter preservation together with modulation of the local and peripheral inflammatory response. Altogether, these results demonstrate the neuroregenerative and potential for inflammatory modulation of ASC secretome suggesting it as a good candidate for cell-free therapeutic strategies for SCI.
