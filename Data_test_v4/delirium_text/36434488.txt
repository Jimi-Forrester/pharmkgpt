36434488|t|Rapid Response EEG: Current State and Future Directions.
36434488|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To critically appraise the literature on the application, methods, and advances in emergency electroencephalography (EEG). RECENT FINDINGS: The development of rapid EEG (rEEG) technologies and other reduced montage approaches, along with advances in machine learning over the past decade, has increased the rate and access to EEG acquisition. These achievements have made EEG in the emergency setting a practical diagnostic technique for detecting seizures, suspected nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), altered mental status, stroke, and in the setting of sedation. Growing evidence supports using EEG to expedite medical decision-making in the setting of suspected acute neurological injury. This review covers approaches to acquiring EEG in the emergency setting in the adult and pediatric populations. We also cover the clinical impact of this data, the time associated with emergency EEG, and the costs of acquiring EEG in these settings. Finally, we discuss the advances in artificial intelligence for rapid electrophysiological interpretation.
