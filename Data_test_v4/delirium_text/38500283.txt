38500283|t|Investigating Bacopa monnieri L. Therapeutic Potential for the Treatment of Neurological Diseases.
38500283|a|The popular perennial creeping plant known as Bacopa monnieri (also known as Brahmi) is being utilized in the Indian Ayurvedic medicine practice. It has a variety of bioactive phytoconstituents that have been used therapeutically to treat a number of serious illnesses. Ancient Vedic scholars used this herb because of its pharmacological effects, particularly as a nerve booster and nootropic supporter. However, it is vital to comprehend the active phytochemical components of Bacopa monnieri extract (BME) and their molecular mechanisms in order to better grasp the effect of BME on neurological illnesses and diseases. Understanding its active phytochemical constituents and their molecular processes is essential. Numerous clinical investigations indicated that BME may have neuroprotective benefits, so it is worthwhile to re-evaluate this wellknown plant. Here, we focused on neurological problems as we examined the pharmacological and phytochemical characteristics of BME. For their effective usage in neuroprotection and cognition, many clinical concerns and the synergistic potential of Bacopa extract have been investigated. Alzheimer's disease is a neurological condition caused by the production of reactive oxygen species, which also causes amyloid-beta (A) and tau protein aggregation and increases neuro-inflammation and neurotoxicity. Our review offers a more indepth molecular understanding of the neuroprotective functions of BME, which can also be connected to its therapeutic management of neurological illnesses and cognitive-improving effects.
