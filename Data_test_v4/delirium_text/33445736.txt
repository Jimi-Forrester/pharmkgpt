33445736|t|Fluorescent Probes for Selective Recognition of Hypobromous Acid: Achievements and Future Perspectives.
33445736|a|Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in numerous pathological processes and their homeostasis facilitates the dynamic balance of intracellular redox states. Among ROS, hypobromous acid (HOBr) has a high similarity to hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in both chemical and physical properties, whereas it has received relatively little attention. Meanwhile, selective recognition of endogenous HOBr suffers great challenges due to the fact that the concentration of this molecule is much lower than that of HOCl. Fluorescence-based detection systems have emerged as very important tools to monitor biomolecules in living cells and organisms owing to distinct advantages, particularly the temporal and spatial sampling for in vivo imaging applications. To date, the development of HOBr-specific fluorescent probes is still proceeding quite slowly, and the research related to this area has not been systematically summarized. In this review, we are the first to review the progress made so far in fluorescent probes for selective recognition and detection of HOBr. The molecular structures, sensing mechanisms, and their successful applications of these probes as bioimaging agents are discussed here in detail. Importantly, we hope this review will call for more attention to this rising field, and that this could stimulate new future achievements.
