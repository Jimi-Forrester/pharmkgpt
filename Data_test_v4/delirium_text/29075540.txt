29075540|t|Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome and Cytomegalovirus Pneumonia Case Report: Highlights and Missing Links in Classification Criteria and Standardized Treatment.
29075540|a|BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pulmonary involvement is rarely associated with IRIS; therefore, limited information is available. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we describe the case of a 43-year-old HIV-infected male who developed an unusual case of IRIS after cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia. Clinically there was a progressive and paradoxical worsening of respiratory distress, despite being treated for CMV after initiation with antiretroviral therapy. Chest X-ray revealed disseminated infiltrates in both lungs; chest CT-scan showed generalized lung involvement and mediastinal adenopathy. Pulmonary biopsy confirmed CMV pneumonia with the observation of typical viral inclusions on pneumocytes. CONCLUSIONS: CMV pneumonia can be associated with the development of IRIS requiring treatment with immunosuppressant's and immunomodulatory drugs.
