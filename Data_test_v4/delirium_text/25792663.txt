25792663|a|OBJECTIVE: We investigated and compared the risk of dementia development in a cohort of patients with tuberculosis (TB). METHODS: The study involved 6473 patient with newly diagnosed TB, and each patient was randomly frequency matched with 4 people without TB based on age, sex, and index year. The risk of dementia development was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Among the patients with TB, the overall risk of developing dementia was 1.21-fold significantly higher than the non-TB cohort. In the stratified analysis of dementia risks, only the patients with TB who were male or 50 to 64 years of age exhibited a significantly higher risk of dementia development compared with those without TB. An analysis of the follow-up duration revealed that patients with TB had a 1.78-fold increased risk within 1 year of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Patients with TB have a significantly higher risk of developing dementia than that of the general population.
