36831509|t|Multi-Morbidity and Risk of Breast Cancer among Women in the UK Biobank Cohort.
36831509|a|(Multi-)Morbidity shares common biological mechanisms or risk factors with breast cancer. This study aimed to investigate the association between the number of morbidities and patterns of morbidity and the risk of female breast cancer. Among 239,436 women (40-69 years) enrolled in the UK Biobank cohort who had no cancer history at baseline, we identified 35 self-reported chronic diseases at baseline. We assigned individuals into morbidity patterns using agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis. We fitted Cox models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for breast cancer risk. In total, 58.4% of women had at least one morbidity, and the prevalence of multi-morbidity was 25.8%. During a median 7-year follow-up, there was no association between breast cancer risk (5326 cases) and either the number of morbidities or the identified clinically relevant morbidity patterns: no-predominant morbidity (reference), psychiatric morbidities (HR = 1.04, 95%CI 0.94-1.16), respiratory/immunological morbidities (HR = 0.98, 95%CI 0.90-1.07), cardiovascular/metabolic morbidities (HR = 0.93, 95%CI 0.81-1.06), and unspecific morbidities (HR = 0.98, 95%CI 0.89-1.07), overall. Among women younger than 50 years of age only, however, there was a significant association with psychiatric morbidity patterns compared to the no-predominant morbidity pattern (HR = 1.25, 95%CI 1.02-1.52). The other associations did not vary when stratifying by age at baseline and adherence to mammography recommendations. In conclusion, multi-morbidity was not a key factor to help identify patients at an increased risk of breast cancer.
