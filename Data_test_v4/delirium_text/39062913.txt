39062913|a|Pancreas-derived islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) aggregates and deposits in the pancreas and periphery of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) patients, contributing to diabetic complications. The excess IAPP can be removed by autoantibodies, and increased levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) G against IAPP have been reported in T2D patients. However, whether other Ig classes are also affected and if the levels can be managed is less known. This pre-post study examines IgA levels against IAPP oligomers (IAPPO-IgA) in T2D patients and assesses the impact of the Okinawa-based Nordic (O-BN) diet-a low-carbohydrate, high-fiber diet-on these levels after following the diet for 3 months. IAPP, IAPPO-IgA, and total IgA levels were measured in plasma and fecal samples from n = 30 T2D patients collected at baseline, after 3 months of diet, and after additional 4 months of unrestricted diets (a clinical follow-up). The IAPP and IAPPO-IgA levels were significantly lower after 3 months, with the latter also being significantly reduced at the clinical follow-up. The reduction in plasma IAPP and IAPPO-IgA levels correlated with reductions in plasma levels of metabolic and inflammatory markers. Hence, following the O-BN diet for at least 3 months is sufficient to reduce circulating IAPP and IAPPO-IgA levels, which may be principal in managing T2D.
