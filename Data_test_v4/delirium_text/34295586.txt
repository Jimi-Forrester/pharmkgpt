34295586|t|Association of Diabetes With Lower Back Pain: A Narrative Review.
34295586|a|Diabetes mellitus with its increasing prevalence is one of the four major non-communicable diseases. It is characterized by hyperglycemia, which may progress to chronic complications such as peripheral vascular disease and neuropathy. This paper highlights the pathophysiology associated with diabetes, which is restricted to not only hyperglycemia but also other comorbidities including chronic lower back pain. Diabetes is a metabolic disorder associated with hypercholesteremia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension. This chain of events leads to free plasma fatty acids and a pro-inflammatory state, therefore promoting calcification of blood vessels, which may block the blood supply to vertebral discs and thereby increase vulnerability in the patients with ongoing inflammatory disease such as osteoarthritis and also causing costochondritis. Functional limitation due to increased load on the weight-bearing joints is a common mechanical complication of diabetes. Obesity in diabetes is more prevalent due to a disturbed metabolism, which is aggravated with a persistent inflammatory state. Moreover, the aim of this review is to encourage further conduction of clinical studies to explore the definite cause and potential therapy for chronic lower back pain in diabetes, thereby investigating the association of lipid metabolism and skeletal muscle atrophy leading to chronic back pain, the role of diabetic medications, and vulnerability in the female gender. Diminished physical activity and depression in diabetic patients disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), which further contributes to lower back pain. Further clinical investigation and research in this regard will establish substantial data for the linkage between depression in diabetes and back pain. However, despite all the advancements of medical literature, the exact cause of lower back pain in diabetes is arguable. Pain impedes the health status and life quality; therefore, it is essential to maintain the quality of health in patients with diabetes by treating not only hyperglycemia but also other multifactorial causes leading to lower back pain.
