36699107|t|Calciphylaxis Case Series: A Late Presentation of Chronic Kidney Disease From the Eastern Caribbean.
36699107|a|Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) or calciphylaxis is a rare condition that predominantly affects the dialysis population and is characterized by calcification of cutaneous arterioles accompanied by painful necrotic skin ulcers. At the hemodialysis unit of the Port-of-Spain General Hospital, there have been eight cases between the years 2015-2019 with an incidence of 121 cases per 10,000 patients undergoing renal replacement therapy, quite possibly one of the highest in the world along with an 87.5% mortality when diagnosed with this condition. Risk factors identified in this case series include female gender, obesity, and late presentation of end-stage renal disease. This case series highlights limitations in the diagnosis and management of the disease in a resource-limited setting and intends to raise awareness of this condition in the Caribbean.
