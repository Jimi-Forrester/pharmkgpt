34292818|a|Uncemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty (UBHA) has been widely used to treat geriatric displaced femoral neck fracture (GDFNF), which results in a high 30-day mortality rate among the elderly. To date, few studies have focused on the risk factors for mortality after UBHA for GDFNF. In this retrospective study, elderly patients (age >=70 years) who underwent UBHA for GDFNF were studied in order to provide helpful insight into the risk factors for mortality postoperatively. This retrospective study enrolled 835 elderly patients who underwent UBHA for GDFNF from January 2010 to December 2017. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis were used to identify significant risk factors predicting mortality after UBHA for GDFNF. Univariate analysis showed that underweight (body mass index <18.5 kg/m2), smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hypoproteinemia, low activities of daily living (ADL) score (0 to 2), and postoperative delirium were identified as the potential risk factors responsible for mortality after UBHA for GDFNF. Multivariate analysis suggested that underweight, hypoproteinemia, low ADL score, and postoperative delirium were significant risk factors predicting mortality after UBHA for GDFNF. Postoperative delirium was the most robust risk factor for mortality after UBHA for GDFNF. Underweight, hypoproteinemia, and low ADL score were also closely associated with mortality after UBHA for GDFNF. [Orthopedics. 2021;44(4):e570-e576.].
