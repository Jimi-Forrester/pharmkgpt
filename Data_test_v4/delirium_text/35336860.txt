35336860|t|Distinct Plasma Concentrations of Acyl-CoA-Binding Protein (ACBP) in HIV Progressors and Elite Controllers.
35336860|a|HIV elite controllers (ECs) are characterized by the spontaneous control of viral replication, and by metabolic and autophagic profiles which favor anti-HIV CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses. Extracellular acyl coenzyme A binding protein (ACBP) acts as a feedback inhibitor of autophagy. Herein, we assessed the circulating ACBP levels in ECs, compared to people living with HIV (PLWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) or not. We found lower ACBP levels in ECs compared to ART-naive or ART-treated PLWH (p < 0.01 for both comparisons), independently of age and sex. ACBP levels were similar in ECs and HIV-uninfected controls. The expression of the protective HLA alleles HLA-B*27, *57, or *58 did not influence ACBP levels in ECs. ACBP levels were not associated with CD4 or CD8 T-cell counts, CD4 loss over time, inflammatory cytokines, or anti-CMV IgG titers in ECs. In ART-treated PLWH, ACBP levels were correlated with interleukin (IL)-1beta levels, but not with other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-32, or TNF-alpha. In conclusion, ECs are characterized by low ACBP plasma levels compared to ART-naive or ART-treated PLWH. As autophagy is key to anti-HIV CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, the ACBP pathway constitutes an interesting target in HIV cure strategies.
