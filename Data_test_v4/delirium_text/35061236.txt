35061236|t|Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of DS-1040, in Combination with Thrombectomy, in Japanese Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke.
35061236|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: DS-1040 is a novel inhibitor of the activated form of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor that may have therapeutic potential in thromboembolic diseases, such as acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or pulmonary embolism. We undertook a Phase I clinical trial to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of DS-1040 in Japanese patients who were eligible for thrombectomy following AIS. METHODS: The trial enrolled patients with AIS due to large vessel occlusion, who were planned for thrombectomy within 8 h of symptom onset. Subjects were randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion of placebo or DS-1040 (0.6, 1.2, 2.4 or 4.8 mg) in a sequential-cohort design. The primary endpoints were the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and major extracranial bleeding within 36 and 96 h, respectively, of treatment initiation. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters were also assessed. RESULTS: Nine patients received placebo and 32 patients received DS-1040. There were no cases of symptomatic ICH or major extracranial bleeding with either placebo or DS-1040 after 36 and 96 h. One patient, who received DS-1040 0.6 mg, experienced a subarachnoid hemorrhage that was considered to be drug-related. Three patients died (2 placebo, 1 DS-1040), but no deaths were adjudicated as study drug-related. In vivo exposure to DS-1040 increased in proportion to dosage, but no clear dose-response relationship was seen for D-dimer levels and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor activity. CONCLUSIONS: Single doses of DS-1040 0.6-4.8 mg were well tolerated in Japanese patients with AIS undergoing thrombectomy. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03198715; JapicCTI-163164.
