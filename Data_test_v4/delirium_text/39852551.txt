39852551|a|Neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death are leading causes of death in the elderly and underlie various neurodegenerative diseases. These diseases involve complex pathophysiological mechanisms, including inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and ferroptosis. Compounds derived from deep-sea fungi exhibit low toxicity and potent neuroprotective effects, offering a promising source for drug development. In this study, we isolated 44 natural products from deep-sea-derived fungi and identified isobisvertinol (17) as a compound with anti-inflammatory and ferroptosis-inhibiting effects. Using LPS-induced microglial inflammation and RSL3-induced neuronal ferroptosis models, we found that 17 targets TLR4 to provide neuroprotection. Molecular docking studies revealed that 17 inhibits TLR4 activation by occupying the hydrophobic pocket at the TLR4-MD2 binding site. Additionally, 17 suppresses TLR4, reducing p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and inhibits ferroptosis by decreasing lipid peroxidation and modulating mitochondrial membrane potential. Metabolomic analysis showed that 17 rescues alterations in multiple metabolic pathways induced by RSL3 and increases levels of antioxidant metabolites, including glutamine, glutamate, and glutathione. In summary, our results indicate that isobisvertinol (17) targets TLR4 in neural cells to reduce inflammation and inhibit p38 MAPK phosphorylation, while regulating metabolic pathways, mainly GSH synthesis, to provide antioxidant effects and prevent ferroptosis in neurons.
