38457647|a|Background/Purpose: Older patients living with dementia and their caregivers are ideal beneficiaries of telemedicine, cost-effectiveness, caregiver satisfaction, and physician acceptance. The aim is to study the effect of a telemedicine dementia enabled program on the health outcome of dementia patients and their caregivers, as regard the patient outcome, caregiver stress, and caregiver satisfaction. Methods: Ninety-seven (n = 97) elderly subjects were recruited from the outpatient clinics and inpatient ward of Geriatrics Hospital, Ain Shams University Hospitals. Seventy subjects completed 6 months of follow-up using a telegeriatrics model. Patient outcomes (delirium, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia [BPSD], and need for home consultations, emergency room [ER] visits, clinic visits, and hospital admissions) were assessed and followed. Caregiver stress was evaluated and monitored using the abridged Arabic version of the Zarit Burden Interview ZBI-A. Caregiver satisfaction was assessed using dedicated satisfaction questionnaire designed by Ain Shams Virtual Hospital. Results: elirium episodes, BPSD episodes, and the need for home consultations, clinic visits, ER visits, and hospital admissions. This was statistically significant after the second, fourth, and sixth months of follow-up (p-value <0.001). In addition, the telegeriatrics follow-up model had a positive effect on both caregiver stress and caregiver satisfaction. Conclusions: The telegeriatrics follow-up model is a useful tool in the improvement of health outcomes of dementia patients, reduction of caregiver stress, and achievement of caregiver satisfaction.
