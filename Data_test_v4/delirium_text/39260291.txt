39260291|t|Implementation of the psycho-existential symptom assessment scale in palliative care: Qualitative analysis of stakeholders perspectives.
39260291|a|OBJECTIVES: To explore 1) perspectives of feasibility, acceptability, integration and sustainability of the Psycho-existential Symptom Assessment Scale (PeSAS); 2) barriers and benefits of PeSAS in its real-world performance; and 3) clinician confidence and perceived competency in using PeSAS. METHODS: Thirty-one key stakeholders from nine palliative care services who participated in the implementation of the PeSAS were purposefully sampled and participated in semi-structured interviews. Data was managed using the Determinants Framework. RESULTS: Benefits of PeSAS were a common language enhancing communication, identifying symptoms of psycho-existential distress, initiating referral, providing acknowledgement for previously unrecognised distress and enhancing patient agency. Key barriers were the availability of skilled clinicians, patient characteristics such as delirium and phase of illness, avoidance of confronting end-of-life conversations, information technology resourcing, and reduced engagement due to language, culture and health literacy. CONCLUSION: Screening using the PeSAS is feasible and acceptable once clinicians are adequately trained to administer it. Our study highlights the benefits of qualitative enquiry in developing and implementing new interventions. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The identification and management of psycho-existential symptoms should be part of routine practice in palliative care. However, adequate staff training, resourcing, referral pathways and implementation process and outcome assessments are important to ensure sustainability.
