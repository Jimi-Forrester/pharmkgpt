20860566|t|The production ratios of AICDepsilon51 and Abeta42 by intramembrane proteolysis of betaAPP do not always change in parallel.
20860566|a|BACKGROUND: During intramembrane proteolysis of beta-amyloid protein precursor (betaAPP) by presenilin (PS)/gamma-secretase, epsilon-cleavages at the membrane-cytoplasmic border precede gamma-cleavages at the middle of the transmembrane domain. Generation ratios of Abeta42, a critical molecule for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and the major Abeta40 species might be associated with epsilon48 and epsilon49 cleavages, respectively. Medicines to downregulate Abeta42 production have been investigated by many pharmaceutical companies. Therefore, the epsilon-cleavages, rather than the gamma-cleavage, might be more effective upstream targets for decreasing the relative generation of Abeta42. Thus, one might evaluate compounds by analyzing the generation ratio of the betaAPP intracellular domain (AICD) species (epsilon-cleavage-derived), instead of that of Abeta42. METHODS: Cell-free gamma-secretase assays were carried out to observe de novo AICD production. Immunoprecipitation/MALDI-TOF MS analysis was carried out to detect the N-termini of AICD species. Abeta and AICD species were measured by ELISA and immunoblotting techniques. RESULTS: Effects on the epsilon-cleavage by AD-associated pathological mutations around the epsilon-cleavage sites (i.e., betaAPP V642I, L648P and K649N) were analyzed. The V642I and L648P mutations caused an increase in the relative ratio of epsilon48 cleavage, as expected from previous reports. Cells expressing the K649N mutant, however, underwent a major epsilon-cleavage at the epsilon51 site. These results suggest that epsilon51, as well as epsilon48 cleavage, is associated with Abeta42 production. Only AICDepsilon51, though, and not Abeta42 production, dramatically changed with modifications to the cell-free assay conditions. Interestingly, the increase in the relative ratio of the epsilon51 cleavage by the K649N mutation was not cancelled by these changes. CONCLUSION: Our current data show that the generation ratio of AICDepsilon51 and Abeta42 do not always change in parallel. Thus, to identify compounds that decrease the relative ratio of Abeta42 generation, measurement of the relative level of Abeta42-related AICD species (i.e., AICDepsilon48 and AICDepsilon51) might not be useful. Further studies to reveal how the epsilon-cleavage precision is decided are necessary before it will be possible to develop drugs targeting epsilon-cleavage as a means for decreasing Abeta42 production.
