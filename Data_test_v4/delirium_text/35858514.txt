To examine early cognitive recovery, it is first necessary to establish the feasibility of repeat cognitive assessment during the acute post-stroke phase. OBJECTIVE: To determine if serial computerised testing is feasible for cognitive assessment in an acute post-stroke phase, measured by assessment completion rates. METHOD: An observational cohort study recruited consecutive stroke patients admitted to an acute stroke unit within 48 hours of onset. Daily assessment with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) was performed for seven days, and single Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). RESULTS: Seventy-one participants were recruited, mean age 74 years, with 67 completing daily testing. Participants had predominantly mild (85%; NIHSS <=6), ischemic (90%) stroke, 32% demonstrated clinical delirium. The first day of testing, 76% of participants completed CANTAB batteries. Eighty-seven percent of participants completed MoCA a mean of 3.4 days post-stroke. The proportion of CANTAB batteries completed improved significantly from day 2 to day 3 post-stroke with test completion rates stabilizing >= 92% by day 4. Participants with incomplete CANTAB were older, with persisting delirium, and longer stay in acute care. CONCLUSION: Serial computerised cognitive assessments are feasible the first week post-stroke and provide a novel approach to measuring cognitive change for both clinical and research purposes. Maximum completion rates by day four have clinical implications for optimal timing of cognitive testing.
