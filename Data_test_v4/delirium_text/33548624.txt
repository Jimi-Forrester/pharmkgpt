33548624|t|Segmental structural dynamics in Abeta42 globulomers.
33548624|a|Abeta42 aggregation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In addition to the insoluble fibrils that comprise the amyloid plaques, Abeta42 also forms soluble aggregates collectively called oligomers, which are more toxic and pathogenic than fibrils. Understanding the structure and dynamics of Abeta42 oligomers is critical for developing effective therapeutic interventions against these oligomers. Here we studied the structural dynamics of Abeta42 globulomers, a type of Abeta42 oligomers prepared in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, using site-directed spin labeling. Spin labels were introduced, one at a time, at all 42 residue positions of Abeta42 sequence. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of spin-labeled samples reveal four structural segments based on site-dependent spin label mobility pattern. Segment-1 consists of residues 1-6, which have the highest mobility that is consistent with complete disorder. Segment-3 is the most immobilized region, including residues 31-34. Segment-2 and -4 have intermediate mobility and are composed of residues 7-30 and 35-42, respectively. Considering the inverse relationship between protein dynamics and stability, our results suggest that residues 31-34 are the most stable segment in Abeta42 oligomers. At the same time, the EPR spectral lineshape suggests that Abeta42 globulomers lack a well-packed structural core akin to that of globular proteins.
