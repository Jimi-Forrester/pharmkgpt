39906286|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) production is a normal physiological process, essential for neuronal function. However, an imbalance in Abeta production and clearance is the central pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to the accumulation of Abeta plaques in the brain. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) plays a critical role in both the central clearance of Abeta from the brain and its peripheral transport to visceral organs. Disruptions in these processes contribute to the accumulation of Abeta in the central nervous system (CNS) and the progression of AD. Recent research emphasizes the need for a broader focus on the systemic effects of organs outside the brain, particularly in the context of AD prevention and treatment. The contribution of peripheral systems, such as the liver, in Abeta clearance, is vital, given that Abeta levels in the plasma correlate closely with those in the brain. Consequently, targeting systemic processes, rather than focusing solely on the CNS, may offer promising therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) facilitates the formation of lipoprotein-amyloid complexes, which are important for Abeta transport and clearance, using proteins such as apolipoproteins E and J (ApoE and ApoJ) to form complexes that help manage Abeta accumulation. On the other hand, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) facilitates Abeta efflux from the brain by binding to LRP1, promoting its clearance. Given the relationship between lipid profiles and Abeta levels, along with lipid-modifying drugs, may be effective in managing Abeta accumulation and mitigating AD progression.
