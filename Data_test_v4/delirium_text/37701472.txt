37701472|t|Stroke Prevention.
37701472|a|Stroke has three main subtypes - ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most common stroke subtype is ischemic stroke, making up about 88% of strokes. Many of these strokes may be prevented by lifestyle modifications. These lifestyle modifications include engaging in physical activity, dietary changes such as the Mediterranean diet, smoking cessation, and avoiding substance abuse. Addressing medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, lipid management, sleep apnea, and atrial fibrillation will also have a major impact on stroke prevention. In addition to stroke prevention, these strategies help with overall brain health, which may also have an impact on neurological degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
