31578596|a|The incidence of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) is increasing throughout the world, but their pathogenesis remains unclear and successful treatment remains elusive. Bidirectional communications between the central nervous system and gut microbiota may play some role in the pathogenesis of the above disorders. Up to a thousand bacterial species reside in human intestine; they colonize the gut shortly after birth and remain for life. Numerous studies point to the role of microbiota composition in the development, course and treatment of MS, AD and PD.
