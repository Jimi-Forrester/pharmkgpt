28352631|a|Many older adults suffer from persistent pain but prevalence studies consistently showed high levels of untreated or under-treated pain in old population. Both persistent pain and pain under-treatment adversely affect independence and quality of life in geriatric patients. Pain management is challenging in this age-group because of the declining organ function, the presence of concurrent diseases and polypharmacy. For all the above reasons, persistent pain in the elderly should be considered a geriatric syndrome per se and effective approaches are warranted. Current guidelines and consensus statements recommend opioid therapy for older adults with moderate-to-severe persistent pain or functional impairment and diminished quality of life due to pain. However clinicians and patients themselves have some concerns about opioids use. Age-related decline in organs functions and warnings about risk of addiction and drug misuse/abuse also in geriatric patients need particular attention for safe prescribing. On the basis of clinical evidence, these practical recommendations will help to improve the competence on opioid role in persistent pain management and the likelihood of a successful analgesic trial in older patients.
