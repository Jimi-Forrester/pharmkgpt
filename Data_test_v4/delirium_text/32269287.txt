32269287|t|beta-hydroxybutyrate and its metabolic effects on age-associated pathology.
32269287|a|Aging is a universal process that renders individuals vulnerable to many diseases. Although this process is irreversible, dietary modulation and caloric restriction are often considered to have antiaging effects. Dietary modulation can increase and maintain circulating ketone bodies, especially beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB), which is one of the most abundant ketone bodies in human circulation. Increased beta-HB has been reported to prevent or improve the symptoms of various age-associated diseases. Indeed, numerous studies have reported that a ketogenic diet or ketone ester administration alleviates symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. Considering the potential of beta-HB and the intriguing data emerging from in vivo and in vitro experiments as well as clinical trials, this therapeutic area is worthy of attention. In this review, we highlight studies that focus on the identified targets of beta-HB and the cellular signals regulated by beta-HB with respect to alleviation of age-associated ailments.
