38177673|a|Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradation pathway essential for cellular homeostasis, which decreases with age. However, it is unclear how aging induces autophagy decline. Here we show the role of protein S-palmitoylation in autophagy. We identify the palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC5 as a regulator of autophagy by mediating the palmitoylation of beclin 1, which in turn promotes the formation of ATG14L-containing class III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase complex I and its lipid kinase activity by promoting the hydrophobic interactions between beclin 1 and adapter proteins ATG14L and VPS15. In aging brains of human and nonhuman primate, the levels of DHHC5 exhibit a marked decrease in expression. We show that DHHC5 deficiency in neurons leads to reduced cellular protein homeostasis in two established murine models of Alzheimer's disease, which exaggerates neurodegeneration in an autophagy-dependent manner. These findings identify reduction of DHHC5-mediated beclin 1 S-palmitoylation as an underlying mechanism by which aging induces autophagy decline.
