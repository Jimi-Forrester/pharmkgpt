33477609|a|The intestinal microbiome, the largest reservoir of microorganisms in the human body, plays an important role in neurological development and aging as well as in brain disorders such as an ischemic stroke. Increasing knowledge about mediators and triggered pathways has contributed to a better understanding of the interaction between the gut-brain axis and the brain-gut axis. Intestinal bacteria produce neuroactive compounds and can modulate neuronal function, which affects behavior after an ischemic stroke. In addition, intestinal microorganisms affect host metabolism and immune status, which in turn affects the neuronal network in the ischemic brain. Here we discuss the latest results of animal and human research on two-way communication along the gut-brain axis in an ischemic stroke. Moreover, several reports have revealed the impact of an ischemic stroke on gut dysfunction and intestinal dysbiosis, highlighting the delicate play between the brain, intestines and microbiome after this acute brain injury. Despite our growing knowledge of intestinal microflora in shaping brain health, host metabolism, the immune system and disease progression, its therapeutic options in an ischemic stroke have not yet been fully utilized. This review shows the role of the gut microflora-brain axis in an ischemic stroke and assesses the potential role of intestinal microflora in the onset, progression and recovery post-stroke.
