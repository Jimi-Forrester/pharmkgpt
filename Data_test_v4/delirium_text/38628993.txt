38628993|t|The Great Masquerader: Recurrent Ischemic Strokes Secondary to Meningovascular Syphilis in a Man With Cardiovascular Stroke Risk Factors.
38628993|a|A male in his 60s with stroke risk factors presented with confusion and word-finding difficulties. He was diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke in the right basal ganglia. He was started on secondary stroke prevention measures including dual antiplatelet therapy and a high-dose statin. A highly reactive rapid plasma reagin (RPR) was performed as part of the workup and found to be positive. Follow-up fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (TPA) test was also positive, confirming a diagnosis of syphilis. He was discharged home with a scheduled course of antibiotic treatment for tertiary syphilis but returned due to a new episode of transient facial paralysis. Further workup and physical exam findings revealed the patient had neurosyphilis. He was started on the appropriate antibiotic therapy, which significantly improved his confusion and prevented new episodes of stroke.
