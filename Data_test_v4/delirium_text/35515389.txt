35515389|t|Integrated glycomics strategy for the evaluation of glycosylation alterations in salivary proteins associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
35515389|a|Glycosylation is involved in several biological processes, and its alterations can reflect the process of certain diseases. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has attained the status of a global pandemic; however, the difference in salivary protein glycosylation between healthy subjects and patients with T2DM has not been fully understood. In the present study, salivary specimens from patients with T2DM (n = 72) and healthy volunteers (HVs, n = 80) were enrolled and divided into discovery and validation cohorts. A method combining the lectin microarray and lectin blotting was employed to investigate and confirm the altered glycopatterns in salivary glycoproteins. Then, lectin-mediated affinity capture of glycoproteins and MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS were performed to obtain the precise structural information of the altered glycans. As a result, the glycopatterns recognized by 5 lectins (LEL, VVA, Jacalin, RCA120 and DSA) showed significant alteration in the saliva of T2DM patients. Notably, the glycopattern of Galbeta-1,4GlcNAc (LacNAc) recognized by LEL exhibited a significant increase in T2DM patients compared to HVs in both discovery and validation cohorts. The MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS results indicated that there were 10 and 7 LacNAc-containing N/O-glycans (e.g. m/z 1647.586, 11 688.613 and 1562.470) that were identified only in T2DM patients. Besides, the relative abundance of 3 LacNAc-containing N-glycans and 10 LacNAc-containing O-glycans showed an increase in the glycopattern in T2DM patients. These results indicated that the glycopattern of LacNAc is increased in salivary glycoproteins from T2DM patients, and an increase in LacNAc-containing N/O-glycans may contribute to this alteration. Our findings provide useful information to understand the complex physiological changes in the T2DM patients.
