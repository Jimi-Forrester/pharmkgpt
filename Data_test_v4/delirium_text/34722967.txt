34722967|a|A series of synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) ligands were synthesized to explore the structure-activity relationship and to help further investigate a hydrogen bonding pharmacophore hypothesis. Racemic SynVesT-1 was used as a lead compound to explore the replacement of the 3-methyl group on the pyridinyl moiety with halogens and hydrocarbons. Pyridinyl isomers of racemic SynVesT-1 were also investigated. Highly potent analogs were discovered including a 3-iodo pyridinyl ligand amenable to investigation as a PET or SPECT imaging agent.
