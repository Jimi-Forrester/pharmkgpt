29857276|t|Novel tetrahydrocarbazole benzyl pyridine hybrids as potent and selective butryl cholinesterase inhibitors with neuroprotective and beta-secretase inhibition activities.
29857276|a|Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitors have become interesting target for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A series of dual binding site BuChE inhibitors were designed and synthesized based on 2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazole attached benzyl pyridine moieties. In-vitro assay revealed that all of the designed compounds were selective and potent BuChE inhibitors. The most potent BuChE inhibitor was compound 6i (IC50 = 0.088 +- 0.0009 muM) with the mixed-type inhibition. Docking study revealed that 6i is a dual binding site BuChE inhibitor. Also, Pharmacokinetic properties for 6i were accurate to Lipinski's rule. In addition, compound 6i demonstrated neuroprotective and beta-secretase (BACE1) inhibition activities. This compound could also inhibit AChE-induced and self-induced Abeta peptide aggregation at concentration of 100 muM and 10 muM respectively. Generally, the results are presented as new potent selective BuChE inhibitors with a therapeutic potential for the treatment of AD.
