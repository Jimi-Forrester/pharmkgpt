36556919|a|One of the essential regulators of arterial blood pressure, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) seems to be one of the most complex mechanisms in the human body. Since the discovery of its key components and their actions, new substances and functions are still being unraveled. The main pathway begins with the secretion of renin in the kidney and culminates with the synthesis of angiotensin II (Ang II)-a strong vasoconstrictor-thanks to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Research conducted in 2000 identified another enzyme, named ACE2, that converts Ang II into Ang-(1-7), a heptapeptide with opposing effects to those of Ang II: vasodilation and anti-inflammatory properties. This particular enzyme became of paramount importance during the last two decades, as a result of the confrontation of the human race with life-threatening epidemics. Multiple studies have been performed in order to uncover the link between ACE2 and human coronaviruses, the results of which we systemized in order to create an overview of the pathogenic mechanism. Human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, attach to ACE2 via their spike proteins (S), causing the destruction of the enzyme. Because ACE2 limits the production of Ang II (by converting it into Ang-(1-7)), its destruction leads to a dysregulated inflammatory response. The purpose of this review is to decipher the complex pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the multiorgan complications (oral, cardiac, pulmonary, systemic) that appear as a result of the interaction of the SARS CoV-2 virus with the angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2.
