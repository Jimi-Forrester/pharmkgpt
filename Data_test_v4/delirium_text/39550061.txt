39550061|a|BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of updated drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has produced encouraging cognitive and clinical results in clinical trials, but there is still controversy over how to choose effective treatment options among these numerous drugs. The purpose of this network meta-analysis (NMA) is to compare and rank these drugs based on their efficacy. METHODS: We systematically searched in PubMed, Web of Science databases and Cochrane LIbrary, gov for randomized controlled trials for data from 2020 to 2024, and then performed a random-effect network meta-analysis. RESULTS: Our NMA results showed that in several main indicators ADAS-cog, CDR-SB and ADCS-ADL. GV-971 (MD -2.36, 95 % CI -5.08, 0.35), Lecanemab (MD -2.00, 95 % CI -5.25, 1.26), Donanemab (MD -1.45, 95 % CI -4.70, 1.81), Masupirdine (MD -0.83, 95 % CI -3.49, 1.84) were more effective than placebo in improving ADAS-cog. In terms of CDR-SB, Lecanemab (MD -3.11,95 % CI -5.23, -0.99) was more effective. Compared with placebo, Donanemab was more effective in ADCS-ADL (MD 3.26,95 % CI 1.48,5.05). SUCRA values showed that GV-971 (76.1 % and 68.7 %) could achieve better therapeutic effects in ADAS-cog) and NPI, and Lecanema (98.1 %) was more effective in improving CDR-SB scores than other drugs. Donanemab (99.8 %) may be the most promising way to slow down the decline in ADCS-ADL scores. The effect of Masupirdine (80.7 %) on MMSE was significantly better than that of several other drugs. CONCLUSION: Donanemab and Lecanemab showed good efficacy in ADCS-ADL and CDR-SB, respectively. GV-971 is the best choice to improve ADAS cogs and NPI.
