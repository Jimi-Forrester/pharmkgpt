36519396|t|What are Risk Factors of Postoperative Pneumonia in Geriatric Individuals after Hip Fracture Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
36519396|a|Postoperative pneumonia (POP) is a common postoperative complication. Negative consequences associated with POP included prolonged hospital length of stay, more frequent intensive care unit (ICU) stays, and a higher rate of sepsis, readmission, and mortality. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the incidence and risk factors associated with POP after hip fracture surgery in elderly patients. PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched (up to March 31, 2022). All studies on the risk factors for POP after hip fracture surgery in elderly patients, published in English, were reviewed. The qualities of the included studies were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were pooled, and a meta-analysis was performed. Ten studies, including 12,084 geriatric patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, were included. Of these 12,084 patients, POP occurred in 809 patients. The results indicated that age (mean difference [MD] = 4.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.22-6.69), male (odds ratio [OR] = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.02-1.93), the American Society of Anaesthesiologists classification >=3 (OR = 3.48, 95% CI: 1.87-6.47), dependent functional status (OR = 5.23, 95% CI: 2.18-12.54, P = 0.0002), smoking (OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.07-1.65), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 3.76, 95% CI: 2.07-6.81), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.01-1.40), coronary heart disease (OR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.23-2.46), arrhythmia (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.01-2.14), cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.56-2.27), dementia (OR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.04-5.36), chronic renal failure (OR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.29-2.67), hip arthroplasty (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.08-1.56), delayed surgery (OR = 6.40, 95% CI: 3.00-13.68), preoperative creatinine (MD = 5.32, 95% CI: 0.55-10.08), and preoperative serum albumin (MD = -3.01, 95% CI: -4.21 - -1.80) were risk factors for POP. Related prophylactic measures should be provided in geriatric patients with the above-mentioned risk factors to prevent POP after hip fracture surgery.
