9631060|a|The potential therapeutic applications of encapsulated cells are enormous. In the US alone, it has been estimated that nearly half-a-trillion dollars are spent each year to care for patients who suffer tissue loss or dysfunction. Over 6 million patients suffer from neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, over 14 million patients suffer from diabetes, and millions more from liver failure, hemophilia, and other diseases caused by the loss of specific vital cellular functions. It appears likely that by the end of the decade clinical trials of encapsulated cells to treat many of these diseases will become a reality. The Food and Drug Administration has already authorized studies to evaluate the safety and biological activity of several types of systems. A number of issues will have to be addressed, including the sourcing of raw materials, the design and building of manufacturing facilities, the scale-up and optimization process, storage and distribution of the product, and quality control.
