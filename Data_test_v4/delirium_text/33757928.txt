33757928|a|The results of the WHI, which reported a doubling of the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a decline in cognitive function in women who were given menopause hormone therapy (MHT), have raised concerns on the deleterious impact of MHT on the central nervous system. Such as for the cardiovascular system, the very late age of initiation of treatment and the nature of the molecules have led to conclusions that cannot be extended to women in their fifties, at the onset of their menopause which is the usual age of MHT initiation. The molecules, which are used in France, 17-beta estradiol and natural progesterone (or its isomer, dydrogesterone) are very different from the equine conjugated estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate used in the WHI. It can now be stated that if MHT is started within the window of opportunity (i.e. before the age of 60 or within the first 10years after the beginning of menopause) no deleterious effect on cognition is observed. Moreover, cognition remains relatively stable at the beginning of menopause since the cognitive reserve as well as the different compensation circuits allow compensation for estrogen deficiency. This does not in any way prejudge a possible positive effect of MHT on AD, which is very difficult to demonstrate, as the age of onset of this dementia is very late, 20 or 30years after the initiation of treatment.
