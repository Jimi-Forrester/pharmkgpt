35719711|a|Background: Sensory impairments and cognitive impairment are increasing in scope due to the aging population. Objective: To investigate the association between hearing impairment, vision impairment, and dual sensory impairment with cognitive impairment among older adults. Methods: Secondary analysis of a combination of ten consecutive waves (2008-2017) of the nationally representative American Community Survey. The sample included 5.4 million community-dwelling and institutionalized older adults aged 65 and older. Bivariate and logistic regression models were conducted to examine the association hearing impairment, vision impairment, and dual sensory impairment with cognitive impairment. Results: After controlling for age, race, education, and income, older adults with only hearing impairment had more than double the odds of cognitive impairment (OR = 2.66, 95% CI = 2.64, 2.68), while older adults with only vision impairment had more than triple the odds of cognitive impairment (OR = 3.63; 95% CI = 3.59, 3.67). For older adults with dual sensory impairment, the odds of cognitive impairment were eight-fold (OR = 8.16; 95% CI = 8.07, 8.25). Similar trends were apparent in each sex and age cohort. Conclusion: Hearing and vision impairment are both independently associated with cognitive impairment. However, dual sensory impairment is associated with substantially higher odds of cognitive impairment, even after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. Practitioners working with older adults may consider treatment for sensory impairments and cognitive impairment concurrently. Future research is needed to determine if the association is causal, and to investigate the effectiveness of common methods of treatment for sensory impairment for reducing the prevalence of cognitive impairment.
