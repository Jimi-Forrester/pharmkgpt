26379476|a|Clinical and basic experimental evidence indicates that chronic inflammation is the greatest factor in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) progression, which is the most common cause of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS). The use of anti-inflammatory agents such as steroids, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and phytotherapics have been investigated as forms of treatment for various prostate diseases. Recent evidence has demonstrated that PDE5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) improve symptoms of BPH/LUTS, possibly as a result of the relaxing of the smooth muscle fibers of the bladder and prostate by NO/cGMPc signaling, or by improving RhoA/Rho-kinase (ROCK), and reduction of the hyperactivity of the autonomic nervous system. However, some results have suggested that besides vasodilatation and their anti-proliferative effect, PDE5Is exert a direct anti-inflammatory effect, by raising cGMP. Given that inflammation is major factor in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) progression, PDE5Is could act also restore prostatic function as they act as potent anti-inflammatory drugs. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors to treat prostatic inflammation.
