36676778|t|Asymptomatic Esophageal Necrosis in a Patient with Recent COVID-19: The First Case Diagnosed through Autopsy.
36676778|a|Acute esophageal necrosis is a rare condition, characterized by a distinctive endoscopic/necropsic image-circumferential black area of the esophagus. This paper presents a case of a 78-year-old patient with recent history of a severe form of COVID-19 (2 months previously), with multiple comorbidities, which presents sudden death in hospital. Anatomic-pathological autopsy showed extensive esophageal necrosis, pulmonary thromboses, and coronarian and aortic atherosclerosis. The histopathological examination revealed necrosis of the esophageal mucosa and phlegmonous inflammation extended to the mediastinum, chronic pneumonia with pulmonary fibrosis, viral myocarditis, papillary muscle necrosis, and pericoronary neuritis. Thromboses and necroses were identified also in the liver, pancreas, and adrenal glands. Post-COVID-19 thromboses can manifest late, affecting various vascular territories, including esophageal ones. Their clinical picture may be diminished or absent in elderly and/or diabetic patients.
