38186336|t|Serum vitamin C levels and their correlation with chronic kidney disease in adults: a nationwide study.
38186336|a|INTRODUCTION: Inflammation and oxidative stress play significant roles in the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Given the recognized antioxidant properties of vitamin C, our study aimed to explore the correlation between CKD and serum vitamin C levels. METHODS: Data were gathered from the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants below 18 years of age, pregnant individuals, those lacking essential data for CKD diagnosis, or individuals with incomplete serum vitamin C data were excluded. Subgroup and weighted multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the potential correlation between serum vitamin C and CKD. RESULTS: Our study comprised 4969 participants, revealing an overall CKD prevalence of 15.0%. The results indicated that individuals with reduced serum vitamin C levels were more likely to be male, possess lower educational attainment, have a diminished poverty-income ratio, engage in heavy drinking, and be current smokers. Additionally, they exhibited a higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes. Significantly, participants in the third quartile group experienced a 37.0%, 47.0%, and 46.6% decrease in the risk of developing albuminuria, low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and CKD, respectively. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that individuals between 65 and 80 years of age showed a statistically reduced risk of developing CKD and low eGFR when their serum vitamin C levels fell in the third and fourth quartile groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a correlation between elevated serum vitamin C levels and a decreased risk of developing albuminuria, low eGFR, and CKD. Appropriately increasing serum vitamin C levels may hold promise in protecting renal function, particularly among older individuals.
