37593599|t|EEG-derived pain threshold index-guided versus standard care during propofol-remifentanil anesthesia: A randomized controlled trial.
37593599|a|Purpose: The pain threshold index (PTI), a novel index of nociception based on spontaneous EEG wavelet analysis, has been reported to provide reliable accuracy for predicting postoperative pain and hemodynamic reactivity. The present study is aimed to investigate whether PTI-guided analgesia reduces the pain intensity and rate of remedial analgesia in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Methods: A total of 122 females undergoing elective gynecologic surgeries had been randomized to receive either PTI-guided analgesia (PTI group) or standard clinical care (control group). Remifentanil administration in the PTI group was guided by PTI to maintain the value between 40 and 65, while that in the control group was guided by hemodynamic changes. The primary outcome was remedial analgesia rate in the PACU. The postoperative pain scores, intraoperative remifentanil requirements, opioid-related adverse events and perioperative serum stress hormone concentrations between the two groups were also compared. Findings: It was found that 23 of 58 patients (40%) in the control group and 8 of 58 patients (14%) in the PTI group needed remedial analgesia. The relative risk of receiving remedial analgesia was 2.88 (95% CI, 1.40-5.89, P = 0.002) in the control group. Sufentanil consumption in the PACU (mug) was lower in the PTI group (P = 0.002) than in the control group. Remifentanil and propofol consumption, opioid-related adverse events between these two groups were comparable. Implications: PTI-guided analgesia during gynaecologic operations resulted in 25.87% less remedial analgesia. However, studies with different PTI thresholds and larger, more diverse populations should be conducted to further demonstrate the clinical effectiveness of PTI.
