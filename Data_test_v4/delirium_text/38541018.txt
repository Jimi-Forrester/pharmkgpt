38541018|t|Remimazolam for Procedural Sedation in Older Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis with Trial Sequential Analysis.
38541018|a|This systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis (TSA) aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remimazolam compared to other sedatives for procedural sedation in older patients. We registered the protocol of this systematic review and meta-analysis with TSA in the PROSPERO network (CRD42023441209). Two investigators performed a systematic, comprehensive, and independent search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing remimazolam with other sedatives in older patients undergoing procedural sedation. Conventional meta-analysis and TSA were also performed. Seven RCTs (1502 patients) were included. Pooled results demonstrated that remimazolam was associated with a low incidence of hypoxemia, hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, and injection pain. Remimazolam also required a long time to cause loss of consciousness. There were no differences in rates of sedation success, dizziness/headache, postoperative nausea and vomiting, or recovery time. Older patients receiving procedural sedation with remimazolam had a lower risk of hypoxemia, hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, and injection pain than those receiving other sedatives, suggesting that remimazolam may be more suitable for procedural sedation in older patients.
