37493290|t|[Prevention of delirium in the Intensive Care Unit].
37493290|a|Delirium is highly prevalent in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and is strongly associated with negative patient outcomes. We aimed to present an overview of the effectiveness of non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to prevent delirium in ICU patients. Multicomponent non-pharmacological interventions are proven effective in the prevention of delirium. These interventions are aimed at multiple domains, including re-orientation, providing a safe and healing environment, cognitive stimulation, mobilization and family engagement. A special type of multicomponent intervention is the ''A-F bundle'', comprising both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions. Multicomponent non-pharmacological interventions and the ''A-F bundle'' are recommended. There is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of pharmacological prophylaxis using antipsychotics, dexmedetomidine, melatonin or thiamin, except for delirium due to substance withdrawal. Therefore, pharmacological interventions should be aimed at minimizing delirogenousmedication (especially benzodiazepines and opiates), adequate pain management and the prevention of deep and continuous sedation.
