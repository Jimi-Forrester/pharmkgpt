35918298|t|Atypical Presentation of Pill Aspiration in Older Adults with Dysphagia: A Picture Not To Be Forgotten.
35918298|a|Nonconventional clinical presentations of diseases are common in older adults. Even dramatic events, such as foreign body (FB) inhalation, can occur in a subtle and non-specific manner. Pill aspiration is a rare yet overlooked cause of airway injury. It accounts for approximately 7% of all FB aspirations. In contrast, oral dysphagia and polypharmacology, mainly administrated in solid oral dosage forms (SDOF), like tablets and pills, are common conditions in older adults. Herein, we present a case of SDOF aspiration in a 78-year-old man. FB inhalation developed with general clinical deterioration and neurological impairment (delirium) rather than overt respiratory symptoms. Bronchoscopy provided remarkable images of this unexpected finding. Caregivers and healthcare workers must be aware of the risk of SDOF aspiration and adopt proper safety measures. Early recognition and bronchoscopy for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes can be lifesaving in such cases.
