30606722|t|Burden and impact of multifactorial geriatric syndromes in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for older adults.
30606722|a|Multifactorial geriatric syndromes are highly prevalent in older patients with cancer. Because an increasing number of older patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT), we examined the incidence and impact of transplant-related geriatric syndromes using our institutional database and electronic medical records. We identified 527 patients age 60 years or older who had undergone first allo-HCT from 2001 to 2016 for hematologic malignancies. From the initiation of conditioning to 100 days posttransplant, new geriatric syndromes were predominantly delirium with a cumulative incidence of 21% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18%-25%) at day 100 followed by fall at 7% (95% CI, 5%-9%). In multivariable analyses of available pretransplant variables, fall within the last year, potentially inappropriate use of medication, thrombocytopenia, and reduced creatinine clearance were significantly associated with delirium; age older than 70 years and impaired activities of daily living were significantly associated with fall. In the 100-day landmark analysis, both delirium (hazard ratio [HR], 1.66; 95% CI, 1.09-2.52; P = .023) and fall (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.16-3.95; P = .026) were significantly associated with increased nonrelapse mortality; moreover, fall (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.18-3.14; P = .016), but not delirium, was significantly associated with reduced overall survival. Here, we establish baseline incidences and risk factors of common transplant-related geriatric syndromes. Importantly, we demonstrate significant associations of delirium and fall with inferior transplant outcomes. The burden and impact of transplant-related geriatric syndromes warrant the institution of patient-centered, preemptive, longitudinal, and multidisciplinary interventions to improve outcomes for older allo-HCT patients.
