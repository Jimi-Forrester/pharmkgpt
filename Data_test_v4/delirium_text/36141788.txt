36141788|t|Psychological Stress Triggers a Hyperammonemia Episode in Patient with Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency.
36141788|a|An 18-year-old male motorcycle racer, who was a participant in the FIM Road Racing World Championship and had a history of Ornithine Transcarbamylase deficiency, developed nausea and dizziness while driving his motorcycle and became unconscious right after he stopped at the box. He was rapidly attended to by the medical personnel of the circuit, and once he recovered consciousness, he was taken to the local hospital where the blood analysis showed hyperammonemia (307 mug/dL) and excess alkalosis. The patient was properly following the prescribed treatment, and there were no environmental stressors. Hence, psychological stress and its somatization due to the risky task that the patient was performing could have triggered the episode. Stress must be considered as a potential cause, triggering strenuous metabolic stress that leads to hyperammonemia.
