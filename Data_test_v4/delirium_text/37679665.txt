37679665|t|Nasal splinting and mouth breathing training reduce emergence delirium after endoscopic sinus surgery: a randomized controlled trial.
37679665|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence delirium (ED) is generally occurred after anesthesia associated with increased risks of long-term adverse outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of preconditioning with nasal splint and mouth-breathing training on prevention of ED after general anesthesia. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial enrolled 200 adult patients undergoing ESS. Patients were randomized to receive either nasal splinting and mouth breathing training (n = 100) or standard care (n = 100) before surgery. The primary outcome was the occurrence of ED within 30 min of extubation, assessed using the Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale. Logistic regression identified risk factors for ED. RESULTS: Totally 200 patients were randomized and 182 aged from 18 to 82 years with 59.9% of males were included in the final analysis (90 in C-group and 92 in P-group). ED occurred in 16.3% of the intervention group vs. 35.6% of controls (P = 0.004). Male sex, smoking and function endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) were independent risk factors for ED. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative nasal splinting and mouth breathing training significantly reduced the incidence of emergence delirium in patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery.
