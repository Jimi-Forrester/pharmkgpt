34839889|t|Current Concepts in the Management of Periodontitis.
34839889|a|Periodontitis is a common disorder affecting >40% of adults in the United States. Globally, the severe form of the disease has a prevalence of 11%. In advanced cases, periodontitis leads to tooth loss and reduced quality of life. The aetiology of periodontitis is multifactorial. Subgingival dental biofilm elicits a host inflammatory and immune response, ultimately leading to irreversible destruction of the periodontium (i.e. alveolar bone and periodontal ligament) in a susceptible host. In order to successfully manage periodontitis, dental professionals must understand the pathogenesis, primary aetiology, risk factors, contributing factors and treatment protocols. Careful diagnosis, elimination of the causes and reduction of modifiable risk factors are paramount for successful prevention and treatment of periodontitis. Initial non-surgical periodontal therapy primarily consists of home care review and scaling and root planing. For residual sites with active periodontitis at periodontal re-evaluation, a contemporary regenerative or traditional resective surgical therapy can be utilised. Thereafter, periodontal maintenance therapy at a regular interval and long-term follow-ups are also crucial to the success of the treatment and long-term retention of teeth. The aim of this review is to provide current concepts of diagnosis, prevention and treatment of periodontitis. Both clinical and biological rationales will be discussed.
