8208407|a|Previous work suggested a deficiency in the terminal complex of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, cytochrome c oxidase (COX), in platelet mitochondria of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The present study extends this observation to AD brain mitochondria through assay of electron transport chain activities in mitochondria isolated from autopsied brain samples from AD patients (n = 9) and from controls with and without known neurologic disease (n = 8). AD brain mitochondria demonstrated a generalized depression of activity of all electron transport chain complexes. This depression was most marked in COX activity (p < 0.001). Concentrations of cytochromes b, c1, and aa3 were similar in AD and controls. The electron transport chain is defective in AD brain, and the defect centers about COX.
