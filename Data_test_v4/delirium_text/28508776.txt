28508776|t|Development and Validation of a Multivariable Prediction Model for the Occurrence of Delirium in Hospitalized Gerontopsychiatry and Internal Medicine Patients.
28508776|a|Delirium is an acute confusion condition, which is common in elderly and often misdiagnosed in hospitalized patients. Early identification and prevention of delirium could reduce morbidity and mortality rates in those affected and reduce hospitalization costs. We have developed and validated a multivariate prediction model that predicts delirium and gives an early warning to physicians. A large set of patient electronic medical records have been used in developing the models. Classical learning algorithms have been used to develop the models and compared the results. Excellent results were obtained with the feature set and parameter settings attaining accuracy of 84%.
