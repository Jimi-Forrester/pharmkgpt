The goal of the current study was to examine all of the trends being investigated in the area of oral and maxillofacial pathology where AI has been possibly involved in helping practitioners. METHODS: We started by defining the important terms in our investigation's subject matter. Following that, relevant databases like PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched using keywords and synonyms for each concept, such as "machine learning," "diagnosis," "treatment planning," "image analysis," "predictive modelling," and "patient monitoring." For more papers and sources, Google Scholar was also used. RESULTS: The majority of the 9 studies that were chosen were on how AI can be utilized to diagnose malignant tumors of the oral cavity. AI was especially helpful in creating prediction models that aided pathologists and clinicians in foreseeing the development of oral and maxillofacial pathology in specific patients. Additionally, predictive models accurately identified patients who have a high risk of developing oral cancer as well as the likelihood of the disease returning after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In the field of oral and maxillofacial pathology, AI has the potential to enhance diagnostic precision, personalize care, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. The development and application of AI in healthcare, however, necessitates careful consideration of ethical, legal, and regulatory challenges. Additionally, because AI is still a relatively new technology, caution must be taken when applying it to this industry.
