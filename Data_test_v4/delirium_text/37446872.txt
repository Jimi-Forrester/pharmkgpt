37446872|t|Glycosides as Potential Medicinal Components for Ulcerative Colitis: A Review.
37446872|a|Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, non-specific disease of unknown etiology. The disease develops mainly in the rectum or colon, and the main clinical symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and purulent bloody stools, with a wide variation in severity. The specific causative factors and pathogenesis of the disease are not yet clear, but most scholars believe that the disease is caused by the interaction of genetic, environmental, infectious, immune, and intestinal flora factors. As for the treatment of UC, medications are commonly used in clinical practice, mainly including aminosalicylates, glucocorticoids, and immunosuppressive drugs. However, due to the many complications associated with conventional drug therapy and the tendency for UC to recur, there is an urgent need to discover new, safer, and more effective drugs. Natural compounds with biodiversity and chemical structure diversity from medicinal plants are the most reliable source for the development of new drug precursors. Evidence suggests that glycosides may reduce the development and progression of UC by modulating anti-inflammatory responses, inhibiting oxidative stress, suppressing abnormal immune responses, and regulating signal transduction. In this manuscript, we provide a review of the epidemiology of UC and the available drugs for disease prevention and treatment. In addition, we demonstrate the protective or therapeutic role of glycosides in UC and describe the possible mechanisms of action to provide a theoretical basis for preclinical studies in drug development.
