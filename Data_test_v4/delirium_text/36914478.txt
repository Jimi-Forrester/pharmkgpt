36914478|t|Associations between self-reported sleep quality and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
36914478|a|Sleep disorders are very common in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several parameters of polysomnography seem to correlate with cognitive scores and amyloid biomarkers in the different stages of AD. However, there is limited evidence for the relationship between self-reported sleep impairment and disease biomarkers. In this study, we assessed the relationship between self-reported sleep complaints, with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and both cognitive function and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in 70 patients with MCI and 78 patients with AD. Sleep duration and daytime dysfunction were higher in AD. Daytime dysfunction had a negative correlation with cognitive scores (Mini-Mental-State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and with amyloid-beta1-42 protein, and a positive correlation with total tau protein. However, daytime dysfunction was an independent predictor only of t-tau values (F=57.162; 95% CI: [18.118; 96.207], P=0.004). These findings support a relationship between daytime dysfunction, cognitive scores and neurodegeneration, further expanding recent findings that it may signal a risk of dementia.
