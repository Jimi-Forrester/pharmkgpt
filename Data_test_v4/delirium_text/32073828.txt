32073828|t|Multiplex Protein Imaging with Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry Using Metal Oxide Nanoparticle-Conjugated Antibodies.
32073828|a|In spite of recent developments in mass spectrometry imaging techniques, high-resolution multiplex protein bioimaging techniques are required to unveil the complex inter- and intracellular biomolecular interactions for accurate understanding of life phenomena and disease mechanisms. Herein, we report multiplex protein imaging with secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) using metal oxide nanoparticle (MONP)-conjugated antibodies with <300 nm spatial resolution in the low ion dose without ion beam damage because of the high secondary ion yields of the MONPs, which can provide simultaneous imaging of several proteins, especially from cell membranes. We applied our new imaging technique for the study of hippocampal tissue samples from control and Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice; the proximity of protein clusters in the hippocampus CA1 region showed intriguing dependence on aging and AD progress, suggesting that protein cluster proximity may be helpful for understanding pathological pathways in the microscopic cellular level.
