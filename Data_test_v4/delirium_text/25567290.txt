25567290|a|The beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) are thought to play a critical role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. One therapeutic strategy aimed to reduce or eliminate the production of Abeta peptides is inhibition of the gamma-secretase enzyme, which cleaves amyloid precursor protein to form Abeta peptides. We studied the in vivo effects of the potent, orally bioavailable and brain penetrant gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI), MRK-560, on both Abetax-40 and Abetax-42 in multiple compartments (plasma, the brain and cerebrospinal fluid) of rat. Although there were differences in the time course and magnitude of the changes, the results showed that MRK-560 caused marked inhibition of both Abetax-40 and Abetax-42 in all three compartments. We identified good correlations between plasma Abetax-40 versus brain Abetax-40 (r = 0.84), and plasma Abetax-40 versus CSF Abetax-40 (r = 0.85), indicating that these pools of Abeta are related dynamically. These results suggest that central Abeta changes that occur following acute dosing with MRK-560 can be predicted based on plasma Abeta changes and could thus serve as a useful biomarker to help accelerate decision-making during early clinical development.
