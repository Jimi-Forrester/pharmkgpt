36212969|t|Pharmacological Potential of the Standardized Methanolic Extract of Prunus armeniaca L. in the Haloperidol-Induced Parkinsonism Rat Model.
36212969|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex, age-related neurodegenerative disease that causes neuronal loss and dysfunction over time. An imbalance of redox potential of oxidative stress in the cell causes neurodegenerative diseases and dysfunction of neurons. Plants are a rich source of bioactive substances that attenuate oxidative stress in a variety of neurological disorders. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the Prunus armeniaca L. methanolic extract (PAME) for anti-Parkinson activity in rats. PD was induced with haloperidol (1 mg/kg, IP). The PAME was administered orally at 100, 300, and 800 mg/kg dose levels for 21 days. Behavioral studies (catalepsy test, hang test, open-field test, narrow beam walk, and hole-board test), oxidative stress biomarkers (SOD, CAT, GSH, and MDA) levels, neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline) levels, and acetylcholinesterase activity were quantified in the brain homogenate. Liver function tests (LFTs), renal function tests (RFTs), complete blood count (CBC), and lipid profiles were measured in the blood/serum samples to note the side effects of PAME at the selected doses. Histopathological analysis was performed on the brain (anti-PD study), liver, heart, and kidney (to check the toxicity of PAME on these vital organs). Motor functions were improved in the behavioral studies. Dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline levels were significantly increased (P < 0.001), whereas the level of acetylcholinesterase was decreased significantly (P < 0.001). The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and reduced glutathione (GSH) were increased, while malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrite levels were decreased in the PAME-treated groups significantly compared with the disease control group, hence reducing oxidative stress. The incidence of toxicity was determined by biochemical analysis of LFT and RFT biomarkers testing. The histopathological analysis indicated that neurofibrillary tangles and plaques decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the PAME-treated groups. Based on the data, it is concluded that PAME possessed good anti-Parkinson activity, rationalizing the plant's traditional use as a neuroprotective agent.
