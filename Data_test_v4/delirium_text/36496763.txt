36496763|a|This study evaluated the effects of palm kernel oil (PKO) in the diet of lambs on carcass characteristics, quality, and fatty acid profile of the meat. Forty uncastrated male Santa Ines lambs were used and divided among the treatments: PKOzero without inclusion; PKO1.3:added 1.3%; PKO2.6:added 2.6%; PKO3.9:added 3.9%; PKO5.2:added 5.2%. The carcass characteristics, the variables related to meat color, and the chemical composition of the Longissimus lumborum of lambs were not affected by the PKO inclusion. The weight of the carcasses at slaughter, hot and cold, half carcass, loin-eye area, and commercial cuts decreased linearly when PKO was added to the lamb diet (p < 0.01). CCY decreased linearly to the inclusion level of 2.66% PKO (RMSE 2.204). Total conjugated linoleic acid CLA and C18:3 n-3 GA concentrations remained stable until the inclusion levels of 3.44% PKO (RMSE 0.0956) and 2.17% (RMSE 0.0637), decreasing its concentrations as the increased level of PKO. The presence of PKO in the lambs' diet up to the level of 5.2% did not change the meat quality characteristics; thus, from the point of view of lamb meat production and fatty acid profile, the inclusion of PKO is not beneficial.
