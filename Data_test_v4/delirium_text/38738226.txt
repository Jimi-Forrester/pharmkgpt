38738226|t|Health-related quality of life after minimal-invasive treatment of aortic valve stenosis in the elderly.
38738226|a|Background: Although transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI) offers superior early outcome over open surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in the elderly, a comparison of TF-TAVI with surgery performed through partial upper mini sternotomy (PUMS) hasn't yet been validated. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the clinical outcome and quality of life of patients subjected to TF-TAVI and open surgical aortic valve replacement through partial upper mini sternotomy (PUMS-SAVR). Methods: Baseline, procedural and post-treatment data of 197 consecutive patients: 137 TF-TAVI and 60 PUMS-SAVR treated at Philipps University of Marburg, were retrospectively collected. The propensity score method was used to create two groups in a 1:1 fashion. Questionnaire assessment (SF36_LQ) of quality of life of the matched patients was carried out at the ambulant routine control presentation. A competing risk regression model is used to evaluate the impact of the clinical outcome on health-related quality of life (HrQoL). Results: After propensity matching, TF-TAVI remained associated with lower procedural time (136+-50 vs. 298+-36 min, P<0.01), intensive care unit stay (2.68+-2.70 vs. 4.29+-2.43 days, P<0.01), transfusion of packed red cell units (0.46+-2.05 vs. 1.60+-2.00 U, P=0.02) and higher heart block (42.86% vs. 0%, P<0.01) and permanent pacemaker implantation rates (14.29% vs. 0%, P=0.05) compared to PUMS-SAVR. TF-TAVI is associated with less complains, superior HrQoL (excellent 40% and very good 60% vs. very good 100% in PUMS). Partial sternotomy is the main predictor of the inferior HrQoL, with the regression coefficient of -1.11 (95% confidential interval, -1.503 to -0.726; R2=0.324, P<0.0001). Transfusion (P=0.26), paravalvular leakage (0.618), pacemaker implantation (P=0.19) and delirium (P=0.92) did not influence HrQoL after the minimal-invasive treatment of aortic valve stenosis in elderly patients. Conclusions: Although PUMS-SAVR offers better technical outcomes with less permanent pacemaker implantation and less paravalvular leakage than TF-TAVI, it is still associated with more need for transfusion, longer ventilation-and intensive care unit-times, and prolonged hospital stay. In the elderly, PUMS-SAVR achieves inferior quality of life compared to TF-TAVI. Partial sternotomy reveals as the strongest risk factor of perceived health-level post-treatment. It remains to be revealed whether fast-track open heart surgery that maintains a fully intact sternum and allows immediate postoperative extubation-as performed through video-assisted mini-thoracotomy or thoracoscopic robotic procedures with percutaneous cannulation - should be favored against PUMS-SAVR.
