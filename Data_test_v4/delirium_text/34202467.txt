34202467|t|The Role of Cholesterol in Amyloidogenic Substrate Binding to the gamma-Secretase Complex.
34202467|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder and is characterized by the presence of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques in the brain. The gamma-secretase complex, which produces Abeta, is an intramembrane-cleaving protease consisting of four membrane proteins. In this paper we investigated the amyloidogenic fragments of amyloid precursor protein (substrates Abeta43 and Abeta45, leading to less amyloidogenic Abeta40 and more amyloidogenic Abeta42, respectively) docked to the binding site of presenilin, the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase. In total, we performed 9 mus of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the whole gamma-secretase complex with both substrates in low (10%) and high (50%) concentrations of cholesterol in the membrane. We found that, at the high cholesterol level, the Abeta45 helix was statistically more flexible in the binding site of presenilin than Abeta43. An increase in the cholesterol concentration was also correlated with a higher flexibility of the Abeta45 helix, which suggests incompatibility between Abeta45 and the binding site of presenilin potentiated by a high cholesterol level. However, at the C-terminal part of Abeta45, the active site of presenilin was more compact in the case of a high cholesterol level, which could promote processing of this substrate. We also performed detailed mapping of the cholesterol binding sites at low and high cholesterol concentrations, which were independent of the typical cholesterol binding motifs.
