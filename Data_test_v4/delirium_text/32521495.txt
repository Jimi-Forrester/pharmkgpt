32521495|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that affects over 47 million people worldwide, and is the most common form of dementia. There is a vast body of literature demonstrating that the disease is caused by an accumulation of toxic extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles that consist of hyperphosphorylated tau. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been shown to reduce the incidence of AD and the phenolic compounds in extra virgin olive oil, including oleocanthal, have gained a significant amount of attention. A large number of these ligands have been described in the pre-existing literature and 222 of these compounds have been characterised in the OliveNet  database. In this study, molecular docking was used to screen the 222 phenolic compounds from the OliveNet  database and assess their ability to bind to various forms of the Abeta and tau proteins. The phenolic ligands were found to be binding strongly to the hairpin-turn of the Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 monomers, and binding sites were also identified in the tau fibril protein structures. Luteolin-4'-O-rutinoside, oleuricine A, isorhoifolin, luteolin-7-O-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside and luteolin-7,4-O-diglucoside were predicted to be novel lead compounds. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed using well-known olive ligands bound to Abeta1-42 oligomers highlighted that future work may examine potential anti-aggregating properties of novel compounds in the OliveNet  database. This may lead to the development and evaluation of new compounds that may have efficacy against Alzheimer's disease.
