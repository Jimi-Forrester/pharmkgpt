24408078|a|PURPOSE: To examine the usefulness of the early phase [(11)C]BF-227 positron emission tomography (PET) for (1) conferring additional diagnostic value by providing perfusion-like information and (2) obtaining the appropriate anatomical standardization (AS) using three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection (3D-SSP) method. METHODS: This study included 20 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 19 Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 17 normal cognitive (NC) subjects. Early- and late-phase BF-227 PET images were obtained 0-10 and 40-60 min after the injection, respectively. AS for late-phase BF-227 images were performed by 2 methods: (1) method A, for AS of late-phase BF-227 images using (8)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) images of the same subject and (2) method B, for AS of late-phase BF-227 images using early phase BF-227 images. RESULTS: Method B was successfully used for AS in all cases. The Z score maps of 3D-SSP analyses of FDG PET and early phase BF-227 PET for AD and MCI groups showed a typical AD-like pattern. Regional analyses revealed that the early phase BF-227 PET showed significant differences between AD and NC, and MCI and NC. CONCLUSION: The early phase BF-227 PET images showed significant abnormal findings for the AD and MCI groups. AS of late-phase BF-227 images using early phase BF-227 images were successful, and enabled appropriate 3D-SSP analyses.
