27190632|a|BACKGROUND: We formulated mianserin suppositories for the treatment of delirium and evaluated their pharmacokinetics by measuring plasma drug concentrations in dogs and healthy human volunteers. METHODS: Mianserin suppositories were prepared by a melting technique using Tetramide  tablets and Witepsol H-15 as the suppository base. Pharmacokinetics of this 30-mg mianserin preparation were evaluated in three beagle dogs and three healthy adult males, in line with ethics committee approval. Plasma mianserin levels were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: In dogs, the maximum plasma mianserin concentration (Cmax) was 1.3 +- 0.4 ng/mL, the time to Cmax (tmax) was 5.5 +- 4.3 h, and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24) was 18.9 +- 1.9 h ng/mL. In humans, the Cmax was 14.6 +- 6.3 ng/mL, the tmax was 8 h, and the AUC0-24 was 266 +- 103 h ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The current study characterized the pharmacokinetics of mianserin suppositories in dogs and humans. As compared to oral administration, the suppositories produced a lower Cmax and a delayed tmax, although AUC0-24 values were comparable. It will be necessary to identify an appropriate dose that produces an adequate plasma mianserin concentration for effective and safe clinical use. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000013853.
