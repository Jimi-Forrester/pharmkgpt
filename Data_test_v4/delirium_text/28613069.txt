28613069|t|Molybdenum Disulfide Nanoparticles as Multifunctional Inhibitors against Alzheimer's Disease.
28613069|a|The complex pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include the aggregation of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) into oligomers or fibrils as well as Abeta-mediated oxidative stress, which require comprehensive treatment. Therefore, the inhibition of Abeta aggregation and free-radical scavenging are essential for the treatment of AD. Nanoparticles (NPs) have been found to influence Abeta aggregation process in vitro. Herein, we report the inhibition effects of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) NPs on Abeta aggregation. Polyvinylpyrrolidone-functionalized MoS2 NPs were fabricated by a pulsed laser ablation method. We find that MoS2 NPs exhibit multifunctional effects on Abeta peptides: inhibiting Abeta aggregation, destabilizing Abeta fibrils, alleviating Abeta-induced oxidative stress, as well as Abeta-mediated cell toxicity. Moreover, we show that MoS2 NPs can block the formation of the Ca2+ channel induced by Abeta fibrils in the cell membrane for the first time. Thus, these observations suggest that MoS2 NPs have great potential for a multifunctional therapeutic agent against amyloid-related diseases.
