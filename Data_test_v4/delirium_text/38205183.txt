38205183|t|Metal nanoparticles as inhibitors of enzymes and toxins of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
38205183|a|Staphylococcus aureus is an aerobic Gram-positive spherical bacterium known to cause a broad range of infections worldwide. It is a major cause of infective skin and soft infections and severe and life-threatening conditions, such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and endocarditis. The emergence of drug-resistant strains of S aureus, particularly methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA), has become a significant concern in the healthcare community. Antibiotic-resistant S aureus is commonly acquired in hospitals and long-term care facilities. It often affects patients with weakened immune systems, those undergoing invasive medical procedures, or those who have been hospitalized for extended periods. In the US, S aureus is known to cause potentially fatal illnesses, such as toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and acute-onset toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which are characterized by fever and hypotension. It develops resistance to antibiotics through several mechanisms, such as the production of enzymes that inactivate antibiotics, target site modification, efflux pumps, and plasmid-mediated resistance. Therefore, preventing the spread of drug-resistant S aureus is needed, and there is an urgent need to explore novel approaches in the development of anti-staphylococcal agents. This article reviews the principal infections caused by S aureus, major virulence factors, mechanisms of resistance development, and nanotechnology-based solutions for the control of drug-resistant S aureus.
