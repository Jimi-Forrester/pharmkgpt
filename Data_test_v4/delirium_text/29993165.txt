29993165|a|This case report describes a Japanese man who presented with slowly progressive memory disturbances that began at the age of 79 years. The man also displayed conspicuous behaviour and psychological symptoms in the early stage of dementia. Computed tomography revealed atrophy of the amygdala and severe hippocampal deterioration, particularly in the anterior portion. Lateral ventricular dilatation, mainly affecting the anterior and inferior horns, was also observed. Interestingly, cerebral neocortical atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes was considerably mild for the patient's age. Apolipoprotein E gene analysis showed epsilon 3 homozygosity. The patient died at the age of 96 years, and his clinical diagnosis was Alzheimer's disease with severe behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. In addition to indicating considerable hippocampal atrophy, an autopsy revealed numerous neurofibrillary tangles and argyrophilic grains in the brain, as well as extensive senile plaques. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy was also recognized. The pathological findings were suggestive of both Alzheimer's disease and argyrophilic grain dementia; other neurodegenerative disorders were not apparent. The clinicopathologic findings of the present case suggest significant consideration should be made when determining the clinical diagnosis and pathogenesis of senile dementia.
