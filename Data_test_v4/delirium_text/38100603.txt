38100603|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between hospitalization and the occurrence of delirium in older adults with physical frailty. METHOD: Cross-sectional study carried out in a public hospital in southern Brazil. Hospitalized older adults aged >= 60 years participated. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected, physical frailty phenotype tests were performed and the Confusion Assessment Method was used. Descriptive analyzes were carried out and odds ratio values were estimated for the frailty and delirium variables. RESULTS: Of the 320 older adults evaluated, 21.14% presented delirium, 49% were identified as pre-frail and 36.2% as frail. Of those affected by delirium, 71.6% were classified as frail and 28.3% as pre-frail (p < 0.001). An association was observed between the occurrence of delirium and frailty (OR 1.22; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.38), age >= 80 years (OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.32), epilepsy (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.76), dementia (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.37 to 1.82), and history of stroke (OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.26). CONCLUSION: There was a high frequency of pre-frail and frail older adults, and the occurrence of delirium in frail was significantly higher. Special attention should be paid to frail older adults to prevent the occurrence of delirium during hospitalization.
