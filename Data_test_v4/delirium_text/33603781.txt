33603781|a|Background: Diabetes-associated cognitive decline (DACD) is one of the nervous system dysfunctions induced by diabetes mellitus with cognitive impairment as the major symptom. In a previous preliminary proteomic study, we found that endoplasmic reticulum processing and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway might be impaired in DACD pathogenesis. In addition, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 might be a crucial protein as a molecular target of the neuroprotective effects of ZiBuPiYin recipe (ZBPYR). Methods: In this study, 6-8 weeks aged db/db mice were treated with excipients or ZBPYR for 6 weeks. Body weight and RBG were recorded weekly. Oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests were used to assess insulin sensitivity. Morris water maze (MWM) tests were used to assess memory function. The expression of Grb2, Gab2, Akt, and GSK3beta in mouse hippocampus and cerebral cortex were analyzed by Western blotting. Results: ZBPYR not only significantly reduced RGB and improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, but also improved spatial cognition in DACD mice. The expression of Grb2 and Gab2 in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of db/db mice was upregulated after treated with ZBPYR, and then affected the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and inhibited GSK3beta overactivity. Conclusions: This study showed that ZBPYR could enhance the memory and learning ability of db/db mice. Such neuroprotective effect might be related to the activation of Grb2-PI3K/Akt signaling which might provide a novel therapeutic target for the clinical treatment of DACD.
