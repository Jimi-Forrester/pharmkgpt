15002344|a|The effects of repetitive work on Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient functioning were examined when nine veterans were moved from a work program to a traditional adult day care program. Subjects were reassessed four months after the move with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Cognitive Performance Test (CPT), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Individual slopes were calculated for seven subjects who had longitudinal scores, and expected scores were predicted based on the rate of decline. Observed scores at reassessment were significantly lower than expected scores. The MMSE was on average 4.9 points lower, and the CPT .64 points lower than expected. The GDS did not change. The spouses of all nine patients reported declines in daily living activities. Compared to traditional day care activities, work activities involve sequencing skills and practice may translate to self-care activities at home.
