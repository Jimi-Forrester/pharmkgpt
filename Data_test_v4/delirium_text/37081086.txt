37081086|t|The therapeutic potential of neurofibromin signaling pathways and binding partners.
37081086|a|Neurofibromin controls many cell processes, such as growth, learning, and memory. If neurofibromin is not working properly, it can lead to health problems, including issues with the nervous, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems and cancer. This review examines neurofibromin's binding partners, signaling pathways and potential therapeutic targets. In addition, it summarizes the different post-translational modifications that can affect neurofibromin's interactions with other molecules. It is essential to investigate the molecular mechanisms that underlie neurofibromin variants in order to provide with functional connections between neurofibromin and its associated proteins for possible therapeutic targets based on its biological function.
