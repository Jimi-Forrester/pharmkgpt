36543016|a|White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) may be one of the earliest pathological changes in aging. Race differences in WMH burden has been conflicting. This study examined if race influences WMHs and whether these differences are influenced by vascular risk factors. Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants were included if they had a baseline MRI, diagnosis, and WMH measurements. Ninety-one Blacks and 1937 Whites were included. Using bootstrap re-sampling, 91 Whites were randomly sampled and matched to Blacks based on age, sex, education, and diagnosis 1000 times. Linear models examined the influence of race on baseline WMHs, and change of WMHs over time, with and without vascular factors. Vascular risk factors had higher prevalence in Blacks than Whites. When not including vascular factors, Blacks had greater frontal, parietal, deep, and total WMH burden compared to Whites. There were no race differences in longitudinal progression of WMH accumulation. After controlling for vascular factors, only overall longitudinal parietal WMH group differences remained significant, suggesting that vascular factors contribute to racial group differences observed in WMHs.
