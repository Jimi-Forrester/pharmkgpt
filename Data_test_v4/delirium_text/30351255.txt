30351255|t|Relationship between Basal Forebrain Resting-State Functional Connectivity and Brain Amyloid-beta Deposition in Cognitively Intact Older Adults with Subjective Memory Complaints.
30351255|a|Purpose To evaluate the association between the global fibrillary amyloid-beta pathology and the basal forebrain connectivity at rest in cognitively intact older adults at risk for Alzheimer disease. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the local ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of anterior and posterior basal forebrain seeds was investigated, as well as PET-measured global amyloid-beta load by using standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in 267 older cognitively intact individuals with subjective memory complaints (age range, 70-85 years; overall mean age, 75.8 years; 167 women [mean age, 75.9 years] and 100 men [mean age, 75.8 years]). The participants were from the Investigation of Alzheimer's Predictors in Subjective Memory Complainers (INSIGHT-preAD) cohort (date range, 2013-present). The relationship between SUVR and the basal forebrain RSFC was assessed, followed by the effects of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and sex on the basal forebrain RSFC. Results Higher SUVR values correlated with lower posterior basal forebrain RSFC in the hippocampus and the thalamus (Pearson r =-0.23; P <.001 corrected for familywise error [FWE]). Both sex and APOE genotype impacted the associations between basal forebrain RSFC and the global amyloid deposition (t values >3.59; P <.05 corrected for FWE). Conclusion Data indicate a distinct in vivo association between posterior basal forebrain dynamics and global fibrillary amyloid-beta pathology in cognitively intact older adults with subjective memory complaints; both apolipoprotein E and sex moderate such association.
