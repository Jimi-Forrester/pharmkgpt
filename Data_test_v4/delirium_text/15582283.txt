15582283|a|Increased life expectancy leads to increased age-associated health issues in both sexes. For menopausal women the most important of these appear to result from the severe estrogen deficiency caused by ovarian dysfunction. The consequences among others include hot flashes, osteoporosis, obesity, impaired memory, higher incidence of Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease. Ovarian function and steroidogenesis are influenced by pituitary gonadotropins, including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), whose actions are mediated through ovarian receptors. This article highlights our recent data pertinent to aging as derived from a novel genetically modified animal model [the FORKO mouse (FOllitropin Receptor KnockOut) lacking the FSH receptor. FORKO female mice experience a chronic depletion of estrogen (E2) from early development, and have phenotypes similar to aging women, with ovarian failure, obesity, skeletal changes, and ovarian tumors. A variety of findings support the conclusion that E2 deficiency in FORKO mice is responsible for their neural impairments associated with glial cell hypertrophy, region-specific brain cells loss, and abnormal behavior. Findings from mice with FSH receptor haploinsufficiency mice ('menopausal mice') are also shedding light on the molecular basis of menopausal conditions that include degeneration of the hippocampus. Many phenotypes noted in the null condition also occur in +/- females but in an age related manner. Thus, the FORKO mouse becomes an excellent model to investigate mechanisms underlying age-related changes especially when these events are accelerated, as in menopausal women. Opportunities abound to assess the potential benefits/adverse effects of hormone replacement regimen on various targets.
