37143147|a|BACKGROUND: Over the past few years, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have attracted a great deal of scientific attention owing to their promising results in the treatment of incurable diseases. However, there are several concerns about their possible side effects after direct cell transplantation, including host immune response, time-consuming cell culture procedures, and the dependence of cell quality on the donor, which limit the application of MSCs in clinical trials. On the other hand, it is well accepted that the beneficial effects of MSCs are mediated by secretome rather than cell replacement. MSC secretome refers to a variety of bioactive molecules involved in different biological processes, specifically neuro-regeneration. MAIN BODY: Due to the limited ability of the central nervous system to compensate for neuronal loss and relieve disease progress, mesenchymal stem cell products may be used as a potential cure for central nervous system disorders. In the present study, the therapeutic effects of MSC secretome were reviewed and discussed the possible mechanisms in the three most prevalent central nervous system disorders, namely Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. The current work aimed to help discover new medicine for the mentioned complications. CONCLUSION: The use of MSC-derived secretomes in the treatment of the mentioned diseases has encouraging results, so it can be considered as a treatment option for which no treatment has been introduced so far.
