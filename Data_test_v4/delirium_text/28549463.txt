28549463|t|Factors associated with length of stay following trans-catheter aortic valve replacement - a multicenter study.
28549463|a|BACKGROUND: Most patients undergoing Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR) are elderly with significant co-morbidities and there is limited information available regarding factors that influence length of stay (LOS) post-procedure. The aim of this study was to identify the patient, and procedural factors that affect post-TAVR LOS using a contemporary multinational registry. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, with patients recruited from three high volume tertiary institutions. The primary outcome was the LOS post-TAVR procedure. We examined patient and procedural factors in a cause-specific Cox multivariable regression model to elucidate their effect on LOS, accounting for the competing risk of post-procedural death. Hazard ratios (HR) greater than 1 indicate a shorter LOS, while HRs less than 1 indicate a longer LOS. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 809 patients. Patient factors associated with longer LOS were older age, prior atrial fibrillation, and greater patient urgency. Patient factors associated with shorter LOS were lower NYHA class, higher ejection fraction and higher mean aortic valve gradients. Procedural characteristics associated with shorter LOS were conscious sedation (HR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.35, p = 0.004). Transapical access was associated with prolonged LOS (HR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.41-0.58, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This multicenter study identified potentially modifiable patient and procedural factors associated with a prolonged LOS. Future research is needed to determine if interventions focused on these factors will translate to a shorter LOS.
