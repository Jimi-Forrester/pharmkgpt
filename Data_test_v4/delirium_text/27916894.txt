27916894|t|Green Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles Stabilized with Mussel-Inspired Protein and Colorimetric Sensing of Lead(II) and Copper(II) Ions.
27916894|a|This articles reports a simple and green method for preparing uniform silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), for which self-polymerized 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (polyDOPA) is used as the reducing and stabilizing agent in aqueous media. The AgNPs functionalized by polyDOPA were analyzed by UV-Vis spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectrophotometry, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The results revealed that the polyDOPA-AgNPs with diameters of 25 nm were well dispersed due to the polyDOPA. It was noted that the polyDOPA-AgNPs showed selectivity for Pb2+ and Cu2+ detection with the detection limits for the two ions as low as 9.4 x 10-5 and 8.1 x 10-5 muM, respectively. Therefore, the polyDOPA-AgNPs can be applied to both Pb2+ and Cu2+ detection in real water samples. The proposed method will be useful for colorimetric detection of heavy metal ions in aqueous media.
