35155015|t|Successful Stabilization of Thyroid Storm Precipitated by Medication Noncompliance and Complicated Urinary Tract Infection: A Case Report.
35155015|a|Thyroid storm is a rare but life-threatening condition that can occur in the setting of incompletely treated or untreated hyperthyroidism, and is often precipitated by recent infection, surgery, or trauma. We present a fascinating case report of the successful stabilization of a 29-year-old female, recently diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and non-compliant with medications, who presented with thyroid storm in the setting of sepsis secondary to right-sided pyelonephritis, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) type 2, and hyperbilirubinemia. Management was further complicated by electrolyte imbalances secondary to severe diarrhea due to the thyroid storm and pancytopenia likely due to aggressive hydration. This case is demonstrative of the importance of early recognition, timely management, and patient education of life-threatening endocrine disorders such as severe thyrotoxicosis.
