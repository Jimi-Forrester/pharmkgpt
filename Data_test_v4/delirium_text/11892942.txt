11892942|a|Citicoline was originally developed and launched by Ferrer for the treatment of stroke, and is now also being investigated for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the US, the compound is being developed by Interneuron for the treatment of stroke. A US launch had been rescheduled for 2002 although a decision on future US development of citicoline was intended to be made in conjunction with Takeda, Interneuron's US licensee. Takeda had decided not to pursue development by December 2000 and was in negotiations with Interneuron for another product candidate. Interneuron stated at this time that it would explore other partnership opportunities for citicoline. In 1993, Interneuron licensed exclusive marketing and manufacturing rights to citicoline in the US and Canada from Ferrer. By September 1997, a patent application had been filed worldwide by Interneuron for the use of citicoline in the reduction of cerebral infarct volume, and in September 1998, US-05801160 was issued for citicoline relating to the protection of brain tissue from cerebral infarction following ischemic stroke. In December 1999, US rights to the commercialization of citicoline were licensed to Takeda.
