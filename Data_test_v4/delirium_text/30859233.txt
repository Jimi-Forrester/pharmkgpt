30859233|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common but often undiagnosed complication in geriatric patients following a major or minor operation. With 14-56% in patients over 70 years of age, it is one of the most frequent complications seen in hospitals. The link between the prescription of drugs with antimuscarinic effects and cognitive disturbance is also well known. METHODS: Recognizing the presence of delirium and the criteria to establish the diagnosis of delirium will improve a clinician's ability to detect this complication. Treating delirium with non-pharmacologic, reduces the incidence and side effects of postoperative delirium. The purpose of this article is to describe the diagnosis and treatment of postoperative delirium. RESULTS: A sudden rise following fluctuating symptoms with decreased attentiveness, awareness and thinking are typical symptoms of delirium. The organic origin is not focused and must be considered. Transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate and the bladder can increase the risk of bleeding, delirium and TUR syndrome. As simple instruments to assess signs and symptoms, the Clinical Assessment Method (CAM) and the Nurses Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) in the clinical setting are well examined. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperatively screening and execution of a geriatric assessment to detect vulnerable elderly could be a first step in reduction of complication. Regularly screening for delirium reduces the pre-, post-, and perioperative complications in patients with delirium.
