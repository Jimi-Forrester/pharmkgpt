34736644|a|In this paper, we developed a new ultrasensitive capacitance sensor for detection of amyloid beta 1-40 (abeta40) protein (one of Alzheimer's disease core biomarkers) in human serum based on the high supramolecular recognition of the beta-cyclodextrin/reduced graphene oxide (beta-CD/RGO) nanohybrid toward the anti-abeta40 antibody molecule. The sensor was established by immobilizing specific anti-abeta40 antibody onto the beta-CD/RGO nanohybrid functionalized on indium tin oxide micro-disk electrode (anti-abeta40/beta-CD/RGO/ITO). Detection of abeta40 in the human serum (HS) using the sensor anti-abeta40/beta-CD/RGO/ITO is carried out by capacitance measurement without a redox probe to prevent protein denaturation, serving as a convenient strategy for point-of-care diagnosis. In comparison with other studies, the sensor shows a very low limit of detection of 0.69 fg mL-1 in HS, demonstrating its ability for the ultrasensitive detection of abeta40. Using this sensor, the dissociation constant KD of the binding interaction between anti-abeta40 and abeta40 in HS is found to be 2.9 x 10-7 nM, indicating the high binding affinity of antibody-antigen and the suitability of the anti-abeta40/beta-CD/RGO/ITO sensor for abeta40 protein detection. The good selectivity of the anti-abeta40/beta-CD/RGO/ITO sensor in the presence of differential analytes was also performed in this paper.
