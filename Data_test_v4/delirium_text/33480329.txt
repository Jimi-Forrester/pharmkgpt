33480329|t|The possible effect of microRNA-155 (miR-155) and BACE1 inhibitors in the memory of patients with down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease: Design, synthesis, virtual screening, molecular modeling and biological evaluations.
33480329|a|MiR-155 plays main roles in several physiological and pathological mechanisms, such as Down syndrome (DS), immunity and inflammation and potential anti-AD therapeutic target. The miR-155 is one of the overexpressed miRNAs in DS patients that contribute directly and indirectly to the onset or progression of the DS. Since the miR-155 can simultaneously reduce the translation of several genes at post-transcriptional levels, targeting the miR-155 might set the stage for the treatment of DS. One of the rational strategies in providing therapeutic interventions in this respect is to design and develop novel small molecules inhibiting the miR-155 function or biogenesis or maturation. In the present study, we aim to introduce small molecule compounds with the potential to inhibit the generation of the selectively miR-155 processing by employing computational drug design approaches, as well as in vitro studies. We designed and synthesized a novel series of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines derivatives as new nonpeptic candidates for the treatment of DS with AD. The designed compounds were investigated for their BACE1 and miR-155 binder inhibitory potential in vitro and in cell. In addition, we present a systematic computational approach that includes 3 D modeling, docking-based virtual screening, and molecular dynamics simulation to identify Small - molecule inhibitors of pre-miR-155 maturation. To confirm the inhibitory potential of compound 8k on miR-155 maturation, qRT- PCR was performed. All our results confirm that compound 8k, in addition to being a good inhibitor of BACE1, can also be a good inhibitor of miR-155.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
