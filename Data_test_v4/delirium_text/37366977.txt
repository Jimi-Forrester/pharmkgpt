37366977|t|Recent Aptamer-Based Biosensors for Cd2+ Detection.
37366977|a|Cd2+, a major environmental pollutant, is heavily toxic to human health. Many traditional techniques are high-cost and complicated; thus, developing a simple, sensitive, convenient, and cheap monitoring approach is necessary. The aptamer can be obtained from a novel method called SELEX, which is widely used as a DNA biosensor for its easy acquisition and high affinity of the target, especially for heavy metal ions detection, such as Cd2+. In recent years, highly stable Cd2+ aptamer oligonucleotides (CAOs) were observed, and electrochemical, fluorescent, and colorimetric biosensors based on aptamers have been designed to monitor Cd2+. In addition, the monitoring sensitivity of aptamer-based biosensors is improved with signal amplification mechanisms such as hybridization chain reactions and enzyme-free methods. This paper reviews approaches to building biosensors for inspecting Cd2+ by electrochemical, fluorescent, and colorimetric methods. Finally, many practical applications of sensors and their implications for humans and the environment are discussed.
