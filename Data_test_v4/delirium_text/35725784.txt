35725784|a|The exact path leading to cognitive impairment that goes beyond malaria is unclear, but it appears to be the result of interactive factors. Time of exposure to disease and recurrences are potentially major determinant variables. Cognitive impairment is described mainly in children, rarely in adults. The disease in high endemic areas usually does not affect elderlies, because of acquired immunity over time. However, this population is relatively more frequently sick in lower endemic areas, such as in the Amazon. This study assessed the effect of Plasmodium vivax malaria on the executive and cognitive functions of elderlies, in the Brazilian Amazon. A cohort study was conducted to evaluate executive and cognitive functions one week (T0), two months (T2) and eight months (T8) after the malaria episode. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), Wechsler adult intelligence scale (WAIS-III), and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) were used to assess executive and cognitive functions. One hundred-forty elderlies were enrolled (70 with P. vivax malaria and 70 without malaria). P. vivax malaria was associated with impairment of the executive and cognitive functions in elderlies for up to 8 months after acute P. vivax malaria. Prior history of malaria, recurrences and higher parasitemia were independently associated with various surrogates of executive and cognitive impairment. With the increase in life expectancy, elderlies living in malaria endemic areas will deserve more attention from health authorities, to guarantee improvement of their quality of life in the tropics.
