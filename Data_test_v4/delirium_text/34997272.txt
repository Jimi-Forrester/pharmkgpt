34997272|a|Agmatine (AG), idazoxan (IDZ), and efaroxan (EFR) are imidazoline receptor ligands with beneficial effects in central nervous system disorders. The present study aimed to evaluate the interaction between AG, IDZ, and EFR with an opiate, tramadol (TR), in a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. In the experiment, we used five groups with 8 adult male Wistar rats each. During the condition session, on days 2, 4, 6, and 8, the rats received the drugs (saline, or TR, or IDZ and TR, or EFR and TR, or AG and TR) and were placed in their least preferred compartment. On days 1, 3, 5, and 7, the rats received saline in the preferred compartment. In the preconditioning, the preferred compartment was determined. In the postconditioning, the preference for one of the compartments was reevaluated. TR increased the time spent in the non-preferred compartment. AG decreased time spent in the TR-paired compartment. EFR, more than IDZ, reduced the time spent in the TR-paired compartment, but without statistical significance. AG reversed the TR-induced CPP, while EFR and IDZ only decreased the time spent in the TR-paired compartment, without statistical significance.
