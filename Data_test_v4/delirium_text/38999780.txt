38999780|t|Dysfunction of the Murine Liver with Aging and Its Improvement with the Continuous Consumption of Enterococcus faecalis EC-12.
38999780|a|Chronic inflammation is involved in the development of age-related diseases. Given its persistence, controlling chronic inflammation is essential for preventing age-related diseases. In this study, we investigated the effects of Enterococcus faecalis EC-12 (EC-12), which has immunomodulatory and antioxidant effects, on liver gene expression and aging phenomena in mice. Short-term EC-12 administration stimulated the expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis and metabolism in the liver. Furthermore, long-term EC-12 administration from 10 weeks to 1.5 years of age resulted in significant increases in blood interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 concentrations (both p < 0.05) and a significant decrease in the monocyte chemotactic protein-1 concentration (p < 0.05). These results indicated pathologic improvement, such as suppression of fat degeneration in the liver. These results suggest that continuous EC-12 intake from a young age can suppress liver function abnormalities, which is one of the aging phenomena in old age, and contribute to health in old age.
