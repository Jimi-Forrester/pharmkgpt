39712398|a|Background: Multimorbidity is common in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), yet comorbidity patterns are not well documented. Methods: The prevalence of 18 chronic conditions (6 cardiometabolic, 7 other somatic, 5 mental health) was obtained in patients with new-onset AF from 2013-2017 from a 27-county region and controls matched 1:1 on age, sex, and county of residence. For AF patients and controls separately, clustering of conditions and co-occurrence beyond chance was estimated (using the asymmetric Somers' D statistic), overall and for ages <65, 65-74, 75-84, and >=85 years. Results: Among 16,509 patients with AF (median age 76 years, 57% men), few (4%) did not have any of the 18 chronic conditions, whereas nearly one-quarter of controls (23%) did not have any chronic conditions. Clustering of cardiometabolic conditions was common in both AF patients and controls, but clustering of other somatic conditions was more common in AF. Although the prevalence of most condition pairs was higher in AF patients, controls had a larger number of condition pairs occurring together beyond chance. In persons aged <65 years, AF patients more frequently exhibited concordance of condition pairs that included either pairs of somatic conditions or a combination of conditions from different condition groups. In persons aged 65-74 years, AF patients more frequently had pairs of other somatic conditions. Conclusion: Patterns of co-existing conditions differed between patients with AF and controls, particularly in younger ages. A better understanding of the clinical consequences of multimorbidity in AF patients, including those diagnosed at younger ages, is needed.
