36653384|t|A new AMPK isoform mediates glucose-restriction induced longevity non-cell autonomously by promoting membrane fluidity.
36653384|a|Dietary restriction (DR) delays aging and the onset of age-associated diseases. However, it is yet to be determined whether and how restriction of specific nutrients promote longevity. Previous genome-wide screens isolated several Escherichia coli mutants that extended lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, using 1H-NMR metabolite analyses and inter-species genetics, we demonstrate that E. coli mutants depleted of intracellular glucose extend C. elegans lifespans, serving as bona fide glucose-restricted (GR) diets. Unlike general DR, GR diets don't reduce the fecundity of animals, while still improving stress resistance and ameliorating neuro-degenerative pathologies of Abeta42. Interestingly, AAK-2a, a new AMPK isoform, is necessary and sufficient for GR-induced longevity. AAK-2a functions exclusively in neurons to modulate GR-mediated longevity via neuropeptide signaling. Last, we find that GR/AAK-2a prolongs longevity through PAQR-2/NHR-49/Delta9 desaturases by promoting membrane fluidity in peripheral tissues. Together, our studies identify the molecular mechanisms underlying prolonged longevity by glucose specific restriction in the context of whole animals.
