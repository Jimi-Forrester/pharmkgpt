37881831|t|NIAGADS Alzheimer's GenomicsDB: A resource for exploring Alzheimer's disease genetic and genomic knowledge.
37881831|a|INTRODUCTION: The National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site Alzheimer's Genomics Database (GenomicsDB) is a public knowledge base of Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic datasets and genomic annotations. METHODS: GenomicsDB uses a custom systems architecture to adopt and enforce rigorous standards that facilitate harmonization of AD-relevant genome-wide association study summary statistics datasets with functional annotations, including over 230 million annotated variants from the AD Sequencing Project. RESULTS: GenomicsDB generates interactive reports compiled from the harmonized datasets and annotations. These reports contextualize AD-risk associations in a broader functional genomic setting and summarize them in the context of functionally annotated genes and variants. DISCUSSION: Created to make AD-genetics knowledge more accessible to AD researchers, the GenomicsDB is designed to guide users unfamiliar with genetic data in not only exploring but also interpreting this ever-growing volume of data. Scalable and interoperable with other genomics resources using data technology standards, the GenomicsDB can serve as a central hub for research and data analysis on AD and related dementias. HIGHLIGHTS: The National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) offers to the public a unique, disease-centric collection of AD-relevant GWAS summary statistics datasets. Interpreting these data is challenging and requires significant bioinformatics expertise to standardize datasets and harmonize them with functional annotations on genome-wide scales. The NIAGADS Alzheimer's GenomicsDB helps overcome these challenges by providing a user-friendly public knowledge base for AD-relevant genetics that shares harmonized, annotated summary statistics datasets from the NIAGADS repository in an interpretable, easily searchable format.
