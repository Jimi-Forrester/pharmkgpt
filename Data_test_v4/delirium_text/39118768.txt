39118768|a|Background: Group cognitive-behavioral therapy has demonstrated its effectiveness in treating various psychological disorders. Nevertheless, there is insufficient evidence supporting its application in enhancing both the quality of life and depression among Parkinson's patients. Consequently, this study was undertaken to examine the efficacy of group cognitive-behavioral therapy in ameliorating depression symptoms and enhancing the quality of life in individuals afflicted with Parkinson's disease. Materials and methods: A randomized clinical trial with pre-test and post-test measurements, including a control group, was conducted. The sample consisted of individuals referred to Roozbeh Hospital in Tehran with Parkinson's disease in 2023. Ninety participants were selected using convenience sampling and randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control group, with 45 participants in each. The experimental group received a three-month cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention consisting of 12 sessions of 90 min. Pre-test and post-test measures included the Beck Depression Questionnaire and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) in SPSS-25. Results: The results revealed a significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms of depression and quality of life. The cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention significantly reduced depression and significantly improved the quality of life in individuals with Parkinson's disease (P<=0.01). Conclusion: Group cognitive-behavioral therapy can be an effective approach for reducing depression and improving the quality of life in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Therefore, therapists and healthcare providers can utilize cognitive-behavioral therapy to enhance the well-being of individuals with Parkinson's disease.
