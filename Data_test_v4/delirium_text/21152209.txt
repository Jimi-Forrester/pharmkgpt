21152209|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the neurodegenerative diseases which we can by certainty identify its pathology, however, this confidence disappeares when talking about the cause. A long history of trials, suggestions, and theories tried linking PD to a specific causation. In this paper, a new suggestion is trying to find its way, could it be toxicology? Can we-in the future-look to PD as an occupational disease, in fact, many clues point to the possible toxic responsibility-either total or partial-in causing this disease. Searching for possible toxic causes for PD would help in designing perfect toxic models in animals.
