34085097|a|PURPOSE: Patients suffering from aggressive systemic peripheral lymphoma with primary central nervous system involvement (PCL) are a rare and sparsely investigated population. Recommended treatment regimens include a combination of intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy as well as whole brain radiotherapy while offering relatively poor survival. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective study that analyzed safety and outcome of 4 + 4 cycles Rituximab (R)-CHOP and R-high-dose Methotrexate (HD-MTX) for newly diagnosed, transplant-eligible patients ("Ping-Pong"), followed by Cytarabine (AraC)/Thiotepa (TT), BCNU/TT, and autologous hematologic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT). We retrospectively analyzed a set of 16 patients with high-intermediate or high-risk IPI status. RESULTS: Overall response rate to Ping-Pong was 100% measured by CT/MRI, including 93.75% complete remissions after BCNU/TT followed by PBSCT. One patient failed to qualify for high-dose chemotherapy due to progression when receiving Cytarabine/TT. All patients experienced grade III adverse events, 3 of them a grade IV adverse event. Estimated progression-free survival is 93.75% after a 4.8-year follow-up currently. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests high effectivity of R-CHOP with mid-cycle MTX with aHSCT consolidation towards acceptable OS results in this challenging patient population.
