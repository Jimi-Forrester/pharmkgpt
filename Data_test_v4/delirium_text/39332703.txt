39332703|t|Postoperative Bleeding Complications are Common Among Patients Undergoing Transcarotid Artery Revascularization.
39332703|a|BACKGROUND: Current practice guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy for at least 30 days postoperatively after transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) to promote stent patency. However, many patients are already taking other antithrombotic medications. The optimal pharmacologic regimen in this patient population remains unclear, especially as it pertains to postoperative bleeding complications. METHODS: All TCAR procedures performed at a large academic medical center from January 1, 2017 to April 30, 2023 were identified via current procedural terminology codes and retrospectively reviewed via electronic medical records. Data were collected on patient demographics, procedural details, postoperative complications, and antithrombotic regimen. Bleeding complications were categorized as surgical and non-surgical, which included any bleeding diatheses that were not related to the neck incision, such as epistaxis, hematuria, melena, or non-cervical hematoma. RESULTS: A total of 116 TCAR procedures were performed. The 30-day incidence of bleeding complications was 12.1% (n=14), which included 8 (6.9%) symptomatic neck hematomas and 6 (5.2%) non-surgical site bleeding complications. Aside from patient age (median 72 y [66-79] vs 79 y [70.5-88], p=0.03), demographics, medical comorbidities, surgical indication, risk-related indication for TCAR, and inpatient/outpatient status were similar between patients who experienced bleeding versus no bleeding complications. Patients who developed bleeding complications experienced higher thirty-day hospital readmission (42.9% vs 9.8%, p<0.001) and reintervention rates (21.4% vs 2.0%, p<0.001) and trended towards longer postoperative length of stay (1.5 d [1-3] vs 1 [1-2] d, p=0.07). Reasons for readmission (n=16) included: epistaxis (1), hematuria (1), headache and melena (1), melena and myocardial infarction (1), fall (1), headache (1), dyspnea (5), delirium (1), diarrhea (1), atrial fibrillation (1), and neck hematoma (1); one patient did not have a readmission reason documented. Reinterventions (n=6) included: neck hematoma evacuation (2), epistaxis cauterization (1), emergent cricothyroidotomy (1), and repeat carotid stenting (1). The management of antithrombotic medications during bleeding events were highly variable amongst providers (11 patients with nothing held, one apixaban held, one aspirin held, one clopidogrel held), however, no patients suffered carotid stent thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Bleeding complications are common within 30 days of TCAR and frequently result in unplanned hospital readmission and reintervention. There is significant provider-level variability in management of antithrombotic medications during these events. These data highlight need for evidence-based guidelines for the optimal pharmacologic strategy for patients post-TCAR who develop bleeding complications.
