27028811|t|[Induction of Unspecific Permeabilization of Mitochondrial Membrane and Its Role in Cell Death].
27028811|a|Mitochondria participate in various vital cellular processes. Violation of their functions can lead to the development of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and malignancies. One of the key events responsible for mitochondrial damage-induction of Ca^(2+)-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition, due to the opening of a nonspecific pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Despite active studies of pore components, its detailed structure has not yet been established. This review analyzes possible constituents and regulators of the pore, the role of the pore in various pathologies, and hypotheses that explain the organization of the pores. Elucidation of these questions can help developing strategies for the treatment of a wide range of pathologies-from Alzheimer and Parkinson's disease to cancer.
