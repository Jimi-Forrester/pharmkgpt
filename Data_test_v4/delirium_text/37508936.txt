37508936|t|Metacognition in Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders-Current Methods and Approaches.
37508936|a|Metacognition essentially represents "thinking about thinking", or the individual's capacity to control and monitor their own cognitive processes. Metacognition impairment in schizophrenia represents a core feature of the disease, and, in the last fifteen years, the subject has evolved into a growing study area concentrating on a wide variety of processes, such as clinical insight, autobiographical memory, cognitive beliefs, reasoning, and memory biases. Since metacognition is a complex subject, we wanted to focus on the different nuances of metacognition transposed into the lives of patients diagnosed with either schizophrenia or a schizoaffective disorder. Therefore, this narrative review aims to analyze the literature in order to provide an insight regarding the current methods and approaches in the study of metacognition in schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders, as well as the results provided. Results from the reviewed studies showed that patients with schizophrenia have a lower metacognitive ability, which is strongly reflected in their lives. Studies to date have highlighted the interaction between schizophrenia symptoms and metacognition, which shows how metacognition impacts work performance, autobiographical memory, motivation, the severity of symptoms, and social cognition.
