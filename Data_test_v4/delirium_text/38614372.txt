38614372|a|INTRODUCTION: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), early diagnosis facilitates treatment options and leads to beneficial outcomes for patients, their carers and the healthcare system. The neuropsychological battery of the Uniform Data Set (UDSNB3.0) assesses cognition in ageing and dementia, by measuring scores across different cognitive domains such as attention, memory, processing speed, executive function and language. However, its neuroanatomical correlates have not been investigated using 7 Tesla MRI (7T MRI). METHODS: We used 7T MRI to investigate the correlations between hippocampal subfield volumes and the UDSNB3.0 in 24 individuals with Amyloidbeta-status AD and 18 age-matched controls, with respective age ranges of 60 (42-76) and 62 (52-79) years. AD participants with a Medial Temporal Atrophy scale of higher than 2 on 3T MRI were excluded from the study. RESULTS: A significant difference in the entire hippocampal volume was observed in the AD group compared to healthy controls (HC), primarily influenced by CA1, the largest hippocampal subfield. Notably, no significant difference in whole brain volume between the groups implies that hippocampal volume loss is not merely reflective of overall brain atrophy. UDSNB3.0 cognitive scores showed significant differences between AD and HC, particularly in Memory, Language, and Visuospatial domains. DG volume was sigificantly associated with UDSNB3.0 Memory and Executive domain scores for AD patients. The data also suggested a non significant trend for CA1 volume associated with UDSNB3.0 Memory, Executive, and Language domain scores in AD. A reassessment focused on hippocampal subfields and MoCA memory subdomains in AD, demonstrated associations with DG showing with Cued, Uncued, and Recognition Memory subscores, while CA1 and Tail displayed associations solely with Cued memory. DISCUSSION: This study reveals differences in the hippocampal volumes measured using 7T MRI, between individuals with early symptomatic AD compared with healthy controls. This highlights the potential of 7T MRI as a valuable tool for early AD diagnosis and the real-time monitoring of AD progression and treatment efficacy.
