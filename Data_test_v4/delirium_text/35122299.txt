35122299|a|The synuclein family includes three neuronal proteins, named alpha-synuclein, beta-synuclein, and gamma-synuclein, that have peculiar structural features. alpha-synuclein is largely known for being a key protein in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies, namely, dementia with Lewy bodies and multisystem atrophy. The role of beta-synuclein and gamma-synuclein is less well understood in terms of physiological functions and potential contribution to human diseases. alpha-synuclein has been investigated extensively in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood as a potential biomarker for synucleinopathies. Recently, great attention has been also paid to beta-synuclein, whose CSF and blood levels seem to reflect synaptic damage and neurodegeneration independent of the presence of synucleinopathy. In this review, we aim to provide an overview on the pathophysiological roles of the synucleins. Because gamma-synuclein has been poorly investigated in the field of synucleinopathy and its pathophysiological roles are far from being clear, we focus on the interactions between alpha-synuclein and beta-synuclein in PD. We also discuss the role of alpha-synuclein and beta-synuclein as potential biomarkers to improve the diagnostic characterization of synucleinopathies, thus highlighting their potential application in clinical trials for disease-modifying therapies.   2022 The Authors.
