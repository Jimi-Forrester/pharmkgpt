38461276|a|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess whether preoperative dexmedetomidine (DEX) nasal drips combined with conventional treatment could mitigate the occurrence of postoperative delirium (POD). DESIGN: A prospective randomised controlled study. SETTING: The cardiac surgery intensive care unit (CSICU) and patient hospitalisation ward at a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 100 patients (aged >=60 years) undergoing cardiac surgery at a university hospital between 7 January 2022, and 30 November 2022 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients with sleep disorders (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index >=8) were divided into two groups: Group A (the placebo group, n=50), receiving a short-term preoperative placebo combined with conventional treatment and Group B (the DEX group, n=50), receiving short-term preoperative DEX combined with conventional treatment. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) was used for POD assessment in the CSICU, while the CAM was employed to assess delirium in the patient ward. Group B demonstrated a reduced incidence of POD compared to Group A (12% vs. 30%, odds ratio: 0.318, 95% confidence interval: 0.112-0.905, p=0.027). CONCLUSION: The combined treatment involving DEX demonstrated a decreased incidence of POD in elderly individuals with sleep disorders undergoing cardiac surgery compared to the placebo combination treatment.
