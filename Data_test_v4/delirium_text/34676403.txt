34676403|a|OBJECTIVES: First experiences with rib fixation using nitinol, in terms of reliability and morbidity, influence on pain control and quality of life (QOL), in a large series of selected patients after blunt chest trauma. METHODS: Data of all patients who had undergone rib fixation by the use of nitinol were retrospectively analysed in terms of indications, morbidity and in-hospital mortality. Pain status and health-related QOL were assessed preoperatively, when possible, at discharge and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-surgery using visual analogous scale and short form 12 questionnaires. RESULTS: From September 2017 to April 2019, 70 patients underwent rib fixation using the nitinol device, of which 47 (67%) had dislocated, painful fractures, 6 (8.5%) had flail chest injuries, 6 (8.5%) were emergencies with haemodynamical instability and 11 (16%) had pseudoarthrosis. Morbidity was 21% without wound infection; in-hospital mortality was 3%. Fracture of the material occurred in 6% of the patients during the first year, but removal of the material was not required. Analysis of the pain score showed a statistically significant decrease in pain for both the whole collective and the group with a series of dislocated and painful fractured ribs (P < 0.001, Tukey contrast on the linear mixed-effects models). Assessment of health-related QOL revealed a significant improvement in the physical score for the mid- and long-term analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that rib fixation using the nitinol device is reliable, associated with an acceptable morbidity, while significantly decreasing pain and improving health-related QOL.
