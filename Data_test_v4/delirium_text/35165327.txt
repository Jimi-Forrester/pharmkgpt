35165327|a|For now, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is incurable. But if it can be diagnosed early, the correct treatment can be used to delay the disease. Most of the existing research methods use single or multi-modal imaging features for prediction, relatively few studies combine brain imaging with genetic features for disease diagnosis. In order to accurately identify AD, healthy control (HC) and the two stages of mild cognitive impairment (MCI: early MCI, late MCI) combined with brain imaging and genetic characteristics, we proposed an integrated Fisher score and multi-modal multi-task feature selection research method. We learned first genetic features with Fisher score to perform dimensionality reduction in order to solve the problem of the large difference between the feature scales of genetic and brain imaging. Then we learned the potential related features of brain imaging and genetic data, and multiplied the selected features with the learned weight coefficients. Through the feature selection program, five imaging and five genetic features were selected to achieve an average classification accuracy of 98% for HC and AD, 82% for HC and EMCI, 86% for HC and LMCI, 80% for EMCI and LMCI, 88% for EMCI and AD, and 72% for LMCI and AD. Compared with only using imaging features, the classification accuracy has been improved to a certain extent, and a set of interrelated features of brain imaging phenotypes and genetic factors were selected.
