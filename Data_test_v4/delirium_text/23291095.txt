23291095|a|Deciphering the mechanism by which the relative Abeta42(43) to total Abeta ratio is regulated is central to understanding Alzheimer disease (AD) etiology; however, the mechanisms underlying changes in the Abeta42(43) ratio caused by familial mutations and gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) are unclear. Here, we show in vitro and in living cells that presenilin (PS)/gamma-secretase cleaves Abeta42 into Abeta38, and Abeta43 into Abeta40 or Abeta38. Approximately 40% of Abeta38 is derived from Abeta43. Abeta42(43) cleavage is involved in the regulation of the Abeta42(43) ratio in living cells. GSMs increase the cleavage of PS/gamma-secretase-bound Abeta42 (increase k(cat)) and slow its dissociation from the enzyme (decrease k(b)), whereas PS1 mutants and inverse GSMs show the opposite effects. Therefore, we suggest a concept to describe the Abeta42(43) production process and propose how GSMs act, and we suggest that a loss of PS/gamma-secretase function to cleave Abeta42(43) may initiate AD and might represent a therapeutic target.
