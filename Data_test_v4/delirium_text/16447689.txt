16447689|a|In this paper titled "My Kumamoto Life of 19 Years; The Travel for Times", the memorial lecture on my retirement from Kumamoto National University Corporation Integrated Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Biomedical Informatics (Chairman) is summarized. As they say "Time flies", time extends from seconds to years. The lecture includes a summary of my short term research and long term studies, such as age-dependant and gene-related changes in ageing over 5 or more years in the healthy elderly. Short-term study mostly involved of newly evaluated assay methods for important substances such as the second level in the cell life span in the variation of lipid metabolite of cardiovascular diseases based on atherosclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and their evaluation by homogeneous assay of HDL-C, LDL-C, enzymatic assay for choline relating metabolites, and lipoperoxide as the results of free radical reactions. The intermediate-term studies were mainly on the development of total laboratory automation (TLA) for the management of the laboratory of the university hospital. The hospital has various degrees of sophistication in its laboratory services. Technicians were allowed to transport specimens immediately by using an air-shooter system after drawing blood, from the emergency room to the central laboratory. Routine specimens could be measured within 30 min and the results could be automatically sent to the physician's office. It greatly minimized reporting errors, decreased the exposure to biohazards, reduced labor expense, improved operation efficiency, and shortened turnaround time. Moreover, for the outpatients and emergency laboratories, we constructed a robotic measuring system which was assembled into a sequential method for the analysis of chemistry, hematology and urinalysis specimens by using a polyarticular robot. The robot arm extends to a bar-coded tube, picking up and placing test tubes on a turn table of autoanalyzers for analysis without manpower. This is the first known effective unmanned procedure for assay in the world of laboratory medicine. Also, our research on pathological informatics was begun. Our laboratory had 7 themes; the study of the reference intervals in the elderly as one of strategy of standardization on laboratory data (Drs. Uji Y, Sugiuchi H), the study of the activation mechanism of ribosomal proteins by the functions of blood cells (Drs. Shibuya Y, Senba U), the evaluation of diagnostic methods in latent ailments by gene analysis (Dr. Ando Y), the evaluation of a highly sensitive method for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (Okajima K), the study of the neogenesis of blood vessels by physical invasion (Uchiba M), the study of the deposition mechanism of amyloid proteins and evaluation of the diagnostic methods in the autonomic system(Drs. Ando Y, Nakamura M), and the study of the function of blood stem cells in blood transfusion services (Drs. Yamaguchi K, Yonemura M, Tsunemi M). Finally, my long term work also included research into the early diagnosis and prediction of latent ailments and the variation of serum proteins levels in the healthy aged. The conclusion was that the reference value of healthy populations and individuals (intra-personal) who had no combined ailments, in follow-up for 5 years, categorized by age, sex, and social conditions, gave a narrower range of variation than did large mixed populations (inter-personal), in laboratory tests and activity of daily living (ADL). Concerning the early diagnosis and prediction studies for the latent ailments in the aged, variations of serum protein levels in the healthy aged were classified into 3 types: serum proteins levels increased with advancing age (alphaAT, mainly acute phase reactant proteins), those that decreased with advancing age (albumin mainly transporting proteins) and proteins with no significant variation. The higher increase of the alpha1AT/beta2 III ratio in the healthy aged over 60 years old is suspected to create symptoms in the near future. The papers presented concerning ageing studies were presented at the APCCC Symposium (India, 2002) and the IFCC Symposium (Kyoto, 2002), and the TLA study was also presented at the Symposium of XX World Congress of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine (San Paulo Brazil 1999).
