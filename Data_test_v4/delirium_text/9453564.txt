9453564|a|Inflammatory processes involving reactive microglia, e.g., those associated with beta-amyloid containing neuritic and core plaques in Alzheimer's disease, appear to contribute to neuronal degeneration in the CNS. The fact that increased nerve growth factor (NGF) protein levels were found throughout brains of Alzheimer's disease patients led us to investigate neurotrophin synthesis in a human microglial cell line showing typical properties of human microglial cells, including expression of neurotrophins such as NGF, as well as the NGF receptor trkA and the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75. We found that the cytokines interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha synergistically stimulate microglial NGF transcription and protein release. Moreover, exposure of microglial cells to complement factor C3a induces NGF expression. To assess the role of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in inflammatory mediator-induced microglial NGF expression, the effect of the NF-kappaB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) was analyzed. In the presence of PDTC, a dose-dependent inhibition of cytokine-activated NGF expression occurred. In contrast, the C3a-dependent stimulation of NGF synthesis was not influenced by PDTC. In addition, microglial neurotoxicity-mediating beta-amyloid peptides A beta(1-40) and A beta(1-42) failed to alter NGF synthesis, whereas A beta(25-35) specifically induced NF-kappaB-dependent microglial NGF expression. In conclusion, inflammatory signals (cytokines and complement factors), as well as A beta(25-35), are potent stimulators of human microglial NGF synthesis involving NF-kappaB-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Microglial secretion of neurotrophins appears to be involved in early processes of neuronal regeneration.
