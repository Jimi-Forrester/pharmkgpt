39429231|a|Aim: To examine epigenetic changes leading to functional repair after damage to the central motor system.Data sources: A literature search was conducted using medical and health science electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus) up to July 2023.Study selection: Data were summarized for type of intervention, study design, findings including human and animal studies.Data extraction: Data were extracted and double-checked independently for methodological quality. By means of the influence of environmental (calorie restriction or physical exercise) and other factors, epigenetic instructions were found to increase levels of BDNF and enhance synaptic neurotransmission, possibly leading to larger scale changes in structural and functional assets, which may end up to cognitive and motor repair after stroke.
