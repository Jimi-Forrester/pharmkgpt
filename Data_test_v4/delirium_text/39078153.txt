39078153|a|BACKGROUND: Inpatient delirium is common and associated with poor outcomes. Although most organisations have evidence-based guidelines to improve delirium prevention and management, delirium rates and outcomes have remained relatively unchanged over time. A lack of understanding of healthcare providers' experience of caring for people with delirium and its integration into existing guidance may explain some of the slow progress in improving delirium care. OBJECTIVE: To review and synthesise existing qualitative evidence on healthcare providers' experience of caring for inpatients with delirium within and across disciplines. METHODS: We systematically searched OVID Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Emcare, PsychINFO, AMED and Web of Science databases for articles published between January 1990 and November 2022. Article inclusion and study quality were assessed by two independent reviewers. Both thematic synthesis and content analysis were then conducted to synthesise findings from included studies. RESULTS: Within the 25 included studies, the experience of nurses was the most commonly studied perspective, followed by medical and allied health. Nursing, medical and allied health staff all reported that their experience of caring for people with delirium was challenging, highlighting difficulties in delirium recognition and that they felt unsupported at organisational and local levels. Attitudes towards older people and the importance of delirium influenced identification and prioritisation. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare providers often find caring for hospitalised patients with delirium challenging and complex. Although good communication within multidisciplinary teams was deemed helpful, more work is required to understand how to achieve this, recognising the unique perspectives of individual disciplines.
