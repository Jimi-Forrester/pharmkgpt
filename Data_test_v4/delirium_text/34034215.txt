34034215|a|Blood pressure variability (BPV) is linked to dementia risk, possibly through cerebral hypoperfusion. We investigated BPV over 1 year and concurrent regional cerebral perfusion decline in older adults without dementia. Participants underwent 4 blood pressure measurements across 12 months, ASL-MRI at baseline and 12-months, and baseline FDG-PET. Regional perfusion was normalized to precentral gyrus. A subset had cerebral spinal fluid Alzheimer's disease biomarker abnormalities. For every SD increase in BPV, perfusion decreased in medial orbitofrontal cortex (ss = -.36; p = 0.008), hippocampus (ss = -.37; p = 0.005), entorhinal cortex (ss = -.48; p < 0.001), precuneus (ss = -.31; p = 0.02), inferior parietal cortex (ss = -.44; p < 0.001), and inferior temporal cortex (ss = -.46; p < 0.001). Similar patterns emerged in subsets with biomarker abnormalities. Older adults with elevated BPV exhibit concurrent regional perfusion decline in areas vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease, independent of cerebral hypometabolism. BPV may be an early marker of vascular dysfunction in aging.
