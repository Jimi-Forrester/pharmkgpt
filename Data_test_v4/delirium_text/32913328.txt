32913328|a|In addition to sperm-related genes, the male-specific chromosome Y (chrY) contains a class of ubiquitously expressed and evolutionary conserved dosage-sensitive regulator genes that include the neighboring Uty, Ddx3y and (in mice) Eif2s3y genes. However, no study to date has investigated the functional impact of targeted mutations of any of these genes within adult non-reproductive somatic cells. We thus compared adult male mice carrying a gene trap within their Uty gene (UtyGT) to their wild-type (WT) isogenic controls, and performed deep sequencing of RNA and genome-wide profiling of chromatin features in extracts from either cardiac tissue, cardiomyocyte-specific nuclei or purified cardiomyocytes. The apparent impact of UtyGT on gene transcription concentrated mostly on chrY genes surrounding the locus of insertion, i.e. Uty, Ddx3y, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contained within their introns and Eif2s3y, in addition to possible effects on the autosomal Malat1 lncRNA. Notwithstanding, UtyGT also caused coordinate changes in the abundance of hundreds of mRNA transcripts related to coherent cell functions, including RNA processing and translation. The results altogether indicated that tightly co-regulated chrY genes had nonetheless more widespread effects on the autosomal transcriptome in adult somatic cells, most likely due to mechanisms other than just transcriptional regulation of corresponding protein-coding genes.
