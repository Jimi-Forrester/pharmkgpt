35743158|a|Many organophosphorus compounds (OPs), especially various alpha-aminophosphonates, exhibit anti-cancer activities. They act, among others, as inhibitors of the proteases implicated in cancerogenesis. Thesetypes of inhibitors weredescribed, e.g., for neutral endopeptidase (NEP) expressed in different cancer cells, including osteosarcoma (OS). The aim of the present study isto evaluate new borane-protected derivatives of phosphonous acid (compounds 1-7) in terms of their drug-likeness properties, anti-osteosarcoma activities in vitro (against HOS and Saos-2 cells), and use as potential NEP inhibitors. The results revealed that all tested compounds exhibited the physicochemical and ADME properties typical for small-molecule drugs. However, compound 4 did not show capability of blood-brain barrier penetration (Lipinski and Veber rules;SwissAdme tool). Moreover, the alpha-aminophosphonite-boranes (compounds 4-7) exhibited stronger anti-proliferative activity against OS cells than the other phosphonous acid-borane derivatives (compounds 1-3),especially regarding HOS cells (MTT assay). The most promising compounds 4 and 6 induced apoptosis through the activation of caspase 3 and/or cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase (flow cytometry). Compound 4 inhibited the migration and invasiveness of highly aggressive HOS cells (wound/transwell and BME-coated transwell assays, respectively). Additionally, compound 4 and, to a lesser extent, compound 6 inhibited NEP activity (fluorometric assay). This activity of compound 4 was involved in its anti-proliferative potential (BrdU assay). The present study shows that compound 4 can be considered a potential anti-osteosarcoma agent and a scaffold for the development of new NEP inhibitors.
