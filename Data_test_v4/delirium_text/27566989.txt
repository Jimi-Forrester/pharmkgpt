27566989|t|The impact of delirium on healthcare utilization and survival after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
27566989|a|OBJECTIVES: We assessed whether post-operative delirium is associated with healthcare utilization and overall survival after trans-catheter aortic valve replacement. BACKGROUND: Delirium, a common syndrome among hospitalized older adults, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We reviewed 294 transcatheter aortic valve replacement cases between June 2008 and February 2015 at a tertiary care academic medical center. Post-operative delirium was identified by confusion assessment method screening and clinician diagnosis. RESULTS: Delirium was identified in 61 patients (21%). Non-femoral access for trans-catheter aortic valve replacement was more common in delirious patients than in non-delirious patients (41% vs. 27%, P = 0.04). Delirious patients had diminished overall survival after trans-catheter aortic valve replacement compared to non-delirious patients (1-year survival 59% vs. 84%, log-rank P = 0.002). After adjusting for age, Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted 30-day mortality, and access type; delirium remained independently associated with diminished overall survival (hazard ratio 2.01, 95% confidence interval 1.21-3.33, P = 0.007). The delirium group had longer mean hospital stay (13.3 +- 9.5 days vs. 6.7 +- 3.8 days, P < 0.001) and a higher rate of discharge to a rehabilitation facility (61% vs. 27%, P < 0.001), but there was no difference in 30-day hospital re-admission rates or 30-day mortality based on delirium status. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium occurs in one out of five patients after trans-catheter aortic valve replacement and is associated with diminished survival and increased healthcare utilization. Further studies are needed to clarify whether strategies aimed at reducing delirium after trans-catheter aortic valve replacement may improve outcomes in this high-risk subset.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
