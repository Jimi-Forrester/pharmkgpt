17288081|t|PRO DEM: a community-based approach to care for dementia.
17288081|a|Physicians in a region south of Bremen, Germany, created PRO DEM (for patients with dementia), a service coordinating medical care and social intervention for patients with dementia. The program now serves about 125 outpatients and their families, along with 360 patients in nursing homes. Two nurse consultants coordinate patient care. Treatment strategies are decided during a multidisciplinary case conference among physicians, nurses, and other professionals. Social intervention modules include various care groups for patients and respite services for caregivers. PRO DEM aims to provide fully coordinated care for a better quality of life for patients and caregivers, delaying nursing home admission as long as possible.
