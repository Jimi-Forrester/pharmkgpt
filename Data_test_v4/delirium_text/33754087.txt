33754087|t|A Rare Report of Clinical Lycanthropy in Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders.
33754087|a|Lycanthropy is a rare variant of a delusional misidentification syndrome specifically reverse inter-metamorphosis where patients believe that they are experiencing transformation or have transformed into an animal. A case report of this phenomenon is discussed. We report the lycanthropy phenomenon of a 25-year-old male who believed himself to be transformed into a buffalo after bestiality along with developing obsessive-compulsive features. A case report along with a literature review forms the basis of discussion. Clinical lycanthropy has been reported with various neuropsychiatric conditions including primary psychotic and affective conditions, drug intoxication and withdrawal, cerebrovascular disease, traumatic brain injury, dementia, delirium, and seizures, but its association in the context of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) is a very rare finding. A differential of OCRD should be given due importance and managed accordingly when dealing with lycanthropy, which may help in early identification and management.
