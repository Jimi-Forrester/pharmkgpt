10819286|a|H. K. is a ninety-two-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease and mild hypertension. She resides at a nursing home, where she transfers from bed to chair with maximal assistance. She presents to our emergency department with a painful right hip. Physical examination demonstrates a confused, elderly patient with significant right hip pain and shortening and external rotation of the lower extremity. Radiographs demonstrate a displaced intertrochanteric hip fracture. The patient lacks the capacity for informed consent. Her family is contacted to obtain consent for insertion of a compression screw. The family refuses to give consent, stating that the patient is too old and the surgery is too dangerous.
