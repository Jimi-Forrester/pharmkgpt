39063016|t|Adaptive and Maladaptive DNA Breaks in Neuronal Physiology and Alzheimer's Disease.
39063016|a|DNA strand breaks excessively accumulate in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). While traditionally considered random, deleterious events, neuron activity itself induces DNA breaks, and these "adaptive" breaks help mediate synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Recent studies mapping the brain DNA break landscape reveal that despite a net increase in DNA breaks in ectopic genomic hotspots, adaptive DNA breaks around synaptic genes are lost in AD brains, and this is associated with transcriptomic dysregulation. Additionally, relationships exist between mitochondrial dysfunction, a hallmark of AD, and DNA damage, such that mitochondrial dysfunction may perturb adaptive DNA break formation, while DNA breaks may conversely impair mitochondrial function. A failure of DNA break physiology could, therefore, potentially contribute to AD pathogenesis.
