37601693|t|Targeting MCL-1 protein to treat cancer: opportunities and challenges.
37601693|a|Evading apoptosis has been linked to tumor development and chemoresistance. One mechanism for this evasion is the overexpression of prosurvival B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family proteins, which gives cancer cells a survival advantage. Mcl-1, a member of the BCL-2 family, is among the most frequently amplified genes in cancer. Targeting myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) protein is a successful strategy to induce apoptosis and overcome tumor resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Various strategies to inhibit the antiapoptotic activity of MCL-1 protein, including transcription, translation, and the degradation of MCL-1 protein, have been tested. Neutralizing MCL-1's function by targeting its interactions with other proteins via BCL-2 interacting mediator (BIM)S2A has been shown to be an equally effective approach. Encouraged by the design of venetoclax and its efficacy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, scientists have developed other BCL-2 homology (BH3) mimetics-particularly MCL-1 inhibitors (MCL-1i)-that are currently in clinical trials for various cancers. While extensive reviews of MCL-1i are available, critical analyses focusing on the challenges of MCL-1i and their optimization are lacking. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge regarding clinically relevant MCL-1i and focus on predictive biomarkers of response, mechanisms of resistance, major issues associated with use of MCL-1i, and the future use of and maximization of the benefits from these agents.
