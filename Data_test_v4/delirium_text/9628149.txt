9628149|t|Treatment of insomnia by concomitant therapy with Zopiclone and Aniracetam in patients with cerebral infarction, cerebroatrophy, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
9628149|a|For insomniac patients, sleeping drugs are used: in addition, concomitant therapy with other drugs has been tried in an effort to prevent a decrease in the effects due to long-term continuous use. This report presents the results of a study on the sleeping effects in nine aged patients with insomnia associated with cerebrovascular and noncerebrovascular disorders who received concomitant therapy with Zopiclone and Aniracetam. The treatment in 7/9 cases (78%) was found to be effective, showing more than 50% prolongation of sleeping time, and in two cases (22%) was found to be ineffective. We discuss the mechanism of action referring to the literature.
