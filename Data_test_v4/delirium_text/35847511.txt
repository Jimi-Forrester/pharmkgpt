35847511|a|Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a multifunctional protein of the CCN family, regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and a variety of other biological processes. It is involved in the disease-related pathways such as the Hippo pathway, p53 and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) pathways and thus contributes to the developments of inflammation, fibrosis, cancer and other diseases as a downstream effector. Therefore, CTGF might be a potential therapeutic target for treating various diseases. In recent years, the research on the potential of CTGF in the treatment of diseases has also been paid more attention. Several drugs targeting CTGF (monoclonal antibodies FG3149 and FG3019) are being assessed by clinical or preclinical trials and have shown promising outcomes. In this review, the cellular events regulated by CTGF, and the relationships between CTGF and pathogenesis of diseases are systematically summarized. In addition, we highlight the current researches, focusing on the preclinical and clinical trials concerned with CTGF as the therapeutic target.
