38889254|t|Neuropsychiatric manifestations due to anticholinergic agents and anabolic steroids ingestion: A case series and literature review.
38889254|a|Anticholinergic toxicity is a common occurrence in the emergency room, making it crucial for emergency clinicians to have a good understanding of this toxidrome. The neuropsychiatric effects of anticholinergic agents and anabolic steroids (ASs) can manifest as symptoms like anxiety, agitation, dysarthria, confusion, seizures, visual hallucinations, bizarre behavior, delirium, psychosis, and coma. When dealing with a conscious patient who has ingested an anticholinergic substance, a detailed history of ingestion can aid clinicians in making an accurate diagnosis. However, the lack of information about the substances consumed can complicate diagnosis. In cases where the exposure is unknown, clinicians should consider anticholinergic poisoning in patients showing signs of altered mental status and physical examination findings consistent with anticholinergic toxicity. We report four cases presenting a range of symptoms, including neuropsychiatric manifestations, following the ingestion of the same bodybuilding powders with anticholinergic properties. All four patients consumed yellow and white powders at the same time and in the same place. Laboratory analysis revealed that yellow powder and white powder contained ASs and cyproheptadine, respectively.
