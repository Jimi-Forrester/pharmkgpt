33794116|a|CONTEXT: Pomelo peel oil (PPO) [Citrus maxima (Burm.) Merr. (Rutaceae)] is reported to possess antioxidant and antimelanogenic activities. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of PPO [Citrus maxima (Burm.) Merr. cv. Shatian Yu] on tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced necroptosis in cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) after cardiac arrest (CA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to six groups: sham group, PP0-L (10 mg/kg), PPO-M (20 mg/kg), PPO-H (40 mg/kg) and two control groups (CA, 0.9% saline; Gly, 10% glycerol). All drugs were administered intravenously to the CA/CPR rats within 10 min after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). After 24 h, rats were assessed for neuronal injury via the neurological deficit score (NDS), cerebral cortex staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and expression levels of TNF-alpha and necroptosis-related proteins by immunoreactivity staining and western blotting. RESULTS: Compared to those in the sham group (survival rate, 100% and NDS, 80), the survival rate and NDS were significantly reduced in the model groups (CA, 56.25%, 70; Gly, 62.5%, 71; PPO-L, 75%, 72; PPO-M, 87.5%, 75; PPO-H, 81.25%, 74). In the PPO-M group, Nissl bodies were significantly increased (43.67 +- 1.906 vs. 17 +- 1.732), the incidence of pathomorphological injury was lower and the necroptosis markers (TNF-alpha, RIPK1, RIPK3, p-MLKL/MLKL) expression was downregulated compared to those in the CA group (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The neuroprotective effects of PPO in the CA rats suggested that PPO possibility as a health product enhances the resistance ability against brain injury for humans.
