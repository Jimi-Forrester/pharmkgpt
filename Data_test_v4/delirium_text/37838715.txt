37838715|a|BACKGROUND: The effect of amyloid-beta (Abeta) on cognitive impairment in patients with small subcortical infarction remains controversial, although a growing body of evidence shows a substantial overlap between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and subcortical ischemic vascular dementia, another form of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). Therefore, we investigated the relationships between Abeta positivity and the development of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) in patients with small subcortical infarction. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 37 patients aged >= 50 years, with first-ever small subcortical infarction, who underwent amyloid positron emission tomography, 3 months after stroke at Korea University Guro Hospital. We also enrolled CU participants matched for age and sex with stroke patients for comparison of Abeta positivity. Patients were followed up at 3 and 12 months after the stroke to assess cognitive decline. Logistic and linear mixed-effect regression analyses were performed to identify the effect of Abeta positivity on PSCI development and long-term cognitive trajectories. RESULTS: At 3 months after stroke, 12/37 (32.4%) patients developed PSCI, and 11/37 (29.7%) patients had Abeta deposition. Abeta positivity (odds ratio [OR] = 72.2, p = 0.024) was predictive of PSCI development regardless of cSVD burden. Abeta positivity (beta = 0.846, p = 0.014) was also associated with poor cognitive trajectory, assessed by the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Box, for 1 year after stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that Abeta positivity is an important predictor for PSCI development and cognitive decline over 1 year. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that anti-AD medications may be a strategy for preventing cognitive decline in patients with small subcortical infarctions.
