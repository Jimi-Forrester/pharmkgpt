35448520|t|Lipidomics in Understanding Pathophysiology and Pharmacologic Effects in Inflammatory Diseases: Considerations for Drug Development.
35448520|a|The lipidome has a broad range of biological and signaling functions, including serving as a structural scaffold for membranes and initiating and resolving inflammation. To investigate the biological activity of phospholipids and their bioactive metabolites, precise analytical techniques are necessary to identify specific lipids and quantify their levels. Simultaneous quantification of a set of lipids can be achieved using high sensitivity mass spectrometry (MS) techniques, whose technological advancements have significantly improved over the last decade. This has unlocked the power of metabolomics/lipidomics allowing the dynamic characterization of metabolic systems. Lipidomics is a subset of metabolomics for multianalyte identification and quantification of endogenous lipids and their metabolites. Lipidomics-based technology has the potential to drive novel biomarker discovery and therapeutic development programs; however, appropriate standards have not been established for the field. Standardization would improve lipidomic analyses and accelerate the development of innovative therapies. This review aims to summarize considerations for lipidomic study designs including instrumentation, sample stabilization, data validation, and data analysis. In addition, this review highlights how lipidomics can be applied to biomarker discovery and drug mechanism dissection in various inflammatory diseases including cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, lung disease, and autoimmune disease.
