34130217|t|"Clicking" fragment leads to novel dual-binding cholinesterase inhibitors.
34130217|a|Cholinesterase inhibitors are potent therapeutics in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Among them, dual binding ligands have recently gained a lot of attention. We discovered novel dual-binding cholinesterase inhibitors, using "clickable" fragments, which bind to either catalytic active site (CAS) or peripheral anionic site (PAS) of the enzyme. Copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition allowed to effectively synthesize a series of final heterodimers, and modeling and kinetic studies confirmed their ability to bind to both CAS and PAS. A potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with IC50 = 18 nM (compound 23g) was discovered. A target-guided approach to link fragments by the enzyme itself was tested using butyrylcholinesterase.
