30518221|t|Relationships Between Cognitive Dysfunction and Health-Related Quality of Life Among Older Persons in Taiwan: A Nationwide Population-Based Survey.
30518221|a|BACKGROUND: To examine the relationships between cognitive dysfunction status and quality of life. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a nationwide population-based survey (>=65 years) in Taiwan. The 5-dimension EuroQoL questionnaire (EQ-5D) was completed by 10 013 participants. RESULTS: Participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; odds ratio = 4.88), very mild dementia (VMD; 7.96), or dementia (32.85) were more likely than those with normal cognition to report self-care problems. Participants with MCI (3.86), VMD (9.26), or dementia (31.61) were more likely to have usual-activity problems, and those with MCI (3.04), VMD (3.82), or dementia (9.23) were more likely to have mobility problems. Participants with MCI (2.10 and 2.14), VMD (2.77 and 2.18), or dementia (3.04 and 3.02) were more likely to report pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. CONCLUSION: Dementia was negatively associated with EQ-5D, especially self-care, usual activities, and mobility. Mild cognitive impairment or VMD was also negatively associated, with VMD more negatively associated. Developing interventions for patients with specific cognitive dysfunctions is critical.
