37293508|a|Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic endocrine metabolic disease caused by insulin dysregulation. Studies have shown that aging-related oxidative stress (as "oxidative aging") play a critical role in the onset and progression of T2DM, by leading to an energy metabolism imbalance. However, the precise mechanisms through which oxidative aging lead to T2DM are yet to be fully comprehended. Thus, it is urgent to integrate the underlying mechanisms between oxidative aging and T2DM, where meaningful prediction models based on relative profiles are needed. Methods: First, machine learning was used to build the aging model and disease model. Next, an integrated oxidative aging model was employed to identify crucial oxidative aging risk factors. Finally, a series of bioinformatic analyses (including network, enrichment, sensitivity, and pan-cancer analyses) were used to explore potential mechanisms underlying oxidative aging and T2DM. Results: The study revealed a close relationship between oxidative aging and T2DM. Our results indicate that nutritional metabolism, inflammation response, mitochondrial function, and protein homeostasis are key factors involved in the interplay between oxidative aging and T2DM, even indicating key indices across different cancer types. Therefore, various risk factors in T2DM were integrated, and the theories of oxi-inflamm-aging and cellular senescence were also confirmed. Conclusion: In sum, our study successfully integrated the underlying mechanisms linking oxidative aging and T2DM through a series of computational methodologies.
