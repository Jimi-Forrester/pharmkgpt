6206666|t|[Changes in the content of dense substances in the cerebral cortical neurons in alcoholic delirium].
6206666|a|An autopsy of ten patients with alcoholic delirium involved histochemical examination of the cerebral cortex neurons including quantitative determination of solid substances (proteins) and the study of the intensity of the reaction of RNA in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The content of solid substances was determined with the help of the interference microscope BINAM L-211. To perform visual evaluation of RNA levels, the sections of the cerebral tissue were stained by Einarson's method. The data obtained were compared with the results of the study of the control group (cases of sudden death in mentally normal subjects). Alcoholic delirium was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the content of solid substances (proteins) in the neuronal cytoplasm; a diminished intensity of response to RNA was also noted. Neuronal nuclei showed similar but less marked changes.
