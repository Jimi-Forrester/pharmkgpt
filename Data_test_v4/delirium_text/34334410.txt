34334410|t|Domain-Specific Cognitive Trajectories Among Patients with Minor Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack in a 6-Year Prospective Asian Cohort: Serial Patterns and Indicators.
34334410|a|BACKGROUND: Long-term post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) has often been overlooked, especially among patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). OBJECTIVE: To assess 6-year domain-specific cognitive trajectories among survivors of minor stroke or TIA and to identify possible indicators associated with cognitive trajectories, as well as long-term and incident PSCI. METHODS: Eligible participants completed cognitive and clinical assessments at baseline (2 weeks after stroke) and up to 5 follow-up visits in 6 years. Mixed linear models and generalized estimating equations were adopted to analyze longitudinal data and survival analysis to explore incident PSCI, controlling for demographic, clinical, and vascular indicators. RESULTS: The prevalence of PSCI and mortality rate ranged from 34.6% to 53.7%, and 0 to 7.7% respectively, among 244 patients. Incidence of PSCI was 21.9%. While visual memory demonstrated a significant improvement (p < 0.05), other cognitive domains showed a fluctuating yet stable pattern across visits (all ps > 0.05). Besides age, baseline IQCODE (attention: -0.218 SD/y, executive function: -0.238 SD/y, visual memory: -0.266 SD/y), and MoCA improvement within 1 year (visuoconstruction: 0.007 SD/y, verbal memory: 0.012 SD/y) were associated with longitudinal cognitive changes. Baseline MoCA (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = [0.59-0.74]), MoCA improvement within 3-6 months (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = [0.71-0.89], and within 1 year (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = [0.76-0.96]) were associated with long-term PSCI, while baseline MoCA (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = [0.61-0.96]) was also associated with incident PSCI. CONCLUSION: While most domains remained stable across-time, visual memory demonstrated an overall improvement. Short-term cognitive improvement could be an early indicator of long-term cognitive trajectory to identify individuals who may be resilient to PSCI.
