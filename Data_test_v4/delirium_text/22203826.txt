22203826|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The present study examined if knowledge of driving laws independently predicts on-the-road driving performance among cognitively impaired older adults. METHODS: The current study consisted of retrospective observational analyses on 55 cognitively impaired older adults (77.9 +- 6.4 years) that completed an on-the-road driving evaluation, a 20-item knowledge test of driving laws, and a brief cognitive test battery. RESULTS: Logistic regression found poorer performance on the knowledge test was significantly associated with greater likelihood of recommended driving cessation beyond important demographic and cognitive variables (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Cognitively impaired patients' ability to drive may be related to their knowledge regarding common driving laws, in addition to their current level of cognitive functioning.
