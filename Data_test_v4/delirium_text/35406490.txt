35406490|t|Recent Advances in CAR T-Cell Therapy for Patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.
35406490|a|Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR T cells) have resulted in dramatic treatment responses for patients with hematologic malignancies, resulting in improved survival for patients with intractable disease. The first patient treated with CD19 directed CAR T cell therapy had chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and achieved a complete remission. Subsequent clinical trials have focused largely on patients with other B-cell hematologic malignancies, owing to the fact that CAR T cell therapy for patients with CLL has met with challenges. More recent clinical trials have demonstrated CAR T cell therapy can be well tolerated and effective for patients with CLL, making it a potential treatment option for patients with this disease. In this article we review the background on CAR T cells for the treatment of patients with CLL, focusing on the unique obstacles that patients with CLL present for the development of adoptive T cell therapy, and the novel approaches currently under development to overcome these hurdles.
