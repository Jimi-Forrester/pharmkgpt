31031898|a|INTRODUCTION: Donepezil (DON), an Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor (AChEI), is widely used in the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The current study aimed at evaluating the effect of donepezil hydrochloride on pyramidal neuron response in CA1 region of a rat model of AD. METHODS: In the current experimental study, adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: Nucleus Basalis Magnocellularis (NBM) lesion (the lesions were induced by an electrical method of 0.5 m A, for 3 s in NBM) and three donepezil groups (lesions plus 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg donepezil intraperitoneal injection). Neuronal spontaneous activity to injection of the donepezil and saline were recorded in CA1 region of hippocampal. RESULTS: The obtained results showed that IntraPeritoneal (IP) injection of donepezil (10 and 15 mg/kg) increased neuronal spontaneous activity in the rat model of AD. CONCLUSION: The current study results suggested that acute IP injection of donepezil increased neuronal response in CA1 region of hippocampal in a rat model of AD.
