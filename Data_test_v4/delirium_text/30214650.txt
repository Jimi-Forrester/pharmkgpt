30214650|t|Pulmonary Artery Pseudoaneurysms in the Setting of Gout Polyarthropathy: A Case Report.
30214650|a|Pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm is a dangerous pathology often missed as a differential and on imaging. With a 50% mortality rate early detection and intervention are critical to patient outcome, rendering diagnosis based on clinical grounds to be of paramount importance. A high index of suspicion should be placed on patients presenting with unprovoked hemoptysis, hemorrhage or hemothorax. Knowledge of the common causes of pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysms is also important; however, it is integral to note spontaneous occurrences in patients with no known risk factors. Herein, we report a case of an unprovoked pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm in a 72-year-old male with no known risk factors or causes for the pathology. Additionally, we review the pathophysiology behind the potential association of polyarthritic gout as a cause of pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysms. To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported link between the two diseases, providing grounds to widen literature and increase diagnoses of pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysms.
