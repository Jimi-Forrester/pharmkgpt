38252656|t|Positive affect disrupts neurodegeneration effects on cognitive training plasticity in older adults.
38252656|a|Cognitive training for older adults varies in efficacy, but it is unclear why some older adults benefit more than others. Positive affective experience (PAE), referring to high positive valence and/or stable arousal states across everyday scenarios, and associated functional networks can protect plasticity mechanisms against Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration, which may contribute to training outcome variability. The objective of this study is to investigate whether PAE explains variability in cognitive training outcomes by disrupting the adverse effect of neurodegeneration on plasticity. The study's design is a secondary analysis of a randomized control trial of cognitive training with concurrent real or sham brain stimulation (39 older adults with mild cognitive impairment; mean age, 71). Moderation analyses, with change in episodic memory or executive function as the outcome, PAE or baseline resting-state connectivity as the moderator and baseline neurodegeneration as the predictor are the methods used in the study. The result of the study is that PAE stability and baseline default mode network (DMN) connectivity disrupted the effect of neurodegeneration on plasticity in executive function but not episodic memory. The study concludes that PAE stability and degree of DMN integrity both explained cognitive training outcome variability, by reducing the adverse effect of neurodegeneration on cognitive plasticity. We highlight the need to account for PAE, brain aging factors and their interactions with plasticity in cognitive training.
