31497712|t|Synthesis of Mono-N-Methyl Aromatic Amines from Nitroso Compounds and Methylboronic Acid.
31497712|a|The selective synthesis of mono-N-methyl aromatic amines was achieved by the reaction of aromatic nitroso compounds with methylboronic acid promoted by triethylphosphite under transition metal-free conditions. The target compounds are constructed efficiently without overmethylation, under environmentally benign reaction conditions that do not require bases or reductants and therefore are of interest in pharmaceutical, agricultural, and chemical industries.
