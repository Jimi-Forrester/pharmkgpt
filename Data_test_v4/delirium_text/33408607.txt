33408607|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate brain white matter (WM) fibers connectivity damage in stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) subjects by direct electrophysiological imaging (DELPHI) that analyzes transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked potentials (TEPs). METHODS: The study included 123 participants, out of which 53 subjects with WM-related pathologies (39 stroke, 14 TBI) and 70 healthy age-related controls. All subjects underwent DELPHI brain network evaluations of TMS-electroencephalogram (EEG)-evoked potentials and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans for quantification of WM microstructure fractional anisotropy (FA). RESULTS: DELPHI output measures show a significant difference between the healthy and stroke/TBI groups. A multidimensional approach was able to classify healthy from unhealthy with a balanced accuracy of 0.81 +- 0.02 and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 +- 0.01. Moreover, a multivariant regression model of DELPHI output measures achieved prediction of WM microstructure changes measured by FA with the highest correlations observed for fibers proximal to the stimulation area, such as frontal corpus callosum (r = 0.7 +- 0.02), anterior internal capsule (r = 0.7 +- 0.02), and fronto-occipital fasciculus (r = 0.65 +- 0.03). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that features of TMS-evoked response are correlated to WM microstructure changes observed in pathological conditions, such as stroke and TBI, and that a multidimensional approach combining these features in supervised learning methods serves as a strong indicator for abnormalities and changes in WM integrity.
