16242632|a|Cerebral deposition of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is an invariant feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To answer why soluble Abeta does not aggregate to beta-amyloid fibrils (fAbeta) in the brain of normal humans, we examined the influence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from AD and non-AD patients on the formation of fAbeta(1-40) and fAbeta(1-42) in vitro, by using fluorescence spectroscopy with thioflavin T and electron microscopy. Although the CSF obtained from both groups inhibited the formation of both fAbeta(1-40) and fAbeta(1-42), the CSF from non-AD patients inhibited the formation of fAbetas more strongly than that from AD patients. In AD patients, the final levels of fAbetas formation showed a significant negative correlation with the Abeta(1-42) level in CSF. These results indicate that fAbeta deposition in the brain of AD may be enhanced by the decrease of specific inhibitory factors and/or by the increase of specific accelerating factors in CSF.
