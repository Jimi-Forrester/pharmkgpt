39350365|t|Validation of an Ultra-Sensitive Method for Quantitation of Phospho-Tau 217 (pTau217) in Human Plasma, Serum, and CSF using the ALZpath pTau217 Assay on the Quanterix HD-X Platform.
39350365|a|BACKGROUND: Both blood (plasma and serum) and CSF tau phosphorylated at Threonine 217 (pTau217) have been shown to be able to discriminate early to mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders and healthy controls with high sensitivity and specificity. OBJECTIVES: We report the full validation of the ALZpath ultra-sensitive pTau217 research-use only (RUO) assays for human EDTA plasma, serum, and CSF using the Quanterix Simoa HD-X platform, in support of clinical trials and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The ALZpath pTau217 Simoa Advantage v2 kit from ALZpath/Quanterix was used for method development and validation of pTau217 in human plasma, serum, and CSF. All three method validations have followed the 2018 FDA BMV and 2022 ICH M10 guidelines. RESULTS: Validation of pTau217 quantitation in human plasma, serum, and CSF demonstrated that the validated pTau217 assay has an analytical LLOQ of 0.00977 pg/mL. It is one of the most sensitive assays with a minimal required sample volume of 33.3 microl for plasma and serum, and 5 microl for CSF, and is relatively cost-effective, compared to the currently published data. The minimum required dilution (MRD) for plasma, serum, and CSF were determined. The analyte passed short-term stability tests. It was also tolerant of moderate hemolytic, and lipemic interferences in plasma and serum. pTau217 was detected in 100% of tested healthy control plasma, 90.0% of healthy control serum, 92.3% of healthy control CSF samples, and 100% of AD plasma and CSF samples. The validated assay was successfully applied in the analysis of AD samples, with data showing dramatic differences in the pTau217 levels between healthy control subjects and AD patients in both plasma and CSF. CONCLUSION: Validation of the ALZpath pTau217 Simoa assay in human plasma, serum, and CSF demonstrates ultra sensitivity, high accuracy, and assay robustness. Together with other established and sensitive assays for pTau181, GFAP, and NfL, these assays have immediate utility for application in clinical trials and can play a role in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.
