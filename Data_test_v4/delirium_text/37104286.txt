37104286|t|Phenotypic and functional features of B cells from two different human subcutaneous adipose depots.
37104286|a|In this study, we have compared frequencies, phenotype, function and metabolic requirements of B cells isolated from the breast and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) of women with obesity who underwent weight reduction surgeries. Results show that B cells from the abdominal AT are more inflammatory than those from the breast, characterized by higher frequencies of inflammatory B cell subsets and higher expression of RNA for inflammatory markers associated with senescence. Secretion of autoimmune antibodies is also higher in the abdominal AT as compared to the breast, and is associated with higher frequencies of autoimmune B cells with the membrane phenotype CD21lowCD95+ B cells expressing the transcription factor T-bet. Moreover, glucose uptake is higher in B cells from the abdominal AT as compared to the breast, thereby suggesting a better capacity to perform glycolysis, needed to support intrinsic B cell inflammation and autoimmune antibody secretion.
