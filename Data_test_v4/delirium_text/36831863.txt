36831863|a|Physical exercise and cognitive remediation represent the psychosocial interventions with the largest basis of evidence attesting their effectiveness in improving cognitive performance in people living with schizophrenia according to recent international guidance. The aims of this review are to provide an overview of the literature on physical exercise as a treatment for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and of the studies that have combined physical exercise and cognitive remediation as an integrated rehabilitation intervention. Nine meta-analyses and systematic reviews on physical exercise alone and seven studies on interventions combining physical exercise and cognitive remediation are discussed. The efficacy of physical exercise in improving cognitive performance in people living with schizophrenia is well documented, but more research focused on identifying moderators of participants response and optimal modalities of delivery is required. Studies investigating the effectiveness of integrated interventions report that combining physical exercise and cognitive remediation provides superior benefits and quicker improvements compared to cognitive remediation alone, but most studies included small samples and did not explore long-term effects. While physical exercise and its combination with cognitive remediation appear to represent effective treatments for cognitive impairment in people living with schizophrenia, more evidence is currently needed to better understand how to implement these treatments in psychiatric rehabilitation practice.
