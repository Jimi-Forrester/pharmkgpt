28608815|t|Gold Electrodes Modified with Calix[4]arene for Electrochemical Determination of Dopamine in the Presence of Selected Neurotransmitters.
28608815|a|Here, we present an electrochemical sensor based on gold electrodes modified with calix[4]arene functionalized with carboxypiperidino groups at the upper rim. It has been demonstrated that these groups are involved in a complex formation with dopamine (DA) on the surface of gold electrodes. The supramolecular complex calix[4]arene-DA created on the gold electrode surface has been characterized electrochemically and the measuring conditions have been optimized. The presented sensor displayed a detection limit in the pM range. The DA determination was performed successfully in the presence of ascorbic acid, uric acid and selected neurotransmitters.
