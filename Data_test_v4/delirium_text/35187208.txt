35187208|a|Modern lifestyle and adversities such as the COVID-19 pandemic pose challenges for our physical and mental health. Hence, it is of the utmost importance to identify mechanisms by which we can improve resilience to stress and quickly adapt to adversity. While there are several factors that improve stress resilience, social behavior-primarily in the form of social touch-is especially vital. This article provides an overview of how the somatosensory system plays a key role in translating the socio-emotional information of social touch into active coping with stress. Important future directions include evaluating in humans whether stress resilience can be modulated through the stimulation of low-threshold C-fiber mechanoreceptors and using this technology in the prevention of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder.
