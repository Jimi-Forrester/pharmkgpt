33102941|a|Retinal degeneration is a main class of ocular diseases. So far, retinal progenitor cell (RPC) transplantation has been the most potential therapy for it, in which promoting RPCs neuronal differentiation remains an unmet challenge. To address this issue, innovatively designed L/ d - phenylalanine based chiral nanofibers (LPG and DPG) are employed and it finds that chirality of fibers can efficiently regulate RPCs differentiation. qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence analysis show that right-handed helical DPG nanofibers significantly promote RPCs neuronal differentiation, whereas left-handed LPG nanofibers decrease this effect. These effects are mainly ascribed to the stereoselective interaction between chiral helical nanofibers and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4, a key protein in the retinoic acid (RA) metabolic pathway). The findings of chirality-dependent neuronal differentiation provide new strategies for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases via optimizing differentiation of transplanted stem cells on chiral nanofibers.
