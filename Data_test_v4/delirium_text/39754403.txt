39754403|t|Neurobiology of COVID-19-Associated Psychosis/Schizophrenia: Implication of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Signaling.
39754403|a|COVID-19 exhibits not only respiratory symptoms but also neurological/psychiatric symptoms rarely including delirium/psychosis. Pathological studies on COVID-19 provide evidence that the cytokine storm, in particular (epidermal growth factor) EGF receptor (EGFR, ErbB1, Her1) activation, plays a central role in the progression of viral replication and lung fibrosis. Of note, SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically, S1 spike domain) mimics EGF and directly transactivates EGFR, preceding the inflammatory process. In agreement, the anticancer drugs targeting EGFR such as Nimotuzumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are markedly effective on COVID-19. However, these data might raise a provisional caution regarding implication of psychiatric disorder such as schizophrenia. The author's group has been investigating the etiologic and neuropathologic associations of EGFR signaling with schizophrenia. There are significant molecular associations between schizophrenia and EGFR ligand levels in blood as well as in the brain. In addition, perinatal challenges of EGFR ligands and intraventricular administration of EGF to rodents and monkeys both resulted in severe behavioral and/or electroencephalographic endophenotypes relevant to this disorder. These animal models also display postpubertal abnormality in soliloquy-like self-vocalization as well as in intercortical functional connectivity. Here, we discuss neuropsychiatric implication of coronavirus infection and its interaction with the EGFR system, by searching related literatures in PubMed database as of the end of 2023.
