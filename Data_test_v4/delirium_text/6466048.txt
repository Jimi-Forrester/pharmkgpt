6466048|t|Suicide in alcoholism. A prospective study of 88 suicides: I. The multidimensional diagnosis at first admission.
6466048|a|A series of 1,312 alcoholics admitted to the Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden, from 1949 through 1969, were followed up until Dec 31, 1980. Eighty-eight (16%) of a total of 537 deaths were officially registered as suicides. The conditions of all alcoholics were evaluated with a multidimensional diagnostic rating schedule at first admission. Alcoholics who later committed suicide had a higher rate of depressive and dysphoric symptoms and were more brittle and sensitive than the others, while the frequencies of cognitive impairment and delirium tremens were similar. Peptic ulcers were more frequent in the suicide group (21% v 7%). The ratings did not differentiate between those who committed suicide early or late after admission.
