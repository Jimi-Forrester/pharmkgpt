33786443|t|Characterization of Nocturnal Neuroactive Medication Use and Related Sleep Documentation in Critically Ill Adults.
33786443|a|We retrospectively characterized scheduled, newly initiated, nocturnal neuroactive medication use, and related clinician documentation, in a cohort of consecutive adults admitted greater than or equal to 24 hours to seven different medical/surgical ICUs at two academic centers who had not received a scheduled nocturnal neuroactive medication prior to admission, over a 5-month period (April 1, 2017, to August 31, 2017). A total of 207 different newly initiated, scheduled nocturnal neuroactive medication orders were written (melatonin agonist 101 [48.8%], antipsychotic 80 [38.6%], antidepressant 17 [8.2%], benzodiazepine 9 [4.3%]) in 189 (9.7%) of the 1,955 patients. Among the 1,553 nights, the 189 patients spent in the ICU, a scheduled nocturnal neuroactive medication was administered on 1,103 (71%), an "as needed" nocturnal neuroactive medication was solely administered on 183 (11.8%), delirium occurred on 736 (47.4%), and nurses were twice as likely as physicians (28.8% vs 11.4%; p < 0.0001) to document a note about sleep quality. Among the 69.8% of patients discharged to the floor, and the 64.5% from the hospital, the scheduled nocturnal neuroactive medication was continued in 85.6% and 87.3%, respectively. Scheduled nocturnal neuroactive medication initiation is common, often continued beyond hospital discharge, and poorly documented.
