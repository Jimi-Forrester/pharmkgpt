35852718|a|BACKGROUND: Although many reports have shown that preoperative dementia affects surgical prognosis, it is unclear whether the dementia based on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) affect hospital mortality in old old patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery. AIMS: This study aims to investigate whether preoperative dementia might affect the outcomes of old old patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery by evaluating with the MMSE. METHODS: All patients aged >= 75 years who undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery form January 2015 to December 2021 in a Chinese tertiary hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Their preoperative cognitive status was evaluated using the MMSE, and analysis was performed to compare the patients with MMSE score < 24 (dementia group) or MMSE score 24-30 (non-dementia group). Risk factors for hospital mortality were explored using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 980 patients were rolled in the study, and 102 (10.4%) patients were in the dementia group. ICU and hospital stay were longer in the dementia group. Regarding the postoperative complications, the incidence of cerebral infarction (P = 0.014), delirium (P = 0.019), and pulmonary infection (P = 0.017) was more frequent in dementia group. Hospital mortality was 11% in the dementia group and 3% in the non-dementia group (P = 0.009). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that dementia (P = 0.0135), preoperative lower albumin (P = 0.0018) and malignancy (P = 0.0212) were independent risk factors for hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Among old old patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery, hospital mortality was increased significantly for patients with dementia evaluating with the MMSE.
