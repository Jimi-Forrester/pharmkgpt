23691800|a|The association between diabetes mellitus and the risk of developing dementia has received much attention in epidemiological studies. However, the results from these studies are still inconclusive. An accurate population-based prospective cohort study of dementia was begun in 1985 in the town of Hisayama, Japan. To examine the association between the glucose tolerance status and development of dementia, a total of 1,017 community-dwelling dementia-free subjects aged > or = 60 years who underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test were followed up for 15 years. We demonstrated that people with diabetes were at an increasing risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). Moreover, 2-hour post-load glucose levels were closely associated with an increased risk of AD and VaD, but no such associations were observed for fasting plasma glucose levels.
