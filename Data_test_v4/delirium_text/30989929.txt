30989929|a|Fangji Dihuang Decoction and Fengyin Decoction, which were firstly recorded in Synopsis of the Golden Chamber, could be used to treat stroke. However, both of these two decoctions are used infrequently. There is a clear pathogenesis of modern pathophysiology behind Fangji Dihuang Decoction syndrome and Fengyin Decoction syndrome, which can be interpreted by modern language of science. Fangji Dihuang Decoction can nourish Yin, tonify kidney, extinguish the wind, and dredge collaterals. It could be used to treat mania caused by cerebral infarction, senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease and other cerebrovascular diseases, and opened up the precedent of nourishing Yin and expelling wind to treat stroke in later generations. Fengyin Decoction can clear heat, extinguish the wind, and calm the mind. It can be used to treat cerebral infarction, limb paralysis and epileptic seizures with heat syndrome. It may be equivalent to "oriental olanzapine", and opened up the precedent of smoothing liver and suppressing Yang to treat stroke in later generations. They can be used in the combination, with a high application value in treating stroke and mental diseases.
