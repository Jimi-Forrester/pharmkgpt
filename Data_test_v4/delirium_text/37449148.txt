37449148|a|Currently, millions of people are exposed to dangerous levels of chemical and biological water pollution in drinking water due to source contamination. The rising of populations and industrialization or agricultural wastewaters were causes of water contaminations. The aim of this study was to design, develop and performance evaluation of point of use drinking water purification technology using MoringaOleifera seed coupled followed by scoria coag-filtration media. Experimental laboratory based aquas solution of contaminated water was prepared for evaluations. Moringa Oleifera seed coagulation/flocculation and sedimentation tests were carried out using jar test with the batch experiment. The potential treatment of the sequential ordered unit process stages were evaluated by the determination of physicochemical parameters of the water; such as turbidity, Color, PO4-3, Fe+3 and F-concentration. The factor that affects the purification where coagulant doses, pH, and contact time. Based on this, the physicochemical parameter analysis indicated that turbidity from (150-8NTU), PO4-3 (20-5.95 mg/L), Fe+3 (7-2.93 mg/L) and F- (9-2.83 mg/L), Moringa Oleifera seed dose (10-40 mL/L) extract paste. The maximum pollutant removal efficiency was achieved at 35 mL/L of Moringa Oleifera seed extractdose, within 6.5-7.5 pH range. Then VSco filtration was conducted after jar test under small column experiment as a function of contact time (0, 2, 4 h s). The VSco removal capacity showed that the removal of turbidityfrom (8-2.54NTU), PO4-3 (5.95-1.07 mg/L), Fe+3 (2.93-0.43 mg/L) and F- (2.83-1.94 mg/L) were achieved after 4hr detention time. The percent removal of turbidity, PO4-3, Fe+3 and F- increases remarkably with increasing of their initial concentration. At an initial concentration of turbidity (150NTU), PO4-3 (20 mg/L), Fe+3 (7 mg/L) and F-(9 mg/L), the removal efficiency were 98%, 84%, 85% and 60% respectively. Therefore, we recommend Moringa Oleifera seed -Vscoas an economic, efficient and simple Point of Use drinking water treatment technology.
