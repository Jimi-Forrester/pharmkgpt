37628896|t|Maintenance of Flap Endonucleases for Long-Patch Base Excision DNA Repair in Mouse Muscle and Neuronal Cells Differentiated In Vitro.
37628896|a|After cellular differentiation, nuclear DNA is no longer replicated, and many of the associated proteins are downregulated accordingly. These include the structure-specific endonucleases Fen1 and DNA2, which are implicated in repairing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Two more such endonucleases, named MGME1 and ExoG, have been discovered in mitochondria. This category of nuclease is required for so-called "long-patch" (multinucleotide) base excision DNA repair (BER), which is necessary to process certain oxidative lesions, prompting the question of how differentiation affects the availability and use of these enzymes in mitochondria. In this study, we demonstrate that Fen1 and DNA2 are indeed strongly downregulated after differentiation of neuronal precursors (Cath.a-differentiated cells) or mouse myotubes, while the expression levels of MGME1 and ExoG showed minimal changes. The total flap excision activity in mitochondrial extracts of these cells was moderately decreased upon differentiation, with MGME1 as the predominant flap endonuclease and ExoG playing a lesser role. Unexpectedly, both differentiated cell types appeared to accumulate less oxidative or alkylation damage in mtDNA than did their proliferating progenitors. Finally, the overall rate of mtDNA repair was not significantly different between proliferating and differentiated cells. Taken together, these results indicate that neuronal cells maintain mtDNA repair upon differentiation, evidently relying on mitochondria-specific enzymes for long-patch BER.
