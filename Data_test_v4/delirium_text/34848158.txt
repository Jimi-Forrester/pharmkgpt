34848158|t|Increasing Rates of Prone Positioning in Acute Care Patients with COVID-19.
34848158|a|BACKGROUND: Prone positioning improves mortality in patients intubated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and has been proposed as a treatment for nonintubated patients with COVID-19 outside the ICU. However, there are substantial patient and operational barriers to prone positioning on acute floors. The objective of this project was to increase the frequency of prone positioning among acute care patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The researchers conducted a retrospective analysis of all adult patients admitted to the acute care floors with COVID-19 respiratory failure. A run chart was used to quantify the frequency of prone positioning over time. For the subset of patients assisted by a dedicated physical therapy team, oxygen before and after positioning was compared. The initiative consisted of four separate interventions: (1) nursing, physical therapy, physician, and patient education; (2) optimization of supply management and operations; (3) an acute care prone positioning team; and (4) electronic health record optimization. RESULTS: From March 9, 2020, to August 26, 2020, 176/875 (20.1%) patients were placed in prone position. Among these, 43 (24.4%) were placed in the prone position by the physical therapy team. Only 2/94 (2.1%) eligible patients admitted in the first two weeks of the pandemic were ever documented in prone position. After launching the initiative, weekly frequency peaked at 13/28 (46.4%). Mean oxygen saturation was 91% prior to prone positioning vs. 95.2% after (p < 0.001) in those positioned by physical therapy. CONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary quality improvement initiative increased frequency of prone positioning by proactively addressing barriers in knowledge, equipment, training, and information technology.
