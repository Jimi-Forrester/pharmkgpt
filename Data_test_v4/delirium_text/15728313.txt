15728313|t|Cystatin C as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease.
15728313|a|Cystatin C, a protease inhibitor with widespread distribution, is upregulated in response to injury. Levels are elevated in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). We compared frequencies for the CST 3 exon 1 polymorphism in patients with AD and controls. A proportional odds model indicated that the CST 3 A and APOE4 combination carried a high risk: a 14-fold elevation for men and 16-fold for women. These risks apply to risk at ages older than 64 years and to a shift in onset to ages younger than 65 years.
