37609004|a|The disease trajectory and healthcare requirements of patients with young-onset dementia (YOD) differ from those of older patients. Accurate data about YOD is crucial to improve diagnosis and optimize care. PRECODE-GP aims to set up a prospective national database of patients with YOD to gain insight into the occurrence and characteristics of patients with YOD in memory clinics in the Netherlands. The national database includes data from dementia patients aged <70 years at diagnosis, collected by local memory clinics (MCs). Data included demographic information, clinical variables, and (etiological) diagnoses. Between July 2019 and December 2022, 781 patients with a mean age of 62+-6y at diagnosis (range 37 to 69y) were included from 39 MCs. Most (n = 547,70%) were diagnosed with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients with Frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTD, n = 87, 11%) were youngest (61+-6.0y). Over half (55%) of patients were experiencing symptoms for >=2 years. We initiated a Dutch national YOD database to improve diagnosis and care for this underrepresented and vulnerable patient group. The database provides a basis for future in-depth studies on YOD.
