25191179|a|BACKGROUND: Different methods and many drugs have been used to control the post-operative pain. In this study, we evaluate the role of gabapentin premedication and/or dexamethasone in management of post-operative pain following adenotonsillectomy in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a double-blind randomized study, 120 children were subjected for adenotonsillectomy classified into three equal groups. Group G: Gabapentin 10 mg/kg was given orally 2 h before induction of anesthesia (Gabapentin syrup 250 mg/5 ml. Group D: Children in this group received placebo pre-operatively and received dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg intravenously after induction of anesthesia, but before surgery. Group C: Children in this group received combination of oral gabapentin 10 mg/kg 2 h before induction of anesthesia and intra-operative 0.15 mg/kg dexamethasone intravenously. All children underwent general anesthesia. Pain score was assisted post-operatively 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h and 18 h after recovery using face, legs, activity, cry, consolability scale. RESULTS: Pain score in Group C and Group G was significantly less at 4 h, 6 h and 8 h post-operatively than in Group D (P < 0.05). At 12 h, the pain score in Group C was significantly less than Group G and Group D (P < 0.05). And no significant changes were observed in pain score at 18 h post-operatively between all groups (P > 0.05). The time to first analgesia was longer in the Group C than in Group G and Group D and the time to first analgesia was significantly longer in Group G than in Group D (P < 0.05). The total amount of pethidine was less in Group C and Group G than in Group D (P < 0.05). The incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting was statically insignificant among all groups and no reported post-operative bleeding. CONCLUSION: Gabapentin 10 mg/kg premedication combined with intra-operative dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg prolongs the post-operative analgesia following adenotonsillectomy in children and decreases the amount of pethidine used post-operatively with no reported adverse effects or increase in the incidence of post-operative bleeding.
