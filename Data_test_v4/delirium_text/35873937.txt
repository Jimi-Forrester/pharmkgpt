35873937|t|A Review of Oral Semaglutide Available Evidence: A New Era of Management of Diabetes with Peptide in a Pill Form.
35873937|a|Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have gained an important place in the management of diabetes management because of their exceptional glucose-lowering, weight lowering and cardiovascular (CV) benefits. Despite recommendations by various clinical practice guidelines and benefits, their usage in clinical practice was limited because of being injectable in nature. Oral semaglutide is a novel GLP-1RA with 94% homology to human GLP-1 which is co-formulated with absorption enhancer sodium N-(8-[2-hydroxybenzoyl] amino) caprylate (SNAC), that overcomes the challenges of peptide absorption in the acidic conditions of the stomach. Oral semaglutide has been evaluated in an extensive phase 3 clinical trial programme named Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment (PIONEER) which demonstrated its robust glucose and weight lowering effects against other comparators. The evolution of the GLP-1RA class to include an oral pill will facilitate the use of this class of agents much earlier in the diabetes treatment cascade owing to wider acceptance from patients and clinicians alike. The current review discusses the various aspects of oral semaglutide and its place in clinical practice.
