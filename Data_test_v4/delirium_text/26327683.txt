26327683|a|Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in plaques in the brain and in artery walls as cerebral amyloid angiopathy indicates a failure of elimination of Abeta from the brain with age and Alzheimer's disease. A major pathway for elimination of Abeta and other soluble metabolites from the brain is along basement membranes within the walls of cerebral arteries that represent the lymphatic drainage pathways for the brain. The motive force for the elimination of Abeta along this perivascular pathway appears to be the contrary (reflection) wave that follows the arterial pulse wave. Following injection into brain parenchyma, Abeta rapidly drains out of the brain along basement membranes in the walls of cerebral arteries; such drainage is impaired in apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (ApoE4) mice. For drainage of Abeta to occur in a direction contrary to the pulse wave, some form of attachment to basement membrane would be required to prevent reflux of Abeta back into the brain during the passage of the subsequent pulse wave. In this study, we show first that apolipoprotein E co-localizes with Abeta in basement membrane drainage pathways in the walls of arteries. Secondly, we show by Atomic Force Microscopy that attachment of ApoE4/Abeta complexes to basement membrane laminin is significantly weaker than ApoE3/Abeta complexes. These results suggest that perivascular elimination of ApoE4/Abeta complexes would be less efficient than with other isoforms of apolipoprotein E, thus endowing a higher risk for Alzheimer's disease. Therapeutic correction for ApoE4/Abeta/laminin interactions may increase the efficiency of elimination of Abeta in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.
