35978311|a|Neuroinflammation is instigated by the misfiring of immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) involving microglia and astrocytes as key cell-types. Neuroinflammation is a consequence of CNS injury, infection, toxicity, or autoimmunity. It is favorable as well as a detrimental process for neurodevelopment and associated processes. Transient activation of inflammatory response involving release of cytokines and growth factors positively affects the development and post-injury tissue. However, chronic or uncontrolled inflammatory responses may lead to various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. These diseases have variable clinical and pathological features, but are underlaid by the aggregation of misfolded proteins with a cytotoxic effect. Notably, abnormal activation of glial cells could mediate neuroinflammation, leading to the neurodegenerative condition. Microglia, a type of glial cell, a resident immune cell, form the forefront defense of the CNS immune system. Dysfunctional microglia and astrocyte, a different kind of glial cell with homeostatic function, impairs the protein aggregate (amyloid-beta plaque) clearance in AD. Studies have shown that microglia and astrocytes undergo alterations in their genetic profile, cellular and molecular responses, and thus promote dysfunctional immune cross-talk in AD. Hence, targeting microglia and astrocytes-driven molecular pathways could resolve the particular layers of neuroinflammation and set a reliable therapeutic intervention in AD progression.
