28930654|t|A Tale of Two Genes: Microglial Apoe and Trem2.
28930654|a|Microglial cell function is implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease by human genetics. In this issue of Immunity, Krasemann et al. (2017) describe a gene expression signature associated with an APOE- and TREM2-dependent response of microglia to brain tissue damage that accumulates in aging and disease, defining an axis that might be amenable to therapeutic targeting.
