38796462|a|Disease models of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) offer the possibility to explore the relationship between iron dyshomeostasis and neurodegeneration. We analyzed hiPS-derived astrocytes from PANK2-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), an NBIA disease characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and high iron accumulation in the globus pallidus. Previous data indicated that PKAN astrocytes exhibit alterations in iron metabolism, general impairment of constitutive endosomal trafficking, mitochondrial dysfunction and acquired neurotoxic features. Here, we performed a more in-depth analysis of the interactions between endocytic vesicles and mitochondria via superresolution microscopy experiments. A significantly lower number of transferrin-enriched vesicles were in contact with mitochondria in PKAN cells than in control cells, confirming the impaired intracellular fate of cargo endosomes. The investigation of cytosolic and mitochondrial iron parameters indicated that mitochondrial iron availability was substantially lower in PKAN cells compared to that in the controls. In addition, PKAN astrocytes exhibited defects in tubulin acetylation/phosphorylation, which might be responsible for unregulated vesicular dynamics and inappropriate iron delivery to mitochondria. Thus, the impairment of iron incorporation into these organelles seems to be the cause of cell iron delocalization, resulting in cytosolic iron overload and mitochondrial iron deficiency, triggering mitochondrial dysfunction. Overall, the data elucidate the mechanism of iron accumulation in CoA deficiency, highlighting the importance of mitochondrial iron deficiency in the pathogenesis of disease.
