37046987|t|The Role of Gasotransmitter-Dependent Signaling Mechanisms in Apoptotic Cell Death in Cardiovascular, Rheumatic, Kidney, and Neurodegenerative Diseases and Mental Disorders.
37046987|a|Cardiovascular, rheumatic, kidney, and neurodegenerative diseases and mental disorders are a common cause of deterioration in the quality of life up to severe disability and death worldwide. Many pathological conditions, including this group of diseases, are based on increased cell death through apoptosis. It is known that this process is associated with signaling pathways controlled by a group of gaseous signaling molecules called gasotransmitters. They are unique messengers that can control the process of apoptosis at different stages of its implementation. However, their role in the regulation of apoptotic signaling in these pathological conditions is often controversial and not completely clear. This review analyzes the role of nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in apoptotic cell death in cardiovascular, rheumatic, kidney, and neurodegenerative diseases. The signaling processes involved in apoptosis in schizophrenia, bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders are also considered. The role of gasotransmitters in apoptosis in these diseases is largely determined by cell specificity and concentration. NO has the greatest dualism; scales are more prone to apoptosis. At the same time, CO, H2S, and SO2 are more involved in cytoprotective processes.
