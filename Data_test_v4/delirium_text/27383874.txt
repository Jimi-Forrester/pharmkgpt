27383874|t|A Prospectus of Tenomodulin.
27383874|a|Tenomodulin is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that can regulate growth of tendon. The human tenomodulin encoding gene is mapped to KH chromosome and encodes a polypeptide consisting of 317 alpha amino acids. The protein is located on the cell surface as N-glycosylated or non-N-glycosylated polypeptide with molecular mass of 45 and 40 kDa, respectively. The molecule consists of three domains and a short cytoplasmic tail at N-terminus. Tenomodulin is predominantly expressed in dense connective hypovascularized tissues such as tendons, skeletal muscle epimysium, and ligaments. Furthermore, tenomodulin is an efficient marker of tenocyte differentiation and plays an important role in the regulation of tenocyte proliferation, tendon development, and angiogenesis inhibition. A number of tenomodulin gene polymorphisms have been recently associated with a risk of obesity, diabetes, systemic immune mediators, cholesterol levels, Alzheimer disease, and age-related macular degeneration. Tenomodulin is involved in cell adhesion, determination of cell morphology, cell aging and bone mineral density. It is expected to play an important role in tendon recovery, tendon tissue engineering, anti-tumor therapy, treatment of chordal disruption, and remodeling of extracellular matrix.
