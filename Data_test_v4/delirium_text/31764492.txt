31764492|t|The Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test: A Useful Tool in Screening of Cognitive Impairment in Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
31764492|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an inflammatory, chronic, and multisystemic disease, which may be associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric manifestations, including cognitive impairment. Cognitive evaluations based on screening tests might identify early SLE-related cognitive alterations. The aim of this study was to evaluate and to compare the efficacy of three screening tests (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA], Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE], Cognitive Symptom Inventory [CSI]) against the gold standard (neuropsychological battery), in order to identify the most efficient screening test for cognitive impairment in patients with SLE. METHODS: This observational cross-sectional study recruited 44 patients, from August to December 2017, who were diagnosed with SLE according to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) Criteria 2012, and had no medical or psychiatric comorbidities. The patients were evaluated using the MoCA, MMSE, CSI, and the gold standard. Spearman's correlation and area under the curve analysis were performed; p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The MoCA test showed the highest correspondence with the gold standard (AUC = 99.4%, p < 0.001), sensitivity (84%), and specificity (100%). This was followed by the MMSE (AUC = 92.6%, p < 0.001; sensitivity, 54.8%; specificity, 100%) and the CSI (AUC = 30.6%, p < 0.05; sensitivity, 54.8%; specificity, 30.76%). CONCLUSION: The MoCA is a brief, easily applied screening test that is highly effective for detecting cognitive impairment in SLE patients. It could be useful in clinical follow-up as a tool for early detection of cognitive alterations.
