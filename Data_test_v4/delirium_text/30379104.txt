30379104|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium affects nearly half of octogenarian patients after aortic valve replacement, resulting in impaired cognition, reduced awareness and hallucinations. Although healthcare professionals and relatives are often present during episodes, the nature of interactions with them is scarcely studied, and little is known about their long-term experiences. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore and describe how octogenarian patients with post-aortic valve replacement delirium experience interactions with healthcare professionals and relatives within the first year and four years later. METHOD: An explorative design with qualitative content analysis was used. Delirium was assessed for five consecutive days after aortic valve replacement using the Confusion Assessment Method. Delirious patients ( n=10) were interviewed 6-12 months post-discharge and four years later ( n=5). We used an inductive approach to identify themes in transcribed interviews. FINDINGS: An overarching theme emerged: ' Healthcare professionals' and relatives' responses made a considerable impact on the delirium experience postoperatively and in a long-term'. Three sub-themes described the patients' experiences: ' the need for close supportive care', ' disrespectful behaviour created a barrier' and ' insensitive comments made lasting impressions'. Having healthcare professionals and relatives nearby made the patients feel secure, while lack of attention elevated patients' emotional distress. Four years later, patients clearly recalled negative comments and unsupportive actions in their delirious state. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals and relatives have an essential role in the aortic valve replacement recovery process. Inconsiderate behaviour directed at older patients in delirium elevates distress and has long-term implications. Supportive care focused on maintaining the patients' dignity and integrity is vital.
