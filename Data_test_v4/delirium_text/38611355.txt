38611355|t|Preparation of Edible Colorant Lake Using Calcium Carbonate and beta-Carotene: Structural Characterization and Formation Mechanism Study.
38611355|a|This study prepared a novel beta-carotene colorant lake using calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and investigated the lake formation process and its basic characteristics. Kinetic adsorption analysis confirmed that medium pH (9.3) and medium temperature (40  C) were more suitable for lake preparation, while desorption occurred, possibly due to crystalline transformation of CaCO3. The isothermal analysis and model fitting results suggested that the beta-carotene and CaCO3 particles combined via a monolayer adsorption process driven by physical force. Electrostatic attraction likely participated in the process due to the net negative surface charges of beta-carotene dispersion and positively charged groups on the CaCO3 particle surfaces. Ethanol, ultrasonic treatment, and drying method significantly influenced the immobilization efficiency (IE) of beta-carotene in the lake and light stability of the lake, without affecting its crystal form. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves confirmed absorption of beta-carotene onto CaCO3. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses indicated no obvious chemical bonds between beta-carotene and CaCO3. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the presence of beta-carotene on surfaces but not in the interior of the CaCO3 particles. The adsorption of beta-carotene by calcium carbonate was further confirmed to be a physical adsorption on surface.
