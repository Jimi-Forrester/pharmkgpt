38552113|a| Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia in the world. It affects 6 million people in the United States and 50 million people worldwide. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques (Abeta), an increase in tau protein neurofibrillary tangles, and a loss of synapses. Since the 1990s, removing and reducing Abeta has been the focus of Alzheimer's treatment and prevention research. The accumulation of Abeta can lead to oxidative stress, inflammation, neurotoxicity, and eventually apoptosis. These insults impair signaling systems in the brain, potentially leading to memory loss and cognitive decline. Aniracetam is a safe, effective, cognitive-enhancing drug that improves memory in both human and animal studies. Aniracetam may prevent the production and accumulation of Abeta by increasing alpha-secretase activity through two distinct pathways: 1) increasing brain derived neurotrophic factor expression and 2) positively modulating metabotropic glutamate receptors. This is the first paper to propose an evidence-based model for aniracetam reducing the accumulation and production of Abeta.
