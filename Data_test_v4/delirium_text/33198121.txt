33198121|t|Fungal Pigments and Their Roles Associated with Human Health.
33198121|a|Fungi can produce myriad secondary metabolites, including pigments. Some of these pigments play a positive role in human welfare while others are detrimental. This paper reviews the types and biosynthesis of fungal pigments, their relevance to human health, including their interactions with host immunity, and recent progresses in their structure-activity relationships. Fungal pigments are grouped into carotenoids, melanin, polyketides, and azaphilones, etc. These pigments are phylogenetically broadly distributed. While the biosynthetic pathways for some fungal pigments are known, the majority remain to be elucidated. Understanding the genes and metabolic pathways involved in fungal pigment synthesis is essential to genetically manipulate the production of both the types and quantities of specific pigments. A variety of fungal pigments have shown wide-spectrum biological activities, including promising pharmacophores/lead molecules to be developed into health-promoting drugs to treat cancers, cardiovascular disorders, infectious diseases, Alzheimer's diseases, and so on. In addition, the mechanistic elucidation of the interaction of fungal pigments with the host immune system provides valuable clues for fighting fungal infections. The great potential of fungal pigments have opened the avenues for academia and industries ranging from fundamental biology to pharmaceutical development, shedding light on our endeavors for disease prevention and treatment.
