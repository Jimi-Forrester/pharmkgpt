34291086|a|It has been shown that protein low-sequence complexity domains (LCDs) induce liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which is responsible for the formation of membrane-less organelles including P-granules, stress granules and Cajal bodies. Proteins harbouring LCDs are widely represented among RNA binding proteins often mutated in ALS. Indeed, LCDs predispose proteins to a prion-like behaviour due to their tendency to form amyloid-like structures typical of proteinopathies. Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) can influence phase transition through two main events: i) destabilizing or augmenting multivalent interactions between phase-separating macromolecules; ii) recruiting or excluding other proteins and/or nucleic acids into/from the condensate. In this manuscript we summarize the existing evidence describing how PTM can modulate LLPS thus favouring or counteracting proteinopathies at the base of neurodegeneration in ALS.
