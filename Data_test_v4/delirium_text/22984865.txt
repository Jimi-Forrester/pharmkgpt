22984865|t|Spirocyclic sulfamides as beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1) inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: utilization of structure based drug design, WaterMap, and CNS penetration studies to identify centrally efficacious inhibitors.
22984865|a|beta-Secretase 1 (BACE-1) is an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we describe the discovery of a novel class of BACE-1 inhibitors represented by sulfamide 14g, using a medicinal chemistry strategy to optimize central nervous system (CNS) penetration by minimizing hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) and reducing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated efflux. We have also taken advantage of the combination of structure based drug design (SBDD) to guide the optimization of the sulfamide analogues and the in silico tool WaterMap to explain the observed SAR. Compound 14g is a potent inhibitor of BACE-1 with excellent permeability and a moderate P-gp liability. Administration of 14g to mice produced a significant, dose-dependent reduction in central Abeta(X-40) levels at a free drug exposure equivalent to the whole cell IC(50) (100 nM). Furthermore, studies of the P-gp knockout mouse provided evidence that efflux transporters affected the amount of Abeta lowering versus that observed in wild-type (WT) mouse at an equivalent dose.
