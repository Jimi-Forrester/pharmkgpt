34660781|a|Over the years, most of the research concerning manganese exposure was restricted to the toxicity of neuronal cells. Manganese is an essential trace element that in high doses exerts neurotoxic effects. However, in the last two decades, efforts have shifted toward a more comprehensive approach that takes into account the involvement of glial cells in the development of neurotoxicity as a brain insult. Glial cells provide structural, trophic, and metabolic support to neurons. Nevertheless, these cells play an active role in adult neurogenesis, regulation of synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Disturbances in glial cell function can lead to neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. This review highlights the pivotal role that glial cells have in manganese-induced neurotoxicity as well as the most sounding mechanisms involved in the development of this phenomenon.
