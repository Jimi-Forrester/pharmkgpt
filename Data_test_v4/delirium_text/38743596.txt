38743596|t|A mutation in the PRKAR1B gene drives pathological mechanisms of neurodegeneration across species.
38743596|a|Protein Kinase A (PKA) neuronal function is controlled by the interaction of a regulatory (R) subunit dimer to two catalytic (C) subunits. Recently, the L50R variant in the gene encoding the RIbeta subunit was identified in individuals with a novel neurodegenerative disease. However, the mechanisms driving the disease phenotype remained unknown. In this study, we generated a mouse model carrying the RIbeta-L50R mutation to replicate the human disease phenotype and study its progression with age. We examined postmortem brains of affected individuals as well as live cell cultures. Employing biochemical assays, immunohistochemistry, and behavioral assessments, we investigated the impact of the mutation on PKA complex assembly, protein aggregation and neuronal degeneration. We reveal that RIbeta is an aggregation-prone protein that progressively accumulates in wildtype and Alzheimer's mouse models with age, while aggregation is accelerated in the RIbeta-L50R mouse model. We define RIbeta-L50R as a causal mutation driving an age-dependent behavioral and disease phenotype in human and mouse models. Mechanistically, this mutation disrupts RIbeta dimerization, leading to aggregation of its monomers. Intriguingly, interaction with the C-subunit protects the RIbeta-L50R from self-aggregating, in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, cAMP signaling induces RIbeta-L50R aggregation. The pathophysiological mechanism elucidated here for a newly recognized neurodegenerative disease, in which protein aggregation is the result of disrupted homodimerization, sheds light on a remarkably under-appreciated but potentially common mechanism across several neurodegenerative diseases.
