11291702|a|The median sternotomy approach for the treatment of chronic pulmonary thromboembolism was recently improved by Daily, Jamieson, and coworkers who adopted it for use under cardiopulmonary bypass with intermittent circulatory arrest; however, we have sometimes found that the circulatory arrest time was too short to complete thromboendarterectomy. Therefore, we attempted to perform a selective cerebral perfusion technique to extend the endarterectomy time. Although we noted slight back-bleeding from the bronchial arteries, we were able to extend the endarterectomy time without causing any postoperative delirium. We conclude that the median sternotomy approach using cardiopulmonary bypass with selective cerebral perfusion may be the best option for extending the thromboendarterectomy time.
