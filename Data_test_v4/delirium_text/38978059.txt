38978059|a|BACKGROUND: Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease whose pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, and vaccination is the only effective method for protecting against rabies virus infection. Most inactivated vaccines are produced using Vero cells, which are African green monkey kidney cells, to achieve large-scale production. However, there is a potential carcinogenic risk due to nonhuman DNA contamination. Thus, replacing Vero cells with human diploid cells may be a safer strategy. In this study, we developed a novel 2BS cell-adapted rabies virus strain and analysed its sequence, virulence and immunogenicity to determine its application potential as a human diploid cell inactivated vaccine. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 2BS cell-adapted rabies virus strain 2aG4-B40 was established by passage for 40 generations and selection of plaques in 2BS cells. RNA sequence analysis revealed that mutations in 2BS cell-adapted strains were not located at key sites that regulate the production of neutralizing antibodies or virulence in the aG strain (GQ412744.1). The gradual increase in virulence (remaining above 7.0 logLD50/ml from the 40th to 55th generation) and antigen further indicated that these mutations may increase the affinity of the adapted strains for human diploid cells. Identification tests revealed that the 2BS cell-adapted virus strain was neutralized by anti-rabies serum, with a neutralization index of 19,952. PrEP and PEP vaccination and the NIH test further indicated that the vaccine prepared with the 2aG4-B40 strain had high neutralizing antibody levels (2.24 to 46.67 IU/ml), immunogenicity (protection index 270) and potency (average 11.6 IU/ml). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a 2BS cell-adapted strain of the 2aG4 rabies virus was obtained by passage for 40 generations. The results of sequencing analysis and titre determination of the adapted strain showed that the mutations in the adaptive process are not located at key sequence regions of the virus, and these mutations may enhance the affinity of the adapted strain for human diploid cells. Moreover, vaccines made from the adapted strain 2aG4-B40 had high potency and immunogenicity and could be an ideal candidate rabies virus strain for inactivated vaccine preparation.
