38419922|t|Efficacy of tDCS on craving in patients of alcohol dependence syndrome: A single-blind, sham-controlled trial.
38419922|a|Background: Craving is attributed as one of the main reasons for relapse in alcohol dependence syndrome. Neurostimulation techniques targeting craving in substance use disorders are being researched. Neuroimaging has shown dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as one of the potential targets responsible for craving, with frontal dysfunction being quintessential in alcohol use disorder. Evidence suggests that stimulation of DLPFC with low-dose current can help in reducing craving. Objectives: To study the effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on craving in patients with alcohol dependence syndrome. Materials and Methods: We performed a single-blind, sham-controlled study involving 76 patients with alcohol dependence syndrome (according to ICD-10 DCR). Participants with Clinical Institute of Withdrawal Assessment in Alcohol Withdrawal (CIWA-Ar) scores less than 10, not on any anti-craving medications were included in the study. Patients were allocated to active and sham tDCS groups in a ratio of 1:1. Such that 38 patients received active, and 38 patients sham tDCS stimulations; with anode as right DLPFC and cathode as left DLPFC receiving 2 mA current (twice daily session, total of 10 sessions). The Alcohol Craving Questionnaire (ACQ-NOW) was administered to measure the severity of alcohol craving at baseline and after the last tDCS session. Results: Our study showed a significant reduction in craving in the Post-tDCS, ACQ-NOW scores as compared to sham tDCS. There was a significant reduction in the compulsivity and emotionality domain of craving after tDCS. The effect size for treatment with time interaction was (0.58). Conclusions: tDCS was superior to sham in reducing caving in patients with alcohol dependence syndrome.
