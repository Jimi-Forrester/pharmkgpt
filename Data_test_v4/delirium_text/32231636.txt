32231636|t|Beyond Metabolism: The Complex Interplay Between Dietary Phytoestrogens, Gut Bacteria, and Cells of Nervous and Immune Systems.
32231636|a|The human body has a large, diverse community of microorganisms which not only coexist with us, but also perform many important physiological functions, including metabolism of dietary compounds that we are unable to process ourselves. Furthermore, these bacterial derived/induced metabolites have the potential to interact and influence not only the local gut environment, but the periphery via interaction with and modulation of cells of the immune and nervous system. This relationship is being further appreciated every day as the gut microbiome is researched as a potential target for immunomodulation. A common feature among inflammatory diseases including relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the presence of gut microbiota dysbiosis when compared to healthy controls. However, the specifics of these microbiota-neuro-immune system interactions remain unclear. Among all factors, diet has emerged as a strongest factor regulating structure and function of gut microbial community. Phytoestrogens are one class of dietary compounds emerging as potentially being of interest in this interaction as numerous studies have identified depletion of phytoestrogen-metabolizing bacteria such as Adlercreutzia, Parabacteroides and Prevotella in RRMS patients. Additionally, phytoestrogens or their metabolites have been reported to show protective effects when compounds are administered in the animal model of MS, Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this review, we will illustrate the link between MS and phytoestrogen metabolizing bacteria, characterize the importance of gut bacteria and their mechanisms of action in the production of phytoestrogen metabolites, and discuss what is known about the interactions of specific compounds with cells immune and nervous system. A better understanding of gut bacteria-mediated phytoestrogen metabolism and mechanisms through which these metabolites facilitate their biological actions will help in development of novel therapeutic options for MS as well as other inflammatory diseases.
