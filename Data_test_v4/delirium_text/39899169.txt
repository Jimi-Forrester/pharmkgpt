39899169|a|Inhibition of angiogenesis, either as monotherapy or in conjunction with other treatments, holds significant promise in cancer treatment. However, the limited efficacy of clinically approved anti-angiogenic agents underscores the urgent need for the development of novel drugs and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we demonstrate the highly selective inhibitory effects of clioquinol, a topical antifungal and antibiotic agent, on the angiogenic activity of endothelial cells (ECs) in a series of in vitro angiogenesis assays. Moreover, clioquinol effectively suppressed blood vessel formation in ex vivo aortic ring and in vivo Matrigel plug assays. Mechanistic studies revealed that clioquinol directly binds to the ATP-binding site of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), promoting its degradation through both proteasome and lysosome pathways. This led to the down-regulation of the downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. In addition, the combination with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 synergistically boosted the anti-angiogenic efficacy of clioquinol in vitro and in an in vivo dorsal skinfold chamber model of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), leading to the suppression of TNBC growth. Accordingly, clioquinol, either alone or in combination with AKT inhibitors, represents a promising therapeutic agent for future anti-angiogenic cancer treatment.
