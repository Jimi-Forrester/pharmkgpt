20858965|a|At present, more than 35 million people worldwide have Alzheimer's disease (AD). With increasing incidence and a growing number of aged patients undergoing surgery, the relevance of a possible interaction between anesthetics and AD is growing as well. Below, we review in vitro studies investigating the effects of anesthetics on the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein and its metabolite amyloid-beta.
