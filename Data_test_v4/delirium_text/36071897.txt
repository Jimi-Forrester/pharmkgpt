36071897|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that leads to cognitive impairment and memory loss. Currently, the pathogenesis and underlying causative genes of AD remain unclear, and there exists no effective treatment for this disease. This study explored AD-related diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers from the perspective of immune infiltration by analyzing public data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database. Method: In this study, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to identify modules and hub genes contributing to AD development. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed when the genes in the modules were enriched and examined by Gene Ontology (GO)/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Furthermore, a gene network was established using topological WGCNA, from which five hub genes were selected. Logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were performed to explore the clinical value of genes in AD diagnosis. The genes in the core module intersected with the hub genes, and four intersection genes (ATP2A2, ATP6V1D, CAP2, and SYNJ1) were selected. These four genes were enriched by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Finally, an immune infiltration analysis was performed. Results: The GO/KEGG analysis suggested that genes in the core module played a role in the differentiation and growth of neural cells and in the transmission of neurotransmitters. The GSEA of core genes showed that these four genes were mainly enriched in immune/infection pathways (e.g., cholera infection and Helicobacter pylori infection pathways) and other metabolic pathways. An investigation of immune infiltration characteristics revealed that activated mast cells, regulatory T cells, plasma cells, neutrophils, T follicular helper cells, CD8 T cells, resting memory CD4 T cells, and M1 macrophages were the core immune cells contributing to AD progression. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the ATP6V1D is upregulated in AD. Conclusion: The results of enrichment and immuno-osmotic analyses indicated that immune pathways and immune cells played an important role in the occurrence and development of AD. The selected key genes were used as biomarkers related to the pathogenesis of AD to further explore the pathways and cells, which provided new perspectives on therapeutic targets in AD.
