37231523|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is accompanied by an abnormal high accumulation of cis-P tau. However, the long-term changes in behavior following tau accumulation remains under debate. The present study investigated the long-term effects of tauopathy on learning and memory, synaptic plasticity, and hippocampal cell numbers. RESULTS: Cis-P tau was microinjected into the dorsal hippocampus to generate Alzheimer's like-disease model in C57BL/6 mice. Cis-P tau injected animals showed a significant impairment in learning and memory in Y-maze and Barnes maze tests. In another group of animals, the generation of long-term potentiation (LTP) was evaluated in hippocampal slices 7 months after cis-P tau injection. LTP induction was disrupted only in the dorsal but not ventral hippocampal slices. The basal synaptic transmission was also reduced in dorsal hippocampal slices. In addition, hippocampal sampling was done, and the number of cells was assessed by Nissl staining. Obtained results indicated that the number of survived cells was significantly reduced in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus of cis P-tau injected animals compared to the animals in control group. However, the decrement of cell number was higher in the dorsal compared to the ventral hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, intra-hippocampal cis-P tau injection produced learning and memory impairment at 7 months after its injection. This impairment might result from LTP disruption and a significant decrease in the number of neurons in the dorsal hippocampus.
