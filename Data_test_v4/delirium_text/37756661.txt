37756661|t|Refining S-acylation: Structure, regulation, dynamics, and therapeutic implications.
37756661|a|With a limited number of genes, cells achieve remarkable diversity. This is to a large extent achieved by chemical posttranslational modifications of proteins. Amongst these are the lipid modifications that have the unique ability to confer hydrophobicity. The last decade has revealed that lipid modifications of proteins are extremely frequent and affect a great variety of cellular pathways and physiological processes. This is particularly true for S-acylation, the only reversible lipid modification. The enzymes involved in S-acylation and deacylation are only starting to be understood, and the list of proteins that undergo this modification is ever-increasing. We will describe the state of knowledge on the enzymes that regulate S-acylation, from their structure to their regulation, how S-acylation influences target proteins, and finally will offer a perspective on how alterations in the balance between S-acylation and deacylation may contribute to disease.
