28984596|t|Low Erythrocyte Levels of Proteasome and Acyl-Peptide Hydrolase (APEH) Activities in Alzheimer's Disease: A Sign of Defective Proteostasis?
28984596|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder that is the main cause of dementia. To date, there are no definitive diagnostic tests that can predict or assess onset and progression of the disease. Blood biomarkers for AD are being sought for many years but their identification remains a challenging task. In this study, we investigated the potential relationship between AD and levels of acyl-peptide hydrolase (APEH) and proteasome in erythrocyte samples of 52 participants (26 AD and 26 cognitively healthy controls). A statistically significant decrease in proteasome and exopeptidase/endopeptidase APEH activities was found in AD samples compared to those of healthy controls. Moreover, in contrast to what was observed for proteasome transcripts, APEH activities reduction in AD patients was unrelated to its gene expression levels, suggesting the occurrence of posttranslational modifications or the expression of endogenous inhibitors that might impair enzyme activity. These preliminary data further support a relationship between the APEH-proteasome system and AD molecular players, providing the first evidence of its potential use as a novel blood-based indicator for the routine detection of AD.
