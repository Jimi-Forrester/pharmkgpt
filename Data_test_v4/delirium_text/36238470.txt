36238470|t|Safety and Efficacy of Tirofiban Combined with Statins in the Perioperative Period of Intracranial Aneurysms: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
36238470|a|Objective: In order to verify the safety and effectiveness of tirofiban combined with statins in the perioperative period of intracranial aneurysms, this study adopts systematic review and meta-analysis, so as to comprehensively understand the situation of intracranial aneurysms in the perioperative period, and tirofiban combined with statins was finally determined as an effective treatment drug. Methods: This study used systematic retrospective analysis and selected 80 patients with intracranial aneurysms treated in our hospital from June 2021 to June 2022 as the research objects. Through conventional drugs and tirofiban combined with statins used in this study, the intracranial levels, the probability of aneurysm rupture, and postoperative complications of the two groups were observed and recorded. Results: The analysis of 80 patients with intracranial aneurysms showed that the influence of intracranial levels in the observation group was better than that in the reference group, the rupture of aneurysms in the observation group was lower than that in the reference group, and the incidence of postoperative complications in the observation group was lower than that in the reference group. Conclusion: Through simulation verification, it is concluded that tirofiban combined with statins is safe and effective in the perioperative application of intracranial aneurysms. This drug can improve vascular recanalization, reduce the incidence of cerebrovascular disease events, and reduce the incidence of rebleeding. Its therapeutic effect is worthy of wide clinical application and promotion.
