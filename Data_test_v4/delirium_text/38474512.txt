38474512|t|Quercetin, a Flavonoid with Great Pharmacological Capacity.
38474512|a|Quercetin is a flavonoid with a low molecular weight that belongs to the human diet's phenolic phytochemicals and nonenergy constituents. Quercetin has a potent antioxidant capacity, being able to capture reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and reactive chlorine species (ROC), which act as reducing agents by chelating transition-metal ions. Its structure has five functional hydroxyl groups, which work as electron donors and are responsible for capturing free radicals. In addition to its antioxidant capacity, different pharmacological properties of quercetin have been described, such as carcinostatic properties; antiviral, antihypertensive, and anti-inflammatory properties; the ability to protect low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, and the ability to inhibit angiogenesis; these are developed in this review.
