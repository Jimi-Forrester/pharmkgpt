15801394|t|[Related, induced and associated psychiatric disorders to cannabis].
15801394|a|Cannabis disorders, according to the DSM-IV and the ICD-10 criteria, include cannabis intoxication, cannabis abuse, cannabis dependence, and cannabis-related disorders (anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, cannabis intoxication delirium). Although cannabis withdrawal syndrome has clinical importance, it is not included in these classifications. The amotivational syndrome remains controversial. The psychiatric disorders related to cannabis use are anxiety disorders, depressive disorders and psychotic disorders. Cannabis use could be closely linked with the neurobiology of schizophrenia. As the other psychoactive substances, cannabis use worsens the psychiatric outcomes and is associated with poorer treatment compliance.
