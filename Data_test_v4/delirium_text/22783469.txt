22783469|t|Predictors and clinical outcomes of postoperative delirium after administration of dexamethasone in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery.
22783469|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is one of the important complications of cardiac surgery and it is assumed to provoke inflammatory responses. Theoretically, anti-inflammatory effects of dexamethasone can have an influence on the incidence and outcomes of POD. The aim of our study was to assess POD predictors and outcomes of dexamethasone administration after cardiac surgery. METHODS: Patients' mental status was examined by mini-mental status examination and psychiatric interviewing to diagnose delirium. Subsequently, authors analyzed the patient variables for identification of predictors and outcomes of POD. RESULTS: Between 196 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 34 (17.34%) patients were delirious. History of chronic renal failure, obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, and addiction strongly predicted development of POD. Other predictors were intra-aortic balloon pump insertion, transfusion of packed cells, and atrial fibrillation rhythm. In our study, the administration of dexamethasone significantly reduced the risk for POD. Furthermore, delirium was associated with longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay. CONCLUSION: Our study reports the predictors of POD, which patients commonly facing them in cardiac surgery ICU. Appropriate management and prevention of these predictors, especially modifiable ones, can decrease the incident of POD and improves cognitive outcomes of cardiac surgeries.
