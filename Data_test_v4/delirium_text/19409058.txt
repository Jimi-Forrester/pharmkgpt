19409058|a|Hepatitis-C virus (HCV) has infected an estimated 130 million people worldwide, most of whom are chronically infected. Infection is marked by both treatment- and non-treatment-related psychiatric symptoms. Symptoms associated with antiretroviral therapy, interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), include acute confusional states, delirium, depression, irritability, and even mania. These psychiatric symptoms are further complicated by the high rate of substance abuse and comorbid HIV infection inherent to this population. Even in the absence of IFN-alpha therapy, comorbid depression, cognitive decline, and especially fatigue are common in patients suffering HCV. These comorbidities have significant effects on both treatments and outcomes, and thus are reviewed herein.
