36190126|a|Nowadays, it is still quite challenging to achieve an early diagnosis of the Alzheimer disease (AD) in clinics. The burgeoning near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging fulfills the requirements for a precise diagnosis with good sensitivity and a high signal-to-background ratio and offers opportunities for the efficient AD diagnosis. As the pathogenesis of AD is quite complex, there is an ongoing exploration of advanced probes to specifically target AD biomarkers (e.g., amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, viscosity, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), reactive oxygen species, and methylglyoxal). To this end, a great number of small molecular fluorescent probes with good water solubility, blood-brain barrier crossing capability, and ease in tuning photophysical and biological properties have been studied for the AD diagnosis. Herein, we systematically update the progress of NIRF AD probes in the last three years. The special focus is on the mechanisms for the targeted diagnosis and the relationship between the structure and properties of the probes. Importantly, NIRF probes with complementary functions such as dual-responsiveness and multimodal imaging and even therapeutics are discussed. Moreover, the challenges and perspectives of the AD probes are briefly elucidated. We hope that this review provides guidance for researchers and expedites the preclinical and clinical study of the NIRF AD probes.
