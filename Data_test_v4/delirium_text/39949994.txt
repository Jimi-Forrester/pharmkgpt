39949994|t|Complex NADASE Infusions Improve Clinical Outcome in Substance Use Disorder: Descriptive Annotation in Fifty Cases.
39949994|a|Background: The present study relates to a method to treat and detoxify patients with substance use disorder (SUD) utilizing a series of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and enkephalinase infusions (NADASE) in subjects attending chemical dependency programs. Objective: The primary objective of the current investigation is to provide some additional clinical evidence to show that NAD+ other amino acids including d-phenylalanine, glycine and ananylglutamine dipeptide and Myer's cocktail (B complex) infusions significantly attenuates substance craving behavior and concomitant psychiatric burden sequalae in poly-drug abusers attending both in-patient and out-patient level of care in a number of chemical dependency programs in orange country. Methods: At symmetry approximately 1,000 now performed approximately 1,000 infusions on 900 patients without any serious side effects pointing to the safety of this procedure. The study cohort (n = 50) as a subgroup consisted of highly addicted poly-drug mixed gender and varied ethnic individuals previously resistant to standard treatment with a range of failed treatment attempts from one to ten. Each patient included in this study received a minimum of 7 infusions for an average duration of four weeks. The data includes craving scores, anxiety, depression, and sleep. We utilized likert scales (1 - 10) self-reported responses, accomplished via a counselor to patient structured interview. Results: In summary considering all fifty subjects using wilcoxon signed rank tests and sign tests, we found the following significance comparing the baseline scores to post outcome scores after NAD infusions; craving scores (P = 1.063E-9); anxiety (P = 5.487E-7); and depression (P = 1.763E-4). There was an improvement trend in the number of sleep hours post infusions, it was non-significant (Pre 6.28, and post 7.34). Importantly, urine analysis of a standard panel of illicit drugs of abuse during the course of NAD infusions resulted in a subset of 40 patients tested at midway during infusions 100% of these patients tested negative. Conclusion: These annotated notes serve an important function showing patient to patient similarities and differences and contribute to the emerging literature concerning NAD efficacy in SUD.
