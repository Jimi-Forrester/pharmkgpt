11428308|a|PURPOSE: At the General Hospital in Thun (Switzerland) a memory clinic was established in 1999. METHOD: The first 55 cases (30 females and 25 males) were statistically analysed as a part of internal quality management. The patients were examined using a usual assessment including physical and psychiatric examination, blood and neuropsychological testing (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale). RESULTS: 14% of the examined patients did show kind of cognitive deficit. Men yielded significantly better results in neuropsychological testing than women. CONCLUSIONS: The general acceptance of the new memory clinic in Thun is due to the growing demand for such institutions because of the demographic development. Men's better results in neurological testing might be a sign of different reaction-patterns of their families, that make family practitioners send them at an earlier stage of dementia.
