20522088|t|The epidemiology of dementia associated with Parkinson's disease.
20522088|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative illness after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cognitive impairment and dementia are common features in PD and characterized by a wide range of cognitive deficits distinct from those seen in AD. Mild cognitive impairment occurs even early in PD and is associated with shorter time to dementia. The purpose of this review is to present recent findings on clinical aspects of dementia in PD and to elucidate underlying clinical and neurobiological risk factors.
