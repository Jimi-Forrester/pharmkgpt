38586469|a|Dementia disproportionately affects individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, including those living in areas of lower neighborhood-level socioeconomic status. It is important to understand whether there are specific neighborhood characteristics associated with dementia risk factors and cognition which may inform dementia risk reduction interventions. We sought to examine whether greenspace, walkability, and crime associated with the cumulative burden of modifiable dementia risk factors and cognition. This was a cross-sectional analysis of 2016-2020 data from the Healthy Brain Project, a population-based cohort of community-dwelling individuals across Australia. Participants were aged 40-70 and free of dementia. Measures included greenspace (greenspace % in the local area, and distance to greenspace, n = 2,181); and intersection density (n = 1,159), and crime (rate of recorded offences; n = 1,159). Outcomes included a modified Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) dementia risk score to index the burden of modifiable vascular dementia risk factors; and composite scores of both memory and attention, derived from the Cogstate Brief Battery. Linear regressions adjusted for age, sex, education, and personal socio-economic status, demonstrated distance to greenspace (b +- SE per 2-fold increase = 0.09 +- 0.03, p =.005) and crime rate (b +- SE per 2-fold increase = 0.07 +- 0.03, p =.018) were associated with higher modified CAIDE. Higher crime was associated with lower memory performance (b +- SE = -0.03 +- 0.01, p =.018). The association between distance to greenspace and modified CAIDE was only present in low-moderate socioeconomic status neighborhoods (p interaction = 0.004). Dementia prevention programs that address modifiable risk factors in midlife should consider the possible role of neighborhood characteristics.
