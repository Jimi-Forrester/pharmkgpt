33927529|t|Effects of Health Promotion Model-Based Visual Learning Module on Self-Efficacy and Health Promotion Behavior of Stroke Survivors: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.
33927529|a|Background and Objectives  Globally, stroke is one of the major causes of disability and mortality among adults and old age people. The present study aims to evaluate the effects of the health promotion model-based visual learning module (HPM-VLM) on self-efficacy and behavioral modifications among stroke survivors. Methods  This nonrandomized controlled trial was conducted on 70 stroke survivors (intervention group, n = 35, and control group, n = 35). The intervention group was subjected to two sessions of the HPM-VLM and the control group received routine instructions. Data were collected through face-to-face structured interview, and observation using a self-structured self-efficacy questionnaire and health promotion behavior questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive (frequency and percentage) and inferential (Chi-square, independent t -test, mixed model, and ANCOVA) values by IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS; version 23) software. Results  Eventually, follow-up could have been completed for 66 participants (intervention group, n = 34, and control group, n = 32). HPM-VLM is found to be effective in the promotion of self-efficacy (19.2 +- 1.6 vs. 16.12 +- 2.5; p = 001) and health promotion behavior of stroke survivors in most of the domains ( p < 0.01). Conclusion  HPM-VLM is an effective interventional tool for the promotion of self-efficacy and health promotion behavior of stroke survivors.
