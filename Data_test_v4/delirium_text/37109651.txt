37109651|t|A Cross-Sectional, Retrospective, and Comparative Study between Delirium and Non-Delirium Psychiatric Disorders in a Psychogeriatric Inpatient Population Referred to Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Unit.
37109651|a|Background and objectives: Delirium is the most prevalent psychiatric disorder in inpatient older people. Its presence is associated with higher rates of institutionalization, functional disability and mortality. This study aims to evaluate delirium in a hospitalized psychogeriatric population, focusing on which factors predict the appearance of delirium, the impact it generates and the diagnostic concordance between non-psychiatric physicians and psychiatrists. Material and methods: This is an observational, cross-sectional, retrospective, and comparative study. We obtained data from a sample of 1017 patients (>=65 years) admitted to general hospital and referred from different services to the consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) unit. Logistic regression was performed using delirium as the dependent variable. To estimate the concordance of the diagnoses, the Kappa coefficient was used. To assess the impact of delirium, an ordinal regression, Wilcoxon median test and Fisher's test were performed. Results: Delirium is associated with a higher number of visits, OR 3.04 (95% CI 2.38-3.88), longer length of stay and mortality, OR 2.07 (95% CI, 1.05 to 4.10). The model to predict delirium shows that being >75 years old has an OR of 2.1 (95% CI, 1.59-2.79), physical disability has an OR of 1.66 (95% CI, 1.25-2.20), history of delirium has an OR of 10.56 (95% CI, 5.26-21.18) and no use of benzodiazepines has an OR of 4.24 (95% CI, 2.92-6.14). The concordance between the referring physician's psychiatric diagnosis and the psychiatrist CLP unit showed a kappa of 0.30. When analysing depression and delirium, the concordance showed Kappa = 0.46. Conclusions: Delirium is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder, but it is still underdiagnosed, with low diagnostic concordance between non-psychiatric doctors and psychiatrists from CLP units. There are multiple risk factors associated with the appearance of delirium, which must be managed to reduce its appearance.
