32336077|t|Validity and reliability study of the Turkish version of the self-efficacy for managing chronic disease 6-item scale
32336077|a|Background/aim: The measurement of self-efficacy is an important step toward improving chronic disease management, enhancing adherence to treatment, and assessing patients with chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease 6-Item Scale. Materials and methods: In this methodological study, the sample consisted of 211 patients receiving chronic disease care in 2 family health centers in Istanbul, Turkey. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, concurrent validity, Cronbach's alpha, item-total correlation, and test-retest reliability. Results: Most of the sample were women (72%), primary school graduates (41.7%), hypertensive (68.7%), and had comorbidities (68.2%). The mean age of the sample was 60.5 +- 10.9. The scale mean was 5.66 +- 2.28. Cronbach's alpha reliability was 0.90. Item-total correlations were between 0.64-0.85 and test-retest reliability was high (R = 0.95, P < 0.001). A positive, significant correlation was found in concurrent validity. According to the results of factor analysis, the scale had a 2-dimensional structure. Conclusion: The Turkish version of the Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease 6-Item Scale is a valid and reliable instrument to assess perceived the self-efficacy level of patient with chronic disease.
