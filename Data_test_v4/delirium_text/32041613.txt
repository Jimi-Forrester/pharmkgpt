32041613|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the efficiency of fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) combined with dexmedetomidine (DEX) in postoperative and inflammation management for elder patients after total hip arthroplasty. METHODS: The present randomized controlled study included a total of 119 elder patients who received total hip arthroplasty in our hospital from March 2016 to December 2018. These patients were divided into three groups: control group, patients received routine general anesthesia; FICB group, patients received additional FICB after surgery; and combined group, patients received both pre-treatment of DEX and post-treatment of fascia iliaca compartment block. The serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured by ELISA. The visual analog scale (VAS) score was measured at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery, and the patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) pressing time within 48 h after surgery was also recorded. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) was used to measure the sleep quality before and at 1 month after surgery. RESULTS: The VAS scores were significantly lower in patients in the combined group, when compared with the other two groups, at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery. In addition, the VAS scores at all time points were significantly lower in the FICB group than the control group. The PCIA pressing times were also remarkably lower in the combined group. At 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery, the serum levels of these inflammatory factors were the lowest in the combined group, and the PSQI scores were significantly lower in the combined group, when compared with the other two groups, while the control group had the highest PSQI scores among the three groups. There was no severe side effects and significant difference observed. CONCLUSION: FICB combined with DEX reduced the postoperative pain, improved the sleep condition, and decreased the serum levels of inflammatory factors after total hip arthroplasty.
