38633549|t|COVID-19 in Elderly Patients: Risk Factors for Disease Severity.
38633549|a|Objective: Determining the clinical characteristics associated with SARS-COV-2 infection may contribute to reducing mortality in elderly patients, considering the age-related sensitivity and the excess of complications. Our study aimed to evaluate the factors that determine the severity of the disease in elderly patients followed up in our hospital. Materials and Methods: The files of definite or probable COVID-19 patients over 65 years old who were followed up by the infectious diseases clinic of our hospital between March 15 and October 1, 2020, were evaluated retrospectively. Results: A total of 134 patients were included in the study, 52.2% of the patients were male, and the mean age was 75.11+-7.15 (min 65-max 94). Multimorbidity was detected in 42.5% of the patients, and the most common comorbidities were hypertension (53.7%) and diabetes mellitus (36.6%). Severe COVID-19 was present in 39.6% of patients. The most common complaints were fatigue (70.9%), cough (59.7%), and shortness of breath (59%). When the patients' computed tomography (CT) images of thorax were evaluated, ground-glass was observed in 94.8% (n=127), infiltration in 42.5% (n=57), and consolidation in 32.8% (n=44). Involvement was bilateral in 93.3% (n=125) of the patients. The most common antiviral treatment used for patients was favipiravir 73.1% (n=98). The average hospitalization period of the patients was 12+-6.36 days, the rate of follow-up in the intensive care unit was 20.1% (n=27), and death occurred in 9.7% (n=13) of the patients. In the multivariate analysis, cough and shortness of breath at admission, atelectasis and pleural effusion on thorax CT were found to be significant for severe COVID-19 disease (p<0.05). Conclusion: Providing early medical support to these patients, especially, in the presence of cough and shortness of breath on admission and the presence of pleural effusion and atelectasis on thoracic CT, may help reduce the poor clinical course.
