36107567|t|Prophylactic effect of intravenous lidocaine against cognitive deficit after cardiac surgery: A PRISMA-compliant meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.
36107567|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed at providing an updated evidence of the association between intraoperative lidocaine and risk of postcardiac surgery cognitive deficit. METHODS: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating effects of intravenous lidocaine against cognitive deficit in adults undergoing cardiac surgeries were retrieved from the EMBASE, MEDLINE, Google scholar, and Cochrane controlled trials register databases from inception till May 2021. Risk of cognitive deficit was the primary endpoint, while secondary endpoints were length of stay (LOS) in intensive care unit/hospital. Impact of individual studies and cumulative evidence reliability were evaluated with sensitivity analyses and trial sequential analysis, respectively. RESULTS: Six RCTs involving 963 patients published from 1999 to 2019 were included. In early postoperative period (i.e., 2 weeks), the use of intravenous lidocaine (overall incidence = 14.8%) was associated with a lower risk of cognitive deficit compared to that with placebo (overall incidence = 33.1%) (relative risk = 0.49, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.75). However, sensitivity analysis and trial sequential analysis signified insufficient evidence to arrive at a firm conclusion. In the late postoperative period (i.e., 6-10 weeks), perioperative intravenous lidocaine (overall incidence = 37.9%) did not reduce the risk of cognitive deficit (relative risk = 0.99, 95% confidence interval: 0.84) compared to the placebo (overall incidence = 38.6%). Intravenous lidocaine was associated with a shortened LOS in intensive care unit/hospital with weak evidence. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated a prophylactic effect of intravenous lidocaine against cognitive deficit only at the early postoperative period despite insufficient evidence. Further large-scale studies are warranted to assess its use for the prevention of cognitive deficit and enhancement of recovery (e.g., LOS).
