39305787|a|OBJECTIVE: Hyperactive delirium with agitation following head and neck surgeries with free tissue transfer reconstruction (HNS-FTTR) represents a critical and potentially life-threatening postoperative complication. Although preoperative risk assessment is important, no established risk screening tool has been developed to accurately predict its occurrence. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we examined 192 consecutive patients who underwent HNS-FTTR between August 2019 and January 2024. We assessed the effectiveness of the existing delirium risk screening system, the DELirium Team Approach program which includes factors such as age >= 70 years, presence of brain disorders, dementia, alcohol consumption habits, a history of delirium, and use of benzodiazepines. Additionally, we explored the association between each risk factor and the onset of delirium. RESULTS: Delirium occurred in 43 patients (22.4 %). The risk screening tool effectively predicted the occurrence of hyperactive delirium after HNS-FTTR (OR: 8.316; 95 % CI: 2.205-36.060; p = 0.004), with a sensitivity of 95.3 % and a specificity of 28.9 %. Multivariate analysis revealed age >= 70 years (OR: 2.179; 95 % CI: 1.058-4.662; p = 0.0383) and alcohol consumption habits (OR: 2.554; 95 % CI: 1.260-5.268; p = 0.0098) as significant independent risk factors. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the risk screening system evaluated in this study appears to be sensitive, simple, and effective for the preoperative prediction of hyperactive postoperative delirium following HNS-FTTR.
