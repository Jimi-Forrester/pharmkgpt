35670192|t|Catatonia after COVID-19 infection: scoping review.
35670192|a|AIMS AND METHOD: Catatonia has been increasingly described in cases of COVID-19; we therefore aimed to investigate the evidence for catatonia in patients with COVID-19. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, BIN and CINAHL databases for articles published in English, from the initial descriptions of the COVID-19 pandemic to January 2022. RESULTS: A total 204 studies were identified, 27 (13%) of which met the inclusion criteria. The evidence available was based on case reports. The articles included in this review identified a total of 42 patients, ranging from the ages of 12 to >=70 years, with confirmed or possible catatonia during or after a COVID-19 infection. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This review provides valuable information to clinicians in medical practice for treating patients with COVID-19, and a foundation for further research for this uncommon syndrome of COVID-19.
