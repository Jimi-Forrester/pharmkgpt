39830554|t|Aducanumab in Alzheimer's Disease: A Comparative Study of Its Effects on Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment.
39830554|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Cholinesterase inhibitors are commonly used to manage symptoms but have limited efficacy as the disease progresses. Aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach. Despite its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, its efficacy and safety remain contentious, particularly following the European Medicines Agency's (EMA's) rejection. This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and clinical outcomes of aducanumab in treating mild AD. Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed and Science Direct databases, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case-control studies focusing on aducanumab versus placebo in mild AD. Studies were screened based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and data were extracted on clinical outcomes, biomarkers, and neuroimaging markers. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Out of 967 identified records, seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Findings indicated a dose-dependent reduction in Abeta plaques with aducanumab, but clinical outcomes varied. High-dose aducanumab (10 mg/kg) demonstrated significant improvements in some studies but not others. Adverse events, notably amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), were frequent, especially at higher doses. The studies exhibited heterogeneous treatment effects and underscored the potential of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers as an alternative to amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Aducanumab shows promise in reducing Abeta plaques and has potential clinical benefits at high doses; however, its safety profile, particularly concerning ARIA, remains a significant concern. The variability in clinical efficacy highlights the need for further research to optimize dosing regimens and identify patient populations most likely to benefit from treatment. Future studies should focus on refining treatment protocols and exploring alternative biomarkers to improve therapeutic outcomes for AD.
