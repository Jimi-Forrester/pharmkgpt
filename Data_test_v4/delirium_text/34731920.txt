34731920|a|INTRODUCTION: The incidence of hip fracture will increase dramatically in the coming decades. It has been associated with high mortality and morbidity. Orthogeriatric programs have improved outcomes in fragility hip fracture worldwide. There is little evidence in Mexico on the impact of orthogeriatrics and adherence to quality indicators. OBJECTIVE: To compare adherence to quality indicators in hip fracture before and after the implementation of an orthogeriatrics team compared to the traditional model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Quasi-experimental study conducted in Leon, Mexico. Adherence to quality indicators before and after an interconsultant orthogeriatrics team was compared. The indicators measured were: surgical delay, treatment for osteoporosis, early mobilization, type of implant and delirium. RESULTS: We included 83 patients. The surgical delay was reduced from 144 to 116 hours (28 hours), the percentage of patients with early surgery was increased from 7.9 to 18%, in addition the percentage of patients with treatment for osteoporosis was increased and the incidence of delirium was reduced. CONCLUSION: Adherence to indicators is low, however, it was possible to discreetly increase adherence to these indicators. Internal policies must be generated in public hospitals to improve this adherence and see its impact on long-term outcomes.
