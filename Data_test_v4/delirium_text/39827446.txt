39827446|t|Development of a smartphone-assisted multiple colorimetric detection assay for GSH in food based on the degradation of gold nanorods.
39827446|a|Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide and natural reducing agent composed of glutamic acid, glycine, and cysteine. Its level in the human body is closely linked to human health, such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. The supplementation of exogenous GSH could bring health benefits and GSH detection in food is of considerable importance. However, the existing assays for GSH detection such as high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, electrochemiluminescence and fluorescent nanoprobe were not satisfactory because of the disadvantages of equipment and site requirements. In this study, a multiple-colorimetric detection assay for GSH was developed based on GSH's reaction with gold nanorods. During the reaction with varying concentrations of GSH, the gold nanorods degraded into spherical nanoparticles with multiple color changes, which could be used to determine GSH concentrations. The transverse surface plasmon resonance absorption peak of gold nanorods (AuNRs) significantly shifted, indicating a novel mechanism distinct from etching or surface coating, which typically altered the longitudinal surface plasmon absorption peak. Under optimized conditions, the assay exhibited commendable specificity and reliability in actual samples. The assay accurately quantified GSH ranging from 1 to 10 microM, with detection limits of 439 nM and 260 nM for spectrophotometry and visual analysis, respectively. It was firstly to use GSH as a reducing agent to react with AuNRs in the presence of AgNO3 and the mechanism was different from etching or surface coating. The study's assay shows potential for detecting GSH in food samples and provides an alternative approach for the development of colorimetric detection assays based on AuNRs.
