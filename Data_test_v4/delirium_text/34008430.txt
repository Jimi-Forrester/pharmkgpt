34008430|t|Factors Influencing the Physical Restraint of Patients in the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit.
34008430|a|The purpose of this study was to investigate the current status of physical restraint of patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit (NSICU) and analyze the factors influencing this measure using a cross-sectional study design. A total of 312 patients from four tertiary hospitals in NSICU were investigated in Beijing, China. The rate of physical restraint of patients in the NSICU was 42.9%. In 41.8% of cases, nurses performed physical restraint based on experience, and 45.5% of patients had physical restraint-related nursing records. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that physical restraint was associated with delirium, mild-to-moderate disturbance of consciousness, history of extubation, surgery, and use of sedatives within 24 hour. Analysis of related factors can provide a reference for nurses and managers to improve physical restraint strategies.
