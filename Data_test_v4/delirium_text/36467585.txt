36467585|a|Post-transcriptional modifications in RNAs regulate their biological behaviors and functions. N1-methyladenosine (m1A), which is dynamically regulated by writers, erasers and readers, has been found as a reversible modification in tRNA, mRNA, rRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). m1A modification has impacts on the RNA processing, structure and functions of targets. Increasing studies reveal the critical roles of m1A modification and its regulators in tumorigenesis. Due to the positive relevance between m1A and cancer development, targeting m1A modification and m1A-related regulators has been of attention. In this review, we summarized the current understanding of m1A in RNAs, covering the modulation of m1A modification in cancer biology, as well as the possibility of targeting m1A modification as a potential target for cancer diagnosis and therapy.
