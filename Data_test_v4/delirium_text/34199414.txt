34199414|a|The ratio of human nonmercaptalbumin (HNA) and reduced albumin (HMA) may be a new marker for oxidative stress. Locomotive syndrome (LS) is reduced mobility due to impairment of locomotive organs. We investigated whether the HNA/HMA ratio could be a new biomarker of LS. This study included 306 subjects (mean age 64.24 +- 10.4 years) who underwent LS tests, grip strength, walking speed, and tests for HNA and HMA. Oxidative stress was measured by the ratio of HMA (f(HMA) = (HMA/(HMA + HNA) x 100)), and the subjects were divided into normal (N group; f[HMA] >= 70%) and low (L group; f[HMA] < 70%) groups. There were 124 non-elderly (<65 years) and 182 elderly subjects (>=65 years). There were no significant differences in LS, grip strength, and walking speed between the L and N groups in the non-elderly subjects. However, significant differences were found in the elderly subjects. In logistic regression analysis, there was an association between f(HMA) and the LS severity at older ages. LS in the elderly is associated with a decline in HMA and, thus, an increase in oxidative stress. Thus, f(HMA) is a new biomarker of LS.
