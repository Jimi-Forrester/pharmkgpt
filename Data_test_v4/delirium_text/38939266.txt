38939266|t|Exploring the Ramifications of Delayed Hospital Discharges: Impacts on Patients, Physicians, and Healthcare Systems.
38939266|a|Prolonged hospital stays can significantly impede patients' recovery, negatively affecting anything from physical health via issues like hospital-acquired infections and increased complications due to immobility to psychological health. Several studies investigated the psychosocial impact of prolonged hospital stays, revealing a variety of patient perspectives, such as feeling uncertain and frustrated about their conditions, which can erode their trust in healthcare providers. Delayed discharges not only affect patients but also have multifaceted effects on healthcare providers, potentially reducing physician efficiency and contributing to higher rates of burnout among healthcare professionals. This article investigates the consequences of delayed versus early discharge on physicians, patients, and the overall hospital system. We conducted an extensive search through PubMed and Google Scholar using the keywords "delayed discharge," "hospital discharge," and "bed blocking" to identify all the recent studies highlighting the dynamics of patient discharge. Our results support the hypothesis that reducing delayed discharge rates will not only improve patient outcomes but also have widespread fiscal impacts. This review also outlines measures to reduce delayed discharges, ultimately leading to a significant enhancement in the healthcare system.
