34684152|t|Anticholinergic Burden of Geriatric Ward Inpatients.
34684152|a|Background and Objectives: Anticholinergic drug use in the pharmacotherapy of elderly persons is common despite the increased risk of side effects. We examined the prevalence of anticholinergic drug use and total anticholinergic drug burden among patients admitted to an acute care geriatric ward in Poland. Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional study of 329 subjects hospitalized at the geriatric ward. Patient condition was assessed with a comprehensive geriatric assessment. The Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale was used to estimate the total anticholinergic load. Results: Mean patient age was 79.61 +- 6.82 years. 40.73% of them were burdened with at least one anticholinergic drug. The clinically significant anticholinergic burden was observed in 13.98% of subjects. Patients with dementia, risk of falls, and severe disability had significantly higher total ACB scores compared to other groups. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve revealed that the total ACB score >= 1 was significantly associated with dementia and the risk of falls. Total ACB score >= 2 was significantly associated with severe disability. Conclusions: Patients admitted to an acute care geriatric ward had an anticholinergic cognitive burden score comparable to other patient populations. We found associations at both low and elevated levels of anticholinergic burden with dementia and risk of falls. At elevated anticholinergic burden levels, we found associations with severe disability. Despite recommendations against the use of anticholinergics in older adults these medications are still commonly prescribed. Further study is necessary to define the characteristics of anticholinergic medication most closely associated with negative outcomes in elderly populations.
