34408421|t|Association Between NR4A2 Gene Polymorphism and Depressive Symptoms and Antidepressant Effect.
34408421|a|OBJECTIVE: Although the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) is still unclear, studies have shown that the dopaminergic system of depressed patients is defective, and that NR4A2 is an important transcription factor affecting the development and maintenance of dopaminergic neurons. As such, NR4A2 levels affected by NR4A2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be associated with MDD. This study examined whether NR4A2 SNPs are associated with depressive symptoms and antidepressant efficacy. METHODS: A total of 441 patients with first-episode depression were enrolled in this study. We analysed three SNPs of NR4A2, using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and its four factors to obtain scores at baseline and at the end of 6 weeks. UNPHASED software was employed for quantitative character analysis, and SPSS software was adopted for antidepressant efficacy analysis. RESULTS: Patients with rs12803-A exhibited higher scores of retardation symptoms. Patients with the rs834834-C allele and rs834834-CC genotype had higher retardation symptom scores. Patients with rs3769340 exhibited greater antidepressant efficacy. CONCLUSION: NR4A2 gene polymorphisms are associated with retardation symptoms, somatic symptoms (gastro-intestinal), anxiety-based somatic symptoms, insight, and weight loss in patients with MDD. Additionally, rs3769340 may be a predictor of antidepressant efficacy in patients with major depressive disorder.
