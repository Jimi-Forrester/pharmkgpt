39577506|t|Vibrotactile stimulation at 40 Hz inhibits Abeta-induced changes in SH-SY5Y, BV2 cells, and pericytes.
39577506|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a major societal challenge, yet no definitive cure exists. Noninvasive brain stimulation methods, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, have shown promise in alleviating cognitive symptoms associated with neurodegenerative disorders. This study investigated the effects of 40 Hz vibrotactile stimulation on AD-related cellular responses using SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, primary human brain pericytes, and BV2 microglia. SH-SY5Y cells and brain pericytes treated with oligomeric beta-amyloid (Abeta) underwent 40 Hz vibrational stimulation for varying durations. Cell viability was determined via the CCK-8 assay, while intracellular calcium levels in pericytes were assessed. Protein expression was measured using western blotting, and gene expression was quantified via a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Detailed vibrational parameters were employed to ensure precise stimulation. Notably, 40 Hz vibrotactile stimulation improved cell viability in Abeta-exposed SH-SY5Y cells, reduced intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) levels in Abeta-treated pericytes, activated autophagy, and mitigated tau hyperphosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, it exhibited anti-neuroinflammatory properties in BV2 microglia. These findings highlight the potential of 40 Hz vibrotactile stimulation as a therapeutic strategy for AD.
