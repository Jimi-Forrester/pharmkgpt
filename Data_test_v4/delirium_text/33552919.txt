33552919|t|Rare presentation of isolated bilateral testicular myeloid sarcoma: A case report.
33552919|a|Myeloid sarcoma (MS) of the testis is a rare soft tissue tumour which can herald the development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The diagnosis of MS requires a high degree of suspicion as appropriate immunohistochemical staining must be performed to yield an early diagnosis. Whilst there is no consensus on treatment on MS involving the testis, most patients undergo orchidectomy and systemic chemotherapy, with or without radiation therapy. Early and aggressive treatment is key to achieving remission. This case report describes a patient with bilateral testicular MS which heralded the development of AML, who underwent induction chemotherapy and achieved remission.
