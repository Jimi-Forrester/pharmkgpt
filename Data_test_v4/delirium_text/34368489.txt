34368489|a|INTRODUCTION: the prognosis of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) remains poor. Understanding gender differences can clarify the clinico-epidemiological and process of care related factors that influence SICH prognosis. We analyzed the long-term gender differences of mortality after SICH in Algarve, southern Portugal. PATIENTS AND METHODS: analysis of consecutive community representative of SICH survivors (2009-2015). Logistic regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess gender differences on 1-year mortality and survival. We further analyzed if differences exist between 4 age and gender based subgroups (women <75 years, women >=75 years, men <75 years, men >=75 years). RESULTS: a total of 285 survivors were analyzed; majority men (66.3%). Women were 2 years older on average. Overall case fatality was 11.6% [CI: 8.3-15.8]. A non-statistically significant (P = .094) higher case-fatality rate was observed in women; men were more frequently admitted to stroke unit; women had more often poor functional outcome or modified Rankin scale (mRS) >=3. Predictors of death were: being women with >= 75 years, in-hospital pneumonia and hospital discharge mRS >=3. The likelihood of death was higher in women >=75 years (OR = 2.91 [1.23-8.1], P = .035) in comparison to women <75 years and men >=75 years. Women <75 years had the longest survivor time, whereas women >=75 years the shortest survivor time (P < .001). CONCLUSION: gender and age interact to influence long-term mortality after SICH. Women >=75 years are at increased risk of death and have reduced survival after SICH in southern Portugal. Further studies are needed to clarify the biological or social factors contributing for the poor prognosis in the very old women in the region.
