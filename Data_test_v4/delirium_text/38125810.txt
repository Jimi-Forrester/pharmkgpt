38125810|t|Causal associations between common musculoskeletal disorders and dementia: a Mendelian randomization study.
38125810|a|Introduction: Dementia and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are major public health problems. We aimed to investigate the genetic causality of common MSDs and dementia. Methods: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used in this study. MR analysis based on gene-wide association study (GWAS) data on osteoarthritis (OA), dementia with Lewy bodies, and other MSDs and dementia types were obtained from the Genetics of Osteoarthritis consortium, IEU-open GWAS project, GWAS catalog, and FinnGen consortium. Rigorously selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms were regarded as instrumental variables for further MR analysis. Inverse-variance weighted, MR-Egger regression, weight median, simple mode, and weight mode methods were used to obtain the MR estimates. Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger and MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier analysis, and the leave-one-out test were applied for sensitivity testing. Results: The inverse-variance weighted method showed that hip OA was genetically associated with a lower risk of dementia, unspecified dementia, dementia in Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. Kneehip OA was inversely associated with unspecified dementia and vascular dementia. Rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and seronegative rheumatoid arthritis were inversely associated with frontotemporal dementia, and rheumatoid arthritis was inversely associated with unspecified dementia. Simultaneously, ankylosing spondylitis was an independent risk factor for dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and dementia in Alzheimer's disease. Sensitivity tests showed that heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy did not exist in these associations. The leave-one-out test showed that these associations were stable. Conclusion: We found that some MSDs were associated with the risk of dementia and provide evidence for the early detection of dementia in patients with MSDs and for the impact of inflammation on the central nervous system.
