34986538|a|Cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R), as the major member of the endocannabinoid system, is among the most abundant receptors expressed in the central nervous system. CB1R is mainly located on the axon terminals of presynaptic neurons and participate in the modulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity, playing an important role in the pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric diseases. In recent years, the consistent development of CB1R radioligands and the maturity of molecular imaging techniques, particularly positron emission tomography (PET) may help to visualize the expression and distribution of CB1R in central nervous system . At present, CB1R PET imaging can effectively evaluate the changes of CB1R levels in neuropsychiatric diseases such as Huntington's disease and schizophrenia, and its correlation with the disease severity, therefore providing new insights for the diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases. This article reviews the application of CB1R PET imaging in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, cannabis use disorder and depression.
