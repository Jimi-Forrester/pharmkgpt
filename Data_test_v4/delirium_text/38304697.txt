38304697|a|Carbamate (CBs) is a class of insecticides which is being known as an important cause of intentional or accidental poisoning. CBs, cause carbamylation of acetylcholinesterase at neuronal synapses and neuromuscular junction. Exposure to CBs through skin contact, inhalation, or ingestion can result in significant cholinergic toxicity. This is due to the elevation of acetylcholine levels at ganglionic synapses found in both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, as well as muscarinic receptors located in target organs of the parasympathetic nervous system, nicotinic receptors situated in skeletal muscle tissue, and the central nervous system. The association between human illnesses and environmental exposures to CBs have been extensively studied in several studies. Although CBs-triggered toxicity leads to overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the detailed association between the toxicity under CBs exposure and NFE2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathways has not been completely clarified. In this review we aimed to summarize the latest findings on the functional interrelationship between carbamates compounds and Nrf2 signaling.
