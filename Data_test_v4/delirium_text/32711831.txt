32711831|a|For elderly patients undergoing elective surgical procedures, preoperative evaluation of cognition is often overlooked. Patients may experience postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive decline (POCD), especially those with certain risk factors, including advanced age. Preoperative cognitive impairment is a leading risk factor for both POD and POCD, and studies have noted that identifying these deficiencies is critical during the preoperative period so that appropriate preventive strategies can be implemented. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is a useful approach which evaluates a patient's medical, psycho-social, and functional domains objectively. Various screening tools are available for preoperatively identifying patients with cognitive impairment. The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols have been discussed in the context of prehabilitation as an effort to optimize a patient's physical status prior to surgery and decrease the risk of POD and POCD. Evidence-based protocols are warranted to standardize care in efforts to effectively meet the needs of these patients.
