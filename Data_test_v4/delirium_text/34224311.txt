34224311|a|Interactions between prion protein (PrP) and tau protein have long been discussed, especially in relation to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The presence of tauopathy in the genetic forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) brains is not uncommon. Molecular interactions between PrP and tau protein have been demonstrated in animal models; the role is attributed to the structural properties of misfolded isoform of the host-encoded prion protein (PrPSc) aggregates, especially amyloid, which contributes to the phosphorylation of tau protein, which is reflected in the frequent occurrence of tau pathology in inherited prion amyloidoses. The question is the relationship between PrPSc and hippocampal tau pathology without amyloid deposits (i.e. PART and ARTAG) in sporadic CJD (sCJD). The co-occurrence of these two proteinopathies in sCJD brains is quite rare. These pathological entities have been described in only a few cases of sCJD, all of them were older than 70 years. There have been speculations about the possibility of accelerating the course of pre-existing tauopathy or the possibility of accelerating the ageing process in the CJD brains. Here we present the clinical course and neuropathological findings of a patient with sCJD in whom the above mentioned tauopathies PART and ARTAG, considered to be typical for older age, were found as early as 58 years of age. According to the available information, this case represents an unusually early occurrence of age-related tauopathies not only in relation to sCJD, but also in general.
