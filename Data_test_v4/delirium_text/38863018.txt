38863018|t|The effect of an improved ICU physical environment on outcomes and post-ICU recovery-a protocol.
38863018|a|BACKGROUND: Intensive care medicine continues to improve, with advances in technology and care provision leading to improved patient survival. However, this has not been matched by similar advances in ICU bedspace design. Environmental factors including excessive noise, suboptimal lighting, and lack of natural lights and views can adversely impact staff wellbeing and short- and long-term patient outcomes. The personal, social, and economic costs associated with this are potentially large. The ICU of the Future project was conceived to address these issues. This is a mixed-method project, aiming to improve the ICU bedspace environment and assess impact on patient outcomes. Two innovative and adaptive ICU bedspaces capable of being individualised to patients' personal and changing needs were co-designed and implemented. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of an improved ICU bedspace environment on patient outcomes and operational impact. METHODS: This is a prospective multi-component, mixed methods study including a randomised controlled trial. Over a 2-year study period, the two upgraded bedspaces will serve as intervention beds, while the remaining 25 bedspaces in the study ICU function as control beds. Study components encompass (1) an objective environmental assessment; (2) a qualitative investigation of the ICU environment and its impact from the perspective of patients, families, and staff; (3) sleep investigations; (4) circadian rhythm investigations; (5) delirium measurements; (6) assessment of medium-term patient outcomes; and (7) a health economic evaluation. DISCUSSION: Despite growing evidence of the negative impact the ICU environment can have on patient recovery, this is an area of critical care medicine that is understudied and commonly not considered when ICUs are being designed. This study will provide new information on how an improved ICU environment impact holistic patient recovery and outcomes, potentially influencing ICU design worldwide.
