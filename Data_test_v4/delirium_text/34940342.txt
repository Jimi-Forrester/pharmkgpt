34940342|t|Can RUDAS Be an Alternate Test for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults, Thailand?
34940342|a|The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is the commonly used cognitive test for detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Thailand. Nevertheless, cultural biases and educational levels influence its performance. The Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS) seems to lower the limitation of the MoCA. This study aimed to compare the performance of the RUDAS and the MoCA for the diagnosis of MCI and demonstrate the correlation between them. A cross-sectional study of 150 older participants from the outpatient setting of the Internal Medicine Department, Srinagarind Hospital, Thailand was recruited during January 2020 and March 2021. The diagnostic properties in detecting MCI of the RUDAS and the MoCA were compared. MCI was diagnosed in 42 cases (28%). The AUC for both RUDAS (0.82, 95% CI 0.75-0.89) and MoCA (0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.88) were similar. A score of 25/30 provided the best cut-off point for the RUDAS (sensitivity 76.2%, specificity 75%) and a score of 19/30 for the MoCA had sensitivity and specificity of 76.2% and 71.3%. The Spearman's correlation coefficient between both tests was 0.6. In conclusion, the RUDAS-Thai could be an option for MCI screening. It was correlated moderately to the MoCA.
