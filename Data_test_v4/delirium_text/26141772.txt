26141772|t|3-Hydroxy-4-pyridinone derivatives designed for fluorescence studies to determine interaction with amyloid protein as well as cell permeability.
26141772|a|Finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease is an urgent goal. Multifunctional metal binders are used to elucidate its pathological features and investigated as potential therapeutics. The use of physicochemical and TD-DFT calculations constituted successful strategy in the design of 1-(4-(benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)phenyl)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridin-4(1H)-one (HL21) and 1-(4-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)phenyl)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridin-4(1H)-one (HL22). We report the synthesis and full characterization of these compounds, including X-ray crystallography. Using fluorescent signal as the readout, it was determined that HL22 interacts with amyloid-beta protein fibrils, and permeates into bEnd.3 cells used as a mimic of the blood-brain barrier. This provides the first example of direct investigation of our hydroxypyridinone compounds within a biological setting.
