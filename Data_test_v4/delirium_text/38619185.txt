38619185|t|Efficacy and safety of music therapy for the treatment of anxiety and delirium in ICU patients: a meta-analysis and systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
38619185|a|INTRODUCTION: The medical application of music therapy (MT) has received widespread attention in recent years, some researchers have attempted to apply MT to the treatment of patients with anxiety and delirium in ICU. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Relevant randomized controlled trials (randomized controlled trials s) were searched in databases, such as Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Medline, Scopus, and CINAHL. Researchers performed literature screening, data extraction, literature quality assessment, and heterogeneity analysis among RCTs. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. In general, we included RCTs with low risk of bias, and the primary outcome indicators, including the Chinese version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (C-STAI), Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety Measurement (VAS-A), and Facial Anxiety Scale (FAS), have a recommended level of evidence of "strong". The pooled results indicated that MT was effective in alleviating the anxiety state of ICU patients (95% CI, SMD=-1.09 [-1.52, -0.67], P<0.05) and could reduce mental and physical fatigue in patients with anxious delirium in ICU (95% CI, WMD=-2.35 [-3.37, -1.33], P <0.05). There were significant differences in the therapeutic effects of MT with different intervention durations. Both 15-minute and 30-minute MT were effective in reducing anxiety levels in patients with anxiety disorders in the ICU (15min: 95%CI, SMD=-1.70[-2.15, -1.24], P<0.05; 30min: 95%CI, SMD=-0.73[-1.16, - 0.29], P<0.05). However, when the duration of MT exceeded 45 min, the overtreatment of MT instead interfered with patient rest and failed to produce a positive therapeutic effect (95% CI, SMD=-1.04 [-3.06, 0.97], P=0.31). In addition, a meta-analysis of physiological outcomes found that MT was effective in maintaining the stabilization of heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in ICU patients with anxiety (P<0.05), but did not affect patients' oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure and diastolic blood pressure (P>0.05). No adverse events occurred during MT treatment in the reports of included 14 studies. CONCLUSIONS: MT can safely and effectively reduce the anxiety level of patients with anxiety and delirium in ICU and relieve their psychological and physical fatigue. And MT was able to maintain the stability of HR, RR, and SBP in ICU patients.
