35646513|a|Purpose of Review: Neuropathic pain (NP) has been ubiquitously characterized by lesion and its linked somatosensory system either the central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS) This PNS episode is the most prevalent site of NP origin and is found to be associated with afferent nerve fibers carrying pain signals from injured/trauma site to the CNS including the brain. Several kinds of pharmacotherapeutic drugs shuch as analgesics, anti-convulsants, and anti-depressants are being employed for the its possible interventions. The NP has been a great interest to follow different pathophysiological mechanisms which are often considered to correlate with the metabolic pathways and its mediated disease. There is paucity of knowledge to make such mechanism via NP. Recent Finding: Most notably, recent pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 has also been reported in chronic pain mediated diabetes, inflammatory disorders, and cancers. There is an increasing incidence of NP and its complex mechanism has now led to identify the possible investigations of responsible genes and proteins via bioinformatics tools. The analysis might be more instrumental as collecting the genes from pain genetic database, analyzing the variants through differential gene expression (DEG) and constructing the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and thereby determining their upregulating and downregulating pathways. Summary: This review sheds a bright light towards several mechanisms at both cellular and molecular level, correlation of NP-mediated disease mechanism and possible cell surface biomarkers (receptors), and identified genes could be more promising for their pharmacological targets.
