33343135|a|CONTEXT: Aphasia is a major disabling condition after a stroke that profoundly affects the quality of life of stroke survivors (SS) and their caregivers. Comprehensive neuropsychological rehabilitation has emerged as a complementary intervention that helps in improving the associated cognitive and psychological deficits and quality of life following a brain injury. A standardized, simple, and easy to administer intervention that can be delivered as a home-based intervention can assist in faster recovery. AIMS: To describe the development, validation, and feasibility of a home-based, caregiver-delivered comprehensive neuropsychological and language rehabilitation for SS. METHODS AND MATERIAL: A culture-specific picture and task-based 8-week training workbook and manual were developed based on extensive review and focused group discussions. This intervention targeted areas of language (comprehension, fluency, and naming) and cognition (working memory, attention and concentration, executive functioning, and response inhibition). It was standardized on 40 healthy controls (HC) and 15 SS. Before recruitment, written informed consent was obtained from each patient, their primary caregiver, and the HCs. RESULTS: All tasks were found to be effective in discriminating the performance of SS from the HC. The performance of the HC with respect to the errors and the time taken for each task was used for the hierarchical arrangement of the tasks. The developed intervention was later validated on 15 SS where they significantly improved in the pre-post assessment of language functioning (P < 0.001), quality of life (P < 0.001), and depression (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This intervention can be feasible to administer as a home-based intervention and may help to alleviate language and neuropsychological complaints after stroke in low-literate or mixed-cultural populations. Further, large sample size studies are recommended.
