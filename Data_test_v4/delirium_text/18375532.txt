18375532|t|Transitioning dementia residents from assisted living to memory care units: a pilot study.
18375532|a|Our study examined the process of transitioning residents of assisted living facilities (ALFs) who have Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder to memory care units (MCUs). In-depth surveys with 10 ALF administrators in South Carolina were conducted. Grounded theory identified major themes; thematic analysis organized content. Most administrators used a preadmission screening process to assess cognitive status. About half reported that they discussed the possibility of future transfer to another level of care with the family at admission. Most administrators said that their facilities had transfer policies in place; of these, only two-thirds discussed their policies with families on admission. Transfer triggers included leaving the facility without anyone's knowledge, disturbing behaviors, and increased care needs. Challenges included family resistance and greater costs of MCUs. Assisted living facilities that were part of continuing care retirement communities used more multidisciplinary transfer decision-making than free-standing ALFs. Suggested improvements stressed educating families about dementia and MCUs.
