39035943|t|Designing Nanocomposite-Based Electrochemical Biosensors for Diabetes Mellitus Detection: A Review.
39035943|a|This review will unveil the development of a new generation of electrochemical sensors utilizing a transition-metal-oxide-based nanocomposite with varying morphology. There has been considerable discussion on the role of transition metal oxide-based nanocomposite, including iron, nickel, copper, cobalt, zinc, platinum, manganese, conducting polymers, and their composites, in electrochemical and biosensing applications. Utilizing these materials to detect glucose and hydrogen peroxide selectively and sensitively with the correct chemical functionalization is possible. These transition metals and their oxide nanoparticles offer a potential method for electrode modification in sensors. Nanotechnology has made it feasible to develop nanostructured materials for glucose and H2O2 biosensor applications. Highly sensitive and selective biosensors with a low detection limit can detect biomolecules at nanomolar to picomolar (10-9 to 10-12 molar) concentrations to assess physiological and metabolic parameters. By mixing carbon-based materials (graphene oxide) with inorganic nanoparticles, nanocomposite biosensor devices with increased sensitivity can be made using semiconducting nanoparticles, quantum dots, organic polymers, and biomolecules.
