34629042|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is usually caused by intellectual deterioration which occurs due to the degeneration of cholinergic neurons. Donepezil is employed for cholinesterase enzyme Inhibition (ChEI) to treat AD in a wider population. Over the years, researchers finding difficulties prompted through traditional dosage forms particularly in geriatric patience. To avoid swallowing difficulties brought about with the aid of the AD population, researchers majorly focused on Oral Thin-Film technology (OTF). This technology strongly eliminates issues caused by solid oral dosage forms. It is one of the quality strategies to alternate a drug that is used in the first-pass metabolism or pre systematic metabolism. The solubility of the drug is a bigger problem and it can expand by way of lowering particle size. Nanofibers are need of the day to minimize the drug particles at the submicron stage which can increase the drug release rate drastically. It can be prepared by Electrospinning technology by incorporating polymeric material into poorly soluble drugs. Mostly natural and biodegradable polymers prefer in all pharmaceutical preparations. Polymers employed for oral delivery should be stable, possess mucoadhesive properties, and should release the drug by diffusion, degradation, and swelling mechanism. The objective of the present review explains various thin-film and nanofiber formulations used for faster drug release in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
