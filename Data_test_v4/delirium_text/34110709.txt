34110709|t|Mass spectrometry-based urinary metabolomics for exploring the treatment effects of Radix ginseng-Schisandra chinensis herb pair on Alzheimer's disease in rats.
34110709|a|Herb pairs are the unique combinations of two relatively fixed herbs, intrinsically convey the basic idea of traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions. The compatibility of Radix ginseng and Schisandra chinensis has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for treating Alzheimer's disease for many years. However, there are few studies on Radix ginseng-Schisandra chinensis herb pair, and the underlying action mechanism is still unclear. In this study, the mechanism of Radix ginseng-Schisandra chinensis herb pair on Alzheimer's disease was investigated by using the mass spectrometry-based urinary metabolomics method. Sixteen urinary endogenous metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers. Meanwhile, 10 biomarkers were quantified with tandem mass spectrometry. The study result showed that the brain pathologic symptoms of model rats were improved and the potential biomarkers were adjusted backward significantly after the herb pair administration. The metabolic pathways linked to the herb pair-regulated endogenous biomarkers included phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, purine metabolism, and so on. The above metabolic pathways reflected that Radix ginseng-Schisandra chinensis herb pair mainly regulates abnormal energy metabolism, reduces inflammation, and regulates gut microbiota and neurotransmitters in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
