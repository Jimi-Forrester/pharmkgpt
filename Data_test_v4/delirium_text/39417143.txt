39417143|a|INTRODUCTION: Understanding the heterogeneity of brain structure in individuals with the Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome (MCR) may improve the current risk assessments of dementia. METHODS: We used data from 6 cohorts from the MCR consortium (N=1987). A weakly-supervised clustering algorithm called HYDRA was applied to volumetric MRI measures to identify distinct subgroups in the population with gait speeds lower than one standard deviation (1SD) above mean. RESULTS: Three subgroups (Groups A, B & C) were identified through MRI-based clustering with significant differences in regional brain volumes, gait speeds, and performance on Trail Making (Part-B) and Free and Cued Selective Reminding Tests. DISCUSSION: Based on structural MRI, our results reflect heterogeneity in the population with moderate and slow gait, including those with MCR. Such a data-driven approach could help pave new pathways toward dementia at-risk stratification and have implications for precision health for patients.
