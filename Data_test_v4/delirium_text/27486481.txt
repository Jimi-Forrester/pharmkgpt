27486481|t|A de novo 1.6Mb microdeletion at 19q13.2 in a boy with Diamond-Blackfan anemia, global developmental delay and multiple congenital anomalies.
27486481|a|BACKGROUD: Microdeletions at 19q13.2 are very rare. Only two cases have been previously described. Here we report a 2-year-2-month old boy with Diamond-Blackfan anemia, global developmental delay, cognitive impairments, distinctive facial features, behavior problems, skeletal and genital dysplasia. CASE PRESENTATION: A de novo 1.6 Mb microdeletion at 19q13.2q13.31 was detected by chromosomal microarray analysis. Haploinsufficiency of the RPS19 gene is known to cause Diamond-Blackfan anemia, other features in this patient are likely due to the deletion of other candidate genes such as PAFAH1B3, ERF, LIPE and GSK3A. CONCLUSION: The deletion detected in our patient overlapped and was significantly smaller than the ones previously reported, which offered the opportunity to further define the critical region for this proposed contiguous gene deletion syndrome.
