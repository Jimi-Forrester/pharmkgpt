38784861|t|Vision-Related Quality of Life Among Diabetic Retinopathy Patients in a Hospital-Based Population in the Sultanate of Oman.
38784861|a|Background: The global prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) among individuals with diabetes is 22.27%. This highlights the likelihood of developing burden of retinopathy within the at risk population and can have a detrimental impact on an individual's quality of life (QoL). The aim of this study is to assess the vision-related QoL in individuals with (DR) in a hospital-based population in the Al-Buraimi governorate, Sultanate of Oman. Methods: The study was conducted in the Ophthalmology Outpatient Department of Al Buraimi Hospital and Polyclinic. This study enrolled 218 patients (114 males, 104 females) diagnosed with DR. The NEI-VFQ-25 questionnaire was adopted in this study. The patients were classified into different groups according to their type of diabetes and other relevant demographic information. Results: A total of 218 patients responded to the NEI-VFQ-25 questionnaire. The mean age of the participants was 57.49 +- 12.3 years, 52.3% were male, and 47.7% were female. The overall QoL score was 41.53+- 20.8. Patients aged more than 75 years had the lowest QoL scores compared with the other age groups (p = 0.02). The results showed that the duration of diabetes had no significant impact on the overall QoL scores (p = 0.06). A higher QoL score was observed among patients with type II diabetes mellitus (DM) than with type I diabetes mellitus (p = 0.01). Patients diagnosed with proliferative DR (PDR) had a significantly lower QoL score than those diagnosed at other stages (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The QoL of the population with DR is negatively affected by various factors, including demographics, disease severity, and in patients with DM type II. It is important to consider these factors to enhance QoL in patients with DR. Regular evaluation of an individual's QoL is beneficial for both physicians and healthcare teams.
