38948505|t|Identification of high-performing antibodies for tyrosine-protein kinase SYK for use in Western Blot, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence.
38948505|a|Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK, encoded by the SYK gene, is a non-receptor type protein kinase which mediates immune signal transduction through immunoreceptors. Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK expression has been associated with the development of various inflammatory diseases, cancer and neurodegenerative conditions. The reproducibility of tyrosine-protein kinase SYK research would help elucidate the mechanism in which it causes neuroinflammation as well as its potential as a novel target to treat Alzheimer's disease. This would be facilitated with the availability of high-quality tyrosine-protein kinase SYK. In this study, we characterized thirteen tyrosine-protein kinase SYK commercial antibodies for Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. We identified many high-performing antibodies and encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.
