38251054|t|Post-Traumatic Cerebral Infarction: A Narrative Review of Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment.
38251054|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common diagnosis requiring acute hospitalization. Long-term, TBI is a significant source of health and socioeconomic impact in the United States and globally. The goal of clinicians who manage TBI is to prevent secondary brain injury. In this population, post-traumatic cerebral infarction (PTCI) acutely after TBI is an important but under-recognized complication that is associated with negative functional outcomes. In this comprehensive review, we describe the incidence and pathophysiology of PTCI. We then discuss the diagnostic and treatment approaches for the most common etiologies of isolated PTCI, including brain herniation syndromes, cervical artery dissection, venous thrombosis, and post-traumatic vasospasm. In addition to these mechanisms, hypercoagulability and microcirculatory failure can also exacerbate ischemia. We aim to highlight the importance of this condition and future clinical research needs with the goal of improving patient outcomes after TBI.
