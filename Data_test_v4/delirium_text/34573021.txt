34573021|a|Epilobium hirsutum is extensively used as a traditional remedy in folk medicine, especially against prostate inflammation. Therefore, we evaluated the chemical profiles and biopharmaceutical potentials of different extracts of E. hirsutum aerial parts and roots. Metabolomic, antioxidant, and enzyme inhibitory profiles were investigated. Human prostate cancer PC3 cells were exposed to the extracts to evaluate antiproliferative effects. Gene expression and bioinformatics analyses were performed to investigate anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Oenothein B and myricetin were prominent compounds in the extracts. In scavenging/reducing assays, the methanol, infusion, and methanol/water extracts exhibited similar activities. We also observed the reduction of PC3 viability occurring following exposure to methanol and methanol/water extracts. According to bioinformatics analysis, myricetin was predicted to interact with COX-2 and TNFalpha. The interaction between TNFalpha and oxo-dihydroxy-octadecenoic acid was predicted as well. Intriguingly, the gene expression of COX-2 and TNFalpha was reduced in PC3 cells after exposure to methanol and methanol/water extracts. These effects were paralleled by the decreased gene expression of IL-8 and NFkB and the inhibition of PGE2 release. Therefore, the present findings suggest the potential use of E. hirsutum for the management of the burden of inflammation and oxidative stress occurring in lower urinary tract diseases, including prostatitis.
