32382180|t|The incidence of prolonged post-electroconvulsive therapy delirium: A retrospective study.
32382180|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the incidence and determinants of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-induced delirium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a retrospective study design, data of 488 patients undergoing modified ECT were evaluated for the development of new-onset prolonged delirium. Demographic and clinical parameters of patients who developed delirium and those who did not develop delirium were compared. RESULTS: 5.7% of the patients developed prolonged post-ECT delirium. The use of quetiapine in higher doses and the lack of use of antidepressants while receiving ECT were associated with the development of prolonged post-ECT delirium. None of the other clinical and ECT-related parameters emerged as a significant factor associated with the development of prolonged post-ECT delirium. CONCLUSIONS: A small proportion of patients undergoing ECT develop post-ECT prolonged delirium.
