38899253|t|Characterizing the Immature Immunophenotype of Sickle Cell Disease Monocytes.
38899253|a|Sickle cell disease (SCD) is marked by episodic vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). Recurrent VOC creates a pro-inflammatory state that induces phenotypic alterations in innate immune cells. Monocytes are of particular interest to VOC pathophysiology because they are especially malleable to inflammatory signaling. Indeed, inflammatory disease states such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity and atherosclerosis are known to influence monocyte development and alter monocyte subpopulations. In this study, we describe SCD monocyte subsets by performing immunophenotypic flow cytometric, enzymatic, and morphologic analysis on peripheral blood. Herein, we add to the growing body of evidence suggesting aberrant monocyte populations underpin VOC pathophysiology. We found that SCD monocytes possess an immature phenotype as demonstrated by 1) decreased CD4 positivity (p < .01), 2) low alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase (ANBE) expression, and 3) naive morphologic features. We additionally found an increase in CD14+CD16-CD4- monocytes (p < .01), a subset associated with the impaired immune response of post-trauma patients. Interestingly, we also found a large proportion of CD14+CD4-HLA-DR- monocytes which, under normal circumstances, are exclusively found in neonates (p < .01). Finally, we report an increase in nonclassical monocytes (CD14dimCD16+), a subset recently shown to have a critical role in prevention and recovery from VOC.
