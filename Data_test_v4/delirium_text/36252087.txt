36252087|a|INTRODUCTION: At present, no pharmacological interventions have been approved for the treatment of agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), an important neuropsychiatric symptom that has been linked to increased mortality and greater caregiver burden. Antipsychotics offer some benefit, but increase the risk of adverse events such as falls, extrapyramidal symptoms, stroke, and mortality. Over the past 10 years, several new and repurposed medications have shown promise for treating AD-associated agitation. AREAS COVERED: We review the risks and benefits of emerging therapies for agitation in AD, which include newer atypical antipsychotics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, cannabinoids, and dextromethorphan combination products. Other drugs such as mirtazapine, prazosin, and lithium are also discussed. Clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central databases were searched for relevant studies from 1 January 2012 to 1 May 2022. EXPERT OPINION: At the present time, there are no pharmacological interventions for the treatment of agitation in AD whose benefits clearly outweigh their potential safety concerns. Therefore, management of agitation in AD should primarily be based on non-pharmacological approaches. When medications are considered necessary, they should only be initiated with the caregiver's appreciation of their risks and benefits and with careful and ongoing assessment of their safety.
