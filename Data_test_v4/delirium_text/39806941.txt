39806941|a|Peripheral neurodegenerative diseases induced by irreversible peripheral nerve degeneration (PND), such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy, have a high prevalence worldwide and reduce the quality of life. However, there is no agent effective against the irreversible PND. After peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells play an important role in regulating PND. However, because PND involves multiple biochemical events in Schwann cells, a one-drug-single-target therapeutic strategy is not feasible for PND. Here, we suggested that fascaplysin (Fas), a compound with multiple targets (CDK4/6), could overcome these problems. Fas exerted a significant inhibitory effect on axonal degradation, demyelination, and Schwann cell proliferation and dedifferentiation during in vitro and ex vivo PND. To discover the most likely novel target for PND, a chemo-bioinformatics analysis predicted the other on-targets of Fas and identified androgen receptor (AR) which were involved in Schwann cell differentiation and proliferation. AR interacted with Fas, and nuclear import of the AR/Fas complex was inhibited in Schwann cells, altering the expression patterns of transcription factors during PND. Therefore, Fas may have therapeutic potential for irreversible peripheral neurodegenerative diseases.
