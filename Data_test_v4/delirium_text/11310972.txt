11310972|t|Alzheimer's disease: its origin at the membrane, evidence and questions.
11310972|a|Numerous results on membrane lipid composition from different regions of autopsied Alzheimer's disease brains in comparison with corresponding fractions isolated from control brains revealed significant differences in serine- and ethanolamine-containing glycerophospholipid as well as in glycosphingolipid content. Changes in membrane lipid composition are frequently accompanied by alterations in membrane fluidity, hydrophobic mismatch, lipid signaling pathways, transient formation and disappearance of lipid microdomains, changes in membrane permeability to cations and variations of other membrane properties. In this review we focus on possible implications of altered membrane composition on beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and on proteolysis of APP leading eventually to the formation of neurotoxic beta-amyloid (A beta) peptides, the major proteinaceous component of extracellular senile plaques, directly involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
