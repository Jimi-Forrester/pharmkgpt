23109885|a|The aggregation of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) into fibrils plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Metal ions including copper and zinc are closely connected to the precipitation and toxicity of Abeta. In this study, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor was constructed to investigate the interactions between Abeta and metal ions. Abeta peptide was immobilized on the SPR chip surface through a preformed alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM). Our observations indicate that the immobilized Abeta undergoes a conformational change upon exposure to the metal ions. A difference in metal binding affinity between Abeta(1-28) and Abeta(1-42) was also detected. The results suggest that SPR is an effective method to characterize the interactions between Abeta and metal ions.
