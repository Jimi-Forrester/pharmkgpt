29663387|t|Muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists: current scenario in Alzheimer's disease therapy.
29663387|a|OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become the primary cause of dementia. It shows a progressive cognitive dysfunction with degenerating neurons. Acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) propagate the cognitive ability and it consists of two primary members namely muscarinic (mAChRs) and nicotinic receptors (nAChRs). Where mAChRs is G-protein coupled receptor, (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels. The conventional therapeutic regimen for AD consists of three acetylcholinestearse inhibitors while a single NMDA receptor antagonist. Researchers around the globe are developing new and modifying the existing AChRs agonists to develop lead candidates with lower risk to benefit ratio where benefits clearly outweigh the adverse events. KEY FINDINGS: We have searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Google scholar, Science Direct and, Web of Science with keywords "Muscarinic/Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, agonists and, AD". The literature search included articles written in English. Scientific relevance for clinical studies, basic science studies is eligibility criteria for articles referred in this paper. M1 is the primary muscarinic subtype while alpha7 is the primary nAChR subtype that is responsible for cognition and memory and these two have been the major recent experimental targets for mAChR agonist strategy. SUMMARY: The last cholinergic receptor agonist to enter phase 3 trial was EVP-6124 (Enceniclin) but was withdrawn due to severe gastrointestinal adverse effects. We aim to present an overview of the efforts and achievements in targeting Muscarinic and Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the current review for development of better AD therapeutics.
