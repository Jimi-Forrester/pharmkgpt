38391946|a|The dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) alias mitogen-activated protein 3 kinase 12 (MAP3K12) has gained much attention in recent years. DLK belongs to the mixed lineage kinases, characterized by homology to serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase, but exerts serine/threonine kinase activity. DLK has been implicated in many diseases, including several neurodegenerative diseases, glaucoma, and diabetes mellitus. As a MAP3K, it is generally assumed that DLK becomes phosphorylated and activated by upstream signals and phosphorylates and activates itself, the downstream serine/threonine MAP2K, and, ultimately, MAPK. In addition, other mechanisms such as protein-protein interactions, proteasomal degradation, dephosphorylation by various phosphatases, palmitoylation, and subcellular localization have been shown to be involved in the regulation of DLK activity or its fine-tuning. In the present review, the diverse mechanisms regulating DLK activity will be summarized to provide better insights into DLK action and, possibly, new targets to modulate DLK function.
