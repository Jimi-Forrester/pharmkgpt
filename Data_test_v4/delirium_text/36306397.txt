Prolonged admission and serious complications associated with alcohol withdrawal are responsible for increased costs and use of medical and social resources. This study investigated the predictive value of quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) for developing alcohol-related DTs after alcohol-withdrawal seizure (AWS). METHODS: We compared differences in QEEG in patients after AWS (n = 13). QEEG was performed in the intensive care unit within 48 h of admission, including in age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We also investigated the prognostic value of QEEG for the development of alcohol DTs after AWS in a retrospective, case-control study. The spectral power of each band frequency and the ratio of the theta to alpha band (TAR) in the electroencephalogram were analyzed using iSyncBrain  (iMediSync, Inc., Korea). RESULTS: The beta frequency and the alpha frequency band power were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in patients than in age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In AWS patients with DTs, the relative beta-3 power was lower, particularly in the left frontal area, and the TAR was significantly higher in the central channel than in those without DTs. CONCLUSION: Quantitative EEG showed neuronal excitability and decreased cognitive activities characteristic of AWS associated with alcohol-withdrawal state, and we demonstrated that quantitative EEG might be a helpful tool for detecting patients at a high risk of developing DTs during an alcohol-dependence period.
