30515523|a|RATIONALE: Considerable clinical and experimental studies have shown that depression-related disorders are the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting as many as 20-40% of patients. An increasing amount of evidence shows that monoamine-based antidepressant treatments are not completely effective for depression treatment in patients with dementia. Minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline antibiotic, has been gaining research and clinical attention for the treatment of different neuropsychiatric disorders, and more recently depression symptom in humans. METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the effects of Abeta1-42 administration alone or in combination with minocycline treatment on depression-like behaviors and anti/pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin(IL)-10, IL-beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the hippocampus of rats. RESULTS: Our results showed that Abeta1-42 administration increased depression-related behaviors in sucrose preference test, tail suspension test, novelty-suppressed feeding test, and forced swim test. We also found significant increases in IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels in the hippocampus of Abeta1-42-treated rats. Interestingly, minocycline treatment significantly reversed depression-related behaviors and the levels of hippocampal cytokines in Abeta1-42-treated rats. CONCLUSION: These findings support the idea that there is a significant relationship among AD, depression-related symptoms, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain, and suggest that antidepressant-like impacts of minocycline could be due to its anti-inflammatory properties. This drug could be of potential interest for the treatment of depression in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
