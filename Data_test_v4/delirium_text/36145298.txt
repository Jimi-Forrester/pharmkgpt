36145298|t|Current Advancement of Immunomodulatory Drugs as Potential Pharmacotherapies for Autoimmunity Based Neurological Diseases.
36145298|a|Dramatic advancement has been made in recent decades to understand the basis of autoimmunity-mediated neurological diseases. These diseases create a strong influence on the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), leading to various clinical manifestations and numerous symptoms. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent autoimmune neurological disease while NMO spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is less common. Furthermore, evidence supports the presence of autoimmune mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive death of motor neurons. Additionally, autoimmunity is believed to be involved in the basis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In recent years, the prevalence of autoimmune-based neurological disorders has been elevated and current findings strongly suggest the role of pharmacotherapies in controlling the progression of autoimmune diseases. Therefore, this review focused on the current advancement of immunomodulatory drugs as novel approaches in the management of autoimmune neurological diseases and their future outlook.
