37047231|t|Exposure to Insecticides Modifies Gene Expression and DNA Methylation in Hematopoietic Tissues In Vitro.
37047231|a|The evidence supporting the biological plausibility of the association of permethrin and malathion with hematological cancer is limited and contradictory; thus, further studies are needed. This study aimed to investigate whether in vitro exposure to 0.1 muM permethrin and malathion at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h after cell culture initiation induced changes in the gene expression and DNA methylation in mononuclear cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood (BMMCs, PBMCs). Both pesticides induced several gene expression modifications in both tissues. Through gene ontology analysis, we found that permethrin deregulates ion channels in PBMCs and BMMCs and that malathion alters genes coding proteins with nucleic acid binding capacity, which was also observed in PBMCs exposed to permethrin. Additionally, we found that both insecticides deregulate genes coding proteins with chemotaxis functions, ion channels, and cytokines. Several genes deregulated in this study are potentially associated with cancer onset and development, and some of them have been reported to be deregulated in hematological cancer. We found that permethrin does not induce DNA hypermethylation but can induce hypomethylation, and that malathion generated both types of events. Our results suggest that these pesticides have the potential to modify gene expression through changes in promoter DNA methylation and potentially through other mechanisms that should be investigated.
