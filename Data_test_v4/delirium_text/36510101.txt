36510101|a|Esophagectomy is the selected treatment for nonmetastatic esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancer, although high perioperative morbidity and mortality incur. Robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) effectively reduces cardiopulmonary complications compared to open esophagectomy and offers a technical advantage, especially for lymph node dissection and intrathoracic anastomosis. This article aims at describing our initial experience of Ivor Lewis RAMIE, focusing on the technique's main steps and robotic-sewn esophagogastrostomy. Prospectively collected data from all consecutive patients who underwent Ivor Lewis RAMIE for cancer was reviewed. Reconstruction was performed with a gastric conduit pull-up and a robotic-sewn intrathoracic anastomosis. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded as prescribed by the Esophagectomy Complications Consensus Group (ECCG). Thirty patients underwent Ivor Lewis RAMIE with complete mediastinal lymph node dissection and robot-sewn anastomosis. No intraoperative complications nor conversion occurred. Pulmonary complications totaled 26.7%. Anastomotic leakage (ECCG, type III) and conduit necrosis (ECCG, type III) both occurred in one patient (3.3%). Chylothorax appeared in 2 patients (6.7%) (ECCG, Type IIA). Anastomotic stricture, successfully treated with endoscopic dilatations, occurred in 8 cases (26.7%). Median overall postoperative stay was 11 days (range, 6-51 days). 30 day and 90 day mortality was 0%. R0 resection was performed in 96.7% of patients with a median number of 47 retrieved lymph nodes. RAMIE with robot-sewn intrathoracic anastomosis appears to be feasible, safe and effective, with favorable perioperative results. Nevertheless, further high-quality studies are needed to define the best anastomotic technique for Ivor Lewis RAMIE.
