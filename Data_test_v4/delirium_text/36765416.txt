36765416|a|BACKGROUND: RNA methylation is a widely known post-transcriptional regulation which exists in many cancer and immune system diseases. However, the potential role and crosstalk of five types RNA methylation regulators in diabetic nephropathy (DN) and immune microenvironment remain unclear. METHODS: The mRNA expression of 37 RNA modification regulators and RNA modification regulators related genes were identified in 112 samples from 5 Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization clustering method was performed to determine RNA modification patterns. The ssGSEA algorithms and the expression of human leukocyte antigen were employed to assess the immune microenvironment characteristics. Risk model based on differentially expression genes responsible for the modification regulators was constructed to evaluate its predictive capability in DN patients. Furthermore, the results were validated by using immunofluorescence co-localizations and protein experiments in vitro. RESULTS: We found 24 RNA methylation regulators were significant differently expressed in glomeruli in DN group compared with control group. Four methylation-related genes and six RNA regulators were introduced into riskScore model using univariate Logistic regression and integrated LASSO regression, which could precisely distinguish the DN and healthy individuals. Group with high-risk score was associated with high immune infiltration. Three distinct RNA modification patterns were identified, which has significant differences in immune microenvironment, biological pathway and eGFR. Validation analyses showed the METTL3, ADAR1, DNMT1 were upregulated whereas YTHDC1 was downregulated in DN podocyte cell lines comparing with cells cultured by the normal glucose. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that RNA methylation regulators and immune infiltration regulation play critical roles in the pathogenesis of DN. The bioinformatic analyses combine with verification in vitro could provide robust evidence for identification of predictive RNA methylation regulators in DN.
