38089854|a|In tuberculous patient, abnormal extrarenal production of 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 by activated macrophages results in hypercalcemia. High calcium level associated with tuberculosis is frequent in adults with active pulmonary tuberculosis even though most patients are asymptomatic, while hypercalcemia in children due to disseminated tuberculosis is rare. Here, we described a case of a 5-year-old who presented with cough and right anterior chest swelling of two-month duration with an Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate of 144mm/hour, and a high serum ionized calcium level of 1.46millimol/L. With the epidemiologically prevalence, clinical and radiological imaging findings the diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis to lung, pleura, lymph node, liver and bone was made, and the child was started with the anti-tuberculosis treatment, hypercalcemia was attributed to the disseminated tuberculosis precipitated by high calcium meal intake and excessive sun exposure. Tuberculosis can be complicated with hypercalcemia; care must be taken in supplementing vitamin D and high calcium meals especially in high sun exposure geographic areas.
