33288272|a|BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to drastic changes in how psychiatric consultation-liaison (C-L) services conduct business and required rapid transition to telepsychiatry. We describe the practice changes implemented to rapid transition to virtual care in a large, academic psychiatry C-L service in response to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical service structural changes, timelines and impacts on consultation volume as well as present quantitative and qualitative data regarding the experience of this transition from the standpoints of both psychiatric trainees and attending physicians. METHODS: We present the narrative descriptions of transition details based on focused interviews with inpatient C-L leadership. Inpatient consult volume and charge data were gathered using analysis of health system data. Attending and trainee experience of the transition to virtual care were assessed using anonymous, online surveys. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the average weekly consultation volume and average weekly charges were significantly lower compared with prepandemic. Both volume and charges were affected by addition of video consultation capability. Both attendings and trainees had moderate or high comfort and moderate satisfaction with telephone and video consultations. Overall, the trainee satisfaction with supervision, learning, and their consult psychiatry experience did not seem to be affected by the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the feasibility of the rapid implementation of virtual care in a psychiatric academic C-L service without negatively impacting the learner's consult psychiatry experience. This should provide comfort to academic C-L services that required rapid implementation of virtual care.
