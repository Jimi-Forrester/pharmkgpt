36146495|a|(1) Background: We describe a case of a 58-year-old Chinese woman, without obvious cause of immunosuppression, who developed cytomegalovirus (CMV) proctitis three days after a second COVID-19 vaccination. Electronic colonoscopy revealed a new lesion that was circumferential at the anorectal junction, with an uneven surface and ulceration, which mimicked rectal carcinoma. This is the first case of CMV proctitis following vaccination since the invention of the COVID-19 vaccine, suggesting that the COVID-19 vaccine may cause disorders of immune homeostasis, including not only immune hyperactivity but also immune deficiency. We report this case to increase readers' awareness of the risks after COVID-19 vaccination and to provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of similar cases. (2) Methods: In this case, we used laboratory biochemical examinations, colonoscopy, immunohistochemistry, and a biochemical index to confirm the existence of CMV proctitis. (3) Results: In this case, the vaccine-induced CMV proctitis had a similar endoscopic appearance to rectal neoplastic lesions, which could be confirmed by biopsy and quickly relieved by ganciclovir treatment. Ganciclovir was used to treat the patient, and a good effect was observed. (4) Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination may cause immune disorders, not just immune hyperactivity as previously reported, but also immune deficiency, such as CMV proctitis in this case. The clinical course of CMV proctitis secondary to COVID-19 vaccination was favorable with ganciclovir therapy.
