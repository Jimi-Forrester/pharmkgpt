27053429|a|In 2014, International Psychogeriatrics (IPG) for the first time introduced a "paper of the month" category as part of the 25th year's milestone celebrations. Papers of the month were chosen through an internal selection process by the IPG editorial team. Each month, the seven editors ranked suitable accepted papers from the categories "original research articles" and "reviews" according to scientific quality and clinical relevance. Each paper of the month was accompanied by a brief commentary written by one of the IPG editors, one of the reviewers for the paper, or an international expert on the specific topic of the paper. From the 12 papers of the month, an IPG paper of the year was selected after a ranking process involving three independent expert reviewers.
