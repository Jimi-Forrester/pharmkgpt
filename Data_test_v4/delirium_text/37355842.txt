37355842|t|Neurocognitive Disorders in HIV-positive Patients.
37355842|a|Human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) encompasses a group of syndromes of various degrees of impairment in cognition and daily functioning of HIV positive individuals. Although the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has drastically reduced the prevalence of severe form of HAND, like HIV associated dementia (HAD), the prevalence of HAND and associated morbidity remains high. OBJECTIVES: (1) To know the prevalence of HAND in HIV-infected patients of a multi-ethnic population. (2) To describe various types of neurocognitive impairment among patients of HAND and study the factors affecting HAND. STUDY DESIGN: This study was a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted on 250 HIV-positive patients in outpatient department (OPD) of a tertiary care center in Mumbai, conducted over a period of 12 months. Patients with HIV-1 attending the OPD and having a minimal formal education of 4 years were included. Patients with concomitant delirium, any known central nervous system (CNS) disorder, any psychiatric disorder, and pregnant females were excluded. Outcome measures-the test batteries used were (1) International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS) and (2) Addenbrookes cognitive examination-revised (ACE-R) scale. RESULTS: Of 250 subjects studied, 55.6% (139) were males and 44.4 % (111) were females. The mean age of study population was 39.42 years. The mean years of education were 8.32 years. The mean duration of infection (diagnosis of HIV-positive state) was 64.49 months and the mean duration of HAART intake in our patients was 52.30 months. The mean cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) counts of our subjects were 527.13 per cumm [standard deviation (SD) of 234.13]. The mean nadir CD4 counts were 224.35 per cumm (SD of 115.09). Using the ACE-R scale, the prevalence of HAND was 71.60%, of which 37.20% had an asymptomatic neurological impairment, 29.60% had mild cognitive dysfunction, and 4.80% had HAD. Memory, verbal fluency and visuospatial abilities were the most affected domains on the ACE-R and memory recall and psychomotor speed were affected more on the IHDS. The prevalence of HAND was more with increasing age (p = 0.020), lesser education (p < 0.00) and lesser nadir CD4 counts (p < 0.00). However, it was not affected by the duration of the disease and the current CD4 counts (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) associated neurocognitive disorders HAND is common in HIV-positive patients, most of whom are asymptomatic. Older patients with less education and severe disease, having lower nadir counts are at the highest risk of HAND. Memory, verbal fluency, and visuospatial abilities were the most commonly affected domains.
