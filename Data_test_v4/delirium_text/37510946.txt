37510946|a|BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to analyze prevalence and severity of vascular risk factors in older patients referred to our clinic due to onset of Very Late-Onset Schizophrenia-Like Psychosis (VLOSLP) and to create a specific phenotype based on pathophysiological insight rather than age of onset. METHODS: In a longitudinal study, 103 (M = 39, F = 64; mean age of 80.32 +- 7.65 years) patients were evaluated with cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and functional assessment scales. Blood concentration of hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelets, total protein test (TPT), creatinine, azotemia, glycemia, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), uric acid (UA), sodium (Na), potassium (K), chlorine (Cl), calcium (Ca), folate, vitamin B12 (Vit-B12), and homocysteine were measured. Presence/absence of tobacco use, alcohol consumption, psychoactive substance use, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and history of vascular disease were collected. RESULTS: Females were more apathetic than males (NPI-Apathy: p = 0.040). Males had a significantly higher level of Hb (p = 0.019) and UA (p = 0.001), and a lower level of platelets (p = 0.004) and Ca (p = 0.003), and used more tobacco (p = 0.046) and alcohol (p = 0.024) than females. Comparing patients < 80 and >=80 years, we found differences in frequency of vascular risk factors among men (p = 0.027). In total, 102 patients were treated for psychosis (59.16% of them were using atypical antipsychotics). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study could be useful for a progressive demonstration of the causal relationship between cardiac and cerebral vascular events and VLOSLP.
