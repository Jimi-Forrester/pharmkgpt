21353141|t|A case of delirium, motor disturbances, and autonomic dysfunction due to baclofen and tizanidine withdrawal: a review of the literature.
21353141|a|We report a case of delirium accompanied by extrapyramidal symptoms and autonomic dysfunction in a 59-year-old man following abrupt cessation of baclofen and tizanidine. An extensive search for the etiology was undertaken, but it was only after a careful history was taken that suspicion for baclofen and tizanidine withdrawal was raised. The delirium and motor disturbances resolved within 24 h of reintroduction of baclofen. Withdrawal from muscle relaxants requires a high index of suspicion but should be considered in patients who manifest signs and symptoms of withdrawal from the medications, particularly visual hallucinations, rigidity and autonomic dysfunction.
