35978440|t|C5aR1 antagonism alters microglial polarization and mitigates disease progression in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
35978440|a|Multiple studies have recognized the involvement of the complement cascade during Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. However, the specific role of C5a-C5aR1 signaling in the progression of this neurodegenerative disease is still not clear. Furthermore, its potential as a therapeutic target to treat AD still remains to be elucidated. Canonically, generation of the anaphylatoxin C5a as the result of complement activation and interaction with its receptor C5aR1 triggers a potent inflammatory response. Previously, genetic ablation of C5aR1 in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease exerted a protective effect by preventing cognitive deficits. Here, using PMX205, a potent, specific C5aR1 antagonist, in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease we show a striking reduction in dystrophic neurites in parallel with the reduced amyloid load, rescue of the excessive pre-synaptic loss associated with AD cognitive impairment and the polarization of microglial gene expression towards a DAM-like phenotype that are consistent with the neuroprotective effects seen. These data support the beneficial effect of a pharmacological inhibition of C5aR1 as a promising therapeutic approach to treat Alzheimer's disease. Supportive of the safety of this treatment is the recent FDA-approval of another other C5a receptor 1 antagonist, Avacopan, as a treatment for autoimmune inflammatory diseases.
