33100992|t|Altered Topological Properties of Brain Structural Covariance Networks in Patients With Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy.
33100992|a|BACKGROUND: Brain structural alterations play an important role in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). However, while there have been studies on regional brain structural alterations, only few studies have focused on the topological organization of the brain structural covariance network. This work aimed to describe the structural covariance network architecture alterations that are possibly linked to cortex reorganization in patients with CSM. METHODS: High-resolution anatomical images of 31 CSM patients and 31 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the study. The images were acquired using a sagittal three-dimensional T1-weighted BRAVO sequence. Firstly, the gray matter volume of 90 brain regions of automated anatomical labeling atlas were computed using a VBM toolbox based on the DARTEL algorithm. Then, the brain structural covariance network was constructed by thresholding the gray matter volume correlation matrices. Subsequently, the network measures and nodal property were calculated based on graph theory. Finally, the differences in the network metrics and nodal property between groups were compared using a non-parametric test. RESULTS: Patients with CSM showed larger global efficiency and smaller local efficiency, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and sigma values than HCs. Patients with CSM had greater betweenness in the left superior parietal gyrus (SPG.L) and the left supplementary motor area (SMA.L) than HCs. Besides, patients with CSM had smaller betweenness in right middle occipital gyrus. The brain structural covariance networks of CSM patients exhibited equal resilience to random failure as those of HCs. However, the maximum relative size of giant connected components was approximately 10% larger in HCs than in CSM patients, upon removal of 44 nodes in targeted attack. CONCLUSION: These observed alternations in global network measures in CSM patients reflect that the brain structural covariance network in CSM exhibits the less optimal small-world model compared to that in HCs. Increased betweenness in SPG.L and SMA.L seems to be related to cortex reorganization to recover multiple sensory functions after spinal cord injury in CSM patients. The network resilience of patients with CSM exhibiting a relative mild vulnerability, compared to HCs, is probably attributable to the balance and interplay between cortex reorganization and ongoing degeneration.
