2072505|t|[A case of delirium which occurred during otorhinolaryngological treatment under local anesthesia--the importance of close communication between practitioners and local general hospitals].
2072505|a|We experienced a case of delirium which occurred during treatment of chronic sinusitis under local anesthesia in a ENT practitioner, which took an unique course. We were able to treat the patient immediately after occurrence of the complication because we have emergency hot-line between anesthesiologists in our hospital and the practitioners in our area. Fortunately the patient recovered without severe sequelae due to immediate therapy. We consider that in emergency cases, a close communication between practitioners and local general hospitals is important for exact diagnosis and suitable treatments as well as for life-saving procedures.
