37620412|t|Intraoperative neurological pupil index and postoperative delirium and neurologic adverse events after cardiac surgery: an observational study.
37620412|a|Neurological pupil index (NPi) calculated by automated pupillometry predicts clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. However, there are few data on intraoperative NPi and postoperative outcome after cardiac surgery. We evaluated the relationships between intraoperative NPi and clinical outcomes, such as delirium, in cardiac surgery patients. NPi was measured at baseline, after anesthesia induction, at 30 min intervals after initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass or anastomosis of coronary artery bypass graft, and at skin closure. Abnormal NPi was defined as one or more measurements of NPi < 3.0 during surgery. The worst intraoperative NPi was recorded, then multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between abnormal NPi and postoperative delirium following cardiac surgery. Among 123 included patients, postoperative delirium developed in 19.5% (24/123) of patients. Intraoperative abnormal NPi was significantly associated with postoperative delirium (odds ratio 6.078; 95% confidence interval 1.845-20.025; P = 0.003) after adjustment for Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality score, coronary artery disease, and use of calcium channel blockers. In conclusion, abnormal intraoperative NPi independently predicted postoperative delirium following cardiac surgery. Intraoperative application of pupillometry may have prognostic value for development of postoperative delirium, thereby enabling close surveillance and early intervention in high-risk patients.Registry number: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04136210).
