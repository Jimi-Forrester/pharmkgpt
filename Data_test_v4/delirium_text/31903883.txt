31903883|t|Neuroprotective Polyphenols: A Modulatory Action on Neurotransmitter Pathways.
31903883|a|BACKGROUND: Balance in neurotransmission is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system and even a small, but prolonged disturbance, can induce the negative feedback mechanisms leading to various neuropathologies. Neurodegenerative and mood disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or affective disorders are increasing medical and social problems. Among the wide spectrum of potentially destructive events, oxidative stress and disrupted metabolism of some neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, serotonin or dopamine appear to play a decisive role. Biologically active plant polyphenols have been shown to exert a positive impact on the function of the central nervous system by modulation of metabolism and the action of some neurotransmitters. METHODS: Based on published research, the pharmacological activities of some naturally occurring polyphenols have been reviewed, with a focus on their potential therapeutic importance in the regulation of neurotransmitter systems. RESULTS: Phytochemicals can be classified into several groups and most of them possess anticancer, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. They can also modulate the metabolism or action of some neurotransmitters and/or their receptors. Based on these properties, phytochemicals have been used in traditional medicine for ages, although it was focused mainly on treating symptoms. However, growing evidence indicates that polyphenols may also prevent or slow neurological diseases. CONCLUSION: Phytochemicals seem to be less toxic than synthetic drugs and they can be a safer alternative for currently used preparations, which exert adverse side effects. The neuroprotective actions of some plant polyphenols in the regulation of neurotransmitters metabolism, functioning of neurotransmitters receptors and antioxidative defense have potential therapeutic applications in various neurodegenerative disorders.
