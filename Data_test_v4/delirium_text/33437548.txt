33437548|a|The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has ravaged the world with its novel symptoms, infection rates, and death toll. The research community continues to learn more about the sequalae of the infection as it does not follow the pattern of a typical coronavirus. This is a case of persisting auditory and visual hallucinations in a 46-year-old woman after a COVID-19 induced delirium. The hallucinations remained, despite recovery from the virus, for almost three months with resolution of all other signs and symptoms. The hallucinations eventually disappeared and their persistence was believed to be continued symptomatology after treatment.
