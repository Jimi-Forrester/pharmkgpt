25884153|a|BACKGROUND: Suicide attempts (SA) after psychiatric hospitalization continue to be a major cause of morbidity. Implicit measures may enhance our ability to assess suicide risk. In this context, we describe the first use of the Suicide Opinion Questionnaire (SOQ) to identify post-discharge suicide attempters. METHODS: Adult psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicidality (N = 91) were administered a battery of measures including the SOQ, and forty were reached and reassessed for SA at two months post-discharge. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on items associated with suicidality was performed to identify latent constructs. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to optimize factor combination for suicide identification. Results were compared with explicit measures of suicidality, and logistic regression was used to control for other risk factors. Finally, a simplified 9-item scale was derived from the results and its performance compared to that of the linear discriminant function. RESULTS: Twenty items differed between patients with and without SA at intake or follow-up. EFA on these identified two factors: suicide attempters indicated greater acceptability and less moral condemnation of suicide. The LDA-derived discriminant function and 9-item scale was significantly sensitive and specific for post-discharge SA. CONCLUSIONS: Attitudes of acceptability and lack of condemnation toward suicide may constitute an implicit measure of suicidality that could contribute to risk assessment in a high-risk population.
