33503372|t|Fluorescent Determination of Butyrylcholinesterase Activity and Its Application in Biological Imaging and Pesticide Residue Detection.
33503372|a|Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is an essential human cholinesterase relevant to liver conditions and neurodegenerative diseases, which makes it a pivotal biomarker of health. It therefore remains challenging and highly desired to elaborate efficient chemical tools for BChE with simple operations and satisfactory working performance. In this work, a background-free detection strategy was built by virtue of the judicious coupling of a specific BChE-enzymatic reaction and in situ cyclization. High sensitivity with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.075 mug/mL could be readily achieved from the blank background and the as-produced emissive indicators, and the specific reaction site contributed to the high selectivity over other bio-species even acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In addition to the multifaceted spectral experiments to verify the sensing mechanism, this work assumed comprehensive studies on the application. The bio-investigation ranged from cells to an organism, declaring a noteworthy prospect in disease diagnosis, especially for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common neurodegenerative disease with over-expressed BChE. Moreover, its excellent work for inhibition efficacy elucidation was also proved with the accuracy IC50 of tacrine for BChE (8.6 nM), giving rise to an expanded application for trace pesticide determination.
