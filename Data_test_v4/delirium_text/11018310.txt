11018310|a|Increasing evidence suggests a relation between vascular disorders and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). We performed an association analysis of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) genes, known to be involved in vascular disorders, and AD. Genotyping was carried out in 113 patients with clinically defined Alzheimer's disease (NINCDS-ADRDA criteria) and 203 non-demented controls in a prospective, population-based study of people aged 85 years or over (Vantaa 85+ Study). Corresponding analysis was performed on 121 neuropathologically verified AD patients (CERAD criteria) and 75 controls derived from the same study population. We did not find significant associations between the polymorphisms studied and AD. However, analysis of the LPL polymorphism showed a weak trend (uncorrected P-value 0.095) towards protection against neuropathologically defined AD. Our study is based on very elderly Finns. Therefore, further studies are warranted in other populations.
