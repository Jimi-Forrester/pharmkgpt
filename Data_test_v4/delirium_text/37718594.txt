37718594|t|Distinct serum GDNF coupling with brain structural and functional changes underlies cognitive status in Parkinson's disease.
37718594|a|AIM: Aberrations in brain connections are implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). We previously demonstrated that Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) reduction is associated with cognition decline. Nonetheless, it is elusive if the pattern of brain topological connectivity differed across PD with divergent serum GDNF levels, and the accompanying profile of cognitive deficits has yet to be determined. METHODS: We collected data on the participants' cognition, demographics, and serum GDNF levels. Participants underwent 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging, and we assessed the degree centrality, brain network topology, and cortical thickness of the healthy control (HC) (n = 25), PD-high-GDNF (n = 19), and PD-low-GDNF (n = 19) groups using graph-theoretic measures of resting-state functional MRI to reveal how much brain connectivity varies and its clinical correlates, as well as to determine factors predicting the cognitive status in PD. RESULTS: The results show different network properties between groups. Degree centrality abnormalities were found in the right inferior frontal gyrus and right parietal lobe postcentral gyrus, linked with cognition scores. The two aberrant clusters serve as a potentially powerful signal for determining whether a patient has PD and the patient's cognition level after integrating with GDNF, duration, and dopamine dosage. Moreover, we found a significant positive relationship between the thickness of the left caudal middle frontal lobe and a plethora of cognitive domains. Further discriminant analysis revealed that the cortical thickness of this region could distinguish PD patients from healthy controls. The mental state evaluation will also be more precise when paired with GDNF and duration. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that the topological features of brain networks and cortical thickness are altered in PD patients with cognitive deficits. The above change, accompanied by the serum GDNF, may have merit as a diagnosis marker for PD and, arguably, cognition status.
