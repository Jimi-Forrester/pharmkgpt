23104105|a|This paper describes the application of chronopotentiometry to lipid bilayer research. The experiments were performed on bilayer lipid membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol and formed using the painting technique. Chronopotentiometric (U = f(t)) measurements were used to determine the membrane capacitance, resistance, and breakdown voltage as well as pore conductance and diameter.
