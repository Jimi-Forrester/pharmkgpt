29067316|a|INTRODUCTION: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 90-week study assessed safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of CAD106 with/without adjuvant in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: One hundred twenty-one patients received up to seven intramuscular injections of CAD106 (150 mug or 450 mug) or placebo +- adjuvant over 60 weeks. An amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) substudy was also conducted. RESULTS: CAD106 induced strong serological responses (amyloid-beta [Abeta]-Immunoglobuline G[IgG]) in 55.1% (150 mug) and 81.1% (450 mug) of patients (strong serological responders [SSRs]). Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 24.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 16.7-33.8) of the patients in the active treatment group and in 6.7% (95% CI 0.2-31.9) in the placebo group. Three of the SAEs were classified as possibly related to study drug by the investigators. No evidence of central nervous system inflammation was found. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs) occurred in six cases, all of them were strong serological responders. None of the ARIAs were symptomatic. Serum Abeta-IgG titer area under the curves correlated negatively with amyloid PET standardized uptake value ratio percentage change from baseline to week 78 within the CAD106-treated patients (r = -0.84, P = .0004). Decrease in cortical gray-matter volume from baseline to week 78 was larger in SSRs than in controls (P = .0077). DISCUSSION: Repeated CAD106 administration was generally well tolerated. CAD106 450 mug with alum adjuvant demonstrated the best balance between antibody response and tolerability.
