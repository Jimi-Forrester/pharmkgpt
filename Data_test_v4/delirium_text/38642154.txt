38642154|a|PURPOSE: Standard intensive care unit (ICU) admission policies and treatment strategies for patients with cancer are still lacking. To depict the current status of admission, characteristics, and outcomes of patients with cancer in the ICU. METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional study was performed from May 10, 2021 to July 10, 2021, in the ICU departments of 37 cancer-specialized hospitals in China. Clinical records of all admitted patients aged >= 14 years and ICU duration > 24 h with complete data were included. Demographic information, clinical history, severity score at admission, ICU critical condition diagnosis and treatment, ICU and in-hospital outcomes and 90 days survival were also collected. A total of 1455 patients were admitted and stayed for longer than 24 h. The most common primary cancer diagnoses included lung, colorectal, esophageal, and gastric cancer. RESULTS: Patients with lung cancer were admitted more often because of worsening complications that occurred in the clinical ward. However, other cancer patients may be more likely to be admitted to the ICU because of postoperative care. ICU-admitted patients with lung or esophageal cancer tended to have more ICU complications. Patients with lung cancer had a poor overall survival prognosis, whereas patients with colorectal cancer appeared to benefit the most according to 90 days mortality rates. CONCLUSION: Patients with lung cancer require more ICU care due to critical complications and the overall survival prognosis is poor. Colorectal cancer may benefit more from ICU management. This information may be considered in ICU admission and treatment strategies.
