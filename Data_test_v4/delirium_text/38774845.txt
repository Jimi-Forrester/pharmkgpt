38774845|t|Postoperative Delirium and Dementia in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery: A Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.
38774845|a|Delirium and dementia are considered to be the most significant postoperative neurocognitive complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, particularly those aged 60 years and older, which reduces the post-surgery quality of life, prolongs hospitalization, increases costs, and elevated the rates of mortality. Nevertheless, the etiology, risk factors, and predictive biomarkers, have not been well elucidated particularly, in patients with unmanifested underline cognitive impairments. The present study aimed to review the findings on the etiology, factors increasing the risk of incidence, and predictive biomarkers of postoperative delirium and dementia after cardiac surgery, and to describe the suggested pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.
