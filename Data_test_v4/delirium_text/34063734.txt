34063734|t|Caffeine Inhibits Direct and Indirect Angiogenesis in Zebrafish Embryos.
34063734|a|In this study, we report the effects of caffeine on angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos both during normal development and after exposure to Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2). As markers of angiogenesis, we measured the length and width of intersegmental vessels (ISVs), performed whole-mount in situ hybridization with fli1 and cadh5 vascular markers, and counted the number of interconnecting vessels (ICVs) in sub-intestinal venous plexus (SIVP). In addition, we measured angiogenesis after performing zebrafish yolk membrane (ZFYM) assay with microinjection of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and perivitelline tumor xenograft assay with microinjection of tumorigenic FGF2-overexpressing endothelial (FGF2-T-MAE) cells. The results showed that caffeine treatment causes a shortening and thinning of ISVs along with a decreased expression of the vascular marker genes and a decrease in the number of ICVs in the SIVP. Caffeine was also able to block angiogenesis induced by exogenous FGF2 or FGF2-producing cells. Overall, our results are suggestive of the inhibitory effect of caffeine in both direct and indirect angiogenesis.
