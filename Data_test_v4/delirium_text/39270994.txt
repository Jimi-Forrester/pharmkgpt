39270994|a|Excessive iron accumulation in the brain plays a significant role in neurodegenerative processes, contributing to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD, a prominent neurological disorder affecting the central nervous system, is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau phosphorylation. This accumulation leads to the subsequent development of cognitive impairments, particularly in learning and memory functions. This study investigates the neuroprotective effects of emoxypine succinate in a zebrafish model of iron overload-induced neurodegeneration. Iron was administered to the zebrafish for 28 days to induce neurodegeneration. Following induction, Emoxypine succinate was employed as a treatment intervention for 14 days (concentrations of 4 mg/L, 8 mg/L, and 12 mg/L). Following the end of the treatment, behavioral tests (Y maze test, Novel tank test) were conducted on the zebrafish, and the biochemical (MDA, Catalase, SOD, GSH) and molecular parameters (AchE, Iron levels, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, CDK-5, GSK-3beta and NLRP3) of the zebrafish brain were also assessed. In the novel tank test, emoxypine succinate-treated groups exhibited significantly increased time in the upper zone (p < 0.001), higher distance travelled (p < 0.001), and shorter latency to the top (p < 0.001) compared to the negative control. Similarly, the Y-maze test revealed improved time in the novel arm (p < 0.001) and total distance travelled (p < 0.001) in treated groups versus the negative control. Assessment of oxidative stress parameters demonstrated significant reductions in oxidative stress in emoxypine succinate-treated groups. Furthermore, AChE activity decreased significantly (p < 0.001), and brain iron levels decreased substantially (p < 0.001) in treated groups, indicating positive therapeutic outcomes. Molecular analysis showed a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory markers like IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, CDK-5, GSK-3beta and NLRP3 (p < 0.001). This comprehensive study highlights the potential efficacy of emoxypine succinate in mitigating neurodegeneration associated with iron dysregulation.
