31834883|a|INTRODUCTION: Under the hypothesis that early natural killer cell infusion (NKI) following haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) will reduce relapse in the early post-transplant period, we conducted a pilot study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of NKI following haplo-SCT in children with recurrent neuroblastoma who failed previous tandem high-dose chemotherapy and autologous SCT. METHODS: We used the high-dose 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine and cyclophosphamide/fludarabine/anti-thymocyte globulin regimen for conditioning and infused 3 x 107/kg of ex-vivo expanded NK cells derived from a haploidentical parent donor on days 2, 9, and 16 post-transplant. Interleukin-2 was administered (1 x 106 IU/m2/day) subcutaneously to activate infused donor NK cells on days 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, and 20 post-transplant. RESULTS: Seven children received a total of 19 NKIs, and NKI-related acute toxicities were fever (n = 4) followed by chills (n = 3) and hypertension (n = 3); all toxicities were tolerable. Grade >=II acute GVHD and chronic GVHD developed in two and five patients, respectively. Higher amount of NK cell population was detected in peripheral blood until 60 days post-transplant than that in the reference cohort. Cytomegalovirus and BK virus reactivation occurred in all patients and Epstein-Barr virus in six patients. Six patients died of relapse/progression (n = 5) or treatment-related mortality (n = 1), and one patient remained alive. CONCLUSION: NKI following haplo-SCT was relatively safe and feasible in patients with recurrent neuroblastoma. Further studies to enhance the graft-versus-tumor effect without increasing GVHD are needed.
