8761018|t|Advanced glycation endproducts-associated parameters in the peripheral blood of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
8761018|a|Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), structural components of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangels, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. AGE levels, measured by fluorescence, and their precursor molecules such as glucose and its Amadori product, fructosylamine, were measured to examine the question whether the reported increased level of AGEs in the brain is reflected in an increase in AGE-associated parameters in peripheral blood. Lactoferrin, proposed to play an important role in the interaction of AGEs with their receptors, was determined by ELISA. All AGE-associated parameters showed trends to lower values in patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with non-demented controls. Albumin and total iron were not significantly different between the groups. In contrast to diabetes and renal failure, where high levels of AGEs and their precursors are present in tissue as well as in peripheral blood, elevated CNS AGE levels in patients with Alzheimer's disease are manifested without detectable peripheral changes.
