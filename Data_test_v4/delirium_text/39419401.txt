39419401|t|Harnessing Brainwave Entrainment: A Non-invasive Strategy To Alleviate Neurological Disorder Symptoms.
39419401|a|From 1990-2019, the burden of neurological disorders varied considerably across countries and regions. Psychiatric disorders, often emerging in early to mid-adulthood, are linked to late-life neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Individuals with conditions such as Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Schizophrenia, and Bipolar Disorder face up to four times higher risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders. Contrarily, 65 % of those with neurodegenerative conditions experience severe psychiatric symptoms during their illness. Further, the limitation of medical resources continues to make this burden a significant global and local challenge. Therefore, brainwave entrainment provides therapeutic avenues for improving the symptoms of diseases. Brainwaves are rhythmic oscillations produced either spontaneously or in response to stimuli. Key brainwave patterns include gamma, beta, alpha, theta, and delta waves, yet the underlying physiological mechanisms and the brain's ability to shift between these dynamic states remain areas for further exploration. In neurological disorders, brainwaves are often disrupted, a phenomenon termed "oscillopathy". However, distinguishing these impaired oscillations from the natural variability in brainwave activity across different regions and functional states poses significant challenges. Brainwave-mediated therapeutics represents a promising research field aimed at correcting dysfunctional oscillations. Herein, we discuss a range of non-invasive techniques such as non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), neurologic music therapy (NMT), gamma stimulation, and somatosensory interventions using light, sound, and visual stimuli. These approaches, with their minimal side effects and cost-effectiveness, offer potential therapeutic benefits. When integrated, they may not only help in delaying disease progression but also contribute to the development of innovative medical devices for neurological care.
