33078538|t|Compliance and health consequences of menopausal hormonal therapy after surgical menopause: A retrospective study in Thailand.
33078538|a|AIM: To study compliance with menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT) until age >= 50 year and health consequences after surgical menopause. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 1000 consecutive surgically menopausal patients who underwent premenopausal surgery before 50 years of age from benign indications during 1996-2012 was performed. Main outcomes were number in year of MHT compliance and health consequences: hypertension (HT), diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia (DLP), ischemic heart disease (IHD)/myocardial infarction (MI), venous thromboembolism (VTE), stoke, osteopenia/osteoporosis, cognitive impairment/dementia/Alzheimer's disease (AD) /Parkinsonism and breast/other cancers. The MHT nonuser subgroup served as the control. RESULTS: Of the 1000 patients, 855 cases used MHT. The median overall follow-up time from surgery for 145 MHT nonuser patients, 435 MHT users until age <50 year and 420 MHT users until age >=50 year was 12.0 years. Compliance until age >=50 year was only 49.1%. For MHT users, the overall median age of stopping MHT was 47.0 year with a median MHT use of 6.0 year. After age adjustment at the time of follow-up of all subgroups by forward stepwise logistic regression analysis, the only significantly different health consequence was osteopenia (32.4%, 10.6% and 21.4% in the MHT nonusers, users until age <50 year and users until age >=50 year, respectively [P < 0.001]). Prevalence of breast cancer, colon cancer and other cancers were not different among subgroups. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients used MHT with low compliance until age >=50 year. In addition, MHT initiation after surgery possibly prevented osteopenia compared with MHT nonusers.
