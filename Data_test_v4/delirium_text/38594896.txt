38594896|t|Comparison of Remimazolam and Propofol on Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients Undergoing Radical Resection of Colon Cancer: A Single-Center Prospective Randomized Controlled Study.
38594896|a|BACKGROUND We compared the effect of remimazolam and propofol intravenous anesthesia on postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical resection of colon cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred patients undergoing elective radical operation of colon cancer under general anesthesia were divided into a remimazolam group (group R) and propofol group (group P) by a random number table method. During anesthesia induction and maintenance, group R was intravenously injected with remimazolam to exert sedation; however, in group P, propofol was injected instead of remimazolam. The occurrence of postoperative delirium was assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit scale and postoperative pain was assessed with the visual analogue score (VAS). The primary outcome measures were the incidence and duration of delirium within 7 days following surgery. Secondary outcome measures included postoperative VAS scores, intraoperative anesthetic drug dosage, and adverse reactions, including nausea and vomiting, hypoxemia, and respiratory depression. RESULTS There was no significant difference in baseline data between the 2 groups (P>0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence and duration of postoperative delirium between the 2 groups (P>0.05). There were no significant differences in VAS scores, remifentanil consumption, and adverse reactions, including nausea and vomiting, hypoxemia, and respiratory depression between the 2 groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS In elderly patients undergoing radical colon cancer surgery, remimazolam administration did not improve or aggravate the incidence and duration of delirium, compared with propofol.
