36788216|a|Morphological alterations of the endosomal compartment have been widely described in post-mortem brains from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and subjects with Down syndrome (DS) who are at high risk for AD. Immunostaining with antibodies against endosomal markers such as Early Endosome Antigen 1 (EEA1) revealed increased size of EEA1-positive puncta. In DS, peripheral cells such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and fibroblasts, share similar phenotype even in the absence of AD. We previously found that PBMCs from AD patients have larger EEA1-positive puncta, correlating with brain amyloid load. Here we analysed the endosomal compartment of fibroblasts from a very well characterised cohort of AD patients (IMABio3) who underwent thorough clinical, imaging and biomarkers assessments. Twenty-one subjects were included (7 AD with mild cognitive impairment (AD-MCI), 7 AD with dementia (AD-D) and 7 controls) who had amyloid-PET at baseline (PiB) and neuropsychological tests at baseline and close to skin biopsy. Fibroblasts isolated from skin biopsies were immunostained with anti-EEA1 antibody and imaged using a spinning disk microscope. Endosomal compartment ultrastructure was also analysed by electron microscopy. All fibroblast lines were genotyped and their AD risk factors identified. Our results show a trend to an increased EEA1-positive puncta volume in fibroblasts from AD-D as compared to controls (p.adj = 0.12) and reveal enhanced endosome area in fibroblasts from AD-MCI and AD-AD versus controls. Larger puncta size correlated with PiB retention in different brain areas and with worse cognitive scores at the time of biopsy as well as faster decline from baseline to the time of biopsy. Finally, we identified three genetic risk factors for AD (ABCA1, COX7C and MYO15A) that were associated with larger EEA1 puncta volume. In conclusion, the endosomal compartment in fibroblasts could be used as cellular peripheral biomarker for both amyloid deposition and cognitive decline in AD patients.
