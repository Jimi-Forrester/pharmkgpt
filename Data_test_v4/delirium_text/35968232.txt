Centers for Disease Control Foundation. Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, https://www.cdcfoundation.org/what-public-health; What is the WHO definition of health? from the Preamble to the Constitution of WHO as adopted by the International Health Conference, New York, On 7 April 1948. The definition has not been amended since. 22 July 1946; signed by the representatives of 61 States (Official Records of WHO, no. 2, p. 100) and entered into force, 19 June;1948. https://web.archive.org/web/20190307113324/https:/www.who.int/about/who-we-are/frequently-asked-questions). Translational research in healthcare is not only useful and satisfying for the researchers to bring their work to market but it would also support public health by bringing affordable, attainable and scalable solutions to the community at large. This is of high significance because instead of increasing the GDP spent in public health, we should focus on the increasing the translational research spending, as this would lead to improved solutions. Hence, the public health offering would reach a larger community at an improved cost. The COVID-19 pandemic and the huge number of lives it claimed exposes challenges in the public health. The pandemic has caused economic and social disruption to millions of people around the world, with many falling into extreme poverty. In early 2021, it was estimated nearly 690 million people are undernourished and by end of 2021 to increase further by 132 million (Joint statement by ILO, FAO, IFAD and WHO. Impact of COVID-19 on people's livelihoods, their health and our food systems https://www.who.int/news/item/13-10-2020-impact-of-covid-19-on-people's-livelihoods-their-health-and-our-food-systems). The spending for public health has increased many folds during the pandemic and this is where translational research in healthcare can play a transformative role to reduce the burden on government healthcare budget (Covid-19 and its impact on Indian society. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/covid-19-and-its-impact-on-india/covid-19-and-its-impact-on-indian-society-27565/). Over the past decade, public health research has started playing a major role in Indian academic settings. COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the role of public health. However, the potential of using technological advancement has not been fully utilised. This is where translational research and public health can play a role to tap the full potential of technology. This review paper explores the public health practices to understand the different practices to examine how both public health and translational research can cross-fertilise. It concludes with a short discussion on implications on policymakers.
