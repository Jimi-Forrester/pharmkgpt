24011544|a|We have generated a physiologically relevant bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based genomic DNA expression model to study PS1 gene expression and function. The PS1-WT-BAC construct restored gamma-secretase function, whereas the mutant PS1 BACs demonstrated partial to complete loss of enzymatic activity when stably expressed in a PS double knock-out clonal cell line. We then engineered WT and mutant human PS1-BAC-Luciferase whole genomic locus reporter transgenes, which we transiently transduced in mouse and human non-neuronal and neuronal-like cells, respectively. PS1 DeltaE9 and C410Y FAD were found to lower PS1 gene expression in both cell lines, whereas PS1-M146V showed a neuron-specific effect. The nonclinical gamma-secretase inactive PS1-D257A mutation did not alter gene expression in either cell line. This is the first time that pathogenic coding mutations in the PS1 gene have been shown to lower PS1 gene expression. These findings may represent a pathologic mechanism for PS1 FAD mutations independent of their effects on gamma-secretase activity and demonstrate how dominant PS1 mutations may exert their pathogenic effects by a loss-of-function mechanism.
