21726591|a|One of the main hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is senile plaques composed of amyloid beta (Abeta). We developed a new edible vaccine: rice expressing GFP-Abeta42. In a previous report, we described the production of anti-Abeta antibodies in B6 mice fed Abeta rice mixed with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB). In this report, we investigated whether Abeta rice had therapeutic effects in the Tg2576 AD model mice. The anti-Abeta antibody titer was increased and levels of intracerebral Abeta (soluble and insoluble) and serum Abeta decreased. Because the value of IgG1/IgG2a in the Abeta feeding group was >1, immunization via Abeta rice may induce a non-inflammatory Th2 reaction. We also found that the Abeta vaccine improved memory, as assessed in a Y-maze test. The number of arm entries in the Y-maze test was lower in the Abeta feeding group than in the control group. These results suggest that the new edible vaccine Abeta rice may have therapeutic effects in AD.
