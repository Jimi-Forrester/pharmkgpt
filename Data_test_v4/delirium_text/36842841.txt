36842841|a|BACKGROUND: The effect of postoperative delirium on the amyloid cascade of Alzheimer's dementia is poorly understood. Using early postoperative plasma biomarkers, we explored whether surgery and delirium are associated with changes in amyloid pathways. METHODS: We analysed data from 100 participants in the Interventions for Postoperative Delirium: Biomarker-3 (IPOD-B3) cohort study in the USA (NCT03124303 and NCT01980511), which recruited participants aged >65 yr undergoing non-intracranial surgery. We assessed the relationship between the change in plasma amyloid beta ratio (AbetaR; Abeta42:Abeta40) and delirium incidence (defined by the 3-Minute Diagnostic Confusion Assessment Method) and severity (quantified by the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98, the study's primary outcome). We also tested the relationship between plasma amyloid beta and intraoperative variables. RESULTS: Across all participants, the plasma AbetaR increased from the preoperative period to postoperative Day 1 (Wilcoxon P<0.001). However, this increase was not associated with delirium incidence (Wilcoxon P=0.22) or peak severity after adjusting for confounders (log[incidence rate ratio]=0.43; P=0.14). Postoperative Day 1 change in plasma AbetaR was not associated with postoperative Day 1 change in plasma tau, neurofilament light, or inflammatory markers (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-1Ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12), or with operative time or low intraoperative arterial pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative changes in plasma amyloid do not appear to be associated with postoperative delirium. Our findings do not support associations of dynamic changes in amyloid with postoperative delirium. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: .NCT03124303 and NCT01980511.
