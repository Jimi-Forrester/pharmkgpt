33687588|t|Mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases: towards the development of effective therapy.
33687588|a|Neurodegeneration is a prevalent and one of the emerging reasons for morbidity, mortality, and cognitive impairment in aging. Dementia is one of such conditions of neurodegeneration, partially manageable, irreversible, and worsens over time. This review is focused on biological and psychosocial risk factors associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, highlighting the value of cognitive decline. We further emphasized on current therapeutic strategies from pharmacological and non-pharmacological perspectives focusing on their effects on cognitive impairment, protein aggregation, tau pathology, and improving the quality of life. Deeper mechanistic insights into the multifactorial neurodegeneration could offer the design and development of promising diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
