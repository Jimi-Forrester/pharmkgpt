Both traditional autologous nerve transplantation and emerging therapeutic approaches encounter scientific challenges due to the complex nature of the nervous system and the unsuitability of the surrounding environment for cell transplantation. Tissue engineering techniques offer a promising path for neurotherapy. Successful neural tissue engineering relies on modulating cell differentiation behavior and tissue repair by developing biomaterials that mimic the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) and establish a three-dimensional microenvironment. Peptide-based hydrogels have emerged as a potent option among these biomaterials due to their ability to replicate the structure and complexity of the ECM. This review aims to explore the diverse range of peptide-based hydrogels used in nerve regeneration with a specific focus on dipeptide hydrogels, tripeptide hydrogels, oligopeptide hydrogels, multidomain peptides (MDPs), and amphiphilic peptide hydrogels (PAs). Peptide-based hydrogels offer numerous advantages, including biocompatibility, structural diversity, adjustable mechanical properties, and degradation without adverse effects. Notably, hydrogels formed from self-assembled polypeptide nanofibers, derived from amino acids, show promising potential in engineering neural tissues, outperforming conventional materials like alginate, poly(epsilon-caprolactone), and polyaniline. Additionally, the simple design and cost-effectiveness of dipeptide-based hydrogels have enabled the creation of various functional supramolecular structures, with significant implications for nervous system regeneration. These hydrogels are expected to play a crucial role in future neural tissue engineering research. This review aims to highlight the benefits and potential applications of peptide-based hydrogels, contributing to the advancement of neural tissue engineering.
