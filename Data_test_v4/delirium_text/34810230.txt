34810230|t|Presenilin/gamma-Secretase Activity Is Located in Acidic Compartments of Live Neurons.
34810230|a|Presenilin (PSEN)/gamma-secretase is a protease complex responsible for the proteolytic processing of numerous substrates. These substrates include the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the cleavage of which by gamma-secretase results in the production of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides. However, exactly where within the neuron gamma-secretase processes APP C99 to generate Abeta and APP intracellular domain (AICD) is still not fully understood. Here, we employ novel Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based multiplexed imaging assays to directly "visualize" the subcellular compartment(s) in which gamma-secretase primarily cleaves C99 in mouse cortex primary neurons (from both male and female embryos). Our results demonstrate that gamma-secretase processes C99 mainly in LysoTracker-positive low-pH compartments. Using a new immunostaining protocol which distinguishes Abeta from C99, we also show that intracellular Abeta is significantly accumulated in the same subcellular loci. Furthermore, we found functional correlation between the endo-lysosomal pH and cellular gamma-secretase activity. Taken together, our findings are consistent with Abeta being produced from C99 by gamma-secretase within acidic compartments such as lysosomes and late endosomes in living neurons.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetics and histopathology highlight the importance of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by gamma-secretase in pathogenesis. For the first time, this study has enabled us to directly "visualize" that gamma-secretase processes C99 mainly in acidic compartments such as late endosomes and lysosomes in live neurons. Furthermore, we uncovered that intracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) is significantly accumulated in the same subcellular loci. Emerging evidence proposes the great importance of the endo-lysosomal pathway in mechanisms of misfolded proteins propagation (e.g., Tau, alpha-Syn). Therefore, the predominant processing of C99 and enrichment of Abeta in late endosomes and lysosomes may be critical events in the molecular cascade leading to AD.
