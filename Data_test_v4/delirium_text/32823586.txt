32823586|t|Assessment of Mineral and Phenolic Profiles and Their Association with the Antioxidant, Cytotoxic Effect, and Antimicrobial Potential of Lycium chinense Miller.
32823586|a|This study aimed at investigating the Lycium chinense Miller leaf extract mineral and phenolic compound profiles as well as antioxidant and antimicrobial potential. We determined the leaf extract mineral composition, identified its major mineral components, and quantified secondary metabolites. We also measured the leaf extract antioxidant potential and found that it varies in a concentration-dependent manner. We observed a significant and higher positive correlation between DPPH and ABTS assays compared with the total phenolic and flavonoid content. Furthermore, our assay results positively correlated with several observed acids, indicating their strong association with the L. chinense antioxidant potential. Our cytotoxic assay revealed weak toxicity at higher tested concentrations. Our MIC assay showed that the 80% methanol extract effectively inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli Castellani and Chalmers (ATCC35150). The 625-ppm leaf extract completely suppressed the growth of Staphylococcus aureus Rosenbach (ATCC13150), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 14579), and Helicobacter pylori (ATCC43504). These results allow us to understand the indigenous medicinal value of L. chinense. Our study suggests that the L. chinense leaf extract phenolic compounds possess a good antioxidant activity against free radicals and are effective antimicrobial agents. Finally, the presence and high level of diverse minerals suggest the potential of L. chinense for nutraceutical and functional food applications.
