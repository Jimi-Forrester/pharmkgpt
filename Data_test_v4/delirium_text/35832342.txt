35832342|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with rapid progression. Black cumin (Nigella sativa) is a nutraceutical that has been investigated as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent for this disease due to its ability to prevent or retard the progression of neurodegeneration. Thymoquinone (TQ) is the main bioactive compound isolated from the seeds of black cumin. Several reports have shown that it has promising potential in the prevention and treatment of AD due to its significant antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties along with several other mechanisms that target the altered signaling pathways due to the disease pathogenesis. In addition, it shows anticholinesterase activity and prevents alpha-synuclein induced synaptic damage. The aim of this review is to summarize the potential aspects and mechanisms by which TQ imparts its action in AD.
