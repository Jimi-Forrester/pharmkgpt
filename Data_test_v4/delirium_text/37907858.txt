37907858|a|BACKGROUND: Low mobility during an acute hospitalization is frequent and associated with adverse effects, including persistent functional decline, institutionalization and death. However, we lack effective interventions to improve mobility that are scalable in everyday practice. The INTOMOB trial - INtervention to increase MOBility in older hospitalized medical patients - will test the effect of a multilevel intervention to improve mobility of older hospitalized patients on functional mobility. METHODS: The INTOMOB multicenter superiority parallel cluster randomized controlled trial will enroll in total 274 patients in Swiss hospitals. Community-dwelling adults aged >= 60 years, admitted to a general internal medicine ward with an anticipated length of hospital stay of >= 3 days, will be eligible for participation. Unit of randomization will be the wards. A multilevel mobility intervention will be compared to standard of care and target the patients (information and exercise booklets, mobility diary, iPad with exercise videos), healthcare professionals (e-learning, oral presentation, mobility checklist), and environment (posters and pictures on the wards). The primary outcome will be life-space level, measured by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Study of Aging Life-Space Assessment (LSA), at 30 days after enrollment. The LSA is a measure of functional mobility, i.e., how far participants move from bedroom to outside town. Secondary outcomes include, among others, LSA at 180 days, mobility and falls during hospitalization, muscle strength at discharge, and falls, emergency room visits, readmissions, and death within 180 days. DISCUSSION: This study has the potential to improve outcomes of older hospitalized patients through an intervention that should be scalable in clinical practice because it fosters patient empowerment and does not require additional resources. The tools provided to the patients can help them implement better mobility practices after discharge, which can contribute to better functional outcomes. The choice of a functional patient-reported outcome measure as primary outcome (rather than a "simple" objective mobility measure) reinforces the patient-centeredness of the study.
