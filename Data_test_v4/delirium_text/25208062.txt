25208062|t|Copper(II)-mediated O-arylation of protected serines and threonines.
25208062|a|An effective protocol toward the O-arylation of beta-hydroxy-alpha-amino acid substrates serine and threonine has been developed via Chan-Lam cross-coupling. This Cu(II)-catalyzed transformation involves benign open-flask conditions that are well-tolerated with a variety of protected (Boc-, Cbz-, Tr-, and Fmoc-) serine and threonine derivatives and various potassium organotrifluoroborates and boronic acids.
