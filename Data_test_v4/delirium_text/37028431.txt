37028431|t|Cognitive heterogeneity in Parkinson's disease: A mechanistic view.
37028431|a|Cognitive impairment occurs in most individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), exacting a high toll on patients, their caregivers, and the healthcare system. In this review, we begin by summarizing the current clinical landscape surrounding cognition in PD. We then discuss how cognitive impairment and dementia may develop in PD based on the spread of the pathological protein alpha-synuclein (aSyn) from neurons in brainstem regions to those in the cortical regions of the brain responsible for higher cognitive functions, as first proposed in the Braak hypothesis. We appraise the Braak hypothesis from molecular (conformations of aSyn), cell biological (cell-to-cell spread of pathological aSyn), and organ-level (region-to-region spread of aSyn pathology at the whole brain level) viewpoints. Finally, we argue that individual host factors may be the most poorly understood aspect of this pathological process, accounting for substantial heterogeneity in the pattern and pace of cognitive decline in PD.
