7192929|t|The behavioral side effects of the antihypertensive agents.
7192929|a|Most antihypertensive agents can cause behavioral side effects but only a few effects, such as delirium or severe depression, are serious enough to dictate immediate discontinuance of the offending agent. Other side effects may not even be mentioned by the patient but they can alter the quality of life and, as a result, alter compliance with treatment. For example, sexual difficulties may not be mentioned because of embarrassment. Alteration in dosage, a change in the time of administration or a change to alternative medication may alleviate these problems and help restore the patient's compliance with treatment.
