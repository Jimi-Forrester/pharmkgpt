37941023|a|BACKGROUND: Evaluation of outcome after stroke is largely based on assessment of gross function 3 months after stroke onset using scales such as mRS. Cognitive or social functions, level of symptom burden or emotional health are not usually assessed, nor are data available on long-term functional outcomes years after stroke. METHODS: Analysis of 1141 patients with AIS treated with IVT from two major German university hospitals between 2017 and 2020. Patient characteristics and short-term outcome were analysed from patient records. Long-term outcome of 228 patients with prior written informed consent was assessed via telephone survey using mRS and PROMs (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS) 2.5 years after stroke. RESULTS: Predictors of excellent to good long-term outcome were younger age, event to door time <= 2 h, NIHSS <= 6 on admission and NIHSS <= 6 after IVT. Stroke recurrence was a negative predictor. Predictors of excellent quality of life at 2.5 years included age < 73 years, lower NIHSS after IVT, absence of hypertension. Quality of life was rated in all dimensions with a medium score of 1 and a medium EQ-VAS of 70, representing the good general health status of this stroke population. CONCLUSION: Main predictors of an excellent to good long-term outcome and excellent QoL 2.5 years after stroke are younger age, lower NIHSS, and event to door time <= 2 h. Research on long-term outcome after disease and treatment is of utmost importance, as it has the ability to reveal the patient true functional outcome and quality of life and to provide information on the status of independence and self-esteem.
