35838993|a|BACKGROUND: The incidence of emergence agitation (EA) after sevoflurane anesthesia is high, especially in pediatric strabismus surgery. However, research thus far has focused on the pharmacological prophylaxis of EA and administering drugs to pediatric patients without EA is problematic. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of propofol after sevoflurane anesthesia affects recovery time in patients with EA. METHODS: After obtaining informed written consent, 113 children (aged 2-12 years) with the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I or II who underwent strabismus surgery were enrolled. Patients were divided into 2 groups; upon arrival at the postanesthetic care unit (PACU), patients who had EA (pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium [PAED] scale score >=14) were treated with 1.0 mg/kg 1% propofol (group P: n = 30). Patients who did not have EA (PAED scale score <14, group C: n = 83) were taken care of in the PACU without propofol administration. RESULTS: There was no difference in the PAED scale scores between the 2 groups from 10 minutes to discharge from the PACU (P > .05). There was no difference in PACU stay time between the 2 groups (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that propofol administration for intense EA alleviated EA symptoms and prevented an increase in the duration of PACU stay due to EA in children undergoing strabismus surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia.
