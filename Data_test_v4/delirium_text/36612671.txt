36612671|t|Prediction of 30-Day Readmission in Hospitalized Older Adults Using Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and LACE Index and HOSPITAL Score.
36612671|a|(1) Background: Elders have higher rates of rehospitalization, especially those with functional decline. We aimed to investigate potential predictors of 30-day readmission risk by comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in hospitalized patients aged 65 years or older and to examine the predictive ability of the LACE index and HOSPITAL score in older patients with a combination of malnutrition and physical dysfunction. (2) Methods: We included patients admitted to a geriatric ward in a tertiary hospital from July 2012 to August 2018. CGA components including cognitive, functional, nutritional, and social parameters were assessed at admission and recorded, as well as clinical information. The association factors with 30-day hospital readmission were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The predictive ability of the LACE and HOSPITAL score was assessed using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis. (3) Results: During the study period, 1509 patients admitted to a ward were recorded. Of these patients, 233 (15.4%) were readmitted within 30 days. Those who were readmitted presented with higher comorbidity numbers and poorer performance of CGA, including gait ability, activities of daily living (ADL), and nutritional status. Multivariate regression analysis showed that male gender and moderately impaired gait ability were independently correlated with 30-day hospital readmissions, while other components such as functional impairment (as ADL) and nutritional status were not associated with 30-day rehospitalization. The receiver operating characteristics for the LACE index and HOSPITAL score showed that both predicting scores performed poorly at predicting 30-day hospital readmission (C-statistic = 0.59) and did not perform better in any of the subgroups. (4) Conclusions: Our study showed that only some components of CGA, mobile disability, and gender were independently associated with increased risk of readmission. However, the LACE index and HOSPITAL score had a poor discriminating ability for predicting 30-day hospitalization in all and subgroup patients. Further identifiers are required to better estimate the 30-day readmission rates in this patient population.
