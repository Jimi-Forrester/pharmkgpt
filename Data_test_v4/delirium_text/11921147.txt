11921147|a|BACKGROUND: Delusions of theft (delusions involving the theft of possessions) are one of the most frequent neuropsychiatric manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: The current study investigated the presence and extent of such delusions before and after drug treatment in a group of AD patients, and the consequent effects on the burden of care on caregivers. METHOD: The study was an open-label cohort design. The delusions studied consisted only of those involving theft of possessions. Sixteen AD patients served as subjects in order to assess the efficacy of Risperidone administration, in the reduction or elimination of these delusions. The caregiver burden was evaluated using the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI) before the administration of Risperidone and 12 weeks after administration, for cases where delusions of theft were eliminated or reduced. RESULTS: The burden of care on caregivers was significantly reduced (p < 0.001) through the elimination or reduction of delusions of theft. CONCLUSION: Delusions of theft are considered to be a major factor in increasing the burden of care, and the treatment of these, through appropriate drug therapy, is therefore of great importance in the continuation of satisfactory care in the home.
