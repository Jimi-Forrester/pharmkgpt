21303349|a|Despite the crucial role of redox active metals like copper and iron in central biological reactions, their elevated levels are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Similarly reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) produced during normal metabolic activities, specifically oxidative phosphorylation of the cell, are scavenged by antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase but impaired metabolic pathways tend to generate elevated levels of these ROS/RNS. Iron, copper, and zinc are some of the metals, which intensify this process and contribute for the pathogenesis of AD. This review summarizes the mechanism of ROS/RNS production and their role in lipid peroxidation. The factors, which make brain vulnerable for lipid peroxidation, have been discussed. It also focuses on possible treatment options and future directions.
