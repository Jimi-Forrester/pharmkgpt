32368024|t|Mirabegron in the Treatment of Overactive Bladder: Safety and Efficacy in the Very Elderly Patient.
32368024|a|Lower urinary tract symptoms, including urgency, urgency incontinence, frequency, and nocturia, are highly prevalent in older adults and are associated with significant morbidity and impairment in quality of life. When conservative measures such as bladder training fail to improve symptoms, pharmacological management is recommended by national and international guidelines. Mirabegron, an agonist of the beta3 adrenergic receptor, demonstrates similar efficacy to the anticholinergic drugs without the risk of anticholinergic effects, but experience and evidence in the very elderly population are limited. This narrative review examines the current evidence base for mirabegron in very elderly adults.
