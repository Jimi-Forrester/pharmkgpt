8870825|t|Apoptosis in the aged dog brain.
8870825|a|Apoptosis similar to that seen in Alzheimer's disease patients was found in the brain of aged dogs by the TUNEL method of detecting in situ DNA fragmentation. Apoptosis was observed in both neurons and glial cells, and was morphologically characterized by round and swollen cytoplasm and aggregated nuclear chromatin, although these changes were slight. Neurons and astrocytes in the gray matter and oligodendrocytes in the white matter were affected. The number of ApopTag-positive brain cells increased slightly with age, but was not correlated to the number of senile plaques. A good correlation between the number of ApopTag-positive cells and the dementia index was clearly found. The present study indicates that brain cell apoptosis could account for dementia in aged dogs and suggested that aged dogs may be useful as a simplified animal model for Alzheimer's disease in man.
