37611846|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a perioperative systematic standardized enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program for patients undergoing isolated elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in terms of mortality, hospital morbidities and length of stay. METHODS: From January 2015 to September 2020, 1101 patients underwent isolated elective CABG. Our standardized systematic ERAS program was implemented in November 2018. Propensity score matching resulted in well-matched pairs of 362 patients receiving standard perioperative care (control group) and 362 patients on the ERAS program (ERAS group). There were no significant intergroup differences in preoperative and operative data except for the normothermia rate, which was significantly higher in the ERAS group (P<.001). The primary outcome was 3-year mortality. The secondary outcomes were hospital morbidities and length of stay. RESULTS: In-hospital and 3-year mortality did not differ between the two groups. The ERAS program was associated with a significant relative risk decrease in mechanical ventilation duration (-53.1%, P=.003), length of ICU stay (-28.0%, P=.015), length of hospital stay (-10.5%, P=.046), bronchopneumonia (-51.5%, P<.001), acute respiratory distress syndrome (-50.8%, P=.050), postoperative delirium (-65.4%, P=.011), moderate to severe acute kidney injury (-72.0%, P=.009), 24-h chest tube output (-26.4%, P<.001) and overall red blood cell transfusion rate (-32.4%, P=.005) compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic standardized ERAS program for low-risk patients undergoing isolated elective CABG was associated with a significant improvement in postoperative outcomes, reduction in red blood cell transfusion, shorter lengths of ICU and hospital stays and comparable long-term mortality.
