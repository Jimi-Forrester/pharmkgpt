37266349|t|Negative pressure pulmonary edema due to upper airway obstruction after general anesthesia in a patient with Parkinson's disease: A case report.
37266349|a|In a patient with Parkinson's disease (PD) who underwent spine surgery 13 h after the last anti-Parkinson medications, negative pressure pulmonary edema from upper airway obstruction developed immediately after extubation. Although oxygenation improved with high-flow nasal cannula therapy, such complications might develop due to abrupt discontinuation of medication for PD.
