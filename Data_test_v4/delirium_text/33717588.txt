33717588|t|Mild hypothermic circulatory arrest with selective cerebral perfusion in open arch surgery.
33717588|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate whether the use of mild hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) with selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) in open arch procedure provides comparable perioperative results to moderate HCA for patients with dissected or degenerative arch pathologies. METHODS: Between January 2017 and September 2020, a total of 88 consecutive patients (mean age 47+-11 years, 71 males) underwent open arch repair under a single surgeon at our institution with mild or moderate systemic hypothermia assisted by unilateral or bilateral SCP. Patients were divided into groups according to the nasopharyngeal temperature at the beginning of HCA: a moderate HCA group (n=47, 53.4%) and a mild HCA group (n=41, 46.6%). The postoperative mortality, morbidity, and visceral organ functions between these groups were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Compared to the moderate HCA group, the mild HCA group had a significantly higher core temperature (nasopharynx: 24.4+-0.8 vs. 28.5+-2, P<0.001; bladder 25.9+-0.9 vs. 30+-1.2, P<0.001), and the incidence of major adverse events (MAE) in this group was markedly lower (21.3% vs. 4.9%, P=0.031). No differences were identified between the two groups refer to in-hospital mortality, permanent neurological deficit (PND), temporary neurological deficit (TND), and paraplegia (8.5% vs. 2.4%, P=0.366; 8.5% vs. 0, P=0.120; 6.4% vs. 7.3%, P=1.0; 4.3% vs. 2.4%, P=1.0, respectively). In the moderate HCA group, 6 patients (12.8%) developed acute renal failure needing replacement therapy, which did not occur in the mild HCA group (P=0.028). The duration of ventilator support and intensive care unit stay was shorter in the mild HCA group, as well as a decreased volume of drainage during the first 24 h and reduced platelet transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results of the mild HCA group with SCP applied in open arch repair, mainly in total arch replacement (TAR) and stented elephant trunk (SET) implantation for aortic dissection, were satisfactory. Furthermore, comparable inferior outcomes were obtained with mild HCA compared with that of the conventional moderate HCA strategy. These encouraging surgical and postoperative results favor this more aggressive hypothermia strategy in open arch repair.
