19939284|a|INTRODUCTION: An excessive inflammatory response is thought to account for the pathogenesis of sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) after severe trauma. The interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine. The objectives of this prospective study were to investigate the distribution of IL-10 promoter polymorphisms in a cohort of 308 Chinese Han patients with major trauma, and to identify associations of IL-10 promoter polymorphisms with IL-10 production and incidence of sepsis and MODS. METHODS: A total of 308 patients with major trauma were included in this study. The genotypes of polymorphisms -1082, -819 and -592 were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The IL-10 levels in the supernatants were determined with enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. RESULTS: The -1082A and -592A alleles were significantly associated with lower lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-10 production in an allele-dose dependent fashion. There was no significant difference for the -819 polymorphism. Except for the -1082 polymorphism, the -819 and -592 polymorphisms were not significantly associated with sepsis morbidity rate and MOD scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our results further confirm the functionality of the IL-10 promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms in relation to IL-10 production. They also suggest that individual difference in IL-10 production in trauma patients might be at least in part related to genetic variations in the IL-10 promoter region.
