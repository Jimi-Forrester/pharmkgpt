30338006|a|BACKGROUND: As the elderly population increases dramatically, the chronic age-related disease should be noted. In the elderly, chronic pain is a common health problem. METHODS: This search was performed in 3 databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase). We have reviewed articles related to pain management in the elderly. RESULT: The prevalence of pain in people aged above 60 is twice that in younger people. Pain is estimated to be 45-85 per cent in the elderly. Pain is not a part of the ageing process, but many older people can experience it. Perception of pain can be affected by environmental, emotional, cultural and cognitive factors. Pain in the elderly often remains untreated and misdiagnosed. CONCLUSION: Pain management in elderly needs different approach because of unreported pain in this population, and usually they have multiple problems and comorbidities that complicate evaluation and treatment.
