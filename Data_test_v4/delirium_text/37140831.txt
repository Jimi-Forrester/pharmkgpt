37140831|t|Shaping the course of early-onset Parkinson's disease: insights from a longitudinal cohort.
37140831|a|INTRODUCTION: Early -onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) labels those cases with onset earlier than fifty. Although peculiarities emerged either in clinical or pathological features, EOPD is managed alike typical, late-onset PD. A customized approach would be, instead, better appropriate. Accordingly, a deeper characterization of the clinical course, with an estimation of the disease progression rate, the therapy flow, and the main motor and non-motor complications occurrence, is needed. METHODS: A longitudinal cohort of 193 EOPD patients (selected on a single-centre population of 2000 PD cases) was retrospectively analysed, providing descriptive statics on a series of clinical parameters (genetics, phenotype, comorbidities, therapies, motor and non-motor complications, marital and gender issues) and modelling the trajectories from diagnosis to 10 years later of both Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD). RESULTS: EOPD had a prevalence of 9.7%, including few monogenic cases. It mostly appeared as a motor syndrome, with asymmetric, rigid-akinetic presentation. H&Y linearly progressed with an increment of 0.92 points/10 years; LEDD flow had a non-linear trend, increasing of 526.90 mg/day in 0-5 years, and 166.83 mg/day in 5-10 years. Motor fluctuations started 6.5 +- 3.2 years from onset, affecting up to 80% of the cohort. Neuropsychiatric troubles interested the 50%, sexual complaints the 12%. Gender-specific motor disturbances emerged. CONCLUSION: We shaped EOPD course, modelling a "brain-first" PD subtype, slowly progressive, with non-linear dopaminergic requirement. Major burden mostly resulted from motor fluctuations, neuropsychiatric complications, sexual and marital complaints, with a considerable gender-effect.
