38342753|a|BACKGROUND: In-hospital delirium is associated with adverse outcomes and is underdiagnosed, limiting research and clinical follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of in-hospital delirium determined by chart-based review of electronic medical records (D-CBR) with delirium discharge diagnoses (D-DD). Furthermore, to identify differences in symptoms, treatments and delirium triggers between D-CBR and D-DD. METHOD: The community-based cohort included 2,115 participants in the Hordaland Health Study born between 1925 and 1927. Between 2018 and 2022, we retrospectively reviewed hospital electronic medical records from baseline (1997-99) until death prior to 2023. D-DD and D-CBR were validated using The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, criteria for delirium. RESULTS: Of the 2,115 participants, 638 had in-hospital delirium. The incidence rate (IR) of D-CBR was 29.8 [95% confidence interval 28, 32] per 1,000 person-years, whereas the IR by D-DD was 3.4 [2.8, 4.2]. The IR ratio was 9.14 (P < 0.001). Patients who received pharmacological treatment for delirium (n = 121, odds ratio (OR) 3.4, [2.1, 5.4], P < 0.001), who were affected by acute memory impairment (n = 149, OR 2.8, [1.8, 4.5], P < 0.001), or change in perception (n = 137, OR 2.9, [1.8, 4.6] P < 0.001) had higher odds for D-DD. In contrast, post-operative cases (OR 0.2, [0.1, 0.4], P < 0.001) had lower odds for D-DD. CONCLUSION: Underdiagnosis of in-hospital delirium was a major issue in our study, especially in less severe delirium cases. Our findings emphasise the need for integrating systematic delirium diagnostics and documentation into hospital admission and discharge routines.
