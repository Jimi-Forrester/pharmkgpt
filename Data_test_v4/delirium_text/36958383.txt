36958383|a|Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurological condition, is associated with various internal and external risk factors in the disease's early stages. Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is essential for treatment management. Circulating exosomal microRNAs could be a new class of valuable biomarkers for early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Different kinds of biosensors have been introduced in recent years for the detection of these valuable biomarkers. Isolation of the exosomes is a crucial step in the detection process which is traditionally carried out by multi-step ultrafiltration. Microfluidics has improved the efficiency and costs of exosome isolation by implementing various effects and forces on the nano and microparticles in the microchannels. This paper reviews recent advancements in detecting Alzheimer's disease related exosomal microRNAs based on methods such as electrochemical, fluorescent, and SPR. The presented devices' pros and cons and their efficiencies compared with the gold standard methods are reported. Moreover, the application of microfluidic devices to detect Alzheimer's disease related biomarkers is summarized and presented. Finally, some challenges with the performance of novel technologies for isolating and detecting exosomal microRNAs are addressed.
