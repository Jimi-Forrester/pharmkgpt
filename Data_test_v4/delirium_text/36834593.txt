36834593|t|Age-Related Alterations in the Level and Metabolism of Serotonin in the Brain of Males and Females of Annual Turquoise Killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri).
36834593|a|The annual turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) is a laboratory model organism for neuroscience of aging. In the present study, we investigated for the first time the levels of serotonin and its main metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, as well as the activities of the key enzymes of its synthesis, tryptophan hydroxylases, and degradation, monoamine oxidase, in the brains of 2-, 4- and 7-month-old male and female N. furzeri. The marked effect of age on the body mass and the level of serotonin, as well as the activities of tryptophan hydroxylases and monoamine oxidase in the brain of killifish were revealed. The level of serotonin decreased in the brain of 7-month-old males and females compared with 2-month-old ones. A significant decrease in the tryptophan hydroxylase activity and an increase in the monoamine oxidase activity in the brain of 7-month-old females compared to 2-month-old females was shown. These findings agree with the age-related alterations in expression of the genes encoding tryptophan hydroxylases and monoamine oxidase. N. furzeri is a suitable model with which to study the fundamental problems of age-related changes of the serotonin system in the brain.
