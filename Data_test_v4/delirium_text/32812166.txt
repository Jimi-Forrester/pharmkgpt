32812166|a|It has been demonstrated that physical exercise and probiotic supplementation delay the progress of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in male APP/PS1TG mice. However, it has also been suggested that both exercise and AD have systemic effects. We have studied the effects of exercise training and probiotic treatment on microbiome and biochemical signalling proteins in the liver. The results suggest that liver is under oxidative stress, since SOD2 levels of APP/PS1 mice were decreased when compared to a wild type of mice. Exercise training prevented this decrease. We did not find significant changes in COX4, SIRT3, PGC-1a or GLUT4 levels, while the changes in pAMPK/AMPK, pmTOR/mTOR, pS6/S6 and NRF2 levels were randomly modulated. The data suggest that exercise and probiotics-induced changes in microbiome do not strongly affect mitochondrial density or protein synthesis-related AMPK/mTOR/S6 pathways in the liver of these animals.
