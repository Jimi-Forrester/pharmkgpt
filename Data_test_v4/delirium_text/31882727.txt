31882727|t|Statistical Analysis of Dual-task Gait Characteristics for Cognitive Score Estimation.
31882727|a|Traditional approaches for the screening of cognitive function are often based on paper tests, such as Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), that evaluate the degree of cognitive impairment and provide a score of patient's mental ability. Procedures for conducting paper tests require time investment involving a questioner and not suitable to be carried out frequently. Previous studies showed that dementia impaired patients are not capable of multi-tasking efficiently. Based on this observation an automated system utilizing Kinect device for collecting primarily patient's gait data who carry out locomotion and calculus tasks individually (i.e., single-tasks) and then simultaneously (i.e., dual-task) was introduced. We installed this system in three elderly facilities and collected 10,833 behavior data from 90 subjects. We conducted analyses of the acquired information extracting 12 features of single- and dual-task performance developed a method for automatic dementia score estimation to investigate determined which characteristics are the most important. In result, a machine learning algorithm using single and dual-task performance classified subjects with an MMSE score of 23 or lower with a recall 0.753 and a specificity 0.799. We found the gait characteristics were important features in the score estimation, and referring to both single and dual-task features was effective.
