31476124|t|Modulation of Amyloid-beta42 Conformation by Small Molecules Through Nonspecific Binding.
31476124|a|Aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is a crucial step in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying aggregation inhibitors against AD has been a great challenge. We report an atomistic simulation study of the inhibition mechanism of two small molecules, homotaurine and scyllo-inositol, which are AD drug candidates currently under investigation. We show that both small molecules promote a conformational change of the Abeta42 monomer toward a more collapsed phase through a nonspecific binding mechanism. This finding provides atomistic-level insights into designing potential drug candidates for future AD treatments.
