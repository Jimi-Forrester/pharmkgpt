15942325|a|We assessed the ability of 73 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from our outpatient clinic to demonstrate how they would use the telephone to call for help in case of an emergency. We also assessed their caregivers' awareness of their abilities. Overall, 44% of the patients did not demonstrate how to call for help correctly if they had no written telephone number to call, and 18% did not when they had a written number. There was an association between the abilities of the patients and their Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, with the patients with the lowest scores having the most difficulty (P < 0.0001). Surprisingly, 21% of those with MMSE scores 26-30 did not use the telephone correctly when they had no written number. Of the caregivers, 31% were incorrect in predicting their patients' abilities for the first task, and 11% were incorrect in predicting the second task. We conclude that AD patients lose their ability to use the telephone to call for help as their illness progresses. Furthermore, many caregivers are unaware of their patients' impairment. These findings highlight safety concerns in AD and suggest that caregivers could benefit from education about potential patient losses.
