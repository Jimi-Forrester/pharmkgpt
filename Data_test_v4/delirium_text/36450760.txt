36450760|a|Nonadherence to medication is a common issue that goes along with increased morbidity and mortality and immense health care costs. To improve medication adherence and outcome in ill people, their reasons of not taking their prescribed medication must be known. Here a dataset is presented based on the longitudinal observational NeuroGerAd study in adults with neurological disorders (N = 910). The dataset contains demographic background variables as well as measures of adherence, medication changes after hospital discharge, comprehensive geriatric assessments, personality, patient-physician relationship, and health-related quality of life. As such, the dataset offers unique opportunities to enable a plethora of analyses on personal, social, and institutional factors influencing medication adherence.
