27199760|t|Calcium-Sensing Receptors of Human Neural Cells Play Crucial Roles in Alzheimer's Disease.
27199760|a|In aged subjects, late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) starts in the lateral entorhinal allocortex where a failure of clearance mechanisms triggers an accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid-beta42 oligomers (Abeta42-os). In neurons and astrocytes, Abeta42-os enhance the transcription of Abeta precursor protein (APP) and beta-secretase/BACE1 genes. Thus, by acting together with gamma-secretase, the surpluses of APP and BACE1 amplify the endogenous production of Abeta42-os which pile up, damage mitochondria, and are oversecreted. At the plasmalemma, exogenous Abeta42-os bind neurons' and astrocytes' calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) activating a set of intracellular signaling pathways which upkeep Abeta42-os intracellular accumulation and oversecretion by hindering Abeta42-os proteolysis. In addition, Abeta42-os accumulating in the extracellular milieu spread and reach mounting numbers of adjacent and remoter teams of neurons and astrocytes which in turn are recruited, again via Abeta42-os CaSR-governed mechanisms, to produce and release additional Abeta42-os amounts. This relentless self-sustaining mechanism drives AD progression toward upper cortical areas. Later on accumulating Abeta42-os elicit the advent of hyperphosphorylated (p)-Tau oligomers which acting together with Abeta42-os and other glial neurotoxins cooperatively destroy wider and wider cognition-related cortical areas. In parallel, Abeta42-os CaSR signals also elicit an excess production and secretion of nitric oxide and vascular endothelial growth factor-A from astrocytes, of Abeta42-os and myelin basic protein from oligodendrocytes, and of proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide and (likely) Abeta42-os from microglia. Activated astrocytes and microglia survive the toxic onslaught, whereas neurons and oligodendrocytes increasingly die. However, we have shown that highly selective allosteric CaSR antagonists (calcilytics), like NPS 2143 and NPS 89626, efficiently suppress all the neurotoxic effects Abeta42-os CaSR signaling drives in cultured cortical untransformed human neurons and astrocytes. In fact, calcilytics increase Abeta42 proteolysis and discontinue the oversecretion of Abeta42-os, nitric oxide, and vascular endothelial growth factor-A from both astrocytes and neurons. Seemingly, calcilytics would also benefit the other types of glial cells and cerebrovascular cells otherwise damaged by the effects of Abeta42-os CaSR signaling. Thus, given at amnestic minor cognitive impairment (aMCI) or initial symptomatic stages, calcilytics could prevent or terminate the propagation of LOAD neuropathology and preserve human neurons' viability and hence patients' cognitive abilities.
