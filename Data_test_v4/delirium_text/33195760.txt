33195760|a|OBJECTIVES: To summarize evidence in the literature on the predictors of insomnia in adults and to determine correspondences with diagnostic indicators of the NANDA-I diagnosis Insomnia. METHODS: An integrative review performed in Pubmed, Virtual Health Library and CINAHL. Forty-eight articles published in Portuguese, English or Spanish from 2011 to 2018 were included. An analysis of correspondence between the predictors and the NANDA-I related factors and associated conditions for Insomnia was performed. RESULTS: There was a correspondence of the predictors found in this review with NANDA-I related factors and associated conditions, except for grieving and frequent naps during the day. Smoking, caffeine intake, dysfunctional sleep beliefs, obesity and caregiver role strain are possible new related factors; chronic illness is a possible new associated condition and individuals going through changes in marital status, economically disadvantaged, female gender, increasing age and night shift worker are possible new at-risk populations. CONCLUSION: The predictors of insomnia that had a correspondence with the NANDA-I elements can support the evidence base of the nursing diagnosis. The predictors found without a correspondence with the diagnosis can be considered for inclusion in the NANDA-I classification, thereby supporting the clinical reasoning of nurses and students.
