33961642|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the risk of Alzheimer's disease among patients with age-related macular degeneration and its association with confounding comorbidities. METHOD: This was a population-based, retrospective cohort study. By accessing data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, we identified 10,578 patients aged 50-100 years who were newly diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration between 2000 and 2012 and 10,578 non- age-related macular degeneration individuals. The comorbidities assessed were osteoporosis, diabetes, cirrhosis, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. RESULTS: Patients with age-related macular degeneration had a 1.23-fold increased risk of their condition advancing to Alzheimer's disease (aHR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.04-1.46). The younger patients were diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration, the more likely patients got Alzheimer's disease (50-64 age group: aHR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.04-3.73; 65-79 age group: aHR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.02-1.58; 80-100 age group: aHR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.78-1.45). In addition, there were significantly higher risks of Alzheimer's disease for patients with cirrhosis (aHR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.09-2.06) in the age-related macular degeneration cohort than in the non-age-related macular degeneration cohort. CONCLUSION: Patients with age-related macular degeneration may exhibit a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease than people without age-related macular degeneration.
