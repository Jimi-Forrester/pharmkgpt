38901132|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate how language deteriorates over the Alzheimer's Disease course. METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational study was carried out. 35 patients diagnosed with dementia due to AD using the NINCDS-ARDRA criteria and undergoing treatment for AD with a therapeutic dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were assessed by the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE). The sample comprised 15 patients with mild AD (MMSE > 23, CDR = 0 or 0.5-1.0) and 20 patients with moderate AD (MMSE = 13-23, CDR = 2). The results for the 2 groups on all language tasks were compared. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found between the mild and moderate AD groups for total score on the BDAE (95% CI 47.10-114.08, t = 5.0, DF = 21, p = 0.000*), as well as on several tasks involving oral and writing comprehension, language oral expression and writing. CONCLUSION: The study results showed major changes in the moderate stage. Also, the decline in language performance correlated with the worsening of dementia syndrome, independently of sociodemographic variables.
