29230573|t|Incidence of perioperative stroke in clampless aortic anastomosis during off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.
29230573|a|This study aimed to assess if clampless off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) decreases the incidence of perioperative stroke (POS) rate and in-hospital mortality. The secondary aim was to evaluate 12-year rates of overall mortality. Between January 2003 to December 2015, data of 645 consecutive patients undergoing isolated CABG were retrospectively collected. 363 underwent aortic no-touch OPCAB (No-touch group) and 282 underwent OPCAB with the Heartstring device (HS group). In-hospital mortality and perioperative stroke rate as primary endpoint, as well as long-term follow-up outcome were analysed. In-hospital mortality was lower into No-touch group compared with HS group but without significant statistical difference (1.7 vs. 3.2%, p = 0.19, respectively); the rate of postoperative stroke was higher in No-touch group compared with HS group, although this difference did not reach statistically significance. Delirium was reported with higher presentation rate in HS group (3.9 vs. 0.8%, p = 0.01). Blood transfusions rate was higher in HS subjects (23.4 vs. 16.1%, p = 0.01). Intubation time, ICU, and hospital length of stay were increased in the HS group (p = 0.008, p = 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). Over a 12-year follow-up period, survival probabilities at 1, 5, and 10 years were 93.6 +- 1.3 vs. 93.2 +- 1.5, 80.4 +- 2.6 vs. 80.3 +- 2.2, and 57.9 +- 5 vs. 58.4 +- 3.8% in the No-touch and HS group, respectively (p = 0.97). In this retrospective study, clampless off-pump CABG lowers perioperative stroke rate whose incidence is, however, not inferior compared with No-touch technique, and no statistically significance was detected. Delirium has a higher presentation rate in clampless off-pump CABG.
