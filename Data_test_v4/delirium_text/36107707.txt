36107707|a|OBJECTIVE: Cognitive fluctuations are characteristic of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) but challenging to measure. Dispersion-based intra-individual variability (IIV-d) captures neurocognitive performance fluctuations across a test battery and may be sensitive to cognitive fluctuations but has not been studied in DLB. METHOD: We report on 5,976 participants that completed the uniform data set 3.0 neuropsychological battery (UDS3NB). IIV-d was calculated via the intra-individual standard deviation across 12 primary UDS3NB indicators. Separate models using mean USD3NB score and the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) total score tested the reproducibility of the incremental value of IIV-d over-and-above global cognition. Binary logistic regressions tested whether IIV-d could classify individuals with and without clinician-rated cognitive fluctuations. Multinomial logistic regressions tested whether IIV-d could differentiate participants with DLB, participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and participants with healthy cognition (CH), as well as the incremental diagnostic utility of IIV-d over-and-above clinician-rated cognitive fluctuations. RESULTS: IIV-d exhibited large univariate associations with clinician-rated and non-clinician-informant reported cognitive fluctuations, which persisted when adjusting for MoCA but not the full battery mean. Of diagnostic relevance, greater IIV-d was consistently associated with DLB and AD relative to CH over-and-above global cognition and clinician-rated cognitive fluctuations. Greater IIV-d was less consistently associated with an increased probability of DLB relative to AD when controlling for global cognition. CONCLUSIONS: IIV-d accurately differentiates DLB from CH over-and-above global cognition and clinician-rated cognitive fluctuations. IIV-d may supplement a thorough clinical interview of cognitive fluctuations and serve as a standardized performance-based indicator of this transdiagnostic phenomenon.
