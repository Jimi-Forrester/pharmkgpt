37209215|t|Beyond Weight Loss: Added Benefits Could Guide the Choice of Anti-Obesity Medications.
37209215|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight the added benefits of approved and upcoming, centrally-acting, anti-obesity drugs, focusing not only on the most common metabolic and cardiovascular effects but also on their less explored clinical benefits and drawbacks, in order to provide clinicians with a tool for more comprehensive, pharmacological management of obesity. RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity is increasingly prevalent worldwide and has become a challenge for healthcare systems and societies. Reduced life expectancy and cardiometabolic complications are some of the consequences of this complex disease. Recent insights into the pathophysiology of obesity have led to the development of several promising pharmacologic targets, so that even more effective drugs are on the horizon. The perspective of having a wider range of treatments increases the chance to personalize therapy. This primarily has the potential to take advantage of the long-term use of anti-obesity medication for safe, effective and sustainable weight loss, and to concomitantly address obesity complications/comorbidities when already established. The evolving scenario of the availability of anti-obesity drugs and the increasing knowledge of their added effects on obesity complications will allow clinicians to move into a new era of precision medicine.
