31666843|t|Sodium Valproate versus Continuous Infusion of Haloperidol in Management of Agitated Critically Ill Patients.
31666843|a|AIM: Describe the efficacy and safety of valproate and haloperidol infusion in controlling agitation in the intensive care unit (ICU). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective study on 100 critically ill patients with agitation in Kasralainy Hospital over the period from May 2016 to June 2017.patients were divided into two groups, each group included 50 patients, 1st group patients received Depakene orally, and 2nd group patients received haloperidol by i.v infusion for 72 h. Richmond agitation sedation score and doses of additional sedative drugs were noted and calculated daily in the first three days. RESULTS: Our study showed that valproate was equal in efficacy in controlling agitation; decreasing the RAAS significantly after 48 h from initiation (2.52 +- 0.61 vs 0.28 +- 0.54 with p < 0.001) for Depakene and (2.6 +- 0.67 vs 0.34 +- 0.48 with p < 0.001) for haloperidol. There was also a decrease in the doses of additional sedative drugs used to control agitation (midazolam & propofol) after 48 h from drug initiation. Both drugs therapy was associated with decrease in heart rate (89 +- 20 vs 86.6 +- 13.6 with p = 0.002 for valproate and 99.8 +- 23.3 vs 91 +- 16.7 with p < 0.001 for haloperidol). They did not affect blood pressure. Haloperidol therapy was associated with significant QTc prolongation. CONCLUSION: Valproate was equal in efficacy as haloperidol infusion in controlling agitation in ICU and decreasing the doses of additional sedative drugs used after 48 h from initiation.
