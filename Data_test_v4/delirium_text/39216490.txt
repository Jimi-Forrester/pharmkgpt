39216490|t|An essay on the Charcot and Richer hysteria: from charcoal drawings to cell phones.
39216490|a|Hysteria, previously also known as the disease of the womb, has moved from being a woman's illness through the medieval times' stigma of demonic possession, to the modern concept of a functional neurological disorder. Interestingly to the present assay, Charcot (1825-1893) and Richer (1849-1933) described, in their 1887 work Les Demoniaques dans l'art, by means of iconography, semiological aspects of the so-called Grande Attaque Hysterique, which resembles features of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures emulating grand mal epileptic seizures. The aim of the present assay is to describe how those charcoal iconographic representations evolved through history and are nowadays portrayed in videos recorded at epilepsy monitoring units and patients' cell phones.
