32985487|t|Combination of epidural electrical stimulation with ex vivo triple gene therapy for spinal cord injury: a proof of principle study.
32985487|a|Despite emerging contemporary biotechnological methods such as gene- and stem cell-based therapy, there are no clinically established therapeutic strategies for neural regeneration after spinal cord injury. Our previous studies have demonstrated that transplantation of genetically engineered human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells producing three recombinant therapeutic molecules, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) can improve morpho-functional recovery of injured spinal cord in rats and mini-pigs. To investigate the efficacy of human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells-mediated triple-gene therapy combined with epidural electrical stimulation in the treatment of spinal cord injury, in this study, rats with moderate spinal cord contusion injury were intrathecally infused with human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells expressing recombinant genes VEGF165, GDNF, NCAM1 at 4 hours after spinal cord injury. Three days after injury, epidural stimulations were given simultaneously above the lesion site at C5 (to stimulate the cervical network related to forelimb functions) and below the lesion site at L2 (to activate the central pattern generators) every other day for 4 weeks. Rats subjected to the combined treatment showed a limited functional improvement of the knee joint, high preservation of muscle fiber area in tibialis anterior muscle and increased H/M ratio in gastrocnemius muscle 30 days after spinal cord injury. However, beneficial cellular outcomes such as reduced apoptosis and increased sparing of the gray and white matters, and enhanced expression of heat shock and synaptic proteins were found in rats with spinal cord injury subjected to the combined epidural electrical stimulation with gene therapy. This study presents the first proof of principle study of combination of the multisite epidural electrical stimulation with ex vivo triple gene therapy (VEGF, GDNF and NCAM) for treatment of spinal cord injury in rat models. The animal protocols were approved by the Kazan State Medical University Animal Care and Use Committee (approval No. 2.20.02.18) on February 20, 2018.
