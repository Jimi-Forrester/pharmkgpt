32884682|a|Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is an incapacitating situation and has no effective therapy until now. We examined the possible role of crude leaves of Moringa oleifera Lam. at 200 mg/kg body weight in accelerating the functional regain in the sciatic nerve lesion induced mouse model (Adult male albino mice (BALB/c). Motor functions were evaluated by using the sciatic functional index, muscle mass, and muscle grip strength measurement, whereas the sensory functions were evaluated by using the hot plate test. Blood glucose levels and blood cell composition were also analyzed. We found that the Moringa oleifera crude leaves endorse the sensory and motor functions reclamation following the PNI with a statistically significant difference (p < .05). It also revitalizes the gastrocnemius muscle by mass restoration with glycemic management perspective. Conclusively, the crude powder of Moringa oleifera leaves exhibited a function restoration boosting property and further detailed studies for its application as a therapeutic agent are strongly recommended.
