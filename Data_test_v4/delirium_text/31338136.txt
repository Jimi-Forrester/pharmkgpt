31338136|t|A case of chronic subdural hematoma demonstrating the epileptic focus at the area with sulcal hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image.
31338136|a|Although the sulcal hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images is detected in some chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) cases, its clinical significance remains determined. A 77-year-old man with symptomatic CSDH presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures at 9 days after surgery. 123I-iomazenil -single photon emission computed tomography revealed transient reduction in cortical benzodiazepine receptors binding potential at the region corresponding to that of the sulcal hyperintensity on FLAIR images. Findings of sulcal hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging under the CSDH may have a relation with the cause of epileptic seizure.
