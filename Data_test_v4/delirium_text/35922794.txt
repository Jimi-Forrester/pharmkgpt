35922794|t|A double-blind, randomised cross-over study to evaluate the absorption of a commercially available Ginkgo biloba extract compared to the liposomal extract Ginkgosome.
35922794|a|BACKGROUND: Ginkgo biloba extracts (GBE) have been used in traditional medicines for centuries. GBE has been shown to deliver protective effects against symptoms of age-related cognitive decline. Despite there being standardised extractions for GBE, there is still variability in the absorption and efficacy of different extracts. Following the development of a liposomal GBE (Ginkgosome ), the aim of this study is to investigate the absorption of the liposomal formulation compared to a comparator formulation of equal dose. METHODS: Thirteen healthy male and female volunteers completed this single equivalent dose, randomised, double-blind crossover study. Plasma concentrations were determined at baseline and at regular intervals over a 24-h period following ingestion of 120 mg of either a liposomal or comparator formulation. RESULTS: The liposomal formulation was able to increase plasma concentration of ginkgolide B and C by 1.9 and 2.2-fold compared to the comparator formulation. CONCLUSION: The novel liposomal formulation is safe in humans and demonstrates superior absorption for the supply of GBE constituents compared to a comparator standardised formulation.
