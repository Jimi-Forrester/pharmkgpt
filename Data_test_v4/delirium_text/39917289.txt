39917289|t|Postoperative delirium: identifying the patient at risk and altering the course: A narrative review.
39917289|a|Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common neurocognitive syndrome seen in older patients after major surgery. POD is linked to longer stays in hospital and intensive care, a greater incidence of postoperative complications, worse functional outcome, and higher mortality. Researchers have not yet fully elucidated the exact pathophysiology of POD. Several risk factors that contribute to the development of POD have been identified, such as advanced age, cardiac or hip surgery, preoperative cognitive decline or delirium, disturbances in brain levels of neurotransmitters and information processing, oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation. Identifying patients at risk for POD enables a more precise and efficient allocation of medical resources and facilitates POD prevention and management. The present review addresses how to identify patients at risk of POD and summarizes the currently available evidence and best-practice recommendations for peri-operative management and prevention of POD.
