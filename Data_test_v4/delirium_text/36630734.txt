36630734|a|Neuronal insulin resistance is a major risk for development of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Studies already reported few kinases participating in neuronal insulin signaling connected with progression of AD pathogenesis, yet complete information is missing. alpha isoform of Protein Phosphatase-2C (PP2C) is a Ser/Thr phosphatase, only known in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a positive regulator of insulin signaling. However, many aspects of its function in neuronal insulin signaling and insulin resistance are unidentified. Recently, we reported that PP2Calpha positively regulates neuronal glucose uptake possibly by a mechanism of dephosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser522 and by inactivating AMPK, exacerbating hyperinsulinemia mediated neuronal insulin resistance. Since PP2Calpha affected neuronal insulin signaling and AD is connected to neuronal insulin resistance, in the present study, we studied the role of PP2Calpha in regulating activities of both isoforms of GSK3alpha and GSK3beta (one of the leading kinases for AD progression). The results led us to test the role of PP2Calpha on AD hallmarks. Silencing of PP2Calpha caused hyperphosphorylation of a potential kinase Tau, leading to NFT formation and increased Abeta deposition. Our study thereby demonstrates escalation of hyperinsulinemia mediated neuronal insulin resistance leading to AD-like pathogenesis by PP2Calpha in vitro and hints a novel molecule, PP2Calpha, linking AD pathogenesis.
