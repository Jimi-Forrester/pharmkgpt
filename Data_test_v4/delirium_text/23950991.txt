23950991|t|532 nm low-power laser irradiation recovers gamma-secretase inhibitor-mediated cell growth suppression and promotes cell proliferation via Akt signaling.
23950991|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) has been shown to inhibit expression of amyloid beta (Abeta), but GSI also has a side effect of reducing cell survival. Since low-power laser irradiation (LLI) has been known to promote cell survival, we examined whether 532 nm LLI can rescue the GSI side effect or not. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human-derived glioblastoma cells (A-172) were cultured in 35 mm culture dishes or 96-well plate. The center of dish or selected wells was irradiated with 532 nm laser (Nd:YVO4, CW, 60 mW) for 20, 40 and 60 min, respectively. The irradiated cells were photographed at immediately after, 24 and 48 h later and counted. GSI was supplemented in medium 3 h before LLI. The MTT assay was also used to estimate viable cells at 48 h after irradiation. The expression of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) or phosphorylated PTEN (p-PTEN) was examined by immunofluorescent staining and measured by fluorescence intensity using the software (BZ-9000, KEYENCE, Japan). RESULTS: GSI application depressed cell proliferation as well as cell survival compared to control. GSI down-regulated Abeta but up-regulated p-PTEN and suppressed p-Akt. Application of 532 nm LLI in the presence of GSI significantly recovered the GSI-mediated effects, i.e., LLI could decrease elevated p-PTEN, while increased p-Akt expression with keeping Abeta suppression. The LLI effects had a dose-dependency. CONCLUSION: We confirmed that GSI potently suppressed intracellular Abeta and decreased cell survival. We conclude that a combination of GSI application and 532 nm LLI can increase cell proliferation via Akt activation while keeping PTEN and Abeta suppressed.
