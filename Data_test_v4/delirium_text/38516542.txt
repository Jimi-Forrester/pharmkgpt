38516542|t|Delayed Diagnoses in Patients With Dizziness in the US Commonwealth of Virginia and the Tidewater Region.
38516542|a|Objective: In a region of approximately 1.7 million people (Tidewater, coastal Virginia), identify secondary diagnoses in persons with dizziness. Methods: This cross-sectional study utilizing TriNetX included individuals in the region of interest diagnosed with dizziness between 2010 and 2020. Subsequent diagnoses of vestibular disease or medical conditions possibly associated with dizziness in the same subjects were catalogued. Results: During the study period, 31,670 subjects were identified with diagnoses of dizziness as a symptom; 18,390 subjects were subsequently given a dizziness-related nonvestibular diagnosis, and 930 were given a subsequent vestibular disease diagnosis. The proportion of subjects diagnosed with vestibular disease (3%) after the dizziness diagnosis is far below expected norms (25%-34%) in the general population. There were greater proportions of delayed diagnoses of labyrinth dysfunction (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; P < 0.0001), superior semicircular canal dehiscence (OR, 3.1; P = 0.0023), otolith disease (OR, 3.1; P = 0.0023), among others, and a decreased proportion of delayed diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (OR, 0.56; P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The discrepancy between expected and observed prevalence in our region indicates that vestibular disease is likely underdiagnosed.
