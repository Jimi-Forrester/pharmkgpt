38251125|t|Selenium Nanoparticles in Protecting the Brain from Stroke: Possible Signaling and Metabolic Mechanisms.
38251125|a|Strokes rank as the second most common cause of mortality and disability in the human population across the world. Currently, available methods of treating or preventing strokes have significant limitations, primarily the need to use high doses of drugs due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier. In the last decade, increasing attention has been paid to the capabilities of nanotechnology. However, the vast majority of research in this area is focused on the mechanisms of anticancer and antiviral effects of nanoparticles. In our opinion, not enough attention is paid to the neuroprotective mechanisms of nanomaterials. In this review, we attempted to summarize the key molecular mechanisms of brain cell damage during ischemia. We discussed the current literature regarding the use of various nanomaterials for the treatment of strokes. In this review, we examined the features of all known nanomaterials, the possibility of which are currently being studied for the treatment of strokes. In this regard, the positive and negative properties of nanomaterials for the treatment of strokes have been identified. Particular attention in the review was paid to nanoselenium since selenium is a vital microelement and is part of very important and little-studied proteins, e.g., selenoproteins and selenium-containing proteins. An analysis of modern studies of the cytoprotective effects of nanoselenium made it possible to establish the mechanisms of acute and chronic protective effects of selenium nanoparticles. In this review, we aimed to combine all the available information regarding the neuroprotective properties and mechanisms of action of nanoparticles in neurodegenerative processes, especially in cerebral ischemia.
