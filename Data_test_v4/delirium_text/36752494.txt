36752494|t|Vestibulo-spatial navigation: pathways and sense of direction.
36752494|a|Aims of the present article are: 1) assessing vestibular contribution to spatial navigation, 2) exploring how age, global positioning systems (GPS) use, and vestibular navigation contribute to subjective sense of direction (SOD), 3) evaluating vestibular navigation in patients with lesions of the vestibular-cerebellum (patients with downbeat nystagmus, DBN) that could inform on the signals carried by vestibulo-cerebellar-cortical pathways. We applied two navigation tasks on a rotating chair in the dark: return-to-start (RTS), where subjects drive the chair back to the origin after discrete angular displacement stimuli (path reversal), and complete-the-circle (CTC) where subjects drive the chair on, all the way round to origin (path completion). We examined 24 normal controls (20-83 yr), five patients with DBN (62-77 yr) and, as proof of principle, two patients with early dementia (84 and 76 yr). We found a relationship between SOD, assessed by Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale, and subject's age (positive), GPS use (negative), and CTC-vestibular-navigation-task (positive). Age-related decline in vestibular navigation was observed with the RTS task but not with the complex CTC task. Vestibular navigation was normal in patients with vestibulo-cerebellar dysfunction but abnormal, particularly CTC, in the demented patients. We conclude that vestibular navigation skills contribute to the build-up of our SOD. Unexpectedly, perceived SOD in the elderly is not inferior, possibly explained by increased GPS use by the young. Preserved vestibular navigation in cerebellar patients suggests that ascending vestibular-cerebellar projections carry velocity (not position) signals. The abnormalities in the cognitively impaired patients suggest that their vestibulo-spatial navigation is disrupted.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our subjective sense-of-direction is influenced by how good we are at spatial navigation using vestibular cues. Global positioning systems (GPS) may inhibit sense of direction. Increased use of GPS by the young may explain why the elderly's sense of direction is not worse than the young's. Patients with vestibulo-cerebellar dysfunction (downbeat nystagmus syndrome) display normal vestibular navigation, suggesting that ascending vestibulo-cerebellar-cortical pathways carry velocity rather than position signals. Pilot data indicate that dementia disrupts vestibular navigation.
