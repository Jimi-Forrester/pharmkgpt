24102052|t|Incidence and risk factors of early delirium after cardiac surgery.
24102052|a|INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to identify the incidence and risk factors of delirium after cardiac surgery implementing Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 87 patients, undergoing cardiac surgery at Vilnius University hospital, were prospectively monitored for postoperative delirium development, during intensive care unit stay. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative delirium was 13.30%. No statistically relevant preoperative predictors of delirium were found. The duration of surgery was significantly longer in delirium group (4.51 +- 1.15 versus 3.76 +- 0.97 hours, P = 0.017). Patients in delirium group more often had blood product transfusions (1.50 (+- 1.57) versus 0.49 (+- 0.91) P = 0.003) and had a higher incidence of low cardiac output syndrome (33.30% versus 3.00%, P = 0.004); they were significantly longer mechanically ventilated (24.31 +- 28.35 versus 8.78 +- 4.77 (P < 0.001)) hours (OR = 1.15 (1.02-1.28)) and had twice longer ICU stay (5.00 +- 2.22 versus 2.60 +- 1.10 (P < 0.001)) days (OR = 1.91 (1.22-3.00)). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of delirium after cardiac surgery was 13.3%. Independent predictors of delirium were duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay.
