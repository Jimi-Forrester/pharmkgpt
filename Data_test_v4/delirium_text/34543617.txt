34543617|a|Vgf (non-acronymic), a neurotrophin stimulated protein which plays a crucial role in learning, synaptic activity, and neurogenesis, is markedly downregulated in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, since vgf is a large polar protein, a safe and efficient gene delivery vector is critical for its delivery across the blood brain barrier (BBB). This research work demonstrates brain-targeted liposomal nanoparticles optimized for delivering plasmid encoding vgf across BBB and transfecting brain cells. Brain targeting was achieved by surface functionalization using glucose transporter-1 targeting ligand (mannose) and brain targeted cell-penetrating peptides (chimeric rabies virus glycoprotein fragment, rabies virus derived peptide, penetratin peptide, or CGNHPHLAKYNGT peptide). The ligands were conjugated to lipid via nucleophilic substitution reaction resulting in >75% binding efficiency. The liposomes were formed by film hydration technique demonstrating size <200 nm, positive zeta potential (15-20 mV), and polydispersity index <0.3. The bifunctionalized liposomes demonstrated ~3 pg/microg protein vgf transfection across in vitro BBB, and ~80 pg/mg protein in mice brain which was 1.5-2 fold (p < 0.05) higher compared to untreated control. The nanoparticles were also biocompatible in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a safe and efficient gene delivery system to treat AD.
