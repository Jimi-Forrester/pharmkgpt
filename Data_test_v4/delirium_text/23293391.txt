23293391|a|Recent advances in neurosurgery, neuromonitoring and neurointensive care have dramatically improved the outcome in patients affected by surgical lesions of central nervous system (CNS). Although most of these techniques were applied first in the adult population, paediatric patients present a set of inherent challenges because of their developing and maturing neurological and physiological status, apart from the CNS disease process. To provide optimal neuroanaesthesia care, the anaesthesiologist must have the knowledge of basic neurophysiology of developing brain and effects of various drugs on cerebral haemodynamics apart from the specialised training on paediatric neuroanaesthesia. This article highlights on the perioperative management of paediatric neurosurgical patients.
