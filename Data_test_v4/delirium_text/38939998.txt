38939998|t|Comprehensive Review on Alzheimer's Disease: Natural Therapeutics, Gaps and Challenges.
38939998|a|More than 20 million people worldwide have Alzheimer's disease (AD), making it the most prevalent disease. Patients with AD may live for at least a decade after diagnosis, making it the most common cause of disability in the elderly. Each year, 1% to 4% of the population is affected by AD, with prevalence peaking between ages 65 and 70 and declining to 6% among those over 85. Researchers have accumulated evidence on medicinal herbs that may reverse the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with severe memory loss, which can negatively impact social and professional life. The first neurotransmitter linked to Alzheimer's was acetylcholine (ACh). There is no known cure, and the available treatments are ineffective. Multiple studies indicate that Ayurvedic restorative herbs and their constituents may be effective in treating Alzheimer's disease. This technique emphasizes the fact that delaying or preventing Alzheimer's disease with the help of natural bio-actives could reduce the number of cases over the next half-century. To provide detailed information, the pathology and pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease are discussed in the text of this review, along with an overview of the neurotransmitters involved in the progression of the disease. The importance of different natural bioactives for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease is also outlined in the paper. The information contained in this paper can serve as a template for future research expressing the more beneficial role of other bioactive in acting as an adjuvant in the prevention and treatment of this disease, facing certain challenges and gaps with conventional drugs used to treat Alzheimer's disease.
