37612284|a|Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) is genetically determined, but variability in age of symptom onset suggests additional factors may influence cognitive trajectories. Although apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and educational attainment both influence dementia onset in sporadic AD, evidence for these effects in ADAD is limited. To investigate the effects of APOE and educational attainment on age-related cognitive trajectories in ADAD, we analyzed data from 675 Presenilin-1 E280A mutation carriers and 594 non-carriers. Here we show that age-related cognitive decline is accelerated in ADAD mutation carriers who also have an APOE e4 allele compared to those who do not and delayed in mutation carriers who also have an APOE e2 allele compared to those who do not. Educational attainment is protective and moderates the effect of APOE on cognition. Despite ADAD mutation carriers being genetically determined to develop dementia, age-related cognitive decline may be influenced by other genetic and environmental factors.
