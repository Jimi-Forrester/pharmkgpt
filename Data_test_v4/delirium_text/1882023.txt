1882023|a|The charts of 100 delirious patients seen by a psychiatric consultation service were reviewed. The most common chronic medical problems included diabetes and cardiovascular disease, while infections and trauma were the most common acute problems. The most frequent laboratory abnormality was hypoalbuminemia, appearing in 66% of those tested. Hypoalbuminemic patients were more likely to have a combination of medical problems, long hospital stays, and increased mortality, while patients with normal albumin were more likely to have drug toxicities and short hospital stays. While hypoalbuminemia develops because of many physiological processes, the data suggest that more attention should be paid to nutrition and serum transport capability in medical patients.
