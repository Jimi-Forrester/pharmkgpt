The very broad distribution of its severity across various human subjects requires the quantitative diagnose of Alzheimer's disease beyond the conventional tripartite classification of cohorts such as cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD). The unfolding of such broad distributions by the quantitative and continuous degree of AD severity is necessary for the precise diagnose in the cross-sectional study of different stages in AD. RESULTS: We conducted the massive reanalysis on MRI images of 761 human brains based on the accumulated bigdata of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The score matrix of cortical thickness profile at cortex points of subjects was constructed by statistically learning the cortical thickness data of 761 human brains. We also developed a new and simple algebraic predictor which provides the quantitative and continuous degree of AD severity of subjects along the scale from 0 for fully CN to 1 for fully AD state. The mathematical measure of a new predictor for the degree of AD severity is presented based on a covariance correlation matrix of cortical thickness profile between human subjects. One can remove the uncertainty in the determination of different stages in AD by the quantitative degree of AD severity and thus go far beyond the tripartite classification of cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: We unfold the nature of broad distribution of AD severity of subjects even within a given cohort by the scale from 0 for fully CN to 1 for fully AD state. The quantitative and continuous degree of AD severity developed in this study would be a good practical measure for diagnosing the different stages in AD severity.
