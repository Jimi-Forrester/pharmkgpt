39637485|t|Synthesis of novel pyrimidine-based Schiff base complexes: Targeting Amyloid-beta aggregation in Alzheimer's disease.
39637485|a|A novel Schiff base with imine/amine donors, 5-((3,3-diphenylalilidene)amino)pyrimidine-4-amine (L), and its new Platinum(II) and Ruthenium(II) complexes (I and II) were synthesized and characterized using FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, mass spectrometry and elemental analyses. The ability of these complexes to inhibit amyloid beta (Abeta1-42) aggregation was evaluated using the human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y). The complexes effectively inhibited Abeta1-42 aggregation at a 1:1 M ratio. Both complexes increased cell viability up to 80 % at concentrations of 10 muM. At this concentration, the cell viability value found by Abeta1-42 aggregation is around 65 %. Aggregation kinetics were fluorometrically monitored using Thioflavin T. These findings were further supported by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, the interaction of the complexes with Abeta1-16 was investigated using MALDI-TOF/MS and 1H NMR spectroscopy. All findings showed that Abeta1-42 in both complexes is active in the inhibition of amyloid aggregation.
