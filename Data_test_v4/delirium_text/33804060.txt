33804060|t|One Brain-All Cells: A Comprehensive Protocol to Isolate All Principal CNS-Resident Cell Types from Brain and Spinal Cord of Adult Healthy and EAE Mice.
33804060|a|In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis, the role of each central nervous system (CNS)-resident cell type during inflammation, neurodegeneration, and remission has been frequently addressed. Although protocols for the isolation of different individual CNS-resident cell types exist, none can harvest all of them within a single experiment. In addition, isolation of individual cells is more demanding in adult mice and even more so from the inflamed CNS. Here, we present a protocol for the simultaneous purification of viable single-cell suspensions of all principal CNS-resident cell types (microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons) from adult mice-applicable in healthy mice as well as in EAE. After dissociation of the brain and spinal cord from adult mice, microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and, neurons were isolated via magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). Validations comprised flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, as well as functional analyses (immunoassay and Sholl analysis). The purity of each cell isolation averaged 90%. All cells displayed cell-type-specific morphologies and expressed specific surface markers. In conclusion, this new protocol for the simultaneous isolation of all major CNS-resident cell types from one CNS offers a sophisticated and comprehensive way to investigate complex cellular networks ex vivo and simultaneously reduce mice numbers to be sacrificed.
