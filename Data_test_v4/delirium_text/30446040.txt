30446040|a|Surgical treatment of the elderly can be a very difficult and complex endeavor. Appropriate and thorough evaluation of this group of patients is essential to identify surgical candidates who may be at increased risk for developing age-related problems, such as cognitive impairment or postoperative delirium. Involvement of family members and ancillary caregivers is ideal. In order to optimize surgical results, communication of goals of surgery and expectations of patients in order to achieve these goals is paramount. Physical therapy assessment of the elderly will give input on patients' capacity to perform needed changes in ambulatory status after surgery.
