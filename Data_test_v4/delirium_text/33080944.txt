33080944|t|MALDI-MSI-A Step Forward in Overcoming the Diagnostic Challenges in Ovarian Tumors.
33080944|a|This study presents the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) directly on the tissue of two ovarian tumors that often present a diagnostic challenge, a low-grade serous borderline ovarian tumor and ovarian fibrothecoma. Different spatial distribution of m/z values within the tissue samples was observed, and regiospecific peaks were identified. Among the 106 peaks in the borderline ovarian tumor five, regiospecific peaks (m/z: 2861.35; 2775.79; 3368.34; 3438.43; 4936.37) were selected using FlexImaging software. Subsequently, the distribution of those selected peaks was visualized on the fibrothecoma tissue section, which demonstrated the differences in the tissue homo-/heterogeneous structure of both tumors. The comparison with the histopathological staining of the ovarian borderline tumor tissue section, obtained during serial sectioning, showed a close correlation of the molecular map with the morphological and histopathological features of the tissue and allowed the identification of different tissue types within the sample. This study highlights the potential significance of MSI in enabling morphological characterization of ovarian tumors as well as correct diagnosis and further prognosis than thus far seen in the literature. Osteopontin, tropomyosin and orosomucoid are only a couple of the molecules investigated using MALDI-MSI in ovarian cancer research. This study, in line with the available literature, proves the potential of MALDI-MSI to overcome the current limitations of classic histopathological examination giving a more in-depth insight into the tissue structure and thus lead to the more accurate differential diagnosis of ovarian tumors, especially in the most challenging cases.
