1738846|t|Potentially amyloidogenic, carboxyl-terminal derivatives of the amyloid protein precursor.
1738846|a|The 39- to 43-amino acid amyloid beta protein (beta AP), which is deposited as amyloid in Alzheimer's disease, is encoded as an internal peptide that begins 99 residues from the carboxyl terminus of a 695- to 770-amino acid glycoprotein referred to as the amyloid beta protein precursor (beta APP). To clarify the processing that produces amyloid, carboxyl-terminal derivatives of the beta APP were analyzed. This analysis showed that the beta APP is normally processed into a complex set of 8- to 12-kilodalton carboxyl-terminal derivatives. The two largest derivatives in human brain have the entire beta AP at or near their amino terminus and are likely to be intermediates in the pathway leading to amyloid deposition.
