34180415|a|BACKGROUND: Accumulation of iron is a consistent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. The underlying cause, however, remains debatable. OBJECTIVE: To explore whether local hepcidin synthesized by brain cells contributes to iron accumulation in AD brains. METHODS: Brain tissue from the cingulate cortex of 33 cases of AD pre-assigned to Braak stage I-VI, 6 cases of non-dementia, and 15 cases of non-AD dementia were analyzed for transcriptional upregulation of hepcidin by RT-qPCR and RT-PCR. Change in the expression of ferritin, ferroportin (Fpn), microglial activation marker Iba1, IL-6, and TGFbeta2 was determined by western blotting. Total tissue iron was determined by colorimetry. RESULTS: Significant transcriptional upregulation of hepcidin was observed in Braak stage III-VI relative to Braak stage I and II, non-AD dementia, and non-dementia samples. Ferritin was increased in Braak stage V, and a significant increase in tissue iron was evident in Braak stage III-VI. The expression of Iba1 and IL-6 was also increased in Braak stage III-VI relative to Braak stage I and II and non-AD dementia samples. Amyloid-beta plaques were absent in most Braak stage I and II samples, and present in Braak stage III-VI samples with few exceptions. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that upregulation of brain hepcidin is mediated by IL-6, a known transcriptional activator of hepcidin. The consequent downregulation of Fpn on neuronal and other cells results in accumulation of iron in AD brains. The increase in hepcidin is disease-specific, and increases with disease progression, implicating AD-specific pathology in the accumulation of iron.
