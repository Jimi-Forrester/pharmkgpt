27808157|a|Adaptation of the Entamoeba histolytica parasite to toxic levels of nitric oxide (NO) that are produced by phagocytes may be essential for the establishment of chronic amebiasis and the parasite's survival in its host. In order to obtain insight into the mechanism of E. histolytica's adaptation to NO, E. histolytica trophozoites were progressively adapted to increasing concentrations of the NO donor drug, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) up to a concentration of 110 muM. The transcriptome of NO adapted trophozoites (NAT) was investigated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). N-acetyl ornithine deacetylase (NAOD) was among the 208 genes that were upregulated in NAT. NAOD catalyzes the deacetylation of N-acetyl-L-ornithine to yield ornithine and acetate. Here, we report that NAOD contributes to the better adaptation of the parasite to nitrosative stress (NS) and that this function does not depend on NAOD catalytic activity. We also demonstrated that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is detrimental to E. histolytica exposed to NS and that this detrimental effect is neutralized by NAOD or by a catalytically inactive NAOD (mNAOD). These results establish NAOD as a moonlighting protein, and highlight the unexpected role of this metabolic enzyme in the adaptation of the parasite to NS.
