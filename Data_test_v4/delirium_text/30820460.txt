30820460|a|The glymphatic system is responsible for brain-wide delivery of nutrients and clearance of waste via influx of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alongside perivascular spaces and through the brain. Glymphatic system activity increases during sleep or ketamine/xylazine (K/X) anesthesia, yet the mechanism(s) facilitating CSF influx are poorly understood. Here, we correlated influx of a CSF tracer into the brain with electroencephalogram (EEG) power, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate in wild-type mice under six different anesthesia regimens. We found that glymphatic CSF tracer influx was highest under K/X followed by isoflurane (ISO) supplemented with dexmedetomidine and pentobarbital. Mice anesthetized with alpha-chloralose, Avertin, or ISO exhibited low CSF tracer influx. This is the first study to show that glymphatic influx correlates positively with cortical delta power in EEG recordings and negatively with beta power and heart rate.
