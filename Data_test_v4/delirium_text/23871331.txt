23871331|t|Predictors of electroconvulsive therapy postictal delirium.
23871331|a|BACKGROUND: Postictal delirium is a common adverse effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and can be dangerous to both patient and staff caring for them in the postanesthesia care unit. However, little is known about predictors of postictal delirium. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify predictors of postictal delirium. We hypothesized that both patient and ECT treatment variables might influence the likelihood of postictal delirium. METHODS: We prospectively monitored postictal delirium in the postanesthesia care unit using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit after the first ECT treatment of 96 consecutive patients. Patient and treatment variables were extracted retrospectively by chart review. A multiple logistic regression model was developed to assess the effect of these variables on the likelihood of developing delirium. RESULTS: Seizure length was found to be a statistically significant predictor of postictal delirium after adjusting for other covariates (p = 0.003). No other variables were predictive. CONCLUSION: A long ECT seizure increases the likelihood of delirium in the postanesthesia care unit at the first treatment. This finding suggests that postanesthesia care unit staff may benefit from knowledge about seizure length for predicting postictal delirium and anticipating the best management of post-ECT patients.
