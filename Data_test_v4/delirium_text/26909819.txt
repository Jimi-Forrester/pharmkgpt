26909819|t|Cardiovascular Complications of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.
26909819|a|OPINION STATEMENT: Survivors of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are at significant risk for cardiac disease and cardiac complications. While there may be cardiac complications during the acute period of HSCT, long-term survivors remain at risk for cardiovascular disease at a rate at least fourfold higher than the general population. Aggressive screening for cardiac risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and arrhythmias is warranted pretransplant. For those with risk factors, particularly a history of cardiovascular disease or atrial fibrillation, cardiology consultation is warranted in the pretransplantation period. Aggressive screening for cardiac risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia is warranted in HSCT survivors as well; early and aggressive treatment of left ventricular dysfunction is warranted. Collaboration between hematology/oncology and cardiology through a cardio-oncology clinic is an optimal way to help manage these patients.
