34440928|a|Individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are often plagued by debilitating neurocognitive impairments and affective alterations;the pathophysiology underlying these deficits likely includes dopaminergic system dysfunction. The present review utilized four interrelated aims to critically examine the evidence for dopaminergic alterations following HIV-1 viral protein exposure. First, basal dopamine (DA) values are dependent upon both brain region andexperimental approach (i.e., high-performance liquid chromatography, microdialysis or fast-scan cyclic voltammetry). Second, neurochemical measurements overwhelmingly support decreased DA concentrations following chronic HIV-1 viral protein exposure. Neurocognitive impairments, including alterations in pre-attentive processes and attention, as well as apathetic behaviors, provide an additional line of evidence for dopaminergic deficits in HIV-1. Third, to date, there is no compelling evidence that combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the primary treatment regimen for HIV-1 seropositive individuals, has any direct pharmacological action on the dopaminergic system. Fourth, the infection of microglia by HIV-1 viral proteins may mechanistically underlie the dopamine deficit observed following chronic HIV-1 viral protein exposure. An inclusive and critical evaluation of the literature, therefore, supports the fundamental conclusion that long-term HIV-1 viral protein exposure leads to a decreased dopaminergic state, which continues to persist despite the advent of cART. Thus, effective treatment of HIV-1-associated apathy/depression and neurocognitive impairments must focus on strategies for rectifying decreases in dopamine function.
