24179995|a|In chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), the arsenal of biomarkers available to determine the effectiveness of symptomatic treatment is very limited. Interpretation of the results provided in literature is cumbersome and it becomes difficult to predict their standardization to a larger patient population. Indeed, cognitive assessment alone does not appear to have sufficient predictive value of drug efficacy in early clinical development of AD treatment. In recent years, research has contributed to the emergence of new tools to assess brain activity relying on innovative technologies of imaging and electrophysiology. However, the relevance of the use of these newer markers in treatment response assessment is waiting for validation. This review shows how the early clinical assessment of symptomatic drugs could benefit from the inclusion of suitable pharmacodynamic markers. This review also emphasizes the importance of re-evaluating a step-by-step strategy in drug development.
