21757906|a|BACKGROUND: The relationship between different paraoxonase (PON) gene polymorphisms and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was studied several times and the results were controversial. METHODS: We investigated the association of 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the PON1 (M55L; Q192R; -161C/T) and the PON2 (C311S) genes that were shown to affect the risk of sporadic AD. We studied 360 Caucasian cases with late-onset AD and 354 nondemented controls. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the studied PON SNPs and AD risk. The results did not change after stratification of the apolipoprotein E status. Meta-analyses of studies in Caucasians assessing the associations between the PON1 M55L, -161C/T and Q192R SNPs and the risk of AD were performed, and no associations were found. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the studied PON1 and PON2 polymorphisms are not associated with late-onset AD.
