7886816|a|Alzheimer's disease is aetiologically heterogeneous, but the pathogenesis is often considered to be initiated by the deposition of amyloid fibrils, followed by neuritic tau pathology and neuronal death. A variety of inflammatory proteins has been identified in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease post mortem. In this article, Piet Eikelenboom and colleagues review evidence to suggest that the inflammatory processes are intimately involved in several crucial events in the pathological cascade. This suggests possibilities for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease with anti-inflammatory drugs.
