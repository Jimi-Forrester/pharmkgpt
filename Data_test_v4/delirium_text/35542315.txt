35542315|t|Femoral Neck Osteotomy: A Salvage Procedure for Unstable and Locked Acetabulum Fractures in Selected Frail Patients.
35542315|a|Introduction: Purpose of the study is to present and discuss the femoral neck osteotomy as a salvage procedure for unstable, locked geriatric acetabular fractures in selected frail patients. When disadvantages and possible risks of other treatments exceed the benefits, this method may relieve pain and allow for early wheelchair mobilization in frail patients with limited mobility. Materials and Methods: We report nine patients from 2008 to 2020, which were treated with an osteotomy of the femoral neck for an unstable acetabular fracture. Indications, ASA-Score, Frailty Index, operative procedure, length of hospital stay, complications and outcomes will be discussed. Results: Patient's age averaged 86 years (range 81-92). Acetabular fractures were classified as six both column fractures, two anterior column posterior hemitransversal fractures and one destruction of the acetabulum by multiple metastases. Fracture dislocation with medialization plus locking of the femoral head and a superomedial dome impaction were present in all patients. All patients were classified as ASA III/ IV and the average value on the CSHA Frailty index was 7 (range 6-7). The operation time averaged 52 min (range 34-62). Immediate wheelchair mobilization in seven out of nine patients was started postoperatively. Conclusion: The osteotomy of the femoral neck may be discussed as a salvage procedure in low functional demanding, multimorbid, frail geriatric patients with unstable acetabular fractures and impairment of mobilisation due to a locked femoral head. The procedure has the advantages of a short operation time and immediate mobilization of the patients. However, this procedure only applies as a salvage solution in selected individual cases.
