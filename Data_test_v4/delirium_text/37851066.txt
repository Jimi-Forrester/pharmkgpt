37851066|t|The Impact of Age on the Post-operative Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Resection for Oesophageal and Gastric Cancer.
37851066|a|BACKGROUND: Within our ageing population, there is an increasing number of elderly patients presenting with oesophagogastric cancer. Resection remains the mainstay of curative treatment however it has substantial morbidity. The aim of this study was to assess whether age was an independent predictor of resection related complications in our unit. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of prospectively collated data from 2002 to 2020 of patients undergoing resection for oesophageal and gastric cancers was analysed. Patients aged over 75 and 75 and under were compared for peri-operative morbidity (via the Clavien-Dindo classification), length of stay (LOS), unplanned readmission, 30- and 90-day mortality, and use of neoadjuvant therapy. RESULTS: Data for 466 consecutive patients undergoing oesophagogastric resection (277 oesophagectomy and 189 gastrectomy) were available for analysis. 22% of patients were aged over 75 (14% (39/277) of the oesophagectomy cohort, 34% (65/189) of the gastrectomy cohort). Oesophagectomy patients over 75 were more likely to develop post-operative complications, particularly cardiac or thromboembolic, (69.2%) than those in the younger cohort (50.4%, p = 0.029). There was no difference in complication rates between the younger and older patients undergoing gastrectomy (29.0% vs. 33.9% p = 0.495). The 30- and 90-day mortality rates were 1.4% (n = 4) and 2.5% (n = 7), respectively, for the oesophagectomy cohort and 1.1% (n = 2) and 1.6% (n = 3) for the gastrectomy cohort, with no difference between age groups. CONCLUSION: In this series, we found that patients over the age of 75 were able to undergo oesophageal and gastric resection with curative intent with acceptable post-operative morbidity and mortality.
