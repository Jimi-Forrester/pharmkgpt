37009480|t|Sirtuin-3: A potential target for treating several types of brain injury.
37009480|a|Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) is responsible for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis by deacetylating substrates in an NAD+-dependent manner. SIRT3, the primary deacetylase located in the mitochondria, controls cellular energy metabolism and the synthesis of essential biomolecules for cell survival. In recent years, increasing evidence has shown that SIRT3 is involved in several types of acute brain injury. In ischaemic stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, and intracerebral haemorrhage, SIRT3 is closely related to mitochondrial homeostasis and with the mechanisms of pathophysiological processes such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, autophagy, and programmed cell death. As SIRT3 is the driver and regulator of a variety of pathophysiological processes, its molecular regulation is significant. In this paper, we review the role of SIRT3 in various types of brain injury and summarise SIRT3 molecular regulation. Numerous studies have demonstrated that SIRT3 plays a protective role in various types of brain injury. Here, we present the current research available on SIRT3 as a target for treating ischaemic stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, thus highlighting the therapeutic potential of SIRT3 as a potent mediator of catastrophic brain injury. In addition, we have summarised the therapeutic drugs, compounds, natural extracts, peptides, physical stimuli, and other small molecules that may regulate SIRT3 to uncover additional brain-protective mechanisms of SIRT3, conduct further research, and provide more evidence for clinical transformation and drug development.
