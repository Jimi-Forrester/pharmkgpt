37452053|a|The associations between particulate matter (PM) and overall and specific mental disorders (MDs) are investigated using data from two general hospitals in Shijiazhuang, China, from January 2014 to December 2019. A longitudinal time series study, as one type of ecological study, is conducted using a generalized additive model to examine the relationship between short-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10, and daily hospital admissions for MDs, and further stratification by subtypes, age, and gender. A total of 10,709 cases of hospital admissions for MDs have been identified. The significant short-time effects of PM2.5 on overall MDs at lag01 and PM10 at lag05 are observed, respectively. For specific mental disorders, there are substantial associations of PM pollution with mood disorders and organic mental disorders. PM2.5 has the greatest cumulative effect on daily admissions of mood disorders and organic mental disorders in lag01, and PM 10 has the greatest cumulative effect in lag05. Moreover, the effect modification by sex or age is statistically significant, with males and the elderly (>= 45 years) having a stronger effect. Short-term exposure to PM2.5 and PM10can be associated with an increased risk of daily hospital admissions for MDs.
