35186238|a|BACKGROUND: For evaluating pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block's analgesic effect on elderly patients suffering from femoral neck fracture undergoing hip arthroplasty to provide a basis for optimizing perioperative analgesia in hip arthroplasty. METHODS: Forty-eight patients undergoing hip arthroplasty with spinal anesthesia for femoral neck fracture in our hospital were chosen in this study. Based on the random number table method, patients were categorized into the following two groups (n = 24 per group): the hip peripheral nerve group block group (PE group) and the iliac fascia block group (FI group). The fascia iliaca compartment block was used in the FI group, whereas the pericapsular nerve group block in the PE group. When placed in the position for spinal anesthesia (T4), we measured dynamic and static visual analog scale (VAS) scores as well as analgesic satisfaction before blockade (T0), along with at 10 min (T1), 20 min (T2), and 30 min postblockade (T3). Sufentanil dosage and effective analgesic pump press number at 6 h (T5), 12 h (T6), 24 h (T7), and 48 h (T8) postoperatively were recorded. In the meantime, the development of related complications was also recorded. RESULTS: Compared with T0, patients in both groups achieved lower static VAS scores at T1-T4 (P < 0.05) and lower dynamic VAS scores at T2-T4 of the FI group (P < 0.05). Relative to the FI group, both static and dynamic VAS scores at T1-T4 were obviously lower in the PE group (P < 0.05), along with increased dynamic analgesic satisfaction (P < 0.05). Weakness of the quadriceps was observed in seven patients in the FI groups (P < 0.05). No delirium, hematoma, puncture site infection, or nerve injury occurred in either group. CONCLUSION: The pericapsular nerve group block can provide safe and effective analgesia for elderly patients during the perioperative period of hip arthroplasty, with rapid onset, good analgesic effect, high patient satisfaction, and low complication rate, and is worthy of widespread application. The trial is registered with ChiCTR2100046785.
