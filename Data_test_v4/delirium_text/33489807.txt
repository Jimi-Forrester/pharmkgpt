33489807|a|Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the malignant cancers of lung tumors, and hyponatremia, defined as serum sodium concentration (Na+) lower than 135 mmol/L, is the most common complication of solid tumors, with an incidence of up to 18.9% and a negative impact on quality of life in SCLC. As a prognostic index of SCLC, timely monitoring and correcting of hyponatremia is of great clinical significance for prolonging the survival period of patients. In the explore of new drugs for small cell lung cancer, it is necessary to include hyponatremia as an evaluation index in clinical studies. As the occurrence of hyponatremia is sometimes unavoidable owing to SCLC specific neurological characteristics, early monitoring to detect the presence of hyponatremia and timely correction are helpful to improve the prognosis of patients. There are many predisposing factors for hyponatremia, including heterotopia of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), use of platinum-based chemotherapy drugs, and intracranial metastasis, among others. Patients with small cell lung cancer are usually asymptomatic in the early stage, while it is of great significance to find a suitable clinical index to judge whether it is a malignant inducement or not. In the clinical setting, due to different electrolyte levels and therapeutic scheduling for the primary disease, an individualized plan is often made, mainly comprising water restriction, infusion, and medications. This review includes related clinical studies and describes the common symptoms and predisposing factors of hyponatremia in patients with SCLC, and their impact on quality of life and prognosis.
