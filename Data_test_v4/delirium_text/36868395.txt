36868395|t|Risk factor associations with individual myocardial infarction subtypes and acute non-ischemic myocardial injury in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA): Design and rationale.
36868395|a|BACKGROUND: Despite different prevalence, pathobiology, and prognosis between etiologically distinct myocardial infarction (MI) subtypes, prospective study of risk factor for MI in large NHLBI-sponsored cardiovascular cohorts is limited to acute MI as a singular entity. Therefore, we sought to utilize the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large prospective primary prevention cardiovascular study, to define the incidence and risk factor profile of individual myocardial injury subtypes. METHODS: We describe the rationale and design of re-adjudicating 4,080 events that occurred over the first 14 years of follow-up in MESA for the presence and subtype of myocardial injury as defined by the Fourth Universal Definition of MI: MI type 1 to 5, acute non-ischemic myocardial injury, and chronic myocardial injury. The project utilizes a 2-physician adjudication process via examination of medical records, abstracted data collection forms, cardiac biomarker results, and electrocardiograms of all relevant clinical events. Comparison of the magnitude and direction of associations between baseline traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors with incident and recurrent acute MI subtypes and acute non-ischemic myocardial injury events will be made. CONCLUSIONS: This project will result in one of the first large prospective cardiovascular cohort with modern classification of acute MI subtypes, as well as a full accounting of non-ischemic myocardial injury events, with implications for numerous ongoing and future studies in MESA. By creating precise MI phenotypes, and defining their epidemiology, this project will allow for discovery of novel pathobiology-specific risk factors, allow for development of more accurate risk prediction, and suggest more targeted preventive strategies.
