38275188|a|Clinical improvement following neurosurgical cerebrospinal fluid shunting for presumed idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus is variable. Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients may have undetected Alzheimer's disease-related cortical pathology that confounds diagnosis and clinical outcomes. In this study, we sought to determine the utility of cortical tissue immuno-analysis in predicting shunting outcomes in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients. We performed a pooled analysis using a systematic review as well as analysis of a new, original patient cohort. Of the 2707 screened studies, 3 studies with a total of 229 idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients were selected for inclusion in this meta-analysis alongside our original cohort. Pooled statistics of shunting outcomes for the 229 idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients and our new cohort of 36 idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients revealed that patients with Abeta + pathology were significantly more likely to exhibit shunt nonresponsiveness than patients with negative pathology. Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus patients with Alzheimer's disease -related cortical pathology may be at a higher risk of treatment facing unfavorable outcomes following cerebrospinal fluid shunting. Thus, cortical tissue analysis from living patients may be a useful diagnostic and prognostic adjunct for patients with presumed idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus and potentially other neurodegenerative conditions affecting the cerebral cortex.
