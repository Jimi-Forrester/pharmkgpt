38809370|a|Changes in the transition metal homeostasis in the brain are closely linked with Alzheimer's disease (AD), including intraneuronal iron accumulation and extracellular copper and zinc pooling in the amyloid plague. The brain copper, zinc, and iron surplus are commonly acknowledged characteristics of AD, despite disagreements among some. This has led to the theory that oxidative stress resulting from abnormal homeostasis of these transition metals may be a causative explanation behind AD. In the nervous system, the interaction of metals with proteins appears to be an essential variable in the development or suppression of neurodegeneration. Chelation treatment may be an option for treating neurodegeneration induced by transition metal ion dyshomeostasis. Some clinicians even recommend using chelating agents as an adjunct therapy for AD. The current review also looks at the therapeutic strategies that have been attempted, primarily with metal-chelating drugs. Metal buildup in the nervous system, as reported in the AD, could be the result of compensatory mechanisms designed to improve metal availability for physiological functions.
