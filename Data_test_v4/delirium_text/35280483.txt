35280483|a|Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic, highly prevalent, multi-system and sleep disorder, which may contribute to cognitive impairment and a variety of structural and neurophysiologic changes. The focus on OSA is warranted given its recognized links with major psychiatric and neurologic disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Some preliminary studies suggest a dual effect of the inflammatory response in OSA. Neuroinflammation may present with initial, potentially adaptive and homeostatic, and later, a more distinctly maladaptive, precipitating and perpetuating role. Objective: We here propose and argue in favour of the inflammatory process in the brain as a likely binding mechanism behind at least some effects that OSA may have on the brain and its function. Several OSA-triggered molecular and cellular events, that could lead to a neurodegenerative cascade, are similarly discussed. Methods: This perspective reviews the body of literature that investigates potential links between the inflammatory processes in the brain and the OSA. A special emphasis is placed on a potential role for neuroplastin, a novel transmembrane synaptic protein involved in the neuroplasticity and known to be differentially regulated in the OSA. Conclusions: The intricate interplay between neuroinflammation and other mechanistic correlates of OSA add to the evidence that neuroinflammation may be a key target for future therapeutic strategies in a number of comorbid disorders. The future studies will need to answer whether it is sleep fragmentation (SF) or intermittent hypoxia (IH) which may drive any such neuroinflammation.
