39825548|t|Pattern of Referral of Patients with COVID-19 for Psychiatric Consultation: Experience at a Multidisciplinary Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan.
39825548|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine referral patterns for psychiatric consultations among COVID-19 patients encompassing both the in-patient and Emergency Department of a multidisciplinary hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review. Place and Duration of the Study: The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan, from March 2020 to December 2021. METHODOLOGY: The research team collected pertinent information from medical records using a standardised proforma, which encompassed data from physicians' notes, nurses' notes, assessment forms, and discharge summaries. The data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: This study examined 233 psychiatric referrals, with 67% male patients (n = 156) and 57.1% (n = 133) aged above 60 years. The primary psychiatric diagnosis was delirium (47.1%, n = 105), followed by adjustment disorders (10.8%, n = 27) and mood disorders (11.7%, n = 25). The main symptoms leading to consultation were agitation/confusion (45%, n = 106) and psychotropic adjustment (18%, n = 41). Clinical outcomes, including mortality, were associated with agitation/confusion (p = 0.001), delirium (p = 0.001), older age (p = 0.003), and longer length of stay (p = 0.001). Patients aged 61 years and above exhibited frequent agitation/confusion (p = 0.002) and delirium (p = 0.001). Longer stays correlated with agitation/confusion (p = 0.022), and a one-month hospital stay showed an association with delirium (p = 0.050). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the crucial role of consultation-liaison psychiatric services in addressing the psychological issues in COVID-19 patients. The significance of delirium and its high mortality risk underscores the need for focused research and integration of mental health care into pandemic responses for comprehensive patient care.
