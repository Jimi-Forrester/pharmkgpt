19450264|t|Unique aspects of transcriptional regulation in neurons--nuances in NFkappaB and Sp1-related factors.
19450264|a|The unique physiology and function of neurons create differences in their cellular physiology, including their regulation of gene expression. We began several years ago exploring the relationships between the NFkappaB transcription factor, neuronal survival, and glutamate receptor activation in telencephalic neurons. These studies led us to conclude that this population of cells is nearly incapable of activating the NFkappaB that is nonetheless expressed at reasonable levels. A subset of the kappaB cis elements are instead bound by members of the Sp1 family in neurons. Also surprising was our discovery that Sp1 itself, typically described as ubiquitous, is severely restricted in expression within forebrain neurons; Sp4 seems to be substituted during neuronal differentiation. These findings and their implications for neuronal differentiation--as well as potential dedifferentiation during degenerative processes--are discussed here.
