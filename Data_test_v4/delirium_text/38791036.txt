38791036|t|Insights into Calpain Activation and Rho-ROCK Signaling in Parkinson's Disease and Aging.
38791036|a|Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease, has no cure, and current therapies are not effective at halting disease progression. The disease affects mid-brain dopaminergic neurons and, subsequently, the spinal cord, contributing to many debilitating symptoms associated with PD. The GTP-binding protein, Rho, plays a significant role in the cellular pathology of PD. The downstream effector of Rho, Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), plays multiple functions, including microglial activation and induction of inflammatory responses. Activated microglia have been implicated in the pathology of many neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, that initiate inflammatory responses, leading to neuron death. Calpain expression and activity is increased following glial activation, which triggers the Rho-ROCK pathway and induces inflammatory T cell activation and migration as well as mediates toxic alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) aggregation and neuron death, indicating a pivotal role for calpain in the inflammatory and degenerative processes in PD. Increased calpain activity and Rho-ROCK activation may represent a new mechanism for increased oxidative damage in aging. This review will summarize calpain activation and the role of the Rho-ROCK pathway in oxidative stress and alpha-syn aggregation, their influence on the neurodegenerative process in PD and aging, and possible strategies and research directions for therapeutic intervention.
