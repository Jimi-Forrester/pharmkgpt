35665873|a|BACKGROUND: Melatonin is an indole hormone secreted primarily by the pineal gland that showing anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic capacity. It can play an important role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of various diseases. In this regard, different studies have shown that there is a relationship between Melatonin and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the Central Nervous System. AIM: The objective of this review was to evaluate the mechanisms of action of melatonin on oxidative stress, inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis caused by MS, as well as its interaction with different hormones and factors that can influence the pathophysiology of the disease. RESULTS: Melatonin causes a significant increase in the levels of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione and can counteract and inhibit the effects of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which would also be beneficial during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, melatonin increases antimicrobial peptides, especially Reg3beta, which could be useful in controlling the microbiota. CONCLUSION: Melatonin could exert a beneficial effect in people suffering from MS, running as a promising candidate for the treatment of this disease. However, more research in human is needed to help understand the possible interaction between melatonin and certain sex hormones, such as estrogens, to know the potential therapeutic efficacy in both men and women.
