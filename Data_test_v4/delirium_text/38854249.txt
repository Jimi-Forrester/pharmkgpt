38854249|a|Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy is one of the most unprecedented advancements in the treatment of hematological malignancies, especially B-cell malignancies. The fundamental notion behind the success of this therapy is to generate a synthetic protein (CAR) capable of redirecting T lymphocytes to act against cancer cells. New insights into the genetic and molecular base of hematological malignancies have more recently given rise to the development of targeted treatments. CAR T-cell therapy is one of these immunological treatment techniques that has recently received a lot of attention and paved a light of hope for the effective cure of relapsed and refractory hematological malignancies and some solid malignancies. Researchers of today might not know what the future holds for CAR T-cell therapy, but from whatever research has been done so far, this therapy has proven to be a success despite its limitations, and it can be assumed that the spectrum of its application is expanding with each passing day.
