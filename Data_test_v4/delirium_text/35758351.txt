35758351|t|Risk of developing cognitive impairment on patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A systematic review.
35758351|a|BACKGROUND: The increasing number of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) incidence has led to a great negative impact on older people's lives. This chronic disease was a critical and independent risk factor for cognitive function impairment in the elderly with mild cognitive impairment as a frequent feature. This systematic review aimed to examine the risk of developing cognitive impairment in COPD. METHODS: A structured search of the literature was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement guideline, with a pre-determined search strategy starting from study identification, title and abstract screening, eligibility assessment, and inclusion of relevant study. The search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE via EBSCOhost, with restriction to human studies. The studies from inception until January 12, 2021. RESULTS: Five original articles were included. Most studies found that patients with COPD had a higher chance of developing cognitive impairment, especially when patients were followed up for more than 5 years. We discovered that the risk of cognitive impairment seemed to be correlated with the length of time spent following the participants, with the highest risk of cognitive impairment being identified in those who had the longest observation period. It is critical to conduct cognitive screening from the time a diagnosis of COPD is obtained and on a continuing basis in order to recognize and treat these individuals appropriately. CONCLUSION: There is a potential association between COPD and mild cognitive impairment. We encourage more studies to be done with higher sensitivity and specificity cognitive screening tools in the future to build better evidence and qualify to be analyzed quantitatively with meta-analysis.
