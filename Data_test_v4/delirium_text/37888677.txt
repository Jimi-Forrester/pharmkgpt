37888677|a|This study investigated the effect of Rosmarinus officinalis L. (RO) extract on neurobehavioral and neurobiological changes in male rats with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced epilepsy. Rats were assigned into five groups: (1) control rats, (2) RO-treated rats, (3) PTZ-treated rats, (4) PTZ + RO-treated rats, and (5) PTZ + valproic acid (VA)-treated rats. The PTZ-treated rats required a significantly longer time and distance to find the platform in the Morris water maze test than the control and RO-treated rats. Additionally, PTZ-treated rats showed a decrease in tendency to cross over the platform compared to PTZ group. PTZ + RO-treated rats showed decreased swimming time and distance to find the platform compared to PTZ group. PTZ + RO-treated rats showed a significant decrease in seizure score, a reduced number of myoclonic jerks, and an increased onset of the first myoclonic jerk compared to PTZ group. PTZ reduced the time required to enter the dark room in the passive avoidance learning test, which was reversed by RO treatment. Biochemical results revealed that PTZ-treated rats had higher levels of oxidative stress markers. RO significantly increased the antioxidant markers levels and maintained normal rat brain histology. This study revealed that RO can shield the brain and neural tissues from PTZ.
