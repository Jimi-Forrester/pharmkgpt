37371132|t|Oleic Acid Status Positively Correlates with the Soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-Products (sRAGE) in Healthy Adults Who Are Homozygous for G Allele of RAGE G82S Polymorphism.
37371132|a|BACKGROUND: The soluble form of receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) have been implicated in the prevention of numerous pathologic states, and highlights as an attractive therapeutic target. Because diets rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) reduce postprandial oxidative stress and inflammation that is related to better health during aging, we investigated the association between red blood cell (RBC) fatty acids with circulatory AGE biomarkers and further stratified this correlation based on GG and GA + AA genotype. METHODS: A total of 172 healthy participants (median age = 53.74 +- 0.61 years) were recruited for the study. RBC fatty acid was analysed using gas chromatography and sRAGE was measured using a commercial ELISA kit. RESULTS: The result showed a non-significant correlation between total MUFA with sRAGE however oleic acid (C18:1) exhibited a positive correlation (r = 0.178, p = 0.01) that remained statistically significant (beta = 0.178, p = 0.02) after a stepwise multivariate regression analysis after adjusting for age, BMI and gender. In a univariate analysis, a positive significant correlation between C18:1 and sRAGE in GG genotype (r = 0.169, p = 0.02) and a non-significant correlation with GA + AA genotype (r = 0.192, p = 0.21) was evident. When C18:1 was stratified, a significant difference was observed for oleic acid and G82S polymorphism: low C18:1/GA + AA versus high C18:1/GG (p = 0.015) and high C18:1/GA + AA versus high C18:1/GG (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that increased levels of C18:1 may be a potential therapeutic approach in increasing sRAGE in those with GG genotype and play a role in modulating AGE metabolism.
