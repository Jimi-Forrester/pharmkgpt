36833283|t|Study on the Association between LRRC8B Gene InDel and Sheep Body Conformation Traits.
36833283|a|Marker-assisted selection is an important method for livestock breeding. In recent years, this technology has been gradually applied to livestock breeding to improve the body conformation traits. In this study, the LRRC8B (Leucine Rich Repeat Containing 8 VRAC Subunit B) gene was selected to evaluate the association between its genetic variations and the body conformation traits in two native sheep breeds in China. Four body conformation traits, including withers height, body length, chest circumference, and body weight, were collected from 269 Chaka sheep. We also collected the body length, chest width, withers height, chest depth, chest circumference, cannon bone circumference, and height at hip cross of 149 Small-Tailed Han sheep. Two different genotypes, ID and DD, were detected in all sheep. Our data showed that the polymorphism of the LRRC8B gene was significantly associated with chest depth (p < 0.05) in Small-Tailed Han sheep, and it is greater in sheep with DD than those with ID. In conclusion, our data suggested that the LRRC8B gene could serve as a candidate gene for marker-assisted selection in Small-Tailed Han sheep.
