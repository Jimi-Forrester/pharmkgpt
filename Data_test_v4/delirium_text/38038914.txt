38038914|a|Neurodegenerative disorders are a debilitating and persistent threat to the global elderly population, carrying grim outcomes. Their genesis is often multifactorial, with a history of prior exposure to xenobiotics such as pesticides, heavy metals, enviornmental pollutants, ionizing radiation etc,. A holistic molecular insight into their mechanistic induction upon single or combinatorial exposure to different toxicants is still unclear. In the present study, one-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were administered orally with malathion (50 mg/kg body wt. for 14 days) and single whole-body radiation (0.5 Gy) on the 8th day. Post-treatment, behavioural assays for exploratory behaviour, memory, and learning were performed. After sacrifice, brains were collected for histology, biochemical assays, and transcriptomic analysis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed several altered processes like synaptic transmission and plasticity, neuronal survival, proliferation, and death. Signalling pathways like MAPK, PI3K-Akt, Apelin, NF-kappaB, cAMP, Notch etc., and pathways related to neurodegenerative diseases were altered. Increased astrogliosis was observed in the radiation and coexposure groups, with significant neuronal cell death and a reduction in the expression of NeuN. Sholl analysis, dendritic arborization and spine density studies revealed decreased total apical neuronal path length and dendritic spine density. Reduced levels of the antioxidants GST and GSH and acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity were also detected. However, no changes were seen in exploratory behaviour or learning and memory post-treatment. Thus, explicating the molecular mechanisms behind malathion and radiation can provide novel insights into external factor-driven neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative pathogenesis.
