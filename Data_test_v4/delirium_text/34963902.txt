34963902|a|Introduction: Hyperleukocytosis, an infrequent presentation of new-onset leukemia, is a medical emergency requiring prompt recognition and treatment. It can include altered mental status, fever, critical electrolyte derangements, and coagulopathies. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this simulation was created as a telesimulation in order to adhere to mandatory physical distancing guidelines while addressing learning objectives. Methods: This simulation was designed for pediatric emergency medicine fellows and featured a pediatric patient presenting with fever, altered mental status, and respiratory distress. After an initial assessment and appropriate workup, the patient developed tumor lysis syndrome, coagulopathies, and new-onset neurologic changes requiring appropriate interventions. A debriefing guide and participant evaluation form were utilized. Results: This telesimulation was implemented at five different institutions, with evaluation surveys completed by 22 pediatric emergency medicine fellows. The scenario was rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree) and was generally well received, with participants rating the simulation as effective in teaching the recognition (M = 4.8) and management (M = 4.6) of hyperleukocytosis. Participants felt that virtual telesimulation was effective compared to other distance learning methods (M = 3.9). Discussion: This simulation-based curriculum allows learners to practice identifying and managing hyperleukocytosis. We found that it was well received in both in-person and virtual formats.
