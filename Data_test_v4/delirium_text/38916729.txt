38916729|t|Tryptophan Metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease with the Involvement of Microglia and Astrocyte Crosstalk and Gut-Brain Axis.
38916729|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disease characterized by extracellular Amyloid Abeta peptide (Abeta) deposition and intracellular Tau protein aggregation. Glia, especially microglia and astrocytes are core participants during the progression of AD and these cells are the mediators of Abeta clearance and degradation. The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) is a complex interactive network between the gut and brain involved in neurodegeneration. MGBA affects the function of glia in the central nervous system (CNS), and microbial metabolites regulate the communication between astrocytes and microglia; however, whether such communication is part of AD pathophysiology remains unknown. One of the potential links in bilateral gut-brain communication is tryptophan (Trp) metabolism. The microbiota-originated Trp and its metabolites enter the CNS to control microglial activation, and the activated microglia subsequently affect astrocyte functions. The present review highlights the role of MGBA in AD pathology, especially the roles of Trp per se and its metabolism as a part of the gut microbiota and brain communications. We (i) discuss the roles of Trp derivatives in microglia-astrocyte crosstalk from a bioinformatics perspective, (ii) describe the role of glia polarization in the microglia-astrocyte crosstalk and AD pathology, and (iii) summarize the potential of Trp metabolism as a therapeutic target. Finally, we review the role of Trp in AD from the perspective of the gut-brain axis and microglia, as well as astrocyte crosstalk, to inspire the discovery of novel AD therapeutics.
