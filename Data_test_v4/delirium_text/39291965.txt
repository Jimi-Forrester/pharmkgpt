39291965|a|OBJECTIVE: Hypertension is a major risk factor for dementia, but sustained blood pressure control is difficult to achieve. We evaluated whether inadequately controlled hypertension may contribute to excess dementia risk among people with HIV. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: We studied demographically matched people with and without HIV between 7/1/2013 and 12/31/2021 who were >=50 years old and had a hypertension diagnosis but no dementia diagnosis. Hypertension control was calculated using a disease management index (DMI) which captured degree and duration above the hypertension treatment goals of systolic blood pressure (SBP) <140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) <90 mmHg. DMI values ranged from 0% to 100% (perfect control); hypertension was considered "inadequately controlled" if DMI<80% (i.e., in control for <80% of the time). Annual, time-updated DMI was calculated for SBP and DBP. Associations of SPB and DPB control with incident dementia were evaluated using extended Cox regression models. RESULTS: The study included 3,099 hypertensive people with HIV (mean age: 58.3 years, 90.2% men) and 66,016 people without HIV. Each year of inadequate SBP control was associated with greater dementia risk in both people with HIV (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.26, 0.92-1.64) and people without HIV (aHR = 1.27 (1.21-1.33); p-interaction = 0.85). Similarly, inadequate DBP control was associated with greater dementia risk in both people with HIV (aHR = 1.43, 0.90-1.95) and people without HIV (aHR = 1.71, 1.50-1.93; p-interaction = 0.57). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest the association of inadequate hypertension control with greater dementia risk is similar by HIV status. Stronger associations of DBP control with dementia merits further investigation.
