36926568|a|Developing stabilizers that protect proteins from denaturation under stress, and are easy to remove from solutions, is a challenge in protein therapeutics. In this study, micelles made of trehalose, a zwitterionic polymer (poly-sulfobetaine; poly-SPB), and polycaprolactone (PCL) were synthesized by a one-pot reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization reaction. The micelles protect lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and human insulin from denaturation due to stresses like thermal incubation and freezing, and help them retain higher-order structures. Importantly, the protected proteins are readily isolated from the micelles by ultracentrifugation, with over 90% recovery, and almost all enzymatic activity is retained. This suggests the great potential of poly-SPB-based micelles for use in applications requiring protection and removal as required. The micelles may also be used to effectively stabilize protein-based vaccines and drugs.
