32481833|t|N-Acetyl-l-cysteine capped quantum dots offer neuronal cell protection by inhibiting beta (1-40) amyloid fibrillation.
32481833|a|This is the first work that revealed the neuro-protective effect of functionalized quantum dots against the cytotoxicity induced by beta-amyloid peptides. This study gives insight into the future treatment of Alzheimer's disease. It opens many avenues for the development of the next generation nanotechnology for biomedical and therapeutic applications.
