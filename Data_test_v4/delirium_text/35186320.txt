35186320|a|INTRODUCTION: More than half of persons with dementia will experience night-time wandering, increasing their risk of falls and unattended home exits. This is a major predictor of caregiver burnout and one of the major causes of early institutionalization. METHODS: Using smart home technologies such as sensors, smart bulbs, pressure mats and speakers, the Night-time Wandering Detection and Diversion system is designed to assist caregivers and persons with dementia that are at risk of wandering at night. Being placed in homes around Ottawa for a 12-week trial, the system allows caregivers to rest peacefully in the night, as it detects when the person with dementia gets out of bed and automatically provides cue lighting to guide them safely to the washroom. The system also uses prerecorded audio prompts, if they venture from the bedroom, only waking the caregiver when the person with dementia opens an exit door. RESULTS: Thus far, the average depression and anxiety in caregivers have been improved after the 12 weeks, and most have said that they sleep more peacefully. CONCLUSION: The system has proven successful in supporting the safety of persons with dementia as well as their caregivers.
