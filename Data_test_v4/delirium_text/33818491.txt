33818491|a|Corticotropin-releasing hormone is a critical component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which plays a major role in the body's immune response to stress. Mast cells are both sensors and effectors in the interaction between the nervous and immune systems. As first responders to stress, mast cells can initiate, amplify and prolong neuroimmune responses upon activation. Corticotropin-releasing hormone plays a pivotal role in triggering stress responses and related diseases by acting on its receptors in mast cells. Corticotropin-releasing hormone can stimulate mast cell activation, influence the activation of immune cells by peripheral nerves and modulate neuroimmune interactions. The latest evidence shows that the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone induces the degranulation of mast cells under stress conditions, leading to disruption of the blood-brain barrier, which plays an important role in neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent studies suggest that stress increases intestinal permeability and disrupts the blood-brain barrier through corticotropin-releasing hormone-mediated activation of mast cells, providing new insight into the complex interplay between the brain and gastrointestinal tract. The neuroimmune target of mast cells is the site at which the corticotropin-releasing hormone directly participates in the inflammatory responses of nerve terminals. In this review, we focus on the neuroimmune connections between corticotropin-releasing hormone and mast cells, with the aim of providing novel potential therapeutic targets for inflammatory, autoimmune and nervous system diseases.
