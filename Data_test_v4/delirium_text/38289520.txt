38289520|t|miR-34a/TAN1/CREB Axis Engages in Alleviating Oligodendrocyte Trophic Factor-Induced Myelin Repair Function and Astrocyte-Dependent Neuroinflammation in the Early Stages of Alzheimer's Disease: The Anti-Neurodegenerative Effect of Treadmill Exercise.
38289520|a|Reduced myelin stability observed in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease leads to spatial learning and memory impairment. Exercise has been shown to protect nerves, reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease, and strengthen synaptic connectivity. However, the underlying mechanisms of how exercise can promote myelin repair and coordinate inflammation and proliferation are still uncertain. In this study, we conducted histological and biochemical assays of cortical lysates after behavioral testing to detect pathological changes, myelin sheath thickness, and mRNA and protein levels. It is notable that D-galactose model mice exhibited elevated miRNA-34a levels, overactive astrocytes, decreased myelin staining scores, increased apoptosis, and decreased synaptic plasticity in the brain. Significantly, after eight weeks of exercise, we observed improvements in LFB scores, NeuN( +) neuron counts, and myelin basic protein (MBP) expression. Additionally, exercise promoted the expression of oligodendrocyte markers Olig2 and PDFGR-alpha associated with brain proliferation, and improved spatial cognitive function. Furthermore, it decreased the inflammation caused by astrocyte secretions (TNF-alpha, Cox-2, CXCL2). Interestingly, we also observed downregulation of miR-34a and activation of the TAN1/PI3K/CREB signaling pathway. Our data shed light on a previously unsuspected mechanism by which exercise reduces miR-34a levels and protects neuronal function and survival by preventing excessive demyelination and inflammatory infiltration in the CNS.
