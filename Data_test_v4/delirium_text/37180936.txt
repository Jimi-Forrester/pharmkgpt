37180936|a|An increasing population of people, especially young adults who exercise, consume high protein diets along with carbonated drinks. While there are numerous studies on the effect of high protein diets, there is a need to understand how protein diets in combination with carbonated drinks impact physiology. In order to assess these effects on wistar rats' phenotype, antioxidants and inflammatory profiles, 64 wistar rats were divided into dietary groups of 8 male and 8 female animals each. The animals were fed standard diet as control (chow), chow and carbonated soda, a high protein diet (48.1% energy from protein) and a high protein diet with carbonated soda according to their groups. Body measurements, blood glucose levels, serum insulin levels, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant activity, adipokines and inflammatory markers concentrations were all determined. At the end of the study, body measurements, inflammatory markers and adipokine concentration were increased in animals fed the high protein diet and high protein-soda diet. There was a decrease in antioxidant and lipid peroxidation levels in protein fed male and female animals but those fed protein in combination with soda had increased lipid peroxidation levels. In conclusion, high protein diet in combination with carbonated soda impacts physiology differently from a high protein diet alone, and may stimulate weight gain, oxidative stress and HPD-related inflammation in Wistar rats.
