28002825|t|From Common to Rare Variants: The Genetic Component of Alzheimer Disease.
28002825|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a remarkable example of genetic heterogeneity. Extremely rare variants in the APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 genes, or duplications of the APP gene cause autosomal dominant forms, generally with complete penetrance by the age of 65 years. Nonautosomal dominant forms are considered as a complex disorder with a high genetic component, whatever the age of onset. Although genetically heterogeneous, AD is defined by the same neuropathological criteria in all configurations. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the Abeta peptide, which aggregates in AD brains, is a key player. APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 gene mutations increase the production of more aggregation-prone forms of the Abeta peptide, triggering the pathological process. Several risk factors identified in association studies hit genes involved in Abeta production/secretion, aggregation, clearance, or toxicity. Among them, the APOE epsilon4 allele is a rare example of a common allele with a large effect size, the ORs ranging from 4 to 11-14 for heterozygous and homozygous carriers, respectively. In addition, genome-wide association studies have identified more than two dozen loci with a weak but significant association, the OR of the at-risk allele ranging from 1.08 to 1.30. Recently, the use of massive parallel sequencing has enabled the analysis of rare variants in a genome-wide manner. Two rare variants have been nominally associated with AD risk or protection (TREM2 p.R47H, MAF approximately 0.002, OR approximately 4 and APP p.A673T, MAF approximately 0.0005, OR approximately 0.2). Association analyses at the gene level identified rare loss-of-function and missense, predicted damaging, variants (MAF <0.01) in the SORL1 and ABCA7 genes associated with a moderate relative risk (OR approximately 5 and approximately 2.8, respectively). Although the latter analyses revealed association signals with moderately rare variants by collapsing them, the power to detect genes hit by extremely rare variants is still limited. An alternative approach is to consider the de novo paradigm, stating that de novo variants may contribute to AD genetics in sporadic patients. Here, we critically review AD genetics reports with a special focus on rare variants.
