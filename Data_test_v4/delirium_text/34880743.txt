34880743|a|Background: Early and affordable identification of subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) who will convert to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major scientific challenge. Objective: To investigate the neurophysiological hallmarks of sensorimotor cortex function in aMCI under the hypothesis that some may represent the plastic rearrangements induced by neurodegeneration, hence predictors of future conversion to AD. We sought to determine (1) whether the sensorimotor network shows peculiar alterations in patients with aMCI and (2) if sensorimotor network alterations predict long-term disease progression at the individual level. Methods: We studied several transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters of the sensorimotor cortex in a group of patients with aMCI and followed them for 6 years. We then identified aMCI who clinically converted to AD [prodromal to AD-MCI (pAD-MCI)] and those who remained cognitively stable [non-prodromal to AD-MCI (npAD-MCI)]. Results: Patients with aMCI showed reduced motor cortex (M1) excitability and disrupted EEG synchronization [decreased intertrial coherence (ITC)] in alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands compared to the control subjects. The degree of alteration in M1 excitability and alpha ITC was comparable between pAD-MCI and npAD-MCI. Importantly, beta and gamma ITC impairment in the stimulated M1 was greater in pAD-MCI than npAD-MCI. Furthermore, an additional parameter related to the waveform shape of scalp signals, reflecting time-specific alterations in global TMS-induced activity [stability of the dipolar activity (sDA)], discriminated npAD-MCI from MCI who will convert to AD. Discussion: The above mentioned specific cortical changes, reflecting deficit of synchronization within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop in aMCI, may reflect the pathological processes underlying AD. These changes could be tested in larger cohorts as neurophysiological biomarkers of AD.
