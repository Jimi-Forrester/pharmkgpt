28934304|a|OBJECTIVE: Accumulated data suggests that cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) play an important role in the decline of cognitive function, but the results remain inconsistent. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the association between CMBs and cognitive function, as well as the various effects of CMBs on different domains of cognition. METHODS: We searched through the databases of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect. After a consistency test, the publication bias was evaluated and a sensitivity analysis was performed with combined odds ratios (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) of CMBs. RESULTS: A meta-analysis of 25 studies with 9343 participants total was conducted. Patients with CMBs had higher incidence of cognitive impairment (OR:3.5410; 95% confidence interval [CI] [2.2979, 5.4567], p<0.05) and lower scores of cognitive functions (SMD: -0.2700 [-0.4267, -0.1133], p<0.05 in Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] group and -0.4869 [-0.8902, -0.0818], p<0.05 in Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] group). Our results also indicated that patients with CMBs had obvious decline in cognitive functions, for instance, orientation (SMD: -0.9565 [-1.7260, -0.1869], p<0.05), attention and calculation (SMD: -1.1518 [-1.9553, -0.3484], p<0.05) and delayed recall (SMD: -0.5527 [-1.1043, -0.0011], p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that CMBs might be an important risk factor for cognitive dysfunction, especially in the domains of orientation, attention and calculation and delayed recall functions. Prospective cohort studies with further investigations will be needed in larger samples.
