38929054|t|Are Infants and Children at Risk of Adverse Health Effects from Dietary Deoxynivalenol Exposure? An Integrative Review.
38929054|a|Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a foodborne mycotoxin produced by Fusarium molds that commonly infect cereal grains. It is a potent protein synthesis inhibitor that can significantly impact humans' gastrointestinal, immune, and nervous systems and can alter the microbiome landscape. Low-dose, chronic exposure to DON has been found to stimulate the immune system, inhibit protein synthesis, and cause appetite suppression, potentially leading to growth failure in children. At higher doses, DON has been shown to cause immune suppression, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, the malabsorption of nutrients, intestinal hemorrhaging, dizziness, and fever. A provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) limit of 1 microg/kg/body weight has been established to protect humans, underscoring the potential health risks associated with DON intake. While the adverse effects of dietary DON exposure have been established, healthcare communities have not adequately investigated or addressed this threat to child health, possibly due to the assumption that current regulatory exposure limits protect the public appropriately. This integrative review investigated whether current dietary DON exposure rates in infants and children regularly exceed PMTDI limits, placing them at risk of negative health effects. On a global scale, the routine contamination of cereal grains, bakery products, pasta, and human milk with DON could lead to intake levels above PMTDI limits. Furthermore, evidence suggests that other food commodities, such as soy, coffee, tea, dried spices, nuts, certain seed oils, animal milk, and various water reservoirs, can be intermittently contaminated, further amplifying the scope of the issue. Better mitigation strategies and global measures are needed to safeguard vulnerable youth from this harmful toxicant.
