39421566|t|Prevention and Treatment Strategies for Alzheimer's Disease: Focusing on Microglia and Astrocytes in Neuroinflammation.
39421566|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by its insidious onset and progressive development, making it the most common form of dementia. Despite its prevalence, the exact causes and mechanisms responsible for AD remain unclear. Recent studies have highlighted that inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) plays a crucial role in both the initiation and progression of AD. Neuroinflammation, an immune response within the CNS triggered by glial cells in response to various stimuli, such as nerve injury, infection, toxins, or autoimmune reactions, has emerged as a significant factor alongside amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) commonly associated with AD. This article aims to provide an overview of the most recent research regarding the involvement of neuroinflammation in AD, with a particular focus on elucidating the specific mechanisms involving microglia and astrocytes. By exploring these intricate processes, a new theoretical framework can be established to further probe the impact of neuroinflammation on the development and progression of AD. Through a deeper understanding of these underlying mechanisms, potential targets for therapeutic interventions and novel treatment strategies can be identified in the ongoing battle against AD.
