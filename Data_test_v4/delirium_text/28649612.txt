28649612|t|Disentangling the neural correlates of corticobasal syndrome and corticobasal degeneration with systematic and quantitative ALE meta-analyses.
28649612|a|Corticobasal degeneration is a scarce neurodegenerative disease, which can only be confirmed by histopathological examination. Reported to be associated with various clinical syndromes, its classical clinical phenotype is corticobasal syndrome. Due to the rareness of corticobasal syndrome/corticobasal degeneration and low numbers of patients included in single studies, meta-analyses are particularly suited to disentangle features of the clinical syndrome and histopathology. Using PubMed, we identified 11 magnetic resonance imaging studies measuring atrophy in 22 independent cohorts with 200 patients contrasted to 318 healthy controls. The anatomic likelihood estimation method was applied to reveal affected brain regions across studies. Corticobasal syndrome was related to gray matter loss in the basal ganglia/thalamus, frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. In corticobasal degeneration patients, atrophy in the thalamus, frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes were found. Finally, in a conjunction analysis, the bilateral thalamus, the bilateral posterior frontomedian cortex, posterior midcingulate cortex and premotor area/supplementary motor area, and the left posterior superior and middle frontal gyrus/precentral gyrus were identified as areas associated with both, corticobasal syndrome and corticobasal degeneration. Remarkably, atrophy in the premotor area/supplementary motor area and posterior midcingulate/frontomedian cortex seems to be specific for corticobasal syndrome/corticobasal degeneration, whereas atrophy in the thalamus and the left posterior superior and middle frontal gyrus/precentral gyrus are also associated with other neurodegenerative diseases according to anatomic likelihood estimation method meta-analyses. Our study creates a new conceptual framework to understand, and distinguish between clinical features (corticobasal syndrome) and histopathological findings (corticobasal degeneration) by powerful data-driven meta-analytic approaches. Furthermore, it proposes regional-specific atrophy as an imaging biomarker for diagnosis of corticobasal syndrome/corticobasal degeneration ante-mortem.
