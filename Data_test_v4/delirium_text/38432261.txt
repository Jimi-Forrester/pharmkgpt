38432261|t|Amylovis-201 enhances physiological memory formation and rescues memory and hippocampal cell loss in a streptozotocin-induced Alzheimer's disease animal model.
38432261|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and its treatment is lacking. In this work, we tested Amylovis-201, a naphthalene-derived compound, as a possible therapeutic candidate for the treatment of AD. For this purpose, we performed three experiments. In the first and third experiment, animals received a bilateral administration of streptozotocin and, starting 24 h after injection, a daily dose of Amylovis-201 (orally), for 17 days or for the whole time of the experiment respectively (28 days), after which learning and memory, as well as the number of hippocampal dentate gyrus cells, were assessed. In the second experiment, healthy animals received a single dose of Amylovis-201, 10 min or 5 h after the learning section to assess whether this substance could promote specific mechanisms involved in memory trace formation. Our data show that, administration of a single dose of Amylovis-201, 10 min after the end of training, but not at 5 h, produces a prolongation in memory duration, probably because it modulates specific mechanisms involved in memory trace consolidation. Furthermore, daily administration of Amylovis-201 to animals with bilateral intracerebroventricular injection of STZ produces a reduction in the loss of the hippocampus dentate gyrus cells and an improvement in spatial memory, probably because Amylovis-201 can interact with some of the protein kinases of the insulin signaling cascade, also involved in neural plasticity, and thereby halt or reverse some of the effects of STZ. Taking to account these results, Amylovis-201 is a good candidate for the therapeutic treatment of AD.
