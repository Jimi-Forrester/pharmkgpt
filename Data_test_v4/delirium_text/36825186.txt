36825186|t|Nitrous oxide inhalation-induced cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in a 20-year-old man: A case report.
36825186|a|Nitrous oxide is increasingly abused in the young population and has been verified to induce neuropathy, myelopathy, encephalopathy, and thrombosis. Nitrous oxide-related thrombosis was identified in the coronary artery, ascending aorta, pulmonary artery, and deep vein in the lower extremities. Cases with nitrous oxide abuse-related thrombosis in cerebral veins or cerebral venous sinus have rarely been reported, and confounding risk factors for thrombosis other than nitrous oxide exist in previous cases. Here, we report a case of probable nitrous oxide abuse-related cerebral venous sinus thrombosis without common confounding risk factors for thrombosis except for nitrous oxide.
