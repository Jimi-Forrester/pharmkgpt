37564401|t|Chemical sensors for imaging total cellular aliphatic aldehydes in live cells.
37564401|a|Aliphatic aldehydes are reactive electrophilic carbonyls that cross-link with DNA and proteins leading to cellular toxicity and disease pathogenesis. This toxicity is due to the cooperative effect of multiple aldehydes via a common mechanism. Therefore, live-cell imaging of total aliphatic aldehydes, small-to-long chain (C1-C10), is highly desired to decipher their physiological and pathological functions. However, sensors for imaging total cellular aliphatic aldehydes are currently lacking despite their high concentrations (~80 to >500 muM) inside cells. Herein, we report chemical sensors that generate a benzimidazole moiety upon reaction with aliphatic aldehydes of different chain lengths (C1-C10), resulting in turn-on fluorescence. These sensors exhibit high quantum yields, high dynamic range, and enable the quantification of changes in both the exogenous administration of aldehydes and endogenous real-time formation of aliphatic aldehydes in live mammalian cells. This tool has great potential to transform aldehyde research by illuminating cellular metabolites that have remained elusive in living systems.
