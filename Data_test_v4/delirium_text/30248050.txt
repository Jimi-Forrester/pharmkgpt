30248050|a|BACKGROUND: High-density lipoprotein (HDL) containing apolipoprotein A-I is associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). HDL particle size is modified in the presence of pathological conditions, while the significance of the HDL particle size remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the HDL lipoprotein subclasses in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 20 AD patients, 17 MCI patients, and 17 age-matched controls without cognitive impairment, selected from the database of the Study of Outcome and aPolipoproteins in Dementia (STOP-Dementia) registry. The diagnoses of AD and MCI were performed by expert neurologists according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition criteria. Serum HDL subclasses were measured by electrophoretic separation of lipoproteins using the Lipoprint System. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a marker of inflammation, was calculated by dividing the neutrophil count by the lymphocyte count. RESULTS: Small-sized HDL particle levels in the MCI group were significantly higher than in the control group, although there was no difference in serum HDL-cholesterol levels between MCI and control groups. NLR in the MCI group was higher than in the control group, but this difference was non-significant (p = 0.09). There was no difference in HDL subclasses or NLR between the AD and control groups. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that HDL subclasses might be associated with the development of MCI.
