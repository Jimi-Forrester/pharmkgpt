9639678|t|Presenilin-1 mutations associated with familial Alzheimer's disease do not disrupt protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.
9639678|a|Mutations in genes encoding presenilin-1 (PS1) and presenilin-2 (PS2) have been linked to familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cells expressing mutant presenilins produce elevated levels of Abeta42, the major amyloid peptide found in AD plaques. The mechanism whereby this occurs remains unknown, but the localization of presenilins to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments has suggested that they may function in intracellular trafficking pathways involved in processing beta-amyloid precursor proteins (APP). To test this possibility, we coexpressed PS1(wt), PS1(M146L), or PS1(L286V) in HEK293 cells together with the LDL receptor, a classic glycoprotein marker that undergoes post-translational O-glycosylation in the Golgi compartment. Pulse-chase analysis of the receptor indicated that mutant presenilins had no effect on ER-->Golgi transport. Similar results were obtained when the studies were carried out with cells expressing the Swedish variant of APP (SWAPP751) instead of the LDL receptor. Moreover, secretion of the soluble exodomain polypeptide fragments of SWAPP751 that arise from alpha-secretase and beta-secretase cleavage was not markedly affected by the PS1 mutants. Despite the lack of discernible effect of the PS1 mutants on trafficking of proteins through the Golgi apparatus, they caused a substantial increase in the proportion of Abeta42 relative to total Abeta in the culture medium. The results suggest that mutant forms of PS1 cause elevated production of Abeta42 by a mechanism that is independent of a major disruption of exocytic trafficking of APP.
