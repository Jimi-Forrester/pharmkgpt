28869477|t|Persistence with Antihypertensive Drugs in Patients with Hypertension and Dementia in Germany.
28869477|a|BACKGROUND: Hypertension, a chronic disease resulting from aging and its related physiopathological dysregulations, is often associated with dementia. OBJECTIVE: The goal was to analyze the persistence with antihypertensive drugs in patients affected by both hypertension and dementia in Germany. METHODS: This study included hypertension patients who were initially treated with antihypertensive drugs in 1,262 general practices in Germany between January 2013 and December 2015 (index date). Patients with hypertension and comorbid dementia were matched (1 : 1) to patients without dementia by age, gender, type of residence (nursing home versus home-care setting), physician, and initial antihypertensive therapy, using a propensity score method. The primary outcome was the rate of patients without treatment discontinuation with antihypertensive drugs in cases and controls in the 12 months following the index date. Cox regressions were used to determine the impact of dementia on persistence with antihypertensive treatment. RESULTS: This study included 2,191 patients with hypertension and comorbid dementia and 2,191 patients with hypertension but without dementia. The mean age was 79.3 years (SD = 10.3 years) in both groups. Twelve months after initiation of antihypertensive therapy, 73.5% of cases and 69.5% of controls were persistent (p < 0.001). Dementia was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of non-persistence with antihypertensive drugs in the entire population (HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.79-0.93). This finding was corroborated in five different subgroups (age <=60 years, age 61-70 years, men, women, and patients living in home-care settings). CONCLUSIONS: Dementia was found to be a protective factor for persistence with antihypertensive drugs in Germany.
