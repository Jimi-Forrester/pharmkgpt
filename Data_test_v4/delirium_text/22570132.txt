22570132|t|Clinical trials: new opportunities.
22570132|a|Human cognitive aging has been too long neglected and underappreciated for its critical importance to quality of life in old age. The articles in this session present novel approaches to improving cognitive function in normal aging persons with drugs and interventions that are based on findings in epidemiology, studies in aged animals, and in vitro research. In addition, since aging is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, these studies also have implications as interventions for prevention and treatment. As a field of research, new knowledge regarding the causes and mechanisms of cognitive aging are ripe for translation into human studies, with the application of this knowledge leading the development of interventions and therapeutics for the prevention of cognitive decline in old age and Alzheimer's disease.
