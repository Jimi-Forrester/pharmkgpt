39062967|a|Nature provides us with a rich source of compounds with a wide range of applications, including the creation of innovative drugs. Despite advancements in chemically synthesized therapeutics, natural compounds are increasingly significant, especially in cancer treatment, a leading cause of death globally. One promising approach involves the use of natural inhibitors of checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), a critical regulator of DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Chk2's activation in response to DNA damage can lead to apoptosis or DNA repair, influencing glycolysis and mitochondrial function. In cancer therapy, inhibiting Chk2 can disrupt DNA repair and cell cycle progression, promoting cancer cell death and enhancing the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Additionally, Chk2 inhibitors can safeguard non-cancerous cells during these treatments by inhibiting p53-dependent apoptosis. Beyond oncology, Chk2 inhibition shows potential in treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, as the virus relies on Chk2 for RNA replication in neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in which DNA damage plays a crucial role. Plant-derived Chk2 inhibitors, such as artemetin, rhamnetin, and curcumin, offer a promising future for treating various diseases with potentially milder side effects and broader metabolic impacts compared to conventional therapies. The review aims to underscore the immense potential of natural Chk2 inhibitors in various therapeutic contexts, particularly in oncology and the treatment of other diseases involving DNA damage and repair mechanisms. These natural Chk2 inhibitors hold significant promise for revolutionizing the landscape of cancer treatment and other diseases. Further research into these compounds could lead to the development of innovative therapies that offer hope for the future with fewer side effects and enhanced efficacy.
