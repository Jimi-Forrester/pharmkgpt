In the present work, we report the synthesis and characterization of four new 5-arylidene 3-cyclopropyl-2-(phenylimino)thiazolidin-4-one (1-4) compounds and their human serum albumin glycation inhibitory activity. One of the compounds 5-(2H-1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylmethylidene)-3-cyclopropyl-2-(phenylimino)-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one (3) showed potent inhibition in the synthesis of initial, intermediary, and final products of glycation reactions. Besides, conformational changes in the alpha-helix and beta-sheet (due to hyperglycemia) were also found to be reversed upon the addition of (3). Experimental findings were complemented by computational [molecular docking, ADME/Tox, and density functional theory (DFT)] studies. The docking scores of the compounds were in order 1 > 3 > 2 > 4, indicating the importance of the polar group at the 5-arylidene moiety. The results of ADME/Tox and DFT calculations revealed the safe nature of the compounds with high drug-likeness and stability. Overall, we speculate that the results of this study could provide valuable insights into the biological activity of 4-thiazolidinones.
