20869945|a|Brain microglia are resident macrophage-like cells representing the first and main form of active immune response during brain injury. Microglia-mediated inflammatory events in the brain are known to be associated with chronic degenerative diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's, or Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, identification of mechanisms activating microglia is not only important in the understanding of microglia-mediated brain pathologies, but may also lead to the development of new anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, abscisic acid (ABA), a phytohormone regulating important physiological functions in higher plants, has been proposed to activate murine microglial cell line N9 through increased intracellular calcium. In the present study, we determined the response to ABA and its analogues from murine primary microglia and immortalized murine microglial cell line BV-2 and N9 cells. A Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2AM)-based ratiometric calcium imaging and measurement technique was used to determine the intracellular calcium changes in these cells when treated with (-)-ABA, (+)-ABA, (-)-trans-ABA and (+)-trans-ABA. Both primary microglia and microglial cell lines (BV-2 and N9 cells) showed significant increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)]i) in response to treatment with ATP and ionomycine. However, ABAs failed to evoke dose- and time-dependent [Ca(2+)]i changes in mouse primary microglia, BV-2 and N9 cells. Together, these surprising findings demonstrate that, contrary to that reported in N9 cells [3], ABAs do not evoke intracellular calcium changes in primary microglia and microglial cell lines. The broad conclusion that ABA evokes [Ca(2+)]i in microglia requires more evidence and further careful examination.
