38378084|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the formation beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposited neuritic plaques. Recent evidence suggests that abnormal lipid metabolism and accumulation could serve as biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. Tubular endoplasmic reticulum protein, reticulon 3 (RTN3), plays a crucial role in the development of neuritic plaque and lipid metabolism in AD brains. In present study, we sought to investigate a potential association between neutral lipid accumulation and AD pathology. BODIPY 500/510 dye was used to label neutral lipid surrounding Abeta plaques in APPNL-G-F mouse and AD postmortem brains samples. Immunofluorescent images were captured using confocal microscope and co-localization between lipid metabolism proteins and neutral lipids were evaluated. Lipid accumulation in Abeta plaque surrounding dystrophic neurites (DNs) was observed in the cortical region of AD mouse models and human AD brain samples. The neutral lipid staining was not co-localized with IBA1-labeled microglia or GFAP-labeled astrocytes, but it was co-labeled with VAMP2 and neurofilament. We further showed that neutral lipids were accumulated in RTN3 immunoreactive DNs. Both the neutral lipids accumulation and RIDNs formation showed age-dependent patterns in surrounding amyloid plaques. Mechanistic studies revealed that RTN3 likely contributes to the enrichment of neutral lipids near plaques by interacting with heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) and diminishing its function in chaperone-mediated lipophagy. Our study provides immunohistochemical evidence of neutral lipids being enriched in DNs near amyloid plaques. Our findings shed light on RTN3-mediaed lipid accumulation in AD neuropathology and provide fresh insights into the role of RTN3 in neurodegenerative diseases.
