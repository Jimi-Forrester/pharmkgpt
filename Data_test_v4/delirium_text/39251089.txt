39251089|a|Apolipoprotein E (apoE) has a pivotal role in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathophysiology. APOE4 has been recognized as a risk factor for developing late-onset AD. Recently, APOE4 homozygosity was regarded as a new familial genetic trait of AD. In this opinion paper, we summarized the potential pleiotropic antagonism role of APOE4 in children living under early life adversity and afflicted with enteric infection/malnutrition-related pathogenic exposome. APOE4 was found to be neuroprotective early in life despite its increasing risk for AD with aging. We call for awareness of the potential burden this can bring to the public health system when APOE4 carriers, raised under adverse environmental conditions in early life and then aging with unhealthy lifestyles in later life may be at special risk for cognitive impairments and acquired AD. We postulate the importance of anti-senescence therapies to protect these individuals and remediate aging-related chronic illnesses.
