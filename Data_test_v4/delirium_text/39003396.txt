39003396|a|Immunosuppression and malnutrition play pivotal roles in the complications of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and are intricately linked to the development of stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP). Inflammatory markers, including NLR (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), SII (systemic immune inflammation index), SIRI (systemic inflammatory response index), and SIS (systemic inflammation score), along with nutritional indexes such as CONUT (controlling nutritional status) and PNI (prognostic nutritional index), are crucial indicators influencing the inflammatory state following ICH. In this study, our objective was to compare the predictive efficacy of inflammatory and nutritional indices for SAP in ICH patients, aiming to determine and explore their clinical utility in early pneumonia detection. Patients with severe ICH requiring ICU admission were screened from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The outcomes included the occurrence of SAP and in-hospital death. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, multivariate logistic regression, smooth curve analysis, and stratified analysis were employed to investigate the relationship between the CONUT index and the clinical outcomes of patients with severe ICH. A total of 348 patients were enrolled in the study. The incidence of SAP was 21.3%, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 17.0%. Among these indicators, multiple regression analysis revealed that CONUT, PNI, and SIRI were independently associated with SAP. Further ROC curve analysis demonstrated that CONUT (AUC 0.6743, 95% CI 0.6079-0.7408) exhibited the most robust predictive ability for SAP in patients with ICH. Threshold analysis revealed that when CONUT < 6, an increase of 1 point in CONUT was associated with a 1.39 times higher risk of SAP. Similarly, our findings indicate that CONUT has the potential to predict the prognosis of patients with ICH. Among the inflammatory and nutritional markers, CONUT stands out as the most reliable predictor of SAP in patients with ICH. Additionally, it proves to be a valuable indicator for assessing the prognosis of patients with ICH.
