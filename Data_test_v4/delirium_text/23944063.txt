23944063|a|The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of cornel iridoid glycoside (CIG) on the activity of cholinesterases in vitro, and to investigate the mechanism of CIG's treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). The sources of cholinesterases were prepared from human blood cells, rat brain homogenate and human blood plasma, respectively. The biochemical methods were used to detect the activity of acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and butyryl cholinesterase (BuChE) to investigate the influence of CIG on cholinesterases. The results showed that CIG inhibited the activity of AChE of human blood cells and rat brain homogenate, with the 50% inhibition rate (IC50) of 1.6 g . L-1 and 3.3 g . L-1, respectively; and the inhibition of AChE of CIG is reversible. CIG also inhibited the activity of BuChE of human blood plasma, with the IC50 of 2.9 g . L-1. In conclusion, CIG can inhibit the activity of AChE and BuChE in vitro, which may be one of the mechanisms of CIG to treat AD.
