16186692|a|The members of the casein kinase 1 (CK1) family are highly conserved and are expressed in many eukaryotes ranging from yeast to humans. Mammalian CK1 isoforms (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon) and their splice variants are involved in diverse cellular processes including membrane trafficking, circadian rhythm, cell cycle progression, chromosome segregation, apoptosis and cellular differentiation. Mutations and deregulation of CK1 expression and activity has been linked to various diseases including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, sleeping disorders and proliferative diseases such as cancer. In this review, we summarize the functions of CK1 and outline the participation of CK1 in signal transduction pathways linked to cancer development.
