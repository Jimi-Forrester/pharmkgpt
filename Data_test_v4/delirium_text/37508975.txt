37508975|a|BACKGROUND: The majority of previous studies showed that older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) had impaired cognition and mood status, as well as increased behavioral disturbances after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are still controversial data as regards the multifactorial impact of the restrictive measures on cognition, mood and daily function in older adults with MCI and ADD. AIM: In the current study, the scope is to identify possible deterioration by means of cognitive and functional level due to mood and behavioral alterations during the second quarantine imposed in Greece between November 2020 and May 2021, as well as one year after the second quarantine, in May 2022. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the two day centers of the Greek Association of Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders (GAADRD). They underwent three yearly follow up assessments from May 2020 to May 2022 and participated in cognitive training interventions (through digital online means) during the aforementioned period. Mixed measures analyses of variance as well as path models were used for the study's purposes. RESULTS: The study sample comprised 210 participants (175 people with MCI and 35 people with ADD). The mean age was 71.59 and 77.94 for people with MCI and mild ADD, respectively, whereas the average number of years of education was 12.65 for those with MCI and 9.83 for people with mild ADD. The results show that participants' deterioration rate (D), calculated by means of their performance in neuropsychological and functional assessments between 2020 and 2021 (D1) and 2021 and 2022 (D2), did not change significantly, except for the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), since both groups displayed a larger D2 across the test conditions (immediate recall, fifth trial and delayed recall). Trail Making Test-B (TMT-B) performance, applied only in the MCI group, decreased more in relation to the deterioration rate D2. Additionally, two path models were applied to measure the direct relationships between diagnosis, performance in tests measuring mood and neuropsychiatric disturbances (NPI) and cognition, as measured by the RAVLT, in the 2020-2022 assessments. TMT-B was administered only in the MCI population, and therefore was not included in path models. The results show that participants' scores in RAVLT conditions were related to diagnosis and NPI performance, which was positively affected by diagnosis. No other relationships between RAVLT with mood tests were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that after the second lockdown period, the neuropsychological performance of people with MCI and ADD, calculated by means of their D2, did not change, except from their verbal memory, as well as visual scanning and information processing, measured using the TMT-B. Therefore, it can be assumed that those who were enrolled in digital non-pharmacological interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic home restrictions did not experience increased cognitive and functional deterioration due to mood and behavioral alterations after the pandemic.
