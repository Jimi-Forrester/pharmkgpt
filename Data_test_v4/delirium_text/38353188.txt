38353188|a|Introduction: The costoclavicular brachial plexus block (CCBPB) has emerged as a more effective approach to regional anesthesia of the upper extremity. The costoclavicular space is the anterior portion of the superior thoracic aperture, located between the clavicle and first rib. The brachial plexus cords traverse this space clustered together in a superficial location lateral to the axillary artery and share a consistent topographical relationship to one another. By targeting the brachial plexus at this specific anatomical location, the CCBPB offers a powerful, single-shot, sensorimotor block of the upper extremity below the shoulder. We present a novel application of the CCBPB to facilitate emergency department (ED) analgesia and closed reduction of an upper extremity fracture. Case Report: A 25-year-old male presented to the ED with a traumatic Colles fracture sustained during a high-speed motor vehicle collision. Despite multimodal analgesia, the patient reported intractable severe pain with intolerance of radial manipulation. An ultrasound-guided CCBPB was performed to augment pain control and avoid procedural sedation, resulting in dense, surgical anesthesia of the upper extremity, and painless fracture reduction. Conclusion: Regional anesthesia is an effective component of multimodal pain management and another tool in the emergency physician's analgesic armamentarium. In acute orthopedic traumas necessitating emergent reduction, regional blocks serve as rescue pain control and can obviate the need for procedural sedation. In terms of targeted upper extremity analgesia, the CCBPB offers effective, single-shot, sensorimotor blockade below the shoulder, mitigating use of opioids and their deleterious side effects, while simultaneously avoiding incomplete blockade or phrenic nerve palsy associated with other approaches to brachial plexus blockade.
