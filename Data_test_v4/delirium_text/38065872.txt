38065872|t|Incidence of intraoperative hypotension in older patients undergoing total intravenous anesthesia by remimazolam versus propofol: A randomized controlled trial.
38065872|a|BACKGROUND: An increase in the frequency of surgeries among older individuals is observed in some countries. Hypotension is common and exaggerated in older patients and can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Total intravenous anesthesia is commonly administered with propofol, while remimazolam has been suggested as an alternative to propofol because of advantages such as a more stable hemodynamic profile and less respiratory suppression. We conducted a single-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled trial to compare the incidence of intraoperative hypotension between patients administered with remimazolam and propofol. METHODS: A total of 132 patients, aged between 65 to 80 years and undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy or transurethral resection of bladder tumors were randomly assigned to the propofol or remimazolam group with a permuted block system while being blinded to the hypnotic agent. Remifentanil was administered via target-controlled infusion in both groups, with an initial effect-site concentration of 3.0 ng/mL and titration range of 1.5 to 4.0 ng/mL intraoperatively. The primary outcome of this study was the overall incidence of hypotension during general anesthesia. RESULTS: Patients in the propofol group experienced higher intraoperative hypotension than those in the remimazolam group (59.7% vs 33.3%, P = .006). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that remimazolam administration was associated with reduced hypotension (adjusted odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16-0.73). Secondary outcomes such as recovery time, delirium, and postoperative nausea and vomiting were comparable in both groups. CONCLUSION: Total intravenous anesthesia with remimazolam was associated with less intraoperative hypotension than propofol in older patients, with a comparable recovery profile.
