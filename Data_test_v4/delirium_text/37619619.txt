37619619|a|Ferroptosis is an iron- and lipid peroxidation (LPO)-mediated programmed cell death type. Recently, mounting evidence has indicated the involvement of ferroptosis in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and so on. Treating ferroptosis presents opportunities as well as challenges for neurodegenerative diseases. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the occurrence of ferroptosis, as well as their implications in the pathogenesis and advancement of major neurodegenerative disorders. Meanwhile, we summarize the interaction between ferroptosis and other types of cell death in the advancement of neurodegenerative diseases and their contribution to corresponding drug development. In addition, we specifically summarize recent advances in developing therapeutic means targeting ferroptosis in these diseases, which may guide future approaches for the effective management of these devastating medical conditions.
