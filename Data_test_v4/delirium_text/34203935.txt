34203935|t|The "Magic Bullet" Is Here? Cell-Based Immunotherapies for Hematological Malignancies in the Twilight of the Chemotherapy Era.
34203935|a|Despite the introduction of a plethora of different anti-neoplastic approaches including standard chemotherapy, molecularly targeted small-molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and finally hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), there is still a need for novel therapeutic options with the potential to cure hematological malignancies. Although nowadays HSCT already offers a curative effect, its implementation is largely limited by the age and frailty of the patient. Moreover, its efficacy in combating the malignancy with graft-versus-tumor effect frequently coexists with undesirable graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Therefore, it seems that cell-based adoptive immunotherapies may constitute optimal strategies to be successfully incorporated into the standard therapeutic protocols. Thus, modern cell-based immunotherapy may finally represent the long-awaited "magic bullet" against cancer. However, enhancing the safety and efficacy of this treatment regimen still presents many challenges. In this review, we summarize the up-to-date state of the art concerning the use of CAR-T cells and NK-cell-based immunotherapies in hemato-oncology, identify possible obstacles, and delineate further perspectives.
