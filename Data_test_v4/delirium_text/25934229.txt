25934229|t|Synthesis and evaluation of selegiline derivatives as monoamine oxidase inhibitor, antioxidant and metal chelator against Alzheimer's disease.
25934229|a|A series of compounds with monoamine oxidase inhibition and biometal chelation activities were designed, synthesised and evaluated as agents against Alzheimer's disease. The in vitro assay shows that most target compounds exhibit good MAO-B activities with submicromolar IC50 values and antioxidant activity (1.49-5.67 ORAC-FL values). The selected compounds were used to determine the biometal chelating ability using UV-vis spectrometry and high-resolution mass spectrometry, which confirm that they can effectively interact with copper(II), iron(II) and zinc(II). The ThT fluorescence binding assay indicates that the synthetic compounds can inhibit Cu(II)-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation. The parallel artificial membrane permeation assay shows that most target compounds can cross the BBB. Based on these results, compound 8a was selected as a potential multifunctional agent for the treatment of AD.
