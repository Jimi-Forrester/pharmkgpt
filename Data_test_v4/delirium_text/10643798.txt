10643798|t|A polymorphism in the tau gene associated with risk for Alzheimer's disease.
10643798|a|Searching for tau genetic variations which could be associated with risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), we have performed a mutational analysis of a region containing the whole exon 11 of the tau gene, which encodes a microtubule binding region critical for tau self-assembly, and we have found a biallelic polymorphism at position +34 of intron 11 (IVS11 + 34G/A). We have analyzed the allelic frequencies of this polymorphism in a case-control sample (167 clinically diagnosed AD and 194 controls) and found that the presence of any G allele (genotypes AG + GG) is associated with a five-fold AD risk in individuals carrying the apolipoprotein E4 allele, strongly suggesting that the combined effect of tau and apoE is relevant in relation with AD pathogenesis.
