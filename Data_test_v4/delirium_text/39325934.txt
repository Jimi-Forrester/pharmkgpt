39325934|t|The Role and Mechanism of Vascular Aging in Geriatric Vascular Diseases.
39325934|a|Vascular aging is the pathological basis for the aging of various organ systems in the human body and is a common pathogenesis leading to the development of atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and other conditions among older adults. Aging is characterized by accelerated pulse wave velocity, thickening of the carotid artery intima-media, and decreased vascular dilation function. Signaling pathways such as mTOR, AMPK, NF-kappaB, Klotho, SIRT, and other key proteins are likely involved in these processes. The detection of biomarkers related to vascular aging, including senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, endothelial progenitor cells, circulating endothelial microparticles, and exosomal miRNAs, aids in assessing vascular status and prognosis. Repairing endothelial injury, reducing oxidative stress-inflammatory responses, and restoring mitochondrial and telomere functions are reliable measures to counter vascular aging. In summary, research on vascular aging is the driving force that will provide rational strategies to intervene in geriatric vascular diseases and achieve the long-term goal of healthy aging.
