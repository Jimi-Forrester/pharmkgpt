6702381|t|[Favorable outcomes of paranoid schizophrenia].
6702381|a|The results of follow-up (an observation period of 14-21 years) of 94 patients with paranoid schizophrenia examined and treated on an out-patient or in-patient basis at the Psychiatry Institute of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences in 1960-1966 made it possible to select 35 cases with beneficial outcomes of the disease. Three variants of such outcomes considered in the framework of residual conditions, viz. residual delirium with a retained tendency toward delirious interpretation of the outside world; residual delirium with out signs of actualization; residual conditions with incomplete criticism of the previous delirium and super-worship formations are described. The psycho-pathological structure of the residual conditions was shown to be dependent on the degree of the regression of the endogenic process and the severity of adverse changes associated with the latter. Clinical-pathogenetic criteria suggestive of a favourable outcome of the illness are presented.
