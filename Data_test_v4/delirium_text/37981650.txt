37981650|a|Inflammation in the brain and gut is a critical component of several neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One trigger of the immune system in PD is aggregation of the pre-synaptic protein, alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn). Understanding the mechanism of propagation of alphaSyn aggregates is essential to developing disease-modifying therapeutics. Using a brain-first mouse model of PD, we demonstrate alphaSyn trafficking from the brain to the ileum of male mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the ileal alphaSyn aggregations are contained within CD11c+ cells. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that ileal CD11c+ cells are microglia-like and the same subtype of cells is activated in the brain and ileum of PD mice. Moreover, by utilizing mice expressing the photo-convertible protein, Dendra2, we show that CD11c+ cells traffic from the brain to the ileum. Together these data provide a mechanism of alphaSyn trafficking between the brain and gut.
