35423960|a|The disruption of copper homeostasis (Cu+/Cu2+) may cause neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, the need for understanding the role of Cu+ in physiological and pathological processes prompted the development of improved methods of Cu+ analysis. Herein, a new near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent turn-on probe (NPCu) for the detection of Cu+ was developed based on a Cu+-mediated benzylic ether bond cleavage mechanism. The probe showed high selectivity and sensitivity toward Cu+, and was successfully applied for bioimaging of Cu+ in living cells.
