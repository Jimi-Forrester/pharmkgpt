7746469|a|Our recent results indicate that in Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid angiopathy, smooth muscle cells are responsible for beta-amyloid deposition in the vascular wall. Aged dogs have been shown to develop beta-amyloid angiopathy similar to that in AD. Thus, we used brain and peripheral vessels from aged and young dogs to isolate cells of the vascular wall: smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, and to study their ability to produce beta-protein. We demonstrate that only myocytes from aged animals cultured for up to 4 weeks accumulate beta-protein-immunoreactive material intracellularly, in the form of fibrillar and amorphous deposits.
