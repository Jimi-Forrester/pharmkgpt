31466251|t|Using pH-Activable Carbon Nanoparticles as Cell Imaging Probes.
31466251|a|Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of innovative pH-activable carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) based on urea and citric acid by microwave-assisted green synthesis for application in cell imaging. These CNP-based nanoprobes offer significant advantages of pH responsiveness and excellent biocompatibility. The pH responsiveness ranges from 1.0 to 4.6 and the slightly pH responsiveness ranges from 4.6 to 9.0. In addition, the pH-dependent modification of charge as well as the final diameter of the designed CNPs not only provide support as stable sensors for cell imaging under pH values from 4.6 to 9.0, but can also observe the pH change in cells from 1.0 to 4.6. Importantly, this significantly enhances the cellular internalization process resulting in tumor cell death. Together, we believe that these superior photoluminescence properties of our designed nanomaterials potentially allow for biological labeling, bioimaging, and drug delivery applications.
