15505154|t|1H MR spectroscopy in common dementias.
15505154|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the 1H MR spectroscopic (MRS) findings and intergroup differences among common dementias: Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). METHODS: The authors consecutively recruited 206 normal elderly subjects and 121 patients with AD, 41 with FTLD, 20 with DLB, and 8 with VaD. The 1H MRS metabolite ratio changes in common dementias were evaluated with respect to normal and also differences among the common dementias. RESULTS: N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) was lower than normal in patients with AD, FTLD, and VaD. Myo-inositol (mI)/Cr was higher than normal in patients with AD and FTLD. Choline (Cho)/Cr was higher than normal in patients with AD, FTLD, and DLB. There were no metabolite differences between patients with AD and FTLD or between patients with DLB and VaD. NAA/Cr was lower in patients with AD and FTLD than DLB. MI/Cr was higher in patients with AD and FTLD than VaD. MI/Cr was also higher in patients with FTLD than DLB. CONCLUSIONS: NAA/Cr levels are decreased in dementias that are characterized by neuron loss, such as AD, FTLD, and VaD. MI/Cr levels are elevated in dementias that are pathologically characterized by gliosis, such as AD and FTLD. Cho/Cr levels are elevated in dementias that are characterized by a profound cholinergic deficit, such as AD and DLB.
