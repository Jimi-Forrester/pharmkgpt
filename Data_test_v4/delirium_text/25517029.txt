25517029|a|The IL-33/ST2 signaling pathway plays an important role in coronary artery disease (CHD); however, few studies have explored how variants in IL-33/ST2 genes influence CHD risk. Here, we examined the association between genetic variants in IL-33, ST2, and IL-1RAcP of the IL-33/ST2 axis and the risk of CHD. We conducted a case-controlled study with 1146 CHD cases and 1146 age- and sex-frequency-matched controls. Twenty-eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL-33, ST2, and IL-1RAcP were genotyped by Sequenom MassArray and TaqMan assay. Logistic regression was used to analyze these associations. The SNP rs4624606 in IL-1RAcP was nominally associated with CHD risk. The AA genotype was associated with a 1.85-fold increased risk of CHD (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-3.36; p = 0.045) compared to the TT genotype. Further analysis showed that AA carriers also had a higher risk of CHD than TT + TA carriers (odds ratio (OR) = 1.85; 95% CI = 1.85-3.35; p = 0.043). However, no significant association was observed between variants in IL-33/ST2 genes and CHD risk. Further studies are needed to replicate our results in other ethnic groups with larger sample size.
