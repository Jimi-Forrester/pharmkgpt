27785733|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Acute postoperative pain management in the geriatric patient can be challenging, including their response to medications. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate whether the efficacy and safety profile of fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system (ITS) (IONSYS ) was similar in geriatric (>=65 years) and non-geriatric (<65 years) patients. METHODS: Efficacy and safety data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and four randomized, open-label, active-comparator trials were utilized for this analysis. Efficacy was assessed via the patient global assessment (PGA) and the investigator global assessment (IGA) scales. The PGA and IGA are categorical 4-point scales (excellent, good, fair, or poor) with treatment success defined as excellent or good. Safety was evaluated via adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 1763 patients were assigned to the fentanyl ITS treatment group. Of the 1763 patients in the fentanyl ITS group, 499 patients were >=65 years of age; 65.1% were 65-74 years of age, 31.7% were 75-84 years of age, and 3.2% were >=85 years of age. In the fentanyl ITS treatment groups, there were no statistically significant differences between the non-geriatric and geriatric patients in terms of patients reporting success on the PGA at 24 h (80.0 vs. 83.0%, respectively; p = 0.3415). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in success rates on the IGA at study discharge (82.8 vs. 87.5%, respectively; p = 0.1195). The safety profile was similar between the age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, efficacy and safety of the fentanyl ITS were similar between the geriatric and non-geriatric patients.
