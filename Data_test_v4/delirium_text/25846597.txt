25846597|t|[Volumetry of cerebral gray and white matter using VSRAD ].
25846597|a|Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) using structural brain MRI has been widely used for the early and differential diagnosis and evaluation of disease progression in neuropsychiatric diseases. VBM of MRI data comprises segmentation into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid partitions; anatomical standardization of all the images to the same stereotactic space using linear affine transformation and further non-linear warping and smoothing; and finally performing statistical analysis. Stand-alone VBM software using SPM8 plus DARTEL running on Windows (Voxel-based Specific Regional analysis system for Alzheimer's disease, VSRAD ) has been developed as an adjunct to the clinical assessment. This software provides a Z-score map as a result of the comparison of the patient's MRI with a normal database.
