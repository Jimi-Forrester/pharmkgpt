38886344|a|Since the identification of vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) 35, as a causative molecule for familial Parkinson's disease (PD), retromer-mediated endosomal machinery has been a rising factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. The retromer complex cooperates with sorting nexin (SNX) dimer and DNAJC13, another causal molecule in PD, to transport cargoes from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network, and is also involved in mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy. Retromer dysfunction may induce neuronal death leading to PD via several biological cascades, including misfolded, insoluble alpha-synuclein (aS) accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction; however, the detailed mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we showed that the stagnation of retromer-mediated retrograde transport consistently occurs in different PD-mimetic conditions, i.e., overexpression of PD-linked mutant DNAJC13, excess aS induction, or toxin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistically, DNAJC13 was found to be involved in clathrin-dependent retromer transport as a functional modulator of SNX1 together with heat shock cognate 70 kDa protein (Hsc70), which was controlled by the binding and dissociation of DNAJC13 and SNX1 in an Hsc70 activity-dependent manner. In addition, excess amount of aS decreased the interaction between SNX1 and VPS35, the core component of retromer. Furthermore, R33, a pharmacological retromer chaperone, reduced insoluble aS and mitigated rotenone-induced neuronal apoptosis. These findings suggest that retrograde transport regulated by SNX1-retromer may be profoundly involved in the pathogenesis of PD and is a potential target for disease-modifying therapy for the disease.
