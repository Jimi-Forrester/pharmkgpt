9178861|t|Association between the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and Alzheimer's disease.
9178861|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting elderly people. It usually occurs after 65 years old (late-onset AD). The epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is a risk factor which contributes about 50% of the genetic risk for this form of the disease. The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is a major receptor for APOE which is found in the senile plaques of AD brains. This makes it a good candidate gene for the disease. There is a polymorphism in the region upstream of the LRP gene that has been associated with AD in an American population. We examined this polymorphism by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in a French population with sporadic late-onset AD. In the previous report, a significant increase of the 87 bp allele was found in the AD cases; however, in our population, we observed a significant decrease with this same allele of the LRP gene. The possible reasons for this discrepancy, linkage disequilibrium or statistical anomaly, are discussed.
