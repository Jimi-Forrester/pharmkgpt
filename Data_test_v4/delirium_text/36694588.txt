36694588|a|In recent weeks, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections has been progressively increasing all over the globe, even in countries where vaccination programs have been strongly implemented. In these regions in 2021, a reduction in the number of hospitalizations and deaths compared to 2020 was observed. This decrease is certainly associated with the introduction of vaccination measures. The process of the development of effective vaccines represents an important challenge. Overall, the breakthrough infections occurring in vaccinated subjects are in most cases less severe than those observed in unvaccinated individuals. This review examines the factors affecting the immunogenicity of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and the possible role of nutrients in modulating the response of distinct immune cells to the vaccination.
