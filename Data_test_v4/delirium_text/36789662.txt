36789662|a|Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are multifactorial with several different pathologic mechanisms. Therefore, it is assumed that multitargeted-directed ligands (MTDLs) which interact with different biological targets relevant to the diseases, might offer an improved therapeutic alternative than using the traditional "one-target, one-molecule" approach. Herein, we describe new benzothiazole-based derivatives as a privileged scaffold for histamine H3 receptor ligands (H3R). The most affine compound, the 3-(azepan-1-yl)propyloxy-linked benzothiazole derivative 4b, displayed a Ki value of 0.012 muM. The multitargeting potential of these H3R ligands towards AChE, BuChE and MAO-B enzymes was evaluated to yield compound 3s (pyrrolidin-1-yl-(6-((5-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pentyl)oxy)benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)methanone) as the most promising MTDL with a Ki value of 0.036 muM at H3R and IC50 values of 6.7 microM, 2.35 microM, and 1.6 microM towards AChE, BuChE, and MAO-B, respectively. These findings suggest that compound 3s can be a lead structure for developing new multi-targeting anti-AD agents.
