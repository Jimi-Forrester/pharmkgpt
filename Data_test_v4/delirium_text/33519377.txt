33519377|a|Aggregation and deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in extracellular plaques and in the cerebral vasculature are prominent neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and closely associated with the pathogenesis of AD. Amyloid plaques in the brains of most AD patients and transgenic mouse models exhibit heterogeneity in the composition of Abeta deposits, due to the occurrence of elongated, truncated, and post-translationally modified Abeta peptides. Importantly, changes in the deposition of these different Abeta variants are associated with the clinical disease progression and considered to mark sequential phases of plaque and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) maturation at distinct stages of AD. We recently showed that Abeta phosphorylated at serine residue 26 (pSer26Abeta) has peculiar characteristics in aggregation, deposition, and neurotoxicity. In the current study, we developed and thoroughly validated novel monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that recognize Abeta depending on the phosphorylation-state of Ser26. Our results demonstrate that selected phosphorylation state-specific antibodies were able to recognize Ser26 phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Abeta with high specificity in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western Blotting (WB) assays. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analyses with these antibodies demonstrated the occurrence of pSer26Abeta in transgenic mouse brains that show differential deposition as compared to non-phosphorylated Abeta (npAbeta) or other modified Abeta species. Notably, pSer26Abeta species were faintly detected in extracellular Abeta plaques but most prominently found intraneuronally and in cerebral blood vessels. In conclusion, we developed new antibodies to specifically differentiate Abeta peptides depending on the phosphorylation state of Ser26, which are applicable in ELISA, WB, and immunofluorescence staining of mouse brain tissues. These site- and phosphorylation state-specific Abeta antibodies represent novel tools to examine phosphorylated Abeta species to further understand and dissect the complexity in the age-related and spatio-temporal deposition of different Abeta variants in transgenic mouse models and human AD brains.
