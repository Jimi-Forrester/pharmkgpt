26002225|t|Thiothixene in the Management of Delirium: A Case Series.
26002225|a|BACKGROUND: Pharmacologic strategies are often required to help manage agitated patients with delirium. First-and second-generation antipsychotic medications (such as haloperidol, quetiapine, and olanzapine) are commonly used. OBJECTIVE: On the psychiatric consultation service in our hospital, thiothixene has been used based on its favorable potency, sedative, and cost profiles. Little has been written about the utility of this drug for management of delirium. METHODS: We reviewed our experience with thiothixene in this setting using pharmacy records to identify patients who received at least 1 dose between July 2011 and March 2014. We scrutinized the relevant medical records (n = 111) and recorded the following data: age, sex, medical diagnoses, signs and symptoms of delirium, dosing of thiothixene, and response to thiothixene in terms of both apparent benefit as well as side effects. RESULTS: Resolution or improvement was documented in 78% of patients and good tolerability in 82% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although further data from a randomized, controlled trial would be ideal, our experience suggests that thiothixene could be a safe and effective pharmacologic treatment for agitation and psychosis due to delirium.
