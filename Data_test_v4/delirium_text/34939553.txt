34939553|a|Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy (SAE) is a common complication in the acute phase of sepsis, and patients who develop SAE have a higher mortality rate, longer hospital stay, and worse quality of life than other sepsis patients. Although the incidence of SAE is as high as 70% in sepsis patients, no effective treatment is available for this condition. To develop an effective treatment for SAE, it is vital to explore its pathogenesis. It is known that hyperammonemia is a possible factor in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy as ammonia is a potent neurotoxin. Furthermore, our previous studies indicate that non-hepatic hyperammonemia seems to occur more often in sepsis patients; it was also found that >50% of sepsis patients with non-hepatic hyperammonemia exhibited encephalopathy and delirium. Substatistical analyses indicate that non-hepatic hyperammonemia is an independent risk factor for SAE. This study updates the definition, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of SAE; it also investigates the possible treatment options available for non-hepatic hyperammonemia in patients with sepsis and the mechanisms by which non-hepatic hyperammonemia causes encephalopathy.
