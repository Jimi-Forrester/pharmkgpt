30225789|a|The current review highlights the evidence supporting the use of ketogenic diet therapies in the management of a growing number of neurological disorders in adults. An overview of the scientific literature supporting posited mechanisms of therapeutic efficacy is presented including effects on neurotransmission, oxidative stress, and neuro-inflammation. The clinical evidence supporting ketogenic diet use in the management of adult epilepsy, malignant glioma, Alzheimer's disease, migraine headache, motor neuron disease, and other neurologic disorders is highlighted and reviewed. Lastly, common adverse effects of ketogenic therapy in adults, including gastrointestinal symptoms, weight loss, and transient dyslipidemia are discussed.
