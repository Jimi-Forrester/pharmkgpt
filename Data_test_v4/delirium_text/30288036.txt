30288036|a|INTRODUCTION: The risk of air microembolism during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is high and influences the postoperative outcome, especially in elderly patients. The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere during cardiac surgery may reduce the risk of cerebral air microembolism. The aim of our study was to assess the influence of CO2 field flooding on microembolism-induced brain damage assessed by the level of S100ss protein, regarded as a marker of brain damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of 100 patients undergoing planned mitral valve operation through median sternotomy using standard CPB was recruited for the study. Echocardiography was performed prior to and after the CPB. CO2 insufflation at 6 L/minute was conducted in the study group. Blood samples for S100ss protein analysis were collected after induction of anesthesia, 2 hours after aorta de-clamping, and 24 hours after operation. RESULTS: The S100ss level in blood plasma did not differ significantly between the study and the control group (0.13+-0.08 microg/L, 1.12+-0.59 microg/L, and 0.26+-0.23 microg/L and 0.18+-0.19 microg/L, 1.31+-0.62 microg/L, and 0.23+-0.12 microg/L, P=0.7, 0.14, and 0.78). The mean increase of the S100ss concentration was 13% lower in the group with CO2 protection than in the control group (0.988 microg/L vs 1.125 microg/L), although statistically insignificant. Tricuspid valve annuloplasties (TVAs) had significant impact on the increase in S100ss concentration in the treatment group after 24 hours (TVA [-] 0.21+-0.09 vs TVA [+] 0.42+-0.42, P=0.05). In patients <60 years, there were significant differences in the S100ss level 2 and 24 hours after the procedure (1.59+-0.682 microg/L vs 1.223+-0.571 microg/L, P=0.048, and 0.363+-0.318 microg/L vs 0.229+-0.105 microg/L, P=0.036) as compared with younger patients. CONCLUSION: The increase in S100ss concentration was lower in the group with CO2 protection than in the control group. Age and an addition of TVA significantly influenced the level of S100ss concentration in the tests performed 2 hours after aortic clamp release.
