36094925|a|To investigate the molecular pathological mechanisms of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and elucidate the effects of acupuncture on IBS-D colonic mucosa protein abundance in rats, a label-free high-throughput liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based proteomics analysis was used to survey the global changes of colonic mucosa proteins between different groups. Sixteen Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats were randomly divided into four groups: the control group (C); the IBS-D model group (M); the syndrome differentiation acupuncture group (SD) and the traditional acupuncture group (T). IBS-D model rats were obtained using the CAS (chronic acute combining stress model) method. Comparative bioinformatics analysis of the proteomic data was analyzed using MaxQuant software, Perseus software, online tools DAVID, VENNY and STRING. Functional enrichment and network analyses revealed a close relationship between IBS-D and several biological processes including energy metabolism, muscular excitation/contraction, and both traditional acupuncture and syndrome differentiation acupuncture can reverse the impairments of normal energy metabolism. Moreover, the syndrome differentiation acupuncture can regulate the protein cluster relating inflammation, wound repair and cell protection against oxidative stress which is associated with acupuncture analgesic effect. Differentially expressed proteins Atp5a1 and Bpnt1 were selected as representative proteins and subjected to western blotting. In conclusion, our study provides further insight into the pathological and molecular mechanisms of IBS-D and acupuncture treatments, and serves as an experimental basis for clinical applications.
