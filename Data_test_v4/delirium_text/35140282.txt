35140282|a|Neuroinflammation after surgery and its contribution to peri-operative neurocognitive disorders (PND) is not well understood. Studying the association between central and peripheral cytokines and neuroinflammation is a prelude to the development of treatments for PND. Here, we investigate the hypotheses that there is a greater cytokine response in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) than plasma after orthopaedic surgery, and that plasma cytokine levels are directly related to CSF cytokine levels, indicating that plasma cytokine levels may have potential as biomarkers of neuroinflammation. Patients admitted with a fractured neck of femur were invited to participate in this study. Participants had a spinal catheter inserted just prior to induction of anaesthesia. Samples of blood and CSF were taken before, immediately after, and on the first day following emergency surgery. The catheter was then removed. Samples were analysed for the presence of ten cytokines by immunoassay. A spinal catheter was successfully inserted in 11 participants during the 18-month study period. Five plasma cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70 and IL-13) rose significantly following surgery, whereas all ten CSF cytokines rose significantly (IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) (adjusted-p < 0.05). Central (CSF) cytokine levels were consistently higher than their peripheral (plasma) counterparts after surgery, with some patients having a particularly marked neuroinflammatory response. The greatest increases occurred in IL-8 in CSF and IL-6 in plasma. There were significant, strong positive correlations between several of the measured cytokines in the CSF after surgery, but far fewer in plasma. There was no significant correlation between cytokine levels in the plasma and CSF at each of the three time points. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse paired samples of plasma and CSF for cytokine levels before and after emergency orthopaedic surgery. This study demonstrates that following surgery for a fractured neck of femur, there is a far greater rise in cytokines in the CSF compared to plasma. The lack of correlation between peripheral and central cytokines suggests measurement of peripheral cytokines are not necessarily related to which patients may have a large neuroinflammatory response.
