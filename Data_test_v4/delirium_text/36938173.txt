36938173|t|Heyde Syndrome Complicated by Essential Thrombocythemia: A Case Report.
36938173|a|Heyde syndrome is a multisystem disorder characterized by the triad of aortic stenosis (AS), gastrointestinal bleeding, and acquired von Willebrand syndrome. Age-related degeneration is the most common cause of aortic stenosis and is frequently encountered in today's aging society. Approximately 20% of patients with severe aortic stenosis have Heyde syndrome. We encountered an older patient with primary thrombocytosis who was brought to a rural community hospital with bloody stools and was diagnosed with bleeding from an intestinal arteriovenous malformation. A final diagnosis of Heyde syndrome was made based on the presence of severe aortic stenosis and the presence of schistocytes in peripheral blood smears. Valvular diseases can complicate chronic hematological diseases. When the rapid progression of anemia and segmented red blood cells in the peripheral blood are observed in patients with severe aortic stenosis, Heyde syndrome should be considered based on peripheral blood smears and clinical course.
