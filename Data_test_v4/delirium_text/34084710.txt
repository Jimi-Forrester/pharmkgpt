34084710|t|Point of Care Ultrasound in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: One Modality Helping Multiple Specialties.
34084710|a|After the detection of novel coronavirus (2019) as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, more than 10 million confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported around the globe. In the COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU), the use of stethoscope is minimal for obvious reasons. Shifting of COVID-19 patients out of ICU setup increases the risk of transmission of infection to health-care workers as well as jeopardizes the safety of patients. Hence, diagnostic imaging has emerged as a fundamental component of the current management of COVID-19. Lung ultrasound (LUS) imaging has become a safe bedside imaging alternative that does not expose the patient to radiation and minimizes the risk of contamination. Ultrasound (USG) can be used to scan almost all vital organs (heart, kidney, vascular, brain, etc.) and also help in rapid decision-making regarding the management of COVID-19 patients. In this note, we review the current state of the art of LUS in evaluating pulmonary changes induced by COVID-19. The goal is to identify characteristic sonographic findings most suited for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia infections as well as to assess the impact of infection on other organs and utilizing the same in the management of COVID patients without compromising on the safety of patient or health-care provider.
