36788134|t|Pharmacological prevention of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a bayesian network meta-analysis.
36788134|a|The incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is very high and increases morbidity and mortality. The possibility of pharmacological means to reduce its incidence is very attractive. At present, there is still no clear demonstration that any drug can prevent postoperative delirium in these patients. The aim of this Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was to evaluate whether there is evidence that a drug is effective in reducing the incidence of POD in cardiac surgical patients. Our NMA showed that preoperative ketamine at subanesthetic doses can significantly reduce the incidence of POD. Risperidone also decreases the incidence of POD, but not significantly.
