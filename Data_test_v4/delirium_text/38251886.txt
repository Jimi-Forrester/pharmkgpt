38251886|a|Alcohol-associated liver disease is a common and severe sequela of excessive alcohol use; effective treatment requires attention to both liver disease and underlying alcohol use disorder (AUD). Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) can be dangerous, is a common barrier to AUD recovery, and may complicate inpatient admissions for liver-related complications. Hepatologists can address these comorbid conditions by learning to accurately stage alcohol-associated liver disease, identify AUD using standardized screening tools (eg, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test), and assess risk for and symptoms of AWS. Depending on the severity, alcohol withdrawal often merits admission to a monitored setting, where symptom-triggered administration of benzodiazepines based on standardized scoring protocols is often the most effective approach to management. For patients with severe liver disease, selection of benzodiazepines with less dependence on hepatic metabolism (eg, lorazepam) is advisable. Severe alcohol withdrawal often requires a "front-loaded" approach with higher dosing, as well as intensive monitoring. Distinguishing between alcohol withdrawal delirium and HE is important, though it can be difficult, and can be guided by differentiating clinical characteristics, including time to onset and activity level. There is little data on the use of adjuvant medications, including anticonvulsants, dexmedetomidine, or propofol, in this patient population. Beyond the treatment of AWS, inpatient admission and outpatient hepatology visits offer opportunities to engage in planning for ongoing management of AUD, including initiation of medications for AUD and referral to additional recovery supports. Hepatologists trained to identify AUD, alcohol-associated liver disease, and risk for AWS can proactively address these issues, ensuring that patients' AWS is managed safely and effectively and supporting planning for long-term recovery.
