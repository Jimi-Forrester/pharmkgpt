31861721|a|Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are a family of thioredoxin peroxidases. Accumulating evidence suggests that changes in the expression of Prxs may be involved in neurodegenerative diseases pathology. However, the expression and function of Prxs in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. Here, we showed that Prx5 was the most downregulated of the six Prx subtypes in dopaminergic (DA) neurons in rotenone-induced cellular and rat models of PD, suggesting possible roles in regulating their survival. Depletion of Prx5 sensitized SH-SY5Y DA neuronal cells to rotenone-induced apoptosis. The extent of mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation was increased by Prx5 loss. Furthermore, Prx5 knockdown enhanced the induction of PUMA by rotenone through a p53-dependent mechanism. Using RNA interference approaches, we demonstrated that the p53/PUMA signaling was essential for Prx5 silencing-exacerbated mitochondria-driven apoptosis. Additionally, downregulation of Prx5 augmented rotenone-induced DNA damage manifested as induction of phosphorylated histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX) and activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. The pharmacological inactivation of ATM revealed that ATM was integral to p53 activation by DNA damage. These findings provided a novel link between Prx5 and DNA damage-triggered ATM/p53/PUMA signaling in a rotenone-induced PD model. Thus, Prx5 might play an important role in protection against rotenone-induced DA neurodegeneration.
