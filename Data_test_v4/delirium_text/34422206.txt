34422206|a|Although the interplay between mitochondria and ER has been identified as a crucial regulator of cellular homeostasis, the pathogenic impact of alterations in mitochondria-ER contact sites (MERCS) during myocardial postischemic reperfusion (I/R) injury remains incompletely understood. Therefore, in our study, we explored the beneficial role played by melatonin in protecting cardiomyocytes against reperfusion injury via stabilizing mitochondria-ER interaction. In vitro exposure of H9C2 rat cardiomyocytes to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) augmented mitochondrial ROS synthesis, suppressed both mitochondrial potential and ATP generation, and increased the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening rate. Furthermore, H/R exposure upregulated the protein content of CHOP and caspase-12, two markers of ER stress, and enhanced the transcription of main MERCS tethering proteins, namely, Fis1, BAP31, Mfn2, and IP3R. Interestingly, all the above changes could be attenuated or reversed by melatonin treatment. Suggesting that melatonin-induced cardioprotection works through normalization of mitochondria-ER interaction, overexpression of IP3R abolished the protective actions offered by melatonin on mitochondria-ER fitness. These results expand our knowledge on the cardioprotective actions of melatonin during myocardial postischemic reperfusion damage and suggest that novel, more effective treatments for acute myocardial reperfusion injury might be achieved through modulation of mitochondria-ER interaction in cardiac cells.
