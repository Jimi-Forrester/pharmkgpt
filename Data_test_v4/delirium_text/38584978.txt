38584978|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread neurodegenerative disorder with a significant global impact, affecting approximately 50 million individuals, and projections estimate that up to 152 million people will be affected by 2050. AD is characterized by beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, leading to cognitive decline. Summary: Recent research on AD has made significant strides, including the development of an "amyloid clock" biomarker that tracks AD progression through positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Surf4 and other genes have been discovered to play a role in regulating beta-amyloid toxicity, while inhibiting the enzyme hexokinase-2 has shown positive results in preclinical studies. New brain mapping techniques have identified early brain-based causes of cognitive changes in AD, and biomarkers such as neuronal pentraxin protein Nptx2 and astrocytic 7-subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (7nAChRs) show potential for early detection. Other approaches, such as replenishing the enzyme Tip60, selectively degrading the modified protein p-p38 with PRZ-18002, and targeting the protein voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1), have shown promise in enhancing cognitive function and preventing pathophysiological alterations linked to AD. Baseline blood samples and other biomarkers such as urine formic acid, p-tau 198, microRNAs, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) have also been discovered for early detection and intervention of AD. Additionally, recent FDA approvals for medications such as aducanumab and lecanemab provide options for reducing AD symptoms and improving function, while clinical trials for dementia vaccines show promise for the nasal and beta-amyloid 40 vaccines as well as vaccinations targeting tau. Key Messages: These advancements in AD research, including biomarker discovery and the development of disease-modifying treatments, are crucial steps towards improving the lives of those affected by AD and finding a cure for this debilitating disease.
