37864576|a|BACKGROUND: The incidence of postoperative complications after gastrectomy for gastric cancer is not well known. More population-based studies using established complication classifications are needed for international comparison. The aim of this study was to evaluate the population-based incidence of postoperative complications after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. METHODS: This population-based study based on the Finnish National Esophago-Gastric Cancer Cohort included all patients at least 18 years of age undergoing gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma in Finland during 2005-2016. The occurrence of complications 30 and 90 days after surgery was graded based on the Esophagectomy Complications Consensus Group definitions and the severity of complications was assessed using the Clavien-Dindo scale. RESULTS: This study included a total of 2196 patients. Postoperative complications occurred in 906 (41.3 per cent) of patients during 30 days after surgery and in 946 (43.1 per cent) during 90 days after surgery. Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher complications occurred in 375 (17.1 per cent) of patients. The most common complications 90 days after surgery by Esophagectomy Complications Consensus Group upper-level categories were gastrointestinal (n = 438; 19.9 per cent), including anastomotic leak, infectious (n = 377; 17.2 per cent) and pulmonary (n = 335; 15.3 per cent) complications. Postoperative mortality rate was occurred in 72 (3.3 per cent) patients within 30 days and in 161 (7.3 per cent) patients within 90 days after surgery. The median duration of postoperative hospital stay was 9 days (interquartile range 4-14). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative complications are common across all types of gastrectomy and the majority occur during the first 30 postoperative days. This study informs the patients and caregivers of the expected outcomes of gastrectomy.
