33431221|a|The locus coeruleus (LC) is the major source of noradrenaline, which plays a key role in cognition. We aimed to detect the extent of the LC signal attenuation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients using a neuromelanin (NM)-sensitive MRI and how it may correlate with inflammatory and autonomic measures. An individually matched case-control study design was employed. 24 patients with AD and 24 age and gender matched controls with no cognitive impairment were recruited. The primary outcome measure was the LC signal intensity indicated by the LC contrast ratio (CR) and measured by the NM-sensitive MRI. Secondary outcome measures included neuropsychometric tests of cognitive state, peripheral inflammatory and autonomic measures. Conditional logistic regression analysis revealed a significant 22% LC-CR reduction in the AD group compared with the control group. However, there was no statistical significance from inflammatory or autonomic measures. This is the largest individually-matched case-control study to visualise the LC degeneration in AD patients. The study revealed significant LC degeneration which holds promise to stratify patients who may benefit from treatment targeting noradrenergic dysfunction.
