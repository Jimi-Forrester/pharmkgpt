39588059|a|Purpose: Postinduction hypotension (PIH), occurring between anaesthesia induction and surgical incision, is particularly concerning in older adults undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) due to their multiple comorbidities and age-related cardiovascular changes. This study aimed to assess the relationship between PIH and postoperative adverse events in TAVR patients. Patients and Methods: A total of 777 patients underwent TAVR at The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine from January 1, 2020 to February 28, 2023. Four thresholds of MAP were defined, including two absolute thresholds (<65, <60 mmHg) and two relative thresholds (20% and 30% lower than baseline). The relationships between PIH and the composite outcome, which included all-cause in-hospital mortality, stroke, acute kidney injury (AKI), and myocardial infarction (MI), were examined using unadjusted analysis, 1:1 propensity score matching(PSM), and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Results: A total of 643 older adults were included in the study ultimately. The composite outcome incidence was significantly greater in patients with PIH than in those without PIH (relative risk [RR]: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.66-3.73 for MAP <60 mmHg; RR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.14-2.46 for a >30% decrease from baseline). PIH was significantly associated with stroke (RR: 5.22, 95% CI: 1.98-17.75) and AKI (RR: 2.82, 95% CI: 1.73-4.79) with a MAP <60 mmHg. Conclusion: PIH significantly increases the risk of composite outcomes, especially stroke and AKI, in TAVR patients.
