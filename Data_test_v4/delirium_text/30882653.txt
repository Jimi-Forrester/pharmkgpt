30882653|t|ABCDE and ABCDEF care bundles: A systematic review protocol of the implementation process in intensive care units.
30882653|a|BACKGROUND: The awakening and breathing coordination of daily sedation and ventilator removal trials, delirium monitoring and management, and early mobility and exercise (ABCDE) and assessment, prevent and manage pain, both spontaneous awakening and spontaneous breathing trials, choice of analgesia and sedation, assess, prevent and manage delirium, early mobility and exercise, family engagement (ABCDEF) bundles are part of the science of the liberation of the intensive care unit (ICU). There are not enough studies that have evaluated the effectiveness and safety of the implementation of these bundles. This study will analyze the implementation process, estimate their effectiveness and safety, and identify barriers, facilitators and attitudes that have influenced the implementation process. METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative studies will be eligible for our systematic review with adult patients who have been exposed to the implementation of the ABCDE or ABCDEF bundles compared to the usual care in the ICU. In order to search the implementation interventions of the bundles, we will search electronically: MEDLINE (PubMed); Excerpta Medica Database (Ovid); Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (EBSCO); The Cochrane Library (Wiley); Web of Science; Virtual Health Library; and OpenGrey. We will not impose any language restrictions or publication status. Outcomes of interest include ICU and hospital length of stay; mechanical ventilation time; incidence and prevalence of delirium or coma; level of agitation and sedation; early mobilization; mortality in ICU and hospital; change in perception, attitude or behavior of the stakeholders; and change in knowledge of health professionals. The team of reviewers will independently screen search results, extract data from eligible studies, and assess risk of bias. Disagreements between the reviewers will be solved through consensus or arbitration by a third-party investigator. To assess the quality and risk of bias in randomized and quasi-randomized trials we will use the domain-based evaluation recommended by The Cochrane Handbook. Studies with other methodological designs will be evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Tools developed by The Joanna Briggs Institute. Other instruments may be used, if necessary. RESULTS: The evidence derived from this study will increase the knowledge of effectiveness and safety of the implementation process of ABCDE and ABCDEF bundles. CONCLUSION: The results could guide patients and healthcare practitioners by helping to facilitate evidence-based shared care decision making. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42019121307.
