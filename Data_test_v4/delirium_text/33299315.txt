33299315|t|Rehospitalization Risk of Receptor-Affinity Profile in Antipsychotic Drug Treatment: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis Using a Japanese Employment-Based Health Insurance Database.
33299315|a|PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine whether there is a difference in the risk of rehospitalization when antipsychotics are classified into two groups treated using drugs with a higher or lower affinity to H1 or alpha1 receptors than to D2 receptors (histamine H1 receptors, adrenaline alpha1 receptors [HA] high- and HA low-affinity drug group, respectively) based on affinity to receptors related to sedation using a nationwide insurance claims database in Japan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified eligible patients by the following two criteria: (i) hospitalization due to schizophrenia (International Classification of Disease [ICD]-10 code: F20 or F25) in psychiatric wards between January 1st, 2005 and August 31st, 2017, and (ii) administration of HA high- or HA low-affinity drugs in the next month after discharge from the earliest hospitalization due to schizophrenia (index month). The primary endpoint was rehospitalization due to schizophrenia. The secondary endpoints were (i) involuntary rehospitalization, (ii) concomitant use of anxiolytics/hypnotics, mood stabilizers, and antiparkinsonian drugs, (iii) all-cause death, and (iv) medication discontinuation. Propensity score (PS) matching analysis was applied, and the hazard ratio (HR) of the event rate in the HA high-affinity drug group relative to the HA low-affinity drug group was calculated using Cox's proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Two thousand nine hundred and forty patients were identified as eligible patients. Among PS-matched patients (819 in each group), the HR in the HA high-affinity drug group compared with the HA low-affinity drug group was 1.018 (0.822-1.260, P = 0.870). Other outcomes did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSION: No significant difference was observed in the rehospitalization risk due to schizophrenia associated with HA high-affinity antipsychotic drugs. Although this study was a retrospective PS-matched cohort study, the possibility of masking of the rehospitalization risk cannot be excluded because more than 80% of the patients were administered an anxiolytic/hypnotic at the time of admission.
