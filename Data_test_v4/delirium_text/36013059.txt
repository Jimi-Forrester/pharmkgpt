36013059|a|Approximately half of the world's population is infected with Helicobacter pylori, which causes gastric disease. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported that H. pylori may also have extragastric manifestations such as hematologic diseases, including chronic immune thrombocytopenia (cITP). However, the molecular mechanisms by which H. pylori induces cITP remain unclear, and may involve the host immune response, bacterial strain diversity, and delivery of bacterial molecules to the host blood vessels. This review discusses the important pathophysiological mechanisms by which H. pylori potentially contributes to the development of cITP in infected patients.
