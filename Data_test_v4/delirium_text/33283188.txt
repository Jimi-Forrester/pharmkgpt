33283188|t|The Intersection between COVID-19, the Gene Family of ACE2 and Alzheimer's Disease.
33283188|a|We reviewed factors that might influence COVID-19 outcomes (eg, neurological symptoms), including the link to Alzheimer's disease. Since the virus triggers COVID-19 infection through binding to ACE2, we focused on the ACE2 gene family, including ACE. Both ACE2 and ACE are involved in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In general, ACE causes inflammation and vasoconstriction, while ACE2 leads to anti-inflammation activity and vasodilation. The disturbed balance between these counter-regulatory pathways could influence susceptibility to COVID-19. Notably, dysregulation of the RAS-equilibrium contributes to Alzheimer's disease. Differences in the incidence and symptoms of COVID-19 in diverse populations could be attributed to variability in the human genome. For example, ACE and ACE2 variations could modify the outcome of COVID-19 in different populations. It would be important to conduct genome-wide studies to detect variants influencing COVID-19 presentation, with a special focus on variants affecting immune-related pathways and expression of RAS-related genes.
