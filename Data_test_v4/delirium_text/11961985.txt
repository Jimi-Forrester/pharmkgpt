RESULTS: Two well-known risks for developing Alzheimer's disease are established: advanced age and genetic factors. Mutations linked to autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease are known in chromosomes 21, 14 and 1. A non-mendelian Alzheimer's disease with complex aetiology is linked to the apolipoprotein E in chromosome 19. INTERPRETATION: Children of patients with Alzheimer's disease have a three to four fold increased risk of developing the disease compared to a person without a parent with Alzheimer's disease. The diagnostic benefit of apolipoprotein E genotyping is still uncertain.
