33374296|a|Recently, the gut microbiome has gained considerable interest as one of the major contributors to the pathogenesis of multi-system inflammatory disorders. Several studies have suggested that the gut microbiota plays a role in modulating complex signaling pathways, predominantly via the bidirectional gut-brain-axis (GBA). Subsequent in vivo studies have demonstrated the direct role of altered gut microbes and metabolites in the progression of neurodevelopmental diseases. This review will discuss the most recent advancements in our understanding of the gut microbiome's clinical significance in regulating blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, immunological function, and neurobiological development. In particular, we address the potentially causal role of GBA dysregulation in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through compromising the BBB and immunological abnormalities. A thorough understanding of the complex signaling interactions between gut microbes, metabolites, neural development, immune mediators, and neurobiological functionality will facilitate the development of targeted therapeutic modalities to better understand, prevent, and treat ASD.
