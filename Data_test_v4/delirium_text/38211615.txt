38211615|t|Fluid Status Vulnerability in Older Adults.
38211615|a|There is a growing body of evidence about physiological changes with age that impact fluid and electrolyte balance. It is important that infusion nurses have knowledge in managing care for geriatric patients so they can identify these changes when they are exhibited. Knowing how to minimize the effect of these changes on the health of older adults is critical. The infusion nurse with knowledge of geriatric-focused care can avoid complications and critical illness in older adults. In addition, it is important to provide specific patient education that is grounded in geriatric best practices. This information will assist older adults to better protect themselves from dehydration, kidney injury, and other complications associated with fluid balance, such as delirium. This article reviews the literature on specific changes with aging that predispose older adults to adverse complications with fluid imbalance. New technology in geriatrics that can improve management of fluid status, such as dehydration and electrolyte monitors, are also discussed. This review included searches of the Medline /PubMed  Database using MeSH terms (National Library of Medicine). Search terms included the following: aging-biological; aging kidney; water-electrolyte imbalance; dehydration; hypo-hypernatremia; hypo-hyperkalemia; delirium; wearable technology; and hydration monitors.
