29290138|t|Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans as Relays of Neuroinflammation.
29290138|a|Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are implicated as inflammatory mediators in a variety of settings, including chemokine activation, which is required to recruit circulating leukocytes to infection sites. Heparan sulfate (HS) polysaccharide chains are highly interactive and serve co-receptor roles in multiple ligand:receptor interactions. HS may also serve as a storage depot, sequestering ligands such as cytokines and restricting their access to binding partners. Heparanase, through its ability to fragment HS chains, is a key regulator of HS function and has featured prominently in studies of HS's involvement in inflammatory processes. This review focuses on recent discoveries regarding the role of HSPGs, HS, and heparanase during inflammation, with particular focus on the brain. HS chains emerge as critical go-betweens in multiple aspects of the inflammatory response-relaying signals between receptors and cells. The molecular interactions proposed to occur between HSPGs and the pathogen receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) are discussed, and we summarize some of the contrasting roles that HS and heparanase have been assigned in diseases associated with chronic inflammatory states, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). We conclude by briefly discussing how current knowledge could potentially be applied to augment HS-mediated events during sustained neuroinflammation, which contributes to neurodegeneration in AD.
