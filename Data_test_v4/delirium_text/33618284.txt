33618284|t|Combination of delirium and coma predicts psychiatric symptoms at twelve months in critically ill patients: A longitudinal cohort study.
33618284|a|PURPOSE: We aimed to determine any associations between delirium and comas during intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and long-term psychiatric symptoms and disability affecting activity of daily living (ADL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we enrolled critically ill adult patients that were emergently admitted to an ICU. We assessed psychiatric symptoms and disability affecting ADL at three and twelve months after ICU discharge. RESULTS: Among the 81 and the 47 patients that responded to the questionnaires at three and twelve months, 22 (27%) and 13 (28%) patients experienced delirium, respectively. During their ICU stay, 28 (35%) and 21 (45%) had been in comas, respectively. At three and twelve months, 51 (63%) and 23 (49%) of patients experienced composite psychiatric symptoms or disability affecting ADL, respectively. After adjusting predefined confounders, the combination of delirium and comas was an independent risk factor for the presence of composite psychiatric symptoms or disability affecting ADL (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.38; 1.10-10.38 at three months; aOR 8.28; 1.48-46.46 at twelve months). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill adults, combination of delirium and comas during ICU stay is a predictor of psychiatric symptoms or ADL disability. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN Clinical Trial Registry no.
