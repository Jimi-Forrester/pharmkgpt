38926642|a|BACKGROUND: Aging is a prominent risk factor for diverse diseases; therefore, an in-depth understanding of its physiological mechanisms is required. Nonhuman primates, which share the closest genetic relationship with humans, serve as an ideal model for exploring the complex aging process. However, the potential of the nonhuman primate animal model in the screening of human aging markers is still not fully exploited. Multiomics analysis of nonhuman primate peripheral blood offers a promising approach to evaluate new therapies and biomarkers. This study explores aging-related biomarker through multilayer omics, including transcriptomics (mRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA) and proteomics (serum and serum-derived exosomes) in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). RESULTS: Our findings reveal that, unlike mRNAs and circRNAs, highly expressed lncRNAs are abundant during the key aging period and are associated with cancer pathways. Comparative analysis highlighted exosomal proteins contain more types of proteins than serum proteins, indicating that serum-derived exosomes primarily regulate aging through metabolic pathways. Finally, eight candidate aging biomarkers were identified, which may serve as blood-based indicators for detecting age-related brain changes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of nonhuman primate blood transcriptomes and proteomes, offering novel insights into the aging mechanisms for preventing or treating age-related diseases.
