38528626|a|BACKGROUND: Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a form of dementia that frequently displays significant visual dysfunction and relatively preserved cognitive and executive functions, thus hindering early diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to investigate possible fundus markers in PCA patients and compare them with those of typical Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients to seek potential diagnostic patterns. METHODS: Age-matched PCA and AD patients and healthy controls (HC) completed optometry, intraocular pressure measurement, neuropsychologic assessments, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) examination in one visit. Overall, six outcomes of thicknesses of various retinal layers and seven outcomes of the retinal microvascular network were calculated. After adjusting for age, sex, and years of education, the OCT and OCTA results were analyzed using analysis of covariance and generalized linear models. Correlation analyses were performed using Spearman correlation, and ROC curves were plotted. RESULTS: Twelve PCA patients, nineteen AD patients, and thirty HC, aged 45-80 years were included. Fifty HC, thirty AD, and twenty PCA eyes were available for foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area analysis; forty-nine HC, thirty-four AD, and eighteen PCA eyes were available for OCT and OCTA assessments. PCA patients had thinner retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer + inner plexiform layer than HC in the 0-3 mm circle and 1-3 mm ring. Few structural differences were observed between the AD group and the other two groups. The flow area of the superficial capillary plexus and the intermediate capillary plexus was smaller in the PCA group than in the HC group in the 0-1 mm circle, 0-3 mm circle. MMSE performed better than any combination of optical parameters in identifying AD and PCA from HC (AUC = 1), while the combination of MoCA, retinal thickness and vascular density of ICP in the 1-3 mm ring, with flow area of ICP in the 0-1 mm circle showed the strongest ability to distinguish PCA from AD (AUC = 0.944). CONCLUSIONS: PCA patients exhibited similar impairment patterns to AD patients in the fundus structure and microvascular network. OCTA may aid in the non-invasive detection of AD and PCA, but still remains to be substantiated.
