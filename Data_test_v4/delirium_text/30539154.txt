30539154|t|Isolated hip fracture in the elderly and time to surgery: is there an outcome difference?
30539154|a|BACKGROUND: Early operative intervention for hip fractures in the elderly is advised to reduce mortality and morbidity. Postoperative complications impose a significant burden on patient outcomes and cost of medical care. Our aim was to determine the relationship between time to surgery and postoperative complications/mortality in patients with hip fracture. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of data collected from our institution's trauma registry for patients >=65 years old with isolated hip fracture and subsequent surgery from 2015 to 2017. Patients were stratified into two groups based on time to surgery after admission: group 1: <48 hours versus group 2: >48 hours. Demographic variables included age, gender, race, and Injury Severity Score (ISS). The outcome variables included intensive care unit length of stay (ICU-LOS), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) rate, mortality, and 30-day readmission rates. Analysis of variance was used for analysis, with significance defined as a p value <0.05. RESULTS: A total of 485 patients with isolated hip fracture required surgical intervention. Of those, 460 had surgery <48 hours and 25 had surgery >48 hours postadmission. The average ISS was the same in both groups. The average ICU-LOS was significantly higher in the >48 hours group compared with the <48 hours group (4.0 vs. 2.0, p<0.0002). There was no statistically significant difference between groups when comparing DVTand PE rate, 30-day readmission, or mortality rates. DISCUSSION: Time to surgery may affect overall ICU-LOS in patients with hip fracture requiring surgical intervention. Time to surgery does not affect complication rates, 30-day readmission, or mortality. Future research should investigate long-term outcomes such as functional status and disability-adjusted life years. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III. Retrospective/ prognostic cohort study.
