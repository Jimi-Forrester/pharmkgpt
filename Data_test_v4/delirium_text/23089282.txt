23089282|a|A review of pathogenic findings in Alzheimer's brains and the functional consequences of altered insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) input to the brain suggest the association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the disrupted IGF1 signaling. Recently, the identification of polymorphism rs972936 that was associated with both an increased risk of AD and high circulating levels of IGF1 was reported in Southern European population. In order to evaluate the involvement of the IGF1 polymorphism in the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Chinese, we performed an independent case-control association study in a Han Chinese population (794 LOAD cases and 796 controls). There were significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies between LOAD cases and controls (genotype P = 0.006, allele P = 0.047). The T allele of rs972936 demonstrated a 1.16-fold risk for developing LOAD when compared with the C allele, which diverges to the report in the Caucasian population. After stratification by apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4-carrying status, rs972936 polymorphism was only significantly associated with LOAD in non-ApoE e4 allele carriers (genotype P = 0.002, allele P = 0.039). Multivariate logistic regression analysis also conferred this positive association between the SNP rs972936 and LOAD in the recessive and additive model after adjustment for age, gender, and the ApoE e4 carrier status. These results suggest that IGF1 polymorphism has a possible role in changing the genetic susceptibility to LOAD in a Han Chinese population.
