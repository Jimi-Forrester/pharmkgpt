38167027|a|NAD(P)H Quinone Dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of neuronal function and synaptic plasticity, cellular adaptation to oxidative stress, neuroinflammatory and degenerative processes, and tumorigenesis in the central nervous system (CNS). Impairment of the NQO1 activity in the CNS can result in abnormal neurotransmitter release and clearance, increased oxidative stress, and aggravated cellular injury/death. Furthermore, it can cause disturbances in neural circuit function and synaptic neurotransmission. The abnormalities of NQO1 enzyme activity have been linked to the pathophysiological mechanisms of multiple neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular disease, traumatic brain injury, and brain malignancy. NQO1 contributes to various dimensions of tumorigenesis and treatment response in various brain tumors. The precise mechanisms through which abnormalities in NQO1 function contribute to these neurological disorders continue to be a subject of ongoing research. Building upon the existing knowledge, the present study reviews current investigations describing the role of NQO1 dysregulations in various neurological disorders. This study emphasizes the potential of NQO1 as a biomarker in diagnostic and prognostic approaches, as well as its suitability as a target for drug development strategies in neurological disorders.
