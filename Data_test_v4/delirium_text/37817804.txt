37817804|a|Accumulating evidence suggests a gain of elusive toxicity in pathogenically mutated PFN1. The prominence of PFN1 aggregates as a pivotal pathological hallmark in PFN1 transgenic rats underscores the crucial involvement of protein aggregation in the initiation and progression of neurodegeneration. Detergent-insoluble materials were extracted from the spinal cords of paralyzed rats afflicted with ALS and were intramuscularly administered to asymptomatic recipient rats expressing mutant PFN1, resulting in an accelerated development of PFN1 inclusions and ALS-like phenotypes. This effect diminished when the extracts derived from wildtype PFN1 transgenic rats were employed, as detergent-insoluble PFN1 was detected exclusively in mutant PFN1 transgenic rats. Consequently, the factor influencing the progression of ALS pathology in recipient rats is likely associated with the presence of detergent-insoluble PFN1 within the extracted materials. Noteworthy is the absence of disease course modification upon administering detergent-insoluble extracts to rats that already displayed PFN1 inclusions, suggesting a seeding rather than augmenting role of such extracts in initiating neuropathological changes. Remarkably, pathogenic PFN1 exhibited an enhanced affinity for the molecular chaperone DNAJB6, leading to the sequestration of DNAJB6 within protein inclusions, thereby depleting its availability for cellular functions. These findings shed light on a novel mechanism that underscores the prion-like characteristics of pathogenic PFN1 in driving neurodegeneration in the context of PFN1-related ALS.
