26017149|t|Cerebral beta-Amyloidosis in Mice Investigated by Ultramicroscopy.
26017149|a|Alzheimer s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. AD neuropathology is characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular beta-amyloid deposits in the brain. To elucidate the complexity of AD pathogenesis a variety of transgenic mouse models have been generated. An ideal imaging system for monitoring beta-amyloid plaque deposition in the brain of these animals should allow 3D-reconstructions of beta-amyloid plaques via a single scan of an uncropped brain. Ultramicroscopy makes this possible by replacing mechanical slicing in standard histology by optical sectioning. It allows a time efficient analysis of the amyloid plaque distribution in the entire mouse brain with 3D cellular resolution. We herein labeled beta-amyloid deposits in a transgenic mouse model of cerebral beta-amyloidosis (APPPS1 transgenic mice) with two intraperitoneal injections of the amyloid-binding fluorescent dye methoxy-X04. Upon postmortem analysis the total number of beta-amyloid plaques, the beta-amyloid load (volume percent) and the amyloid plaque size distributions were measured in the frontal cortex of two age groups (2.5 versus 7-8.5 month old mice). Applying ultramicroscopy we found in a proof-of-principle study that the number of beta-amyloid plaques increases with age. In our experiments we further observed an increase of large plaques in the older age group of mice. We demonstrate that ultramicroscopy is a fast, and accurate analysis technique for studying beta-amyloid lesions in transgenic mice allowing the 3D staging of beta-amyloid plaque development. This in turn is the basis to study neural network degeneration upon cerebral beta-amyloidosis and to assess Abeta-targeting therapeutics.
