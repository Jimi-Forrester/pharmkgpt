32979504|t|Gut microbiota and old age: Modulating factors and interventions for healthy longevity.
32979504|a|Our gut microbiota is a complex and dynamic ecosystem with a paramount role in shaping our metabolic and immunological functions. Recent research suggests that aging may negatively affect the composition, diversity, and function of our microbiota mainly due to alterations in diet and immunologic reactivity (i.e. immunosenescence), and increased incidence of certain diseases and, therefore, increased exposure to certain medication (e.g. antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors). In turn, this aging-related gut dysbiosis may contribute to the initiation and/or progress of other metabolic diseases, and consequently, to a decrease in healthy longevity. On the positive side, promising therapeutic interventions, such as diet supplementation with prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation, aimed to counteract these aging-related deleterious consequences, could improve our health, and extend our healthy lifespan. In this context, the current review aims to assess the latest progress in identifying the key elements affecting the gut microbiota of the older adults and their mechanism of action, and the effectiveness of the therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring the diversity and healthy functions of the gut microbiota in older individuals.
