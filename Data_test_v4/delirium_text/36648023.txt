36648023|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to investigate the protective effects of nicotinamide riboside on oxidative stress in an experimental sepsis model created by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were divided into 3 groups randomly: Sham operated (control) group, sepsis (CLP+Saline) group and nicotinamide riboside -treated (CLP+NR) group. Sepsis model induced cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was applied in CLP+Saline group rats. Animals in the CLP+NR group were administered intraperitoneally nicotinamide riboside (500 mg/kg). Tissue specimens of rats were biocemically calculated activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Ovarian tissues of all rats were histopathologically evaluated. RESULTS: CAT, SOD and GSH-Px activities were lower in the sepsis group as compared to the sham operated (control) group. In nicotinamide riboside -treated (CLP+NR) group SOD activity were significantly increased than control and sepsis (CLP+Saline) group (P<0.05). In CLP+ NR group, MPO activities and mean MDA concentration of ovarian tissue were lower than in CLP+Saline group (P<0.05). The light microscopic assesment revealed that ovarian tissue was protected, and inflammation and interstitial edema decreased in CLP+ NR group. The follicular damage findings were notably decreased in CLP+NR group in comparison with CLP+Saline group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that nicotinamide riboside diminished ovarian injury in sepsis via inhibition of tissue infiltration and incresing of endogenous antioxidant capacity. Nicotinamide Riboside administration may represent a new treatment approache for the prevention of sepsis induced ovarian injury.
