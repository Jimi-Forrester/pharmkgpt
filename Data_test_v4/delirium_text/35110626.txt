35110626|t|Expression ratio of circular to linear ANRIL in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease.
35110626|a|Atherosclerotic lesions of the coronary arteries are still in charge of significant annual morbidity and mortality despite intense therapeutic advancements. Genome-born elements contribute substantially to the atherosclerosis process. ANRIL is one of the long non-coding RNAs with outstanding functions particularly regulation of genes involved in atherosclerosis development. In this study, we measured ANRIL expression (circular-, linear-, and circular/linear ratio) in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) compared with peers without CAD. Among hypertensive patients who were candidates of angiography, 25 subjects with CAD and the equal number without CAD were considered as the case and control groups, respectively. Different categories of data were recorded through a predefined questionnaire. Before angiography, blood samples were obtained. After RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, quantitative PCR was performed using specific primers for circular and linear ANRIL. Age and gender were not different between the groups. Most of the parameters of the lipid profile besides creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were remarkably worse in the case group. Circular ANRIL was significantly lower in the case group while linear counterparts were significantly higher in this group. Circular/linear ratio was also significantly lower in the case group. To overcome growing devastating trend of CAD, scrutinizing different factors involved in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis is a must. Atheroprotective role of circular ANRIL and atheroprogressive role of linear ANRIL were shown in our patients with hypertension.
