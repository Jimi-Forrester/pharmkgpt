37094094|t|Carbamate JNK3 Inhibitors Show Promise as Effective Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease: In Vivo Studies on Mouse Models.
37094094|a|We have been developing new inhibitors for c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We identified potential JNK3 inhibitors through pharmacodynamic optimization studies, including benzimidazole compounds 2 and 3, but their unreliable pharmacokinetic properties led us to develop carbamate inhibitors 2h and 3h. In vitro studies validated carbamate inhibitors 2h and 3h as potent and highly selective JNK3 inhibitors with favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. Oral administration of 2h and 3h to both APP/PS1 and 3xTg AD mouse models improved cognitive function, indicating their potential as effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Carbamate JNK3 inhibitor 3h, in particular, restored cognitive function to near-normal levels in the 3xTg mice model of AD and led to pTau reduction in the hippocampal tissues of 3xTg-AD mice during in vivo behavioral evaluations. We intend to further develop these carbamate JNK3 inhibitors in preclinical studies as a potential first-in-class treatment for AD.
