35200688|t|Modalities of Exercise Training in Patients with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support.
35200688|a|The aim of this qualitative systematic review is to summarize and analyze the different modalities of exercise training and its potential effects in patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. ECMO is an outbreaking, life-saving technology of the last decades which is being used as a gold standard treatment in patients with severe cardiac, respiratory or combined cardiorespiratory failure. Critically ill patients on ECMO very often present intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW); thus, leading to decreased exercise capacity and increased mortality rates. Early mobilization and physical therapy have been proven to be safe and feasible in critically ill patients on ECMO, either as a bridge to lung/heart transplantation or as a bridge to recovery. Rehabilitation has beneficial effects from the early stages in the ICU, resulting in the prevention of ICU-AW, and a decrease in episodes of delirium, the duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and mortality rates. It also improves functional ability, exercise capacity, and quality of life. Rehabilitation requires a very careful, multi-disciplinary approach from a highly specialized team from different specialties. Initial risk assessment and screening, with appropriate physical therapy planning and exercise monitoring in patients receiving ECMO therapy are crucial factors for achieving treatment goals. However, more randomized controlled trials are required in order to establish more appropriate individualized exercise training protocols.
