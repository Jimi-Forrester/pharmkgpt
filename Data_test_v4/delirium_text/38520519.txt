38520519|a|The lasting consequences of delirium in children are not well characterized. This study aimed to compare the two-month outcomes in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) survivors according to the presence of delirium. Post-hoc analysis of a single-center prospective study of mechanically ventilated (invasive ventilation or non-invasive ventilation) children followed at the CHU Sainte-Justine PICU follow-up clinic two months after PICU discharge, between October 2018 and August 2022. Delirium was defined as one or more Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD) scores >= 9. Primary outcome was survivors' quality of life and secondary outcomes were sleep and posttraumatic stress and anxiety and depression in parents. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models assessed the independent associations between delirium and outcomes while adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, diagnosis, severity of illness, PICU length of stay, and invasive mechanical ventilation. Of the 179 children included over a 47 month-period, 117 (65.4%) had delirium. Children with delirium were more commonly intubated (91.5% vs. 30.7%, p < 0.001) and had higher PELOD-2 scores (10 vs. 4, p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, delirium was associated with a decreased quality of life at 2.3 months post discharge (p = 0.03). The severity of the delirium episode (higher scores of CAPD) was associated with a higher likelihood of sleep disturbances (OR 1.13, p = 0.01) and parental anxiety (OR 1.16, p = 0.01), in addition to lower quality of life (p = 0.03).Conclusions: Two months following their PICU stay, children with delirium had a lower quality of life, suggesting a lasting effect of delirium on children and their families.
