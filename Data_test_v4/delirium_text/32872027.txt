32872027|a|INTRODUCTION: Anabolic steroids are commonly used by athletes, body builders, and young adults to improve muscle strength. Deleterious effects of anabolic steroids on physical health are well-established. Psychiatric aspects are of particular importance and include psychosis, delirium, mania, depression, and aggression. We describe the case of a young gentleman who was managed as a case of androgenic steroid induced delirium. PATIENT CONCERN: A 33-year-old gentleman presented with increased aggression, hostility, and destructive impulses. He was a regular user of testosterone propionate, testosterone cyprionate and trenbolone acetate up to 200 mg daily in injectable form. His mental status examination showed labile effect, flight of ideas and persecutory delusions. Physical examination was positive for atrophic testes. Laboratory results showed a decreased plasma testosterone level of 9.59 nmol/l (10.4-37.4 nmol/l). Sex Hormone Binding Globulin was 23.8 nmol/l (18.3-54.1 nmol/l) and bioavailable testosterone was 5.110 nmol/l (4.36-14.30 nmol/l). DIAGNOSIS: He was diagnosed as a case of anabolic steroids induced delirium. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOME: Patient was treated with regular haloperidol and quetiapine after which his sensorium, speech and behavior improved. He was discharged on haloperidol 7.5 mg and quetiapine 700 mg daily. CONCLUSION: The purpose of this case report is to emphasize on the neuropsychiatric effects and management of anabolic steroids manifested by delirium, increased aggression, hostility, and destructive impulses.
