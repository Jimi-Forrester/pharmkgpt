39265109|t|Effectiveness of the ABCDEF Bundle to Manage and Prevent Delirium: Pre- and Postintervention Quasi-Experimental Study.
39265109|a|To investigate effectiveness of the ABCDEF bundle to manage and prevent delirium. BACKGROUND: ICU delirium is a common hospital problem that 80% of critically ill patients in the ICU experience. The ABCDEF bundle is one of the tools that included in Delirium guidelines to manage critically ill patients. RESEARCH DESIGN: Pre- and post intervention a quasi-experimental design was utilized in the present study. SETTING: This study was conducted in the intensive care units of Assiut University Hospital. METHODS: A total of 60 mechanically ventilated patients were recruited using inclusion and exclusion criteria. The ABCDEF bundle was implemented every day for the first 7 days of ICU admission, and patient sedation and delirium status were assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). Sedation instrument measures were utilized in data collection. RESULTS: Significant differences were found in the incidence of delirium: 20% in the study group versus 70% in the control group. The increased mean of days without delirium ICU stay was 4.6333 in the study group and 1.1000 in the control group, with P value = .001. CONCLUSION: The mechanically ventilated patients exposed to the implementation of the ABCDE bundle experienced fewer delirium signs than before the ABCDE bundle was implemented.
