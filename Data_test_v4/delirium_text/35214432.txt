35214432|a|Previous research revealed that isotopes 13C and 18O of exhaled CO2 have the potential link with Helicobacter pylori; however, the 17O isotope has received very little attention. We developed a sensitive spectroscopic sensor for simultaneous delta13C, delta18O, and delta17O analysis of human breath CO2 based on mid-infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy with an interband cascade laser (ICL) at 4.33 mum. There was a gas cell with a small volume of less than 5 mL, and the pressure in the gas cell was precisely controlled with a standard deviation of 0.0035 Torr. Moreover, real-time breath sampling and batch operation were achieved in gas inlets. The theoretical drifts for delta13C, delta18O, and delta17O measurement caused by temperature were minimized to 0.017%, 0.024%, and 0.021%, respectively, thanks to the precise temperature control with a standard deviation of 0.0013  C. After absolute temperature correction, the error between the system responded delta-value and the reference is less than 0.3%. According to Allan variance analysis, the system precisions for delta13C, delta18O, and delta17O were 0.12%, 0.18%, and 0.47%, respectively, at 1 s integration time, which were close to the real-time measurement errors of six repeated exhalations.
