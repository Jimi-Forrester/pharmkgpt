29707120|t|miRNA-based signatures in cerebrospinal fluid as potential diagnostic tools for early stage Parkinson's disease.
29707120|a|Parkinson's Disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 1-2% of the elderly population. Its diagnosis is still based on the identification of motor symptoms when a considerable number of dopaminergic neurons are already lost. The development of translatable biomarkers for accurate diagnosis at the earliest stages of PD is of extreme interest. Several microRNAs have been associated with PD pathophysiology. Consequently, microRNAs are emerging as potential biomarkers, especially due to their presence in Cerebrospinal Fluid and peripheral circulation. This study employed small RNA sequencing, protein binding ligand assays and machine learning in a cross-sectional cohort comprising 40 early stage PD patients and 40 well-matched controls. We identified a panel comprising 5 microRNAs (Let-7f-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-125a-5p, miR-151a-3p and miR-423-5p), with 90% sensitivity, 80% specificity and 82% area under the curve (AUC) for the differentiation of the cohorts. Moreover, we combined miRNA profiles with hallmark-proteins of PD and identified a panel (miR-10b-5p, miR-22-3p, miR-151a-3p and alpha-synuclein) reaching 97% sensitivity, 90% specificity and 96% AUC. We performed a gene ontology analysis for the genes targeted by the microRNAs present in each panel and showed the likely association of the models with pathways involved in PD pathogenesis.
