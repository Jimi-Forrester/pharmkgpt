29710710|t|Neural Correlates of Sleep Disturbance in Alzheimer's Disease: Role of the Precuneus in Sleep Disturbance.
29710710|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance may affect the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the neural correlates of sleep disturbance in AD have not been fully clarified. OBJECTIVE: To examine the factors associated with sleep disturbance in AD. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in 63 patients with AD. None of the patients had been prescribed antidementia or psychoactive drugs, and all underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before medication. Sleep disturbance was defined as a score of at least 1 point on the sleep disturbance subscale of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Whole brain image analysis was performed using SPM8 and VBM8. A two-sample t-test was used to compare patients with AD with (n = 19) and without (n = 44) sleep disturbance, with age and gender included as covariates. The statistical thresholds were set to an uncorrected p-value of 0.001 at the voxel level and a corrected p-value of 0.05 at the cluster level. In addition, pineal gland volume (PGV) measured using MRI, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) assessed with the modified Fazekas scale were compared between patients with AD with and without sleep disturbance using independent group t-tests. RESULTS: In whole brain analysis, the precuneus volume in patients with AD with sleep disturbance was significantly smaller than those without sleep disturbance. There were no significant differences in PGV and WMH between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbance in AD was associated with reduction of precuneus volume. This suggests that the precuneus might be an important region in sleep disturbance in AD.
