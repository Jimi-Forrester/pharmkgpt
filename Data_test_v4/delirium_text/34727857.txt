34727857|t|Lipids as Early and Minimally Invasive Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease.
34727857|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. Specifically, typical late-onset AD is a sporadic form with a complex etiology that affects over 90% of patients. The current gold standard for AD diagnosis is based on the determination of amyloid status by analyzing cerebrospinal fluid samples or brain positron emission tomography. These procedures can be used widely as they have several disadvantages (expensive, invasive). As an alternative, blood metabolites have recently emerged as promising AD biomarkers. Small molecules that cross the compromised AD blood-brain barrier could be determined in plasma to improve clinical AD diagnosis at early stages through minimally invasive techniques. Specifically, lipids could play an important role in AD since the brain has a high lipid content, and they are present ubiquitously inside amyloid plaques. Therefore, a systematic review was performed with the aim of identifying blood lipid metabolites as potential early AD biomarkers. In conclusion, some lipid families (fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, lipid peroxidation compounds) have shown impaired levels at early AD stages. Ceramide levels were significantly higher in AD subjects, and polyunsaturated fatty acids levels were significantly lower in AD. Also, high arachidonic acid levels were found in AD patients in contrast to low sphingomyelin levels. Consequently, these lipid biomarkers could be used for minimally invasive and early AD clinical diagnosis.
