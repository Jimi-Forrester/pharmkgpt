33148081|t|Delirium on clozapine: A tale of friend turned foe-A case report.
33148081|a|Treatment resistant schizophrenia (TRS) is often encountered in clinical practice. Clozapine remains the drug of choice in the management of TRS. Several studies have shown that clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic medication to date for TRS. But it is also well known that it has multiple side effects. Some side effects are transient and relatively benign, while other adverse effects are menacing, serious and life-threatening. Delirium may occur with clozapine and is a therapeutic challenge as there is always a risk of precipitating delirium on clozapine rechallenge. Limited management strategies are available as alternatives for the management of psychiatric illness stabilized on clozapine. In this case report, we describe an older adult patient who developed delirium on clozapine. The aims of this case report are to discuss the mechanism by which clozapine leads to delirium, revisit various factors which could possibly lead to delirium, and discuss the different management strategies available for management of psychiatric illness for a patient previously stabilized on clozapine.
