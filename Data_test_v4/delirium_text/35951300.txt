35951300|t|Anti-Amyloid Drug Screening Methods Using Bacterial Inclusion Bodies.
35951300|a|Amyloid aggregation is linked to a number of human disorders that range from non-neurological illnesses such as type 2 diabetes to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The formation of insoluble protein aggregates with amyloid conformation inside bacteria, namely, in bacterial inclusion bodies, offers the possibility to use bacteria as simple models to study amyloid aggregation processes and potential effects of both anti-amyloid drugs and/or pro-aggregative compounds. This chapter describes fast, simple, inexpensive, highly reproducible, and tunable in vitro and in cellulo methods that use bacterial inclusion bodies as preliminary screening tools for anti-amyloid drugs.
