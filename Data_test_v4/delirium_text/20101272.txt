20101272|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess whether quick cognitive screening test (QCST) could quickly identify mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: QCST and a full set of standardized neuropsychological tests, including mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) were performed. A total number of 121 cases of MCI [41 cases of amnestic MCI-single domain (aMCI-s); 44 of amnestic MCI-multiple domain (aMCI-m); 36 of nonamnestic MCI (naMCI)], 79 cases of mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 186 healthy elderly volunteers were employed in the present study. All the participants (55-85 years old) had an educational level no less than 5 years. QCST subtests included word list recall, naming test, animal fluency test, similarity test, color trail-1min, clock drawing test, finger construction test, and digit span test. The total score of QCST was 90 points, 10 points for each index of subtests. RESULTS: The total scores of QCST in MCI, AD and the control groups were (58.13+/-8.18), (44.53+/-10.54) and (72.92+/-6.85) points, respectively. According to the educational level, the cut off scores of participants with an educational level of 5-8 years, 9-12 years and more than 13 years were 63, 65 and 68 points, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of QCST in detection of MCI were 87.6% (85.7% for aMCI-s, 90.1% for aMCI-m and 89.5% for naMCI) and 84.3%, respectively. The area under the curve was 0.923 (95% CI: 0.892-0.953). Delayed memory, color trail-1min and similarity test could help distinguish between aMCI and naMCI. CONCLUSION: QCST may have a good sensitivity and specificity for MCI detection, which warrants its further clinical application.
