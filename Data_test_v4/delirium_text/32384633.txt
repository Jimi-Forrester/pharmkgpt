32384633|t|Simplified Procedure for General Synthesis of Monosubstituted Piperazines-From a Batch Reaction Vessel to a Flow (Microwave) Reactor.
32384633|a|We reported a novel simplified synthetic procedure for the preparation of monosubstituted piperazine derivatives which can now be easily prepared in a one-pot-one-step way from a protonated piperazine with no need of introduction of a protecting group. Reactions, proceeding either at room or higher temperatures in common solvents, involve heterogeneous catalysis by metal ions supported on commercial polymeric resins. A general synthetic scheme was successfully applied to afford a wide range of monosubstituted piperazines. Furthermore, we picked up a set of piperazine derivatives and studied the possibilities of microwave acceleration of given synthetic reactions to make them even more efficient. Our research proceeded from a simple batch technique to the construction of a flow microwave reactor prototype and resulted in promising findings which are summarized and discussed in the article.
