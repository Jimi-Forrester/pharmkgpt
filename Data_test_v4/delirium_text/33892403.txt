33892403|t|Long COVID: An overview.
33892403|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Long COVID is the collective term to denote persistence of symptoms in those who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: WE searched the pubmed and scopus databases for original articles and reviews. Based on the search result, in this review article we are analyzing various aspects of Long COVID. RESULTS: Fatigue, cough, chest tightness, breathlessness, palpitations, myalgia and difficulty to focus are symptoms reported in long COVID. It could be related to organ damage, post viral syndrome, post-critical care syndrome and others. Clinical evaluation should focus on identifying the pathophysiology, followed by appropriate remedial measures. In people with symptoms suggestive of long COVID but without known history of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, serology may help confirm the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This review will helps the clinicians to manage various aspects of Long COVID.
