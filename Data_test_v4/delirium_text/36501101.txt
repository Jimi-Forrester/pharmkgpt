36501101|t|Quality Specific Associations of Carbohydrate Consumption and Frailty Index.
36501101|a|Background: The quality of carbohydrate consumed may influence the risk of frailty. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that indices of carbohydrate intake are associated with trajectories of frailty in participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Methods: Cross sectional and longitudinal analyses were conducted in 1024 BLSA participants to examine the association between usual intake of carbohydrate and frailty index. Seven measures of carbohydrate consumption were estimated using data derived from Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs) and examined in association with a 43-item Frailty Index (FI). Results: In cross-sectional analyses, there was a significant, positive association between higher tertiles of total carbohydrate, glycemic load, and non-whole grains and FI. Conversely, higher tertiles of fiber-to-carbohydrate ratio was associated with lower FI. These differences persisted over the follow-up period of up to 13.8 years. Women in the highest tertile of the fiber-to-carbohydrate ratio showed a less steep increase in FI over time. Conclusions: Carbohydrate intake was positively associated with increased frailty risk in the BLSA participants, whereas a higher fiber-to-carbohydrate ratio was related to reduced risk for frailty.
