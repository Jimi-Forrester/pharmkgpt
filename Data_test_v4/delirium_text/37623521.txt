37623521|t|The Rising Problem of Hip Fractures in Geriatric Patients-Analysis of Surgical Influences on the Outcome.
37623521|a|BACKGROUND: Hip fractures in geriatric patients often have a poor outcome in terms of mortality, mobility as well as independence. Different surgical influence factors are known that improve the outcome. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, 281 patients of a geriatric trauma unit were analyzed prospectively. Demographic factors, as well as data regarding the trauma mechanism and perioperative treatment, were recorded. The nutritional status was also analyzed. The follow-up was set to 120 days. RESULTS: The key conclusion of this study is that a high ASA classification, the use of anticoagulatory medicine and malnutrition are significantly associated with higher mortality together with worse independence (p < 0.05). There is no significant difference in outcome concerning the time to surgery within the first 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition seems to be an important risk factor for an adverse outcome of geriatric patients and therefore warrants a focus in multidisciplinary treatment. The risk factor ASA cannot be improved during the pre-surgery phase, but requires intensified care by a multidisciplinary team specialized in orthogeriatrics.
