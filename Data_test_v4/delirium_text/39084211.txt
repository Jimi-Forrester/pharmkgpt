39084211|t|Inflammasome-Inhibiting Nanoligomers Are Neuroprotective against Space-Induced Pathology in Healthy and Diseased Three-Dimensional Human Motor and Prefrontal Cortex Brain Organoids.
39084211|a|The microgravity and space environment has been linked to deficits in neuromuscular and cognitive capabilities, hypothesized to occur due to accelerated aging and neurodegeneration in space. While the specific mechanisms are still being investigated, spaceflight-associated neuropathology is an important health risk to astronauts and space tourists and is being actively investigated for the development of appropriate countermeasures. However, such space-induced neuropathology offers an opportunity for accelerated screening of therapeutic targets and lead molecules for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we show a proof-of-concept high-throughput target screening (on Earth), target validation, and mitigation of microgravity-induced neuropathology using our Nanoligomer platform, onboard the 43-day SpaceX CRS-29 mission to the International Space Station. First, comparing 3D healthy and diseased prefrontal cortex (PFC, for cognition) and motor neuron (MN, for neuromuscular function) organoids, we assessed space-induced pathology using biomarkers relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Both healthy and diseased PFC and MN organoids showed significantly enhanced neurodegeneration in space, as measured through relevant disease biomarkers, when compared to their respective Earth controls. Second, we tested the top two lead molecules, NI112 that targeted NF-kappaB and NI113 that targeted IL-6. We observed that these Nanoligomers significantly mitigate the AD, FTD, and ALS relevant biomarkers like amyloid beta-42 (Abeta42), phosphorylated tau (pTau), Kallikrein (KLK-6), Tar DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), and others. Moreover, the 43-day Nanoligomer treatment of these brain organoids did not appear to cause any observable toxicity or safety issues in the target organoid tissue, suggesting good tolerability for these molecules in the brain at physiologically relevant doses. Together, these results show significant potential for both the development and translation of NI112 and NI113 molecules as potential neuroprotective countermeasures for safer space travel and demonstrate the usefulness of the space environment for rapid, high-throughput screening of targets and lead molecules for clinical translation. We assert that the use of microgravity in drug development and screening may ultimately benefit millions of patients suffering from debilitating neurodegenerative diseases on Earth.
