37522064|t|Ethyl acetate extract of Gastrodia elata protects Caenorhabditis elegans from oxidative stress and amyloid beta peptide toxicity.
37522064|a|Gastrodia elata Blume is a traditional Chinese medicine with a long history, which has numerous pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and protection of nerves. The present study investigated the regulatory effect of ethyl acetate extract of Gastrodia elata (EEGE) on the beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). First, the main components of EEGE were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography, and the total phenols, total flavonoids and total antioxidant capacity of EEGE were determined. Next, the regulation effect of EEGE on Abeta-induced toxicity of C. elegans was evaluated through experiments on nematode paralysis, lifespan, oxidative and heat stress, locomotor ability, reproductive ability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, Abeta aggregation test, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, catalase (CAT) activity and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Finally, the mechanism of EEGE was elucidated using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and the expression levels of related genes were verified using quantitative PCR. The present study revealed that the main components of EEGE included phosphorylated (p)-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylmethane, possessing strong in vitro free radical scavenging and reducing abilities. In addition, after the intervention of EEGE, the paralysis of nematodes could be delayed, the survival time of the nematodes was prolonged, the survival rate of the nematodes under stress (high temperature and oxidation) conditions was improved, the activity capacity and reproductive capacity of the nematodes were improved, the activities of SOD and CAT were improved and the levels of ROS and MDA were reduced. Notably, EEGE directly inhibited Abeta plaque aggregation in nematodes. RNA-Seq analysis showed that EEGE regulated metabolism and longevity-related genes, and these genes were regulated by the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway. Therefore, the present study hypothesized that the regulatory mechanism of EEGE was significantly related to the IIS pathway. The present research results demonstrated that the protective effect of EEGE on transgenic C. elegans was to reduce Abeta protein aggregation, improve the in vivo antioxidant level, effectively remove free radicals and to regulate the expression of genes related to IIS pathway, thereby reducing Abeta-induced toxicity and delaying nematode paralysis.
