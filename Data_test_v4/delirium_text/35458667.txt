35458667|t|Molecular Modeling and Experimental Evaluation of Non-Chiral Components of Bergamot Essential Oil with Inhibitory Activity against Human Monoamine Oxidases.
35458667|a|Human monoamine oxidases (hMAOs) are well-established targets for the treatment of neurological disorders such as depression, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Despite the efforts carried out over the years, few selective and reversible MAO inhibitors are on the market. Thus, a continuous search for new compounds is needed. Herein, MAO inhibitors were searched among the non-chiral constituents of Bergamot Essential Oil (BEO) with the aid of computational tools. Accordingly, molecular modeling simulations were carried out on both hMAO-A and hMAO-B for the selected constituents. The theoretically predicted target recognition was then used to select the most promising compounds. Among the screened compounds, Bergamottin, a furocoumarin, showed selective hMAO-B inhibitory activity, fitting its active site well. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to deeply analyze the target recognition and to rationalize the selectivity preference. In agreement with the computational results, experimental studies confirmed both the hMAO inhibition properties of Bergamottin and its preference for the isoform B.
