36697475|a|Here, we have demonstrated a metal-free energy-efficient mechanochemical approach for expedient access to a diverse set of 2-amino-3-cyano-aryl/heteroaryl-4H-chromenes, tetrahydrospiro[chromene-3,4'-indoline], 2,2'-aryl/heteroarylmethylene-bis(3-hydroxy-5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-enone) as well as tetrahydro-1H-xanthen-1-one by employing the reactivity of 5,5-dimethylcyclohexane-1,3-dione/cyclohexane-1,3-dione with TsOH H2O as Bronsted acid catalyst under water-assisted grinding conditions at ambient temperature. The ability to accomplish multiple C-C, C=C, C-O, and C-N bonds from readily available starting materials via a domino multicomponent strategy in the absence of metal-catalyst as well as volatile organic solvents with an immediate reduction in the cost of the transformation without necessitates complex operational procedures, features the significant highlights of this approach. The excellent yield of the products, broad functional group tolerances, easy set-up, column-free, scalable synthesis with ultralow catalyst loading, short reaction time, waste-free, ligand-free, and toxic-free, are other notable advantages of this approach. The greenness and sustainability of the protocol were also established by demonstrating several green metrics parameters.
