31575827|t|Association between bone mineral density and brain parenchymal atrophy and ventricular enlargement in healthy individuals.
31575827|a|Bone, vascular smooth muscle, and arachnoid trabeculae are composed of the same type of collagen. However, no studies have investigated the relationship between bone mineral density deterioration and cerebral atrophy, both of which occur in normal, healthy aging. Accordingly, we evaluated whether bone mineral density was associated with brain parenchymal atrophy and ventricular enlargement in healthy individuals. Intracranial cavity, brain parenchyma, and lateral ventricles volumes were measured using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a semiautomated tool. We included 267 individuals with no history of dementia or other neurological diseases, who underwent one or more dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans and brain MRIs simultaneously (within 3 years of each other) at our hospital over an 11-year period. We found that progression of brain parenchymal atrophy was positively associated with bone mineral density after full adjustment (B, 0.94; P < 0.001). In addition, individuals with osteoporosis showed more parenchymal atrophy among those younger than 80 years. In addition, we observed greater ventricular enlargement in individuals with osteoporosis among those older than 80 years. We believe that osteoporosis may play a role in the acceleration of parenchymal atrophy during the early-stages, and ventricular enlargement in the late-stages, of normal aging-related cerebral atrophy.
