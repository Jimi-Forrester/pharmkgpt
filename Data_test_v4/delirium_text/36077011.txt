36077011|t|Pathogenesis, Murine Models, and Clinical Implications of Metabolically Healthy Obesity.
36077011|a|Although obesity is commonly associated with numerous cardiometabolic pathologies, some people with obesity are resistant to detrimental effects of excess body fat, which constitutes a condition called "metabolically healthy obesity" (MHO). Metabolic features of MHO that distinguish it from metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) include differences in the fat distribution, adipokine types, and levels of chronic inflammation. Murine models are available that mimic the phenotype of human MHO, with increased adiposity but preserved insulin sensitivity. Clinically, there is no established definition of MHO yet. Despite the lack of a uniform definition, most studies describe MHO as a particular case of obesity with no or only one metabolic syndrome components and lower levels of insulin resistance or inflammatory markers. Another clinical viewpoint is the dynamic and changing nature of MHO, which substantially impacts the clinical outcome. In this review, we explore the pathophysiology and some murine models of MHO. The definition, variability, and clinical implications of the MHO phenotype are also discussed. Understanding the characteristics that differentiate people with MHO from those with MUO can lead to new insights into the mechanisms behind obesity-related metabolic derangements and diseases.
