37545694|a|It's been 10 years now from the debut of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) era in which gene engineering has never been so accessible, precise and efficient. This technology, like a refined surgical procedure, has offered the ability of removing different types of disease causing mutations and restoring key proteins activity with ease of outperforming the previous resembling methods: zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). Additionally, CRISPR-Cas9 systems can systematically introduce genetic sequences to the specific sites in the human genome allowing to stimulate desired functions such as anti-tumoral and anti-infectious faculties. The present brief review provides an updated resume of CRISPR-Cas9's top achievements from its first appearance to the current date focusing on the breakthrough research including in vitro, in vivo and human studies. This enables the evaluation of the previous phase 'the proof-of-concept phase' and marks the beginning of the next phase which will probably bring a spate of clinical trials.
