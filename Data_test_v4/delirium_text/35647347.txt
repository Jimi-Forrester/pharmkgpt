35647347|a|Background and objectives: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important risk factors for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an effective and widely used method to investigate brain pathomorphological injury in neural diseases. In present study, we aimed to determine the brain regional alterations that correlated to the incidence of MCI in T2DM patients. Materials and methods: Eighteen T2DM patients with and without MCI (DMCI/T2DM) respectively, and eighteen age/gender-matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited. Brain MRI imagines of all the individuals were subjected to automatic quantified brain sub-structure volume segmentation and measurement by Dr. brain   software. The relative volume of total gray matter (TGM), total white matter (TWM), and 68 pairs (left and right) of brain sub-structures were compared between the three groups. Cognitive function correlation analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were conducted in the MCI-related brain regions in T2DM patients, and we utilized a machine learning method to classify the three group of subjects. Results: 10 and 27 brain sub-structures with significant relative volumetric alterations were observed in T2DM patients without MCI and T2DM patients with MCI, respectively (p < 0.05). Compared with T2DM patients without MCI, eight critical regions include right anterior orbital gyrus, right calcarine and cerebrum, left cuneus, left entorhinal area, left frontal operculum, right medial orbital gyrus, right occipital pole, left temporal pole had significant lower volumetric ratio in T2DM patients with MCI (p < 0.05). Among them, the decrease of volumetric ratio in several regions had a positive correlation with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. The classification results conducted based on these regions as features by random forest algorithm yielded good accuracies of T2DM/HC 69.4%, DMCI/HC 72.2% and T2DM/DMCI 69.4%. Conclusions: Certain brain regional structural lesions occurred in patients with T2DM, and this condition was more serious in T2DM patients combined with MCI. A systematic way of segmenting and measuring the whole brain has a potential clinical value for predicting the presence of MCI for T2DM patients.
