34659451|a|Breast cancer is a strong risk factor of cancer amongst women. One in eight women suffers from breast cancer. It is a life-threatening illness and is utterly dreadful. The root cause which is the breast cancer agent is still under research. There are, however, certain potentially dangerous factors like age, genetics, obesity, birth control, cigarettes, and tablets. Breast cancer is often a malignant tumor that begins in the breast cells and eventually spreads to the surrounding tissue. If detected early, the illness may be reversible. The probability of preservation diminishes as the number of measurements increases. Numerous imaging techniques are used to identify breast cancer. This research examines different breast cancer detection strategies via the use of imaging techniques, data mining techniques, and various characteristics, as well as a brief comparative analysis of the existing breast cancer detection system. Breast cancer mortality will be significantly reduced if it is identified and treated early. There are technological difficulties linked to scans and people's inconsistency with breast cancer. In this study, we introduced a form of breast cancer diagnosis. There are different methods involved to collect and analyze details. In the preprocessing stage, the input data picture is filtered by using a window or by cropping. Segmentation can be performed using k-means algorithm. This study is aimed at identifying the calcifications found in bosom cancer in the last phase. The suggested approach is already implemented in MATLAB, and it produces reliable performance.
