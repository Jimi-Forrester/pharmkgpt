35479541|a|Cadmium is a heavy metal which exists widely in industrial and agricultural production and can induce a variety of diseases in organisms. Therefore, its detection is of great significance in the fields of biology, environment and medicine. Fluorescent probe has been a powerful tool for cadmium detection because of its convenience, sensitivity, and bioimaging capability. In this paper, we reviewed 98 literatures on cadmium fluorescent sensors reported from 2017 to 2021, classified them according to different fluorophores, elaborated the probe design, application characteristics and recognition mode, summarized and prospected the development of cadmium fluorescent and colorimetric probes. We hope to provide some help for researchers to design cadmium fluorescent probes with higher selectivity, sensitivity and practicability.
