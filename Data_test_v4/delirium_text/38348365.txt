38348365|a|Objectives-background: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) involves decline in several cognitive domains after surgery and is particularly common after cardiac surgery, while also common among other types of surgery. Given the potential effects of such cognitive dysfunction on the quality of life, it is important to study it in multiple populations in order to limit its occurrence. Study design: We present the long-term neuropsychological outcome of 200 patients, 100 of whom had orthopedic surgery and 100 oncological surgery. Methods: We administered a series of neuropsychological tests assessing attention, complex scanning, verbal working memory, executive functioning, short-term and long-term memory, and visuospatial perception before surgery, prior to discharge, at 3-month follow-up and 6 years after surgery. We compared the performance of these patients to normative datasets. Results: Despite equivalent levels of pre-surgery performance between patients, oncology patients exceeded their preoperative neurocognitive levels, suggesting less postoperative cognitive dysfunction in orthopedic patients overall, in all neuropsychological domains at a 6-year follow-up, except short-term retention. In contrast, orthopedic patients showed no improvement, and, instead, showed some cognitive decline, which remained consistent over time. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the critical role of the type of surgery utilized in the development of POCD and have implications for clinical management and patients' quality of life in the very long term. Health policy professionals should be aware that patients' low POCD may persist in the long term, and this is useful from a clinician's point of view.
