36966258|a|To evaluate clinical value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who had CNS disorders. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 48 PLWHA presenting with CNS disorders were sequenced using mNGS and compared with clinical conventional diagnostic methods. In total, 36/48 ss(75%) patients were diagnosed with pathogen(s) infection by mNGS, and the positive detection proportion by mNGS was higher than that by clinical conventional diagnostic methods (75% vs 52.1%, X2 = 5.441, P = 0.020). Thirteen out of 48 patients (27.1%) were detected with 3-7 pathogens by mNGS. Moreover, 77 pathogen strains were detected, of which 94.8% (73/77) by mNGS and 37.0% (30/77) by clinical conventional methods (X2 = 54.206, P < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of pathogens detection by mNGS were 63.9% (23/36) and 66.7% (8/12), respectively, which were superior to that by clinical conventional methods (23/36 vs 9/25, X2 = 4.601, P = 0.032; 8/12 vs 5/23, X2 = 5.029, P = 0.009). The application of mNGS was superior for its ability to detect a variety of unknown pathogens and multiple pathogens infection, and relatively higher sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of CNS disorders in PLWHA.
