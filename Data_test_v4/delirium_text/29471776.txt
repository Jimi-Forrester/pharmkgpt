29471776|t|T-cell Immunotherapies and the Role of Nonclinical Assessment: The Balance between Efficacy and Pathology.
29471776|a|Gene-engineered T-cell therapies have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of cancer. These therapies have shown exceptional clinical efficacy specifically in the field of B-cell malignancies and the first products (Kymriah  and Yescarta ) have recently been approved in the United States for specific indications. The power of these treatments is also linked with a distinct set of toxicities both predicted and unpredicted, including off-tumor activity, cytokine release syndromes, and neurotoxicity, occasionally with fatal consequences. As these therapies begin to reach more patients, it is critical to develop the nonclinical tools to adequately determine the mechanisms driving these toxicities, to assess the safety risks of candidate products, and to develop strategies for safety management.
