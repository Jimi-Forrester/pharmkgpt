39659348|t|The Role of Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation in Slowing Cognitive Decline Among Elderly Patients With Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.
39659348|a|This systematic review explores the impact of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), on cognitive decline in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Omega-3 fatty acids are widely recognized for their neuroprotective properties, but the evidence regarding their efficacy in mitigating cognitive decline remains mixed. Through a comprehensive analysis of eleven randomized controlled trials, we aimed to assess the role of DHA in improving cognitive functions and slowing brain atrophy. The findings revealed that DHA supplementation demonstrated cognitive benefits, particularly in memory and hippocampal volume preservation, in some studies involving early-stage cognitive decline, while others reported negligible effects, particularly in more advanced Alzheimer's disease. The review identified variations in study design, dosage, intervention duration, and population characteristics as potential factors contributing to the inconsistencies observed across trials. Despite these mixed outcomes, DHA's safety profile and potential for early intervention in at-risk populations offer promise for its use in clinical practice. This review underscores the need for further longitudinal, large-scale studies to refine DHA dosage recommendations, optimize intervention timing, and explore personalized approaches based on genetic factors. The insights gained from this review contribute to a growing understanding of the role omega-3 fatty acids could play in managing cognitive decline and highlight future directions for research.
