27411704|t|The neurological and cognitive consequences of hyperthermia.
27411704|a|An elevated temperature has many aetiologies, both infective and non-infective, and while the fever of sepsis probably confers benefit, there is increasing evidence that the central nervous system is particularly vulnerable to damage from hyperthermia. A single episode of hyperthermia may cause short-term neurological and cognitive dysfunction, which may be prolonged or become permanent. The cerebellum is particularly intolerant to the effects of heat. Hyperthermia in the presence of acute brain injury worsens outcome. The thermotoxicity involved occurs via cellular, local, and systemic mechanisms. This article reviews both the cognitive and neurological consequences and examines the mechanisms of cerebral damage caused by high temperature.
