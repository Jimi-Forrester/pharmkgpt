37533682|t|Management Practice and Clinical Outcomes of Dementia in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review.
37533682|a|Background: Dementia is a severe neurodegenerative disorder and it is a group of acquired symptoms associated with impaired cognitive functions. In low-income settings particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), it is often seen as part of normal aging. Environmental, behavioral, and lifestyle interventions have the potential to alter the disease course of dementia. Objective: This study is aimed to synthesize the literature/evidence(s) on the management practice and treatment outcomes of dementia in SSA. Method: Comprehensive literature was searched in PubMed database, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Eligibility has been set, and based on the criteria, initially, a total of 442 results were obtained, and from those around 183 articles were duplicated. After examining titles and abstracts of records 26 articles were identified. Finally, five randomized clinical trials (RCT) and three prospective cohort studies that were reported on the management practice and treatment outcome of dementia in SSA were eligible for analysis. RCT and prospective cohort studies were used to strengthen the quality of evidence. The quality of the included RCT studies was assessed by using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Result: A total of 2781 patient data were included in the final analysis. Of these, 2354 patients were obtained from 5 RCTs and 427 patients from 3 prospective cohort studies, which were conducted in SSA countries. RCT studies were done on the feasibility and clinical effectiveness of cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) showed improvements in language memory domains and physical health. In addition, studies that focus on the management of human immunodeficiency virus-associated dementia (HIVAD) were reported to improve neurocognitively. Conclusion: CST is applicable in low-resource settings and it shows improvements in cognitive function and quality of life. Early initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings has been associated with improvement in the cognitive function of HIVAD.
