9449433|a|Effects of various amino acids and tryptophan metabolites on the synthesis of nerve growth factor (NGF) in cultured mouse astroglial cells were evaluated. L-Tryptophan stimulated NGF production in a dose-dependent manner. Serotonin and quinolinic acid slightly increased NGF synthesis. L-Kynurenine had a marked stimulatory effect on NGF production at a dose of 10 microM. In contrast, kynurenic acid had no effect on the reaction. L-Glutamine, L-glutamic acid, L-phenylalanine and L-methionine produced no significant change in NGF synthesis. These results were discussed in relation to the treatment of Alzheimer's diseases.
