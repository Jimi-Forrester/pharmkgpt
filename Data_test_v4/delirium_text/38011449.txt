38011449|a|Background: Glatiramer acetate (GA) and Interferon (IFN) beta-1a are used as first-line disease-modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS). In this systematic review, we summarized case reports and case series of adverse side effects of GA and IFN beta-1a in MS patients. Methods: Without any restrictions, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, and Embase databases, and gray literature were systemically searched until June 2022. Articles were screened and data were extracted based on a predefined table by two independent reviewers. The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool. Results: We identified 2103 records from the preliminary search. After deduplication and screening, 172 articles were included in the systematic review. In total, 229 individuals (52 men, 173 women, and 4 unknown) were included in the study. The most common adverse events were cutaneous (32.75%), hepatic (13.54%), allergic (8.3%), and neurological (5.68%) side effects. Furthermore, most reported side effects were related to autoimmune diseases or hypersensitivity reactions. Conclusion: GA and IFN beta-1a are associated with several side effects which may be related to the immunomodulatory function of medication or other injection-related reactions.
