26588015|t|Clinical Neurophysiological and Automated EEG-Based Diagnosis of the Alzheimer's Disease.
26588015|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive disorder affecting intellectual, behavioral and functional abilities. It is associated with age and pathological alterations leading to the formation of amyloid plaques and tangles. It is the most common source of dementia in the older population, which varies in its degrees of severity. We are yet to find efficient methods of diagnosis of AD, as its symptoms vary among individuals. This paper presents a review of recent research on the clinical neurophysiological and automated electroencephalography-based diagnosis of the AD. Various therapeutic measures are also discussed briefly.
