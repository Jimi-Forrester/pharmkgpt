36207441|t|Alzheimer's disease: insights from a network medicine perspective.
36207441|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease that currently lacks available effective therapy. Thus, identifying novel molecular biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of AD is urgently demanded. In this study, we exploited tools and concepts of the emerging research area of Network Medicine to unveil a novel putative disease gene signature associated with AD. We proposed a new pipeline, which combines the strengths of two consolidated algorithms of the Network Medicine: DIseAse MOdule Detection (DIAMOnD), designed to predict new disease-associated genes within the human interactome network; and SWItch Miner (SWIM), designed to predict important (switch) genes within the co-expression network. Our integrated computational analysis allowed us to enlarge the set of the known disease genes associated to AD with additional 14 genes that may be proposed as new potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD phenotype.
