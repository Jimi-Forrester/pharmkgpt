32305782|t|CSF amyloid is a consistent predictor of white matter hyperintensities across the disease course from aging to Alzheimer's disease.
32305782|a|This study investigated the relationship between white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers. Subjects included 180 controls, 107 individuals with a significant memory concern, 320 individuals with early mild cognitive impairment, 171 individuals with late mild cognitive impairment, and 151 individuals with AD, with 3T MRI and CSF Abeta1-42, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) data. Multiple linear regression models assessed the relationship between WMH and CSF Abeta1-42, t-tau, and p-tau. Directionally, a higher WMH burden was associated with lower CSF Abeta1-42 within each diagnostic group, with no evidence for a difference in the slope of the association across diagnostic groups (p = 0.4). Pooling all participants, this association was statistically significant after adjustment for t-tau, p-tau, age, diagnostic group, and APOE-epsilon4 status (p < 0.001). Age was the strongest predictor of WMH (partial R2~16%) compared with CSF Abeta1-42 (partial R2~5%). There was no evidence for an association with WMH and either t-tau or p-tau. These data are supportive of a link between amyloid burden and presumed vascular pathology.
