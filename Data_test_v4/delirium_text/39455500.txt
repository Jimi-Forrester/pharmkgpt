39455500|t|Involvement of Complement in Alzheimer's Disease: From Genetics Through Pathology to Therapeutic Strategies.
39455500|a|Complement is a critical component of innate immunity, evolved to defend against pathogens and clear toxic debris ranging from dead and dying cells to immune complexes. These roles make complement a key player in homeostasis; however, complement has a dark side. When the rigid control mechanisms fail, complement becomes dysregulated, acting as a driver of inflammation and resultant pathology in numerous diseases. Roles of complement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias have emerged in recent years, supported by genetic, biomarker and pathological evidence and animal model studies. Numerous questions remain regarding the precise roles of complement in the brain in health and disease, including where and when complement is expressed, how it contributes to immune defence and garbage disposal in the healthy brain, and exactly how complement contributes to pathology in dementias. In this brief review, we will summarise current knowledge on complement roles in brain, present the evidence implicating complement in AD and explore whether complement represents an attractive therapeutic target for AD.
