12770611|a|Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is the primary constituent of plaque seen in Alzheimer's disease. Abeta is proposed to play an etiological role in Alzheimer's disease and to be a cause of the decrease in the level of acetylcholine in the hippocampus. The SAMP8 strain of mouse develops age-related increases in Abeta and deficits in learning and memory by 12 months of age. We examined in 12 month old SAMP8 mice the effects of giving antibody to Abeta by septal or intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection on acetylcholine levels in the hippocampus. Antibody to Abeta increased acetylcholine in the hippocampus over 100% after ICV injection and over 200% after septal injection. Injection of rabbit serum, antibody directed towards mouse IgG, or a blocking antibody directed towards human interleukin-1beta were without effect. These results suggest that antagonism of Abeta increases acetylcholine concentrations in the hippocampus, an area important for learning and memory.
