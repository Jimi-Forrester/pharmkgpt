31822743|t|One-year mortality after hip fracture surgery and prognostic factors: a prospective cohort study.
31822743|a|Older adult patients with hip fractures are 3-4 times more likely to die within one-year after surgery than general population. The study aimed to identify independent predictive factors associated with one-year mortality after hip fracture surgery. A prospective prognostic cohort study was performed. All patients aged >=65 years, consecutively admitted in three Italian hospitals with a diagnosis of fragility hip fracture were included. Patients with periprosthetic or pathological fractures were excluded. Multivariate analysis was used to determine variables that significantly increased the risk of one-year mortality and Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to assess their predictive capacity on the outcome.1083 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and the one-year follow-up was reached in 728 patients. The 16.6% of patients died within one-year after surgery. At the multivariate analysis, advancing age (OR = 1.094, 95% CI = 1.057-1.132), higher baseline Charlson Index (OR = 1.257, 95% CI = 1.114-1.418) and Activities of Daily Living scores (OR = 1.259, 95% CI = 1.143-1.388), presence of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (PUs) (OR = 1.579, 95% CI = 1.002-2.489) and lack recovery of ambulation (OR = 1.736, 95% CI = 1.115-2.703), were found to be independent predictive factors of one-year mortality after surgery. The area under the ROC curve of the model was 0.780 (CI95% 0.737-0.824) for one-year mortality in elderly hip fractures patients. Early ambulation and careful long-term follow-up, with attention to frailty in elderly people, should be promoted.
