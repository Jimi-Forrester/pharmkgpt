25668827|t|[Delirium tremens].
25668827|a|Delirium tremens (DT) is a specific type of delirium occurring in patients who are in alcohol withdrawal states. It has a high mortality of about 8%. Hence, it is important for clinicians to be able to predict it. Treatment of DT is best achieved by the use of intravenous diazepam administered at frequent intervals while closely monitoring the patient during the procedure. Refractory DT is defined by a high requirement of intravenous diazepam with poor control of withdrawal symptoms. Once the acute phase medically controlled, the patient should be managed for his addiction to alcohol.
