29457061|a|BACKGROUND: Following cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) surgery, severe brain edema and hemorrhage may be caused by postoperative normal perfusion pressure breakthrough (NPPB). Sedation is necessary for this population. It is a challenge for the anesthesiologist to maintain hemodynamic stability without interfering with the neurological assessment. In Japan, propofol is contraindicated for pregnant patients. Dexmedetomidine is a versatile drug in anesthesia practice and may be useful for this situation. There is no report using dexmedetomidine for the purpose of NPPB control in pregnant patients. We describe the postoperative management with dexmedetomidine for a pregnant patient who underwent cerebral AVM nidus removal. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old patient presented with headache at the 16th week of gestation. Neuroimaging revealed an intraventricular hemorrhage and an AVM at the right anterior horn of the lateral ventricle which caused bleeding. A multidisciplinary team discussion was done, and then a craniotomy for AVM nidus removal was performed under general anesthesia. Preanesthetic aspiration prophylaxis and rapid sequence induction were added to our conventional anesthetic management. Hypotension occurred after anesthetic induction but the patient recovered by volume resuscitation and vasopressors. Anesthesia was maintained with 50% O2 in air and sevoflurane. The AVM was completely removed, and no perioperative complications occurred. Postoperative sedation with dexmedetomidine was used to prevent breakthrough hyperperfusion and cerebral edema. CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine infusion was used for postoperative sedation without causing any side effects, and it can be an alternative for sedation, especially when propofol is contraindicated.
