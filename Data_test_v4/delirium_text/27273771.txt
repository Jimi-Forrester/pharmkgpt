27273771|a|AIM: The presence of cerebral white matter changes (WMC) has been reported as an important predictor of the rapidity of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The association between the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and WMC in AD is yet to be elucidated. The present study aimed to examine the association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and WMC among AD patients in Taiwan. METHODS: A total of 403 patients clinically diagnosed with AD were recruited in a cross-sectional study carried out in an area hospital in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The ACE I/D polymorphism was genotyped, and cerebral white matter rating was carried out using the visual rating scale for age-related white matter changes. RESULTS: The I allele was associated with a significantly lower total age-related white matter changes scale score compared with the D allele (4.83 vs 5.93, P = 0.013). The total age-related white matter changes scale score was significantly lower for the I/I genotype than for the I/D (4.37 vs 5.87, P = 0.009) and I/D + D/D genotypes (4.37 vs 5.91, P = 0.006), with no differences observed between the I/I + I/D and the D/D genotypes (5.08 vs 6.09, P = 0.373), after adjustment for age and hypertension. A stratified analysis by sex demonstrated that the I/I genotype was associated with significant lower WMC than other genotypes in women, but not in men. CONCLUSIONS: The present study supports the hypothesis that the ACE I/D polymorphism is associated with the severity of WMC in patients with AD. Patients with AD who are homozygous for the I allele might be less likely to develop WMC, especially women. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017; 17: 945-950.
