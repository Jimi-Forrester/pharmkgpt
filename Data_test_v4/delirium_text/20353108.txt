20353108|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical therapeutic effect of acupuncture on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its mechanism. METHODS: Twenty patients with Alzheimer's disease were treated by acupuncture with reinforcing kidney and activating blood method for 12 weeks and Baihui (GV 20), Shenshu (BL 23), Xuehai (SP 10) and Geshu (BL 17) were selected. The clinical therapeutic effect were assessed by comparing the scores of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Section (ADAS-Cog) and 8-IPF2alpha concentration in cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine before and after treatment were detected by using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: After treatment, the effective rate was 90.0%. The score of ADAS-Cog was 35. 70 +/- 14. 70 before treatment and 31. 45 +/- 4. 08 after treatment, with a significant difference (P<0. 001). The concentration of 8-IPF2alpha in cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine were all significantly decreased after treatment (all P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture can improve the cognitive ability of AD patients and its possible mechanism may be relative to the decrease in lipid peroxidation in AD patients' brain.
