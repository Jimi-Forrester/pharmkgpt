25671729|a|Grape seed polyphenolic extract (GSPE) rich in the flavan-3-ols (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin beneficially modulates Alzheimer's Disease phenotypes in animal models. The parent molecules in the extract are converted to a series of methylated and glucuronidated derivatives. To fully characterize these metabolites and establish a robust quantitative assay of their levels in biological fluids, we have implemented a partial synthetic approach utilizing chemical methylation followed by enzymatic glucuronidation. Liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were used to assign unequivocal structures to the compounds. An analytical method using solid-phase extraction and LC-MS/MS in selective reaction monitoring mode (SRM) was validated for their quantitation in plasma. These studies provide a basis for improvements in future work on the bioavailability, metabolism, and mechanism of action of metabolites derived from dietary flavan-3-ols in a range of interventions.
