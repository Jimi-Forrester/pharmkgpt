29042959|a|The aim of the present study was to present the diagnosis and treatment course of a patient with cobalamin C deficiency (cblC) hospitalized with renal function abnormality from the onset. A female, 7-year-old patient who presented with a cough and progressive dyspnea for 1 day was admitted to the Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Nanjing, China). A routine clinical examination was performed, including physical examination, routine blood and urine tests, blood gas analysis, computed tomography scans of the head, chest and abdomen, electrocardiogram, echocardiography and abdominal ultrasonography. In addition, laboratory tests were performed, including tests for viral infection and markers of autoimmunity, humoral immunity, myocardial enzymes and tumors. Tandem mass analysis and renal biopsy were conducted. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to identify mutated genes, and structural investigation was conducted to identify the key residue mutations in the patient. Routine clinical examination revealed that the patient had multiple organ failure, indicating the presence of metabolic disease. Tandem mass analysis and renal biopsy also indicated that the patient had methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and thrombotic microangiopathy combined with focal renal cortical necrosis. Furthermore, next-generation sequencing identified the presence of two heterozygous mutations in the MMA cblC type with homocystinuria (MMACHC) gene. Structural analysis demonstrated that the two mutations were in key components of the MMACHC protein. The patient was finally diagnosed with cblC according to the results obtained. In conclusion, NGS may aid in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of cblC with renal abnormality from the onset in children.
