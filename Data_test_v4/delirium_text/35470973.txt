35470973|a|The metabolic syndrome comprises a family of clinical and laboratory findings, including insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and hypertension, in addition to central obesity. The syndrome confers a high risk of cardiovascular mortality. Indeed, metabolic dysfunction has been shown to cause a direct insult to smooth muscle and endothelial components of the vasculature, which leads to vascular dysfunction and hyperreactivity. This, in turn, causes cerebral vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion, eventually contributing to cognitive deficits. Moreover, the metabolic syndrome disrupts key homeostatic processes in the brain, including apoptosis, autophagy, and neurogenesis. Impairment of such processes in the context of metabolic dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington diseases. The aim of this review is to elucidate the role that the metabolic syndrome plays in the pathogenesis of the latter disorders, with a focus on the role of perivascular adipose inflammation in the peripheral-to-central transduction of the inflammatory insult. This review delineates common signaling pathways that contribute to these pathologies. Moreover, the role of therapeutic agents aimed at treating the metabolic syndrome, as well as their risk factors that interfere with the aforementioned pathways, are discussed as potential interventions for neurodegenerative diseases.
