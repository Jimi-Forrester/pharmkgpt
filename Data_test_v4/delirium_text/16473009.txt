16473009|t|Synthesis and evaluation of succinoyl-caprolactam gamma-secretase inhibitors.
16473009|a|The synthesis, evaluation, and structure-activity relationships of a series of succinoyl lactam inhibitors of the Alzheimer's disease gamma-secretase are described. Beginning with a screening hit with broad proteinase activity, optimization provided compounds with both high selectivity for inhibition of gamma-secretase and high potency in cellular assays of A beta reduction. The SAR and early in vivo properties of this series of inhibitors will be presented.
