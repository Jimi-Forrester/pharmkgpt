28701064|t|Rosmarinic acid prevents fibrillization and diminishes vibrational modes associated to beta sheet in tau protein linked to Alzheimer's disease.
28701064|a|Alzheimer's disease is a common tauopathy where fibril formation and aggregates are the hallmark of the disease. Efforts targeting amyloid-beta plaques have succeeded to remove plaques but failed in clinical trials to improve cognition; thus, the current therapeutic strategy is at preventing tau aggregation. Here, we demonstrated that four phenolic diterpenoids and rosmarinic acid inhibit fibrillization. Since, rosmarinic acid was the most active compound, we observe morphological changes in atomic force microscopy images after treatment. Hence, rosmarinic acid leads to a decrease in amide regions I and III, indicating that rosmarinic acid prevents beta-sheet assembly. Molecular docking study inside the steric zipper model of the hexapeptide 306VQIVYK311 involved in fibrillization and beta sheet formation, suggests that rosmarinic acid binds to the steric zipper with similar chemical interactions with respect to those observed for orange G, a known pharmacofore for amyloid.
