38534464|t|Bibliometric Overview on T-Cell Intracellular Antigens and Their Pathological Implications.
38534464|a|T-cell intracellular antigen 1 (TIA1) and TIA1-like/related protein (TIAL1/TIAR) are two members of the classical family of RNA binding proteins. Through their selective interactions with distinct RNAs and proteins, these multifunctional regulators are involved in chromatin remodeling, RNA splicing and processing and translation regulation, linking them to a wide range of diseases including neuronal disorders, cancer and other pathologies. From their discovery to the present day, many studies have focused on the behavior of these proteins in order to understand their impact on molecular and cellular processes and to understand their relationship to human pathologies. The volume of research on these proteins in various fields, including molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, immunology and cancer, has steadily increased, indicating a growing interest in these gene expression regulators among researchers. This information can be used to know the most productive institutions working in the field, understand the focus of research, identify key areas of involvement, delve deeper into their relationship and impact on different diseases, and to establish the level of study associated with them.
