32630300|t|A Metabolic Mechanism for Anaesthetic Suppression of Cortical Synaptic Function in Mouse Brain Slices-A Pilot Investigation.
32630300|a|Regulation of synaptically located ionotropic receptors is thought to be the main mechanism by which anaesthetics cause unconsciousness. An alternative explanation, which has received much less attention, is that of primary anaesthetic disruption of brain metabolism via suppression of mitochondrial proteins. In this pilot study in mouse cortical slices, we investigated the effect of disrupting cellular metabolism on tissue oxygen handling and cortical population seizure-like event (SLE) activity, using the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone, and compared this to the effects of the general anaesthetics sevoflurane, propofol and ketamine. Rotenone caused an increase in tissue oxygen (98 mmHg to 157 mmHg (p < 0.01)) before any measurable change in SLE activity. Thereafter, tissue oxygen continued to increase and was accompanied by a significant and prolonged reduction in SLE root mean square (RMS) activity (baseline RMS of 1.7 to 0.7 microV, p < 0.001) and SLE frequency (baseline 4.2 to 0.4 events/min, p = 0.001). This temporal sequence of effects was replicated by all three anaesthetic drugs. In conclusion, anaesthetics with differing synaptic receptor mechanisms all effect changes in tissue oxygen handling and cortical network activity, consistent with a common inhibitory effect on mitochondrial function. The temporal sequence suggests that the observed synaptic depression-as seen in anaesthesia-may be secondary to a reduction in cellular metabolic capacity.
