36439558|a|Delirium is a severe and variable neuropsychiatric illness that causes cognitive and behavioral problems as well as abrupt impairment in consciousness and focus. Due to the complex, dynamic, and multifaceted interactions between several risk factors, the etiology of delirium is unclear. Although its efficacy has not been thoroughly studied, haloperidol, a common antipsychotic medicine, is frequently used to prevent delirium in critically ill patients. When evaluating the atypical antipsychotic response rates for treating delirium, only a few trials have taken age into account.  Articles were searched for from PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), and Science Direct, and reviewed systematically. A complete 225 articles were identified after applying the search strategy to these databases. Out of these, 12 were finalized for review. We reviewed the efficacy and safety of haloperidol with atypical antipsychotics for treating delirium in intensive care unit patients.
