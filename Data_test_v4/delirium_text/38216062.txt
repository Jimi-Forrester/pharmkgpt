38216062|a|BACKGROUND: The association between prolonged delirium during hospitalization and long-term prognosis in patients with acute heart failure (AHF) admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) has not been fully elucidated. METHODS: We conducted a prospective registry study of patients with AHF admitted to the CICU at 2 hospitals from 2013 to 2021. We divided study patients into 3 groups according to the presence or absence of delirium and prolonged delirium as follows: no delirium, resolved delirium, or prolonged delirium. Main outcomes were in-hospital mortality and 3-year mortality after discharge. RESULTS: A total of 1555 patients with AHF (median age, 80 years) were included in the analysis. Of these, 406 patients (26.1%) developed delirium. We divided patients with delirium into 2 groups: the resolved delirium group (n = 201) or the prolonged delirium group (n = 205). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models for long-term prognosis demonstrated that the prolonged delirium group had a higher incidence of all-cause death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.52; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.14) and non-cardiovascular death (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.78) than the resolved delirium group. Regarding in-hospital outcomes, multivariate logistic regression modeling showed that prolonged delirium is associated with all-cause death (odds ratio [OR], 9.55; 95% confidential interval [CI], 2.99 to 30.53) and cardiovascular death (OR, 13.02; 95% CI, 2.86 to 59.27) compared with resolved delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged delirium is associated with worse long-term and short-term outcomes than resolved delirium in patients with AHF.
