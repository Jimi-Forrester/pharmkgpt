METHODS: Protein profiles of human cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients with AD (n = 85), frontotemporal dementia (n = 20), and healthy controls (n = 32) were analyzed by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to verify previously discovered biomarkers. RESULTS: We verified 15 protein biomarkers that were able to differentiate between AD and controls, and 7 of these 15 markers also differentiated AD from FTD. CONCLUSION: A panel of cerebrospinal fluid protein markers was verified by a proteomics technology which may potentially improve the accuracy of the AD diagnosis.
