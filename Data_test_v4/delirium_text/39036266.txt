39036266|t|Biomedical Applications of Lauric Acid: A Narrative Review.
39036266|a|Lauric acid, a major component of coconut oil, has been studied for its various health benefits over the years. Lauric acid is a medium-chained fatty acid with several potential biomedical applications based on its antimicrobial action, capacity for drug delivery, tissue engineering scaffolds, and cleansing capabilities. Various studies are carried out in vitro and in vivo using experimental animals, such as rats, shedding light on the efficacy of lauric acid. The studies related to lauric acid were brought under one umbrella and emphasized the need for further research to explore the efficacy of lauric acid in human health. This review aims to scientifically assess the reported data and present a narrative review on lauric acid in medicine.
