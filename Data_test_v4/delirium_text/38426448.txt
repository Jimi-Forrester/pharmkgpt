38426448|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the predominant cause of dementia and a significant contributor to morbidity among the elderly. Patients diagnosed with AD face an increased risk of epileptic seizures. AREAS COVERED: Herein, the authors review the challenges in the diagnosis of seizures in patients with AD, the risks of seizures related to medications used in AD and the pharmacological treatment of seizures in AD. The authors also provide the reader with their expert opinion on the subject matter and future perspectives. EXPERT OPINION: Healthcare professionals should maintain a vigilant approach to suspecting seizures in AD patients. Acute symptomatic seizures triggered by metabolic disturbances, infections, toxins, or drug-related factors often have a low risk of recurrence. In such cases, addressing the underlying cause may suffice without initiating antiseizure medications (ASMs). However, unprovoked seizures in certain AD patients carry a higher risk of recurrence over time, warranting the use of ASMs. Although data is limited, both lamotrigine and levetiracetam appear to be reasonable choices for controlling seizures in elderly AD patients. Decisions should be informed by the best available evidence, the treating physician's clinical experience, and the patient's preferences.
