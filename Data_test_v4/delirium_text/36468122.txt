36468122|a|Simultaneous impact of zero valent iron (Fe ) and rice cultivar on uptake, translocation, and bioaccumulation of cobalt (Co) and lead (Pb) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was investigated to alleviate Co and Pb toxicity in rice. Kilombero and Faya rice cultivars, amended with Fe  dosages of 0, 6.20, and 12.40 g Fe  kg-1 soil, were cultivated under continuous flooding in pots in a greenhouse. Shoot and grain-Co and Pb concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). For Co, amending Faya rice with at least 6.20 g Fe  kg-1 reduced grain-Co accumulation by 33% or more compared to control plants (F = 17.5; p < 0.001) while inconsistent results were obtained for Kilombero. For Pb, Faya also accumulated more than 39% less grain-Pb than control plants (272 mug kg-1) while Kilombero accumulated more than 55% less grain-Pb than control plants under the same conditions. Despite reducing grain-Pb accumulation in both cultivar, Fe amendments of at least 6.20 g Fe  kg-1 reduced grain-Pb accumulation with greater magnitude in Kilombero (55%) than in Faya (39%). Nonetheless, Fe amendments inhibited greater shoots-Co and Pb translocation (>=32%) to grains in Faya compared to Kilombero (<=20%). The work provides a novel promising agronomical practice of reducing Co and Pb bioaccumulation in rice.
