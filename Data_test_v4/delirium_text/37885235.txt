37885235|t|Exposure to Sedation and Analgesia Medications: Short-term Cognitive Outcomes in Pediatric Critical Care Survivors With Acquired Brain Injury.
37885235|a|Background/Objective: Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) survivors risk significant cognitive morbidity, particularly those with acquired brain injury (ABI) diagnoses. Studies show sedative and analgesic medication may potentiate neurologic injury, but few studies evaluate impact on survivor outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate whether exposures to analgesic and sedative medications are associated with worse neurocognitive outcome. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 91 patients aged 8 to 18 years, undergoing clinical neurocognitive evaluation approximately 1 to 3 months after PICU discharge. Electronic health data was queried for sedative and analgesic medication exposures, including opioids, benzodiazepines, propofol, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine. Doses were converted to class equivalents, evaluated by any exposure and cumulative dose exposure per patient weight. Cognitive outcome was derived from 8 objective cognitive assessments with an emphasis on executive function skills using Principal Components Analysis. Then, linear regression was used to control for baseline cognitive function estimates to calculate a standardized residualized neurocognitive index (rNCI) z-score. Multivariable linear regression evaluated the association between rNCI and medication exposure controlling for covariates. Significance was defined as P < .05. Results: Most (n = 80; 88%) patients received 1 or more study medications. Any exposure and higher cumulative doses of benzodiazepine and ketamine were significantly associated with worse rNCI in bivariate analyses. When controlling for Medicaid, preadmission comorbid conditions, length of stay, delirium, and receipt of other medication classes, receipt of benzodiazepine was associated with significantly worse rNCI (beta-coefficient = -0.48, 95% confidence interval = -0.88, -0.08). Conclusions: Exposure to benzodiazepines was independently associated with worse acute phase cognitive outcome using objective assessments focused on executive function skills when controlling for demographic and illness characteristics. Clinician decisions regarding medication regimens in the PICU may serve as a modifiable factor to improve outcomes. Additional inquiry into associations with long-term cognitive outcome and optimal medication regimens is needed.
