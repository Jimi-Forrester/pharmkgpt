37141260|a|INTRODUCTION: Current evidence suggests the emergence of a novel syndrome (long COVID syndrome) due to sequels and persistent COVID-19 symptoms. Respiratory muscle training improves respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity, diaphragm thickness, and dyspnea, especially in patients with decreased respiratory muscle strength. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a protocol for home-based inspiratory muscle training to improve respiratory muscle strength, dyspnea, and quality of life of patients post-COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSES: This randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial will be conducted at the Instituto de Medicina Tropical of Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (Brazil). Sample size will be determined using maximal inspiratory pressure after a pilot study with five patients per group (total of 10 patients). Patients included in the study will be evaluated in three moments: pre-training (initial), post-training (three weeks), and retention (24 weeks). The sample will be randomized in two groups: active (IMT using 30% of IMT and load increase of 10% of initial IMT every week. Patients will perform 30 repetitions, twice a day (morning and afternoon), for seven consecutive days, and six weeks) and SHAM (IMT without load). The following measurements will be assessed: anthropometry, respiratory muscle strength, pulmonary volume and capacity, dyspnea, perception of effort and lower limb fatigue, handgrip strength, functional capacity, anxiety, depression, and functional status. After initial evaluation, all patients will receive a POWERbreathe  (POWERbreathe , HaB Ltd, Southam, UK) device to perform the training. Normality will be verified using Shapiro-Wilk or Kolmogorov-Smirnov, according to the number of patients included. Variables presenting nonparametric distribution will be compared using Wilcoxon (intragroup analysis) and Mann-Whitney test (intergroup analysis), whereas repeated measures two-way ANOVA will be performed in case of parametric distribution. Dunn's post hoc test will be used to identify significant differences in the two-way ANOVA test. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Respiratory muscle strength, dyspnea, and quality of life of post-COVID-19 patients. SECOND OUTCOMES: Pulmonary function, dyspnea, exercise tolerance, handgrip strength, anxiety, depression, and functional status. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial register number NCT05077241.
