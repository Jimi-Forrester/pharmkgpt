39846055|t|A 3D decoupling Alzheimer's disease prediction network based on structural MRI.
39846055|a|Purpose: This paper aims to develop a three-dimensional (3D) Alzheimer's disease (AD) prediction method, thereby bettering current predictive methods, which struggle to fully harness the potential of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data. Methods: Traditional convolutional neural networks encounter pressing difficulties in accurately focusing on the AD lesion structure. To address this issue, a 3D decoupling, self-attention network for AD prediction is proposed. Firstly, a multi-scale decoupling block is designed to enhance the network's ability to extract fine-grained features by segregating convolutional channels. Subsequently, a self-attention block is constructed to extract and adaptively fuse features from three directions (sagittal, coronal and axial), so that more attention is geared towards brain lesion areas. Finally, a clustering loss function is introduced and combined with the cross-entropy loss to form a joint loss function for enhancing the network's ability to discriminate between different sample types. Results: The accuracy of our model is 0.985 for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and 0.963 for the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle (AIBL) dataset, both of which are higher than the classification accuracy of similar tasks in this category. This demonstrates that our model can accurately distinguish between normal control (NC) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as well as between stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) and progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI). Conclusion: The proposed AD prediction network exhibits competitive performance when compared with state-of-the-art methods. The proposed model successfully addresses the challenges of dealing with 3D sMRI image data and the limitations stemming from inadequate information in 2D sections, advancing the utility of predictive methods for AD diagnosis and treatment.
