39702316|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of pathological proteins and synaptic dysfunction. This study aims to investigate the molecular and functional differences between human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from patients with sporadic AD (sAD) and age-matched controls (healthy subjects, HS), focusing on their neuronal differentiation and synaptic properties in order to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathology. METHODS: Skin fibroblasts from sAD patients (n = 5) and HS subjects (n = 5) were reprogrammed into hiPSCs using non-integrating Sendai virus vectors. Through karyotyping, we assessed pluripotency markers (OCT4, SOX2, TRA-1-60) and genomic integrity. Neuronal differentiation was evaluated by immunostaining for MAP2 and NEUN. Electrophysiological properties were measured using whole-cell patch-clamp, while protein expression of Abeta, phosphorylated tau, Synapsin-1, Synaptophysin, PSD95, and GluA1 was quantified by western blot. We then focused on PAK1-LIMK1-Cofilin signaling, which plays a key role in regulating synaptic structure and function, both of which are disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. RESULTS: sAD and HS hiPSCs displayed similar stemness features and genomic stability. However, they differed in neuronal differentiation and function. sAD-derived neurons (sAD-hNs) displayed increased levels of AD-related proteins, including Abeta and phosphorylated tau. Electrophysiological analyses revealed that while both sAD- and HS-hNs generated action potentials, sAD-hNs exhibited decreased spontaneous synaptic activity. Significant reductions in the expression of synaptic proteins such as Synapsin-1, Synaptophysin, PSD95, and GluA1 were found in sAD-hNs, which are also characterized by reduced neurite length, indicating impaired differentiation. Notably, sAD-hNs demonstrated a marked reduction in LIMK1 phosphorylation, which could be the underlying cause for the changes in cytoskeletal dynamics that we found, leading to the morphological and functional modifications observed in sAD-hNs. To further investigate the involvement of the LIMK1 pathway in the morphological and functional changes observed in sAD neurons, we conducted perturbation experiments using the specific LIMK1 inhibitor, BMS-5. Neurons obtained from healthy subjects treated with the inhibitor showed similar morphological changes to those observed in sAD neurons, confirming that LIMK1 activity is crucial for maintaining normal neuronal structure. Furthermore, administration of the inhibitor to sAD neurons did not exacerbate the morphological alterations, suggesting that LIMK1 activity is already compromised in these cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that although sAD- and HS-hiPSCs are similar in their stemness and genomic stability, sAD-hNs exhibit distinct functional and structural anomalies mirroring AD pathology. These anomalies include synaptic dysfunction, altered cytoskeletal organization, and accumulation of AD-related proteins. Our study underscores the usefulness of hiPSCs in modeling AD and provides insights into the disease's molecular underpinnings, thus highlighting potential therapeutic targets.
