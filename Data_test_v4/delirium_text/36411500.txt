36411500|a|BACKGROUND: [18F]flutemetamol is a PET radioligand used to image brain amyloid, but its detection of myocardial amyloid is not well-characterized. This histological study characterized binding of fluorescently labeled flutemetamol (cyano-flutemetamol) to amyloid deposits in myocardium. METHODS: Myocardial tissue was obtained post-mortem from 29 subjects with cardiac amyloidosis including transthyretin wild-type (ATTRwt), hereditary/variant transthyretin (ATTRv) and immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) types, and from 10 cardiac amyloid-free controls. Most subjects had antemortem electrocardiography, echocardiography, SPECT and cardiac MRI. Cyano-flutemetamol labeling patterns and integrated density values were evaluated relative to fluorescent derivatives of Congo red (X-34) and Pittsburgh compound-B (cyano-PiB). RESULTS: Cyano-flutemetamol labeling was not detectable in control subjects. In subjects with cardiac amyloidosis, cyano-flutemetamol labeling matched X-34- and cyano-PiB-labeled, and transthyretin- or lambda light chain-immunoreactive, amyloid deposits and was prevented by formic acid pre-treatment of myocardial sections. Cyano-flutemetamol mean fluorescence intensity, when adjusted for X-34 signal, was higher in the ATTRwt than the AL group. Cyano-flutemetamol integrated density correlated strongly with echocardiography measures of ventricular septal thickness and posterior wall thickness, and with heart mass. CONCLUSION: The high selectivity of cyano-flutemetamol binding to myocardial amyloid supports the diagnostic utility of [18F]flutemetamol PET imaging in patients with ATTR and AL types of cardiac amyloidosis.
