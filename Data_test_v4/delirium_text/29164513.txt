29164513|t|The Combined Effects of Iron Excess in the Diet and Chromium(III) Supplementation on the Iron and Chromium Status in Female Rats.
29164513|a|Inadequate iron supply has significant consequences to health. There are some relations between the metabolism of different trace elements, such as iron, zinc, copper and chromium. However, the direction of these interactions can be antagonistic or synergistic, and it depends on many factors. The aim of the study was to evaluate the combined effects of supplementary of chromium(III) propionate complex (Cr3) with iron excess on the Cr and Fe status in healthy female rats. The 36 healthy female Wistar rats were divided into six experimental groups (six animals in each) with different Fe levels-adequate (45 mg kg-1-100% RDA) and high (excessive-180 mg kg-1-400% RDA). At the same time, they were supplemented with Cr(III) at doses of 1, 50 and 500 mg kg-1 of diet: C1-control (Fe 45 mg kg-1, Cr 1 mg kg-1); C50 (Fe 45 mg kg-1, Cr 50 mg kg-1); C500 (Fe 45 mg kg-1, Cr 500 mg kg-1); H1 (Fe 180 mg kg-1, Cr 1 mg kg-1); H50 (Fe 180 mg kg-1, Cr 50 mg kg-1); H500 (Fe 180 mg kg-1, Cr 500 mg kg-1). The serum iron level and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) were measured with colorimetric methods. The serum ferritin level was measured by means of electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. The serum transferrin level was measured with the ELISA method. Haematological measurements were made with an automated blood analyser. The Cr and Fe tissular levels were measured with the AAS method. The exposure to a high level of Fe(III) alone or in combination with Cr caused Fe accumulation in tissues, especially in the liver and kidneys, but there were no significant changes in the TIBC, transferrin, ferritin concentration in the serum and most haematological parameters. Moreover, the serum, hepatic and renal Cr concentrations decreased. The doses of supplementary Cr(III) given separately or in combination with high level of Fe(III) disturbed the Cr content in the liver and kidneys of healthy female rats. However, they did not change most of the parameters of Fe metabolism, except the Fe kidney concentration. Supplementary Cr3 decreased the renal Fe level in groups with adequate Fe content in the diet. However, the renal Fe levels increased along with a higher Cr level in the diet in groups with high Fe content. The findings proved a relationship between Fe(III) and Cr(III) metabolism in healthy female rats. However, the direction of change varied and depended on relative amounts of these elements in the diet.
