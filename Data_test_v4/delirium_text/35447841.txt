35447841|t|Lipid-Targeted Atherosclerotic Risk Reduction in Older Adults: A Review.
35447841|a|Aggressive lipid-lowering lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic therapies are the cornerstones of the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events. While statins are highly effective, inexpensive, and generally well-tolerated medications, many clinicians and patients express uncertainty regarding the necessity of statin treatment in older adults. Citing concerns such as polypharmacy, muscle symptoms, and even potential cognitive changes with statins, many patients and health care providers elect to de-intensify or discontinue statin therapy during the process of aging. A lack of clear representation of older individuals in many clinical trials and practice guidelines may contribute to the ambiguity. However, the recently prevailing data and practice patterns supporting the benefits, safety, and tolerability of a variety of lipid-lowering therapeutics in older adults are discussed here, with particular mention of a potential protective effect from incident dementia among a statin-treated geriatric population and an admonishment of the historical concept of "too-low" low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels.
