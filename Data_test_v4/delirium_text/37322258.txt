37322258|a|Overcoming multidrug resistance (MDR) represents a major obstacle in cancer chemotherapy. Cardiac glycosides (CGs) are efficient in the treatment of heart failure and recently emerged in a new role in the treatment of cancer. ZINC253504760, a synthetic cardenolide that is structurally similar to well-known GCs, digitoxin and digoxin, has not been investigated yet. This study aims to investigate the cytotoxicity of ZINC253504760 on MDR cell lines and its molecular mode of action for cancer treatment. Four drug-resistant cell lines (P-glycoprotein-, ABCB5-, and EGFR-overexpressing cells, and TP53-knockout cells) did not show cross-resistance to ZINC253504760 except BCRP-overexpressing cells. Transcriptomic profiling indicated that cell death and survival as well as cell cycle (G2/M damage) were the top cellular functions affected by ZINC253504760 in CCRF-CEM cells, while CDK1 was linked with the downregulation of MEK and ERK. With flow cytometry, ZINC253504760 induced G2/M phase arrest. Interestingly, ZINC253504760 induced a novel state-of-the-art mode of cell death (parthanatos) through PARP and PAR overexpression as shown by western blotting, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation by immunofluorescence, DNA damage by comet assay, and mitochondrial membrane potential collapse by flow cytometry. These results were ROS-independent. Furthermore, ZINC253504760 is an ATP-competitive MEK inhibitor evidenced by its interaction with the MEK phosphorylation site as shown by molecular docking in silico and binding to recombinant MEK by microscale thermophoresis in vitro. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to describe a cardenolide that induces parthanatos in leukemia cells, which may help to improve efforts to overcome drug resistance in cancer. A cardiac glycoside compound ZINC253504760 displayed cytotoxicity against different multidrug-resistant cell lines. ZINC253504760 exhibited cytotoxicity in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells by predominantly inducing a new mode of cell death (parthanatos). ZINC253504760 downregulated MEK1/2 phosphorylation and further affected ERK activation, which induced G2/M phase arrest.
