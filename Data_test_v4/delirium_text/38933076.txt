38933076|a|This report aims to present an elderly woman with persistent delirium after hospitalization for lethargy secondary to hyponatremia. The diagnosis of pontine myelinolysis was made and there were no characteristic neurological manifestations such as pupillary changes or spastic tetraparesis. Hallucinations and personality changes were the clues to the diagnosis and should be considered an atypical manifestation of pontine myelinolysis.
