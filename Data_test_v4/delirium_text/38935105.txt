38935105|a|A balanced and healthy diet during the menopausal transition and after menopause is crucial for women to reduce the risk for morbidities and chronic diseases due to deficiency of essential nutrients. PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of studies that analyzed the impact of vitamin and nutrient deficiencies in postmenopausal women in relation to increased morbidities and chronic conditions. METHODS: Observational studies were searched in the databases PubMed, UpToDate, and Google Scholar. RESULTS: We searched 122 studies, of which 90 were included in our analysis. The meta-analysis of the data could not be performed because of the heterogeneity of the statistical methods in the included studies. In our study, we focused on the aspects of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron, omega-3-fatty acids, and lycopene, belonging to the family of carotenoids. Postmenopausal women with deficiencies of these nutrients are more vulnerable to comorbidities such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, metabolic diseases, osteoporosis, obesity, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression, cognitive decline, dementia, and stroke. We concluded that women after menopause tend to have a greater probability of suffering from deficiencies in various vitamins and nutrients, and consequently have an increased risk of developing morbidities and chronic diseases. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, maintaining optimum serum levels of nutrients and vitamins, either through a balanced and healthy diet consuming fresh fruits, vegetables, and fats or by taking appropriate supplementation, is essential in maintaining optimal health-related quality of life and reducing the risk for women during the menopausal transition and after menopause. Nevertheless, more recent studies need to be assessed to formulate adequate recommendations to achieve positive clinical outcomes.
