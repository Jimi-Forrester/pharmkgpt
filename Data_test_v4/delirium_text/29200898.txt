29200898|a|Asthma in pregnancy poses a risk of adverse outcomes. Osteopontin and clusterin emerged as asthma biomarkers; however, their circulating levels during pregnancy are unknown yet. This cross-sectional study investigated peripheral osteopontin and clusterin levels and their relationship to disease control in 26 asthmatic pregnant (AP), 22 asthmatic nonpregnant (ANP), and 25 healthy pregnant (HP) women and 12 healthy controls (HNP). Osteopontin levels of ANP and HNP were similar (2.142 [1.483-2.701] versus 2.075 [1.680-2.331] ng/mL, p = 0.7331). Pregnancy caused a marked elevation in both healthy (HP: 3.037 [2.439-4.015] ng/ml, p = 0.003 versus HNP) and asthmatic (AP: 2.693 [1.581-3.620] ng/ml) patients; thus the pregnant groups did not differ (p = 0.3541). Circulating clusterin levels were comparable in ANP and HNP (109.2 [95.59-116.3] versus 108.8 [97.94-115.3] microg/mL, p = 0.8730) and the level was lower in HP (98.80 [84.26-105.5] microg/mL, p = 0.0344 versus HNP). In contrast, the level was higher in AP (111.7 [98.84-125.6] microg/mL, p = 0.0091 versus HP). In ANP, a positive correlation of PEF (r = 0.3405; p = 0.0221) and a negative correlation of Raw (r = -0.3723; p = 0.0128) to clusterin level were detected. Circulating osteopontin level increases in pregnancy regardless of concomitant well-controlled asthma, indicating its gestational role. Clusterin level decreases in healthy but not in asthmatic pregnancy and correlates directly with lung function.
