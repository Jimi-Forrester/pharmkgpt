35528360|a|Objective: To explore the effect of applying Dahuang Zhechong pills (DHZCP) from Jingui Yaolue to patients with early-to-mid prostate cancer undergoing radical resection and carry out a theoretical clinical study of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to verify the effect of DHZCP formula under the guidance of TCM theory. Methods: The clinical data of 98 patients with early-to-mid prostate cancer undergoing radical resection treated in our hospital (July 2014 to July 2016) were selected for the retrospective analysis, and the patients were divided into group A (n = 49, routine hormonal therapy) and group B (n = 49, routine hormonal therapy plus DHZCP) according to the double blind method, so as to compare the trauma symptoms, cancer recurrence rate, etc., after treatment between the two groups. Results: Compared with group A, group B obtained significantly higher total effective rate of complication treatment at different time points (P < 0.05), significantly lower mean HAMA score after treatment (P < 0.05), and significantly lower total recurrence rate (P < 0.05). The "congestion" theory in Chapter VI On Pulse, Symptom Complex and Treatment of Arthralgia Due to Stagnation of Blood and Consumptive Diseases of Jingui Yaolue was the theoretical basis for postoperative effect observation of DHZCP in treating prostate cancer. Combining with the onset theory of congestion, personally, the author believed that cancer is caused by congestion disease formed by the extravasated blood in the human body, and with the passing of time, the intermingled deficiency, blood stasis, and toxicity lead to the qualitative change of endogenous cancer toxicity and develop into consumptive congestion disease, making it the core pathogenesis of cancer. And DHZCP had good preventive and treatment effect. Conclusion: DHZCP is an effective drug for improving postoperative complications of early-to-mid prostate cancer, reducing the biological recurrence rate and clinical recurrence rate, and improving mental status. The formula treats both deficiency and excess, combines tonification with purgation, and dispels exogenous pathogen without damaging body resistance, which is a profound formula based on TCM theory to treat "congestion," "congestion disease," and "consumptive congestion disease." Using this theory to guide clinical syndrome differentiation and treatment and modifying the dosage and usage can play an important role in TCM preventive treatment of cancers, early, middle, and late treatment, and clinical prevention of other chronic diseases.
