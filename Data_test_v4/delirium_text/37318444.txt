37318444|t|Neuroprotection of Retinal Ganglion Cells Suppresses Microglia Activation in a Mouse Model of Glaucoma.
37318444|a|Purpose: Microglial activation has been implicated in many neurodegenerative eye diseases, but the interrelationship between cell loss and microglia activation remains unclear. In glaucoma, there is no consensus yet whether microglial activation precedes or is a consequence of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration. We therefore investigated the temporal and spatial appearance of activated microglia in retina and their correspondence to RGC degeneration in glaucoma. Methods: We used an established microbead occlusion model of glaucoma in mouse whereby intraocular pressure (IOP) was elevated. Specific antibodies were used to immunolabel microglia in resting and activated states. To block retinal gap junction (GJ) communication, which has been shown previously to provide significant neuroprotection of RGCs, the GJ blocker meclofenamic acid was administered or connexin36 (Cx36) GJ subunits were ablated genetically. We then studied microglial activation at different time points after microbead injection in control and neuroprotected retinas. Results: Histochemical analysis of flatmount retinas revealed major changes in microglia morphology, density, and immunoreactivity in microbead-injected eyes. An early stage of microglial activation followed IOP elevation, as indicated by changes in morphology and cell density, but preceded RGC death. In contrast, the later stage of microglia activation, associated with upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class II expression, corresponded temporally to the initial loss of RGCs. However, we found that protection of RGCs afforded by GJ blockade or genetic ablation largely suppressed microglial changes at all stages of activation in glaucomatous retinas. Conclusions: Together, our data strongly suggest that microglia activation in glaucoma is a consequence, rather than a cause, of initial RGC degeneration and death.
