37372414|t|Divergent Transcriptomic Effects of Allopregnanolone in Postpartum Depression.
37372414|a|Brexanolone, a formulation of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (ALLO), is approved for treating postpartum depression (PPD) and is being investigated for therapeutic efficacy across numerous neuropsychiatric disorders. Given ALLO's beneficial effects on mood in women with PPD compared to healthy control women, we sought to characterize and compare the cellular response to ALLO in women with (n = 9) or without (n = 10, i.e., Controls) past PPD, utilizing our previously established patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). To mimic in vivo PPD ALLO-treatment, LCLs were exposed to ALLO or DMSO vehicle for 60 h and RNA-sequenced to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs, pnominal < 0.05). Between ALLO-treated Control and PPD LCLs, 269 DEGs were identified, including Glutamate Decarboxylase 1 (GAD1), which was decreased 2-fold in PPD. Network analysis of PPD:ALLO DEGs revealed enriched terms related to synaptic activity and cholesterol biosynthesis. Within-diagnosis analyses (i.e., DMSO vs. ALLO) detected 265 ALLO-induced DEGs in Control LCLs compared to only 98 within PPD LCLs, with just 11 DEGs overlapping. Likewise, the gene ontologies underlying ALLO-induced DEGs in PPD and Control LCLs were divergent. These data suggest that ALLO may activate unique and opposing molecular pathways in women with PPD, which may be tied to its antidepressant mechanism.
