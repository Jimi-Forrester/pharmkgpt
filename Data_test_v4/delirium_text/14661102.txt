14661102|a|This review has focused on the evidence for the involvement of nitrative oxidation in certain neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), stroke, and inflammatory and autoimmune disorders (with particular attention devoted to multiple sclerosis). The relationship between protein peroxidation and pathological changes observed in the above disorders has been reported. Whereas many of the findings are from studies with animal models and autoptic specimens from human patients, few data are available from cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples of the patients at different times and disease stages. The participation of nitrative oxidation to the direct and indirect injury of neurons and other cells of the brain (i.e., oligodendrocytes, for multiple sclerosis) is clear; less evident is their relevance for the development and progression of these disorders.Further studies should be aimed to establish the clinical and prognostic value of peroxidative markers for the CNS diseases considered. This is fundamental for the development of therapeutic interventions antagonizing nitric oxide-related species damage.
