33454341|a|Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) outcomes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have not been fully evaluated and some structural programs in the world have been suspended during this period. We sought to evaluate and compare clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI in pandemic versus nonpandemic era. In a single center, we compared 198 TAVI patients performed during 2019 to 59 patients performed during the COVID-19 pandemic period (March 1st to June 30th, 2020). Primary outcome was procedural success according to VARC criteria and 30-day mortality rates. VARC-defined procedural success was high in both groups (93.3% vs 96.6%; p = 0.53). There were no differences in any vascular complications (26% vs 19%; p = 0.3), permanent pacemaker implantation (11.8% vs 15.3%; p = 0.63), and length of hospital stay (5.2 vs 4.2 days; p = 0.29). Thirty-day mortality was similar (3% vs 3.4%; p = 1.0). We had no documented COVID-19 disease in our patients during follow up. In conclusion, TAVI procedures can be performed effectively and safely during the COVID-9 pandemic, using a minimalist approach, early discharge, and by maintaining proper use of personal protective equipment.
