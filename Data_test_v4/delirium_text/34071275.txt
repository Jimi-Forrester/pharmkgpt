34071275|t|Assessment of EULAR/ACR-2019, SLICC-2012 and ACR-1997 Classification Criteria in SLE with Longstanding Disease.
34071275|a|BACKGROUND: Different classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been launched over the years. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of the EULAR/ACR-2019, SLICC-2012 and ACR-1997 classification criteria in a cohort of SLE patients with longstanding disease. METHODS: Descriptive observational study in 79 patients with established and longstanding SLE. The three classification criteria sets were applied to those patients. RESULTS: Of the 79 patients, 70 were women (88.6%), with a mean age of 51.8 +- 14 years and a mean disease duration of 15.2 +- 11.5 years. The sensitivity of the different criteria were: 51.9%, 87.3% and 86.1% for ACR-1997, SLICC-2012 and EULAR/ACR-2019, respectively. In total, 68 out of 79 patients (53.7%) met all three classification criteria; 11.4% did not meet any classification criteria and were characterized by low SLEDAI (0.6 +- 0.9), low SLICC/ACR Damage Index (0.88 +- 0.56) and fulfilling only skin domains, antiphospholipid antibodies or hypocomplementemia. To fulfill EULAR/ACR-2019 criteria was associated with low complement levels (p < 0.04), high anti-dsDNA levels (p < 0.001), presence of lupus nephritis III-IV (p < 0.05) and arthritis (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The EULAR/ACR-2019 classification criteria showed high sensitivity, similar to SLICC-2012, in SLE patients with longstanding disease. Patients with serological, articular or renal involvement are more likely to fulfill SLICC-2012 or EULAR/ACR-2019 criteria.
