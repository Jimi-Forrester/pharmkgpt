35219435|a|On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, a global pandemic. This pandemic disrupted health care for patients and providers. Uncertainty about COVID-19 played a significant role in the negative mental health impact in older adults. The effect of increasing age on morbidity and mortality in those who came down with COVID-19 has been substantial. The pandemic took a tremendous toll on the mental and physical health of older adults in general with even more severe consequences in more disadvantaged populations within the group.
