36879184|a|INTRODUCTION: Few studies with controls from the same cohort have investigated the impact of stroke on the ability to live an independent life at old age. We aimed to analyze how great an impact being a stroke survivor would have on cognition and disability. We also analyzed the predictive value of baseline cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS: We included 1147 men, free from stroke, dementia, and disability, from the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men, between 69-74 years of age. Follow-up data were collected between the ages of 85-89 years and were available for 481 of all 509 survivors. Data on stroke diagnosis were obtained through national registries. Dementia was diagnosed through a systematic review of medical charts and in accordance with the current diagnostic criteria. The primary outcome, preserved functions, was a composite outcome comprising four criteria: no dementia, independent in personal activities of daily living, ability to walk outside unassisted, and not living in an institution. RESULTS: Among 481 survivors with outcome data, 64 (13%) suffered a stroke during the follow-up. Only 31% of stroke cases, compared to 72% of non-stroke cases (adjusted OR 0.20 [95% CI 0.11-0.37]), had preserved functions. The chance of being free of dementia was 60% lower in the stroke group, OR 0.40 [95% CI 0.22-0.72]. No cardiovascular risk factors were independently able to predict preserved functions among stroke cases. CONCLUSION: Stroke has long lasting consequences for many aspects of disability at very high age.
