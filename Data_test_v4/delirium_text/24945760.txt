24945760|t|Tau propagation, different tau phenotypes, and prion-like properties of tau.
24945760|a|Sanders et al. (2014) demonstrate in this issue of Neuron that the natively unfolded protein tau can propagate indefinitely in distinct stable strains, therefore supporting the general idea that tau has prion-like properties, with implications for Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies.
