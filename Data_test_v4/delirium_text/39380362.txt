39380362|a|The Izpisua-Belmonte group identified a cocktail of metabolites that promote partial reprogramming in cultured muscle cells. We tested the effect of brain injection of these metabolites in the dentate gyrus of aged wild-type mice. The dentate gyrus is a brain region essential for memory function and is extremely vulnerable to aging. A single injection of the cocktail containing four compounds (putrescine, glycine, methionine and threonine) partially reversed brain aging phenotypes and epigenetic alterations in age-associated genes. Our analysis revealed three levels: chromatin methylation, RNA sequencing, and protein expression. Functional studies complemented the previous ones, showing cognitive improvement. In summary, we report the reversal of various age-associated epigenetic changes, such as the transcription factor Zic4, and several changes related to cellular rejuvenation in the dentate gyrus (DG). These changes include increased expression of the Sox2 protein. Finally, the increases in the survival of newly generated neurons and the levels of the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B were accompanied by improvements in both short-term and long-term memory performance. Based on these results, we propose the use of these metabolites to explore new strategies for the development of potential treatments for age-related brain diseases.
