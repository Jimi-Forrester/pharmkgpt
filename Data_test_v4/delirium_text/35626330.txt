35626330|a|Although eosinophilic inflammation is characteristic of asthma pathogenesis, neutrophilic inflammation is also marked, and eosinophils and neutrophils can coexist in some cases. Based on the proportion of sputum cell differentiation, asthma is classified into eosinophilic asthma, neutrophilic asthma, neutrophilic and eosinophilic asthma, and paucigranulocytic asthma. Classification by bronchoalveolar lavage is also performed. Eosinophilic asthma accounts for most severe asthma cases, but neutrophilic asthma or a mixture of the two types can also present a severe phenotype. Biomarkers for the diagnosis of neutrophilic asthma include sputum neutrophils, blood neutrophils, chitinase-3-like protein, and hydrogen sulfide in sputum and serum. Thymic stromal lymphoprotein (TSLP)/T-helper 17 pathways, bacterial colonization/microbiome, neutrophil extracellular traps, and activation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 pathways are involved in the pathophysiology of neutrophilic asthma and coexistence of obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and habitual cigarette smoking have been associated with its pathogenesis. Thus, targeting neutrophilic asthma is important. Smoking cessation, neutrophil-targeting treatments, and biologics have been tested as treatments for severe asthma, but most clinical studies have not focused on neutrophilic asthma. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, anti-TSLP antibodies, azithromycin, and anti-cholinergic agents are promising drugs for neutrophilic asthma. However, clinical research targeting neutrophilic inflammation is required to elucidate the optimal treatment.
