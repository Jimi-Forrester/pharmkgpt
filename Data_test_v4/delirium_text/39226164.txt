39226164|t|Exploring the Frontier: Antisense Long Non-Coding RNAs as Key Regulators in Alzheimer's Disease.
39226164|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent, costly, and fatal neurodegenerative disorder of this century. Two hallmark features of AD are the anomalous cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which leads to the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta), and the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. Despite extensive research efforts, the pathology and pathogenesis of AD remain elusive. Recent investigations have highlighted the close association between antisense long non-coding RNAs (AS-lncRNAs) and various biological and functional aspects of AD. However, many AS-lncRNAs implicated in AD have not yet been comprehensively compiled and discussed. This paper reviews the role of AS-lncRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases, outlines their association with AD, and offers novel insights into the potential applications of antisense RNAs in the diagnosis and treatment of AD.
