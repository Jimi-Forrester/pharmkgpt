36644856|t|In-silico docking and molecular dynamic introspective study of multiple targets of AChE with Rivastigmine and NMDA receptors with Riluzole for Alzheimer's disease.
36644856|a|The present study was initiated with PDB selection and validation where 11 acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 4 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) proteins were considered for docking with Rivastigmine and Riluzole respectively. Out of the 15 proteins, selected significant binding was observed for AChE, with 5FPQ, and NMDA receptors with 5I2K. Molecular docking studies of 5FPQ/Rivastigmine complex displayed a binding score of -8.6 kcal/mol, and the predicted inhibitory concentration (Ki) was found to be 31 nM, whereas the 5I2K/Riluzole complex showed a binding score of -9.6 kcal/mol, with an inhibitory concentration (Ki) of 21 nM. Riluzole in complex with 5I2K formed predominant pi-pi stacking interactions with Tyr144, pi-alkyl interaction with Pro129, and conventional hydrogen bond with Phe130. In contrast, Rivastigmine in a complex with 5FPQ formed a hydrogen bond with Gln413 and pi-alkyl with Pro537. Molecular dynamics simulation study of both complexes 5FPQ/Rivastigmine and 5I2K/Riluzole exhibited stable RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and significant numbers of hydrogen bonds. From free energy landscape (FEL) analysis both complexes were observed to achieve global minima. Overall, molecular docking and MD simulation with subsequent binding free energies studies (MM-PBSA) elucidate the binding conformations and stability of these reprogrammed drugs in the AChE and NMDAR targets. From these in-silico predictions, it can be suggested that both Rivastigmine and Riluzole combination may provide better insights as a starting point combination therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
