37476323|t|Memantine Use and Cognitive Decline in Huntington's Disease: An Enroll-HD Study.
37476323|a|Background: Memantine is an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that is used to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) and has been speculated to provide clinical benefits in Huntington's disease (HD). Objective: To assess the effectiveness of memantine on the trajectory of cognitive decline in individuals with manifest HD. Methods: Using participants from the Enroll-HD study, the primary analysis compared trajectories in cognition over a 5-year period using linear mixed effect models of prevalent and incident memantine users who were propensity-score-matched with non-users on measures of disease progression and demographics. Results: In the primary analysis there were no significant differences in the trajectories between memantine users and non-users on any primary outcomes of interest. Conclusions: Memantine use was not associated with any clinical benefit for individuals with manifest HD. Further studies are warranted to assess the impact of memantine on clinical outcomes in HD.
