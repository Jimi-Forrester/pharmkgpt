38791227|t|Anti-Inflammatory Potential of the Anti-Diabetic Drug Metformin in the Prevention of Inflammatory Complications and Infectious Diseases Including COVID-19: A Narrative Review.
38791227|a|Metformin, a widely used first-line anti-diabetic therapy for the treatment of type-2 diabetes, has been shown to lower hyperglycemia levels in the blood by enhancing insulin actions. For several decades this drug has been used globally to successfully control hyperglycemia. Lactic acidosis has been shown to be a major adverse effect of metformin in some type-2 diabetic patients, but several studies suggest that it is a typically well-tolerated and safe drug in most patients. Further, recent studies also indicate its potential to reduce the symptoms associated with various inflammatory complications and infectious diseases including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These studies suggest that besides diabetes, metformin could be used as an adjuvant drug to control inflammatory and infectious diseases. In this article, we discuss the current understanding of the role of the anti-diabetic drug metformin in the prevention of various inflammatory complications and infectious diseases in both diabetics and non-diabetics.
