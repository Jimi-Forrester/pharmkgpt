39449627|t|Racial and ethnic disparities in social isolation and 11-year dementia risk among older adults in the United States.
39449627|a|AIMS: Social isolation has been implicated in the development of cognitive impairment, but research on this association remains limited among racial-ethnic minoritized populations. Our study examined the interplay between social isolation, race-ethnicity and dementia. METHODS: We analyzed 11 years (2011-2021) of National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) data, a prospective nationally representative cohort of U.S. Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. Dementia status was determined using a validated NHATS algorithm. We constructed a longitudinal score using a validated social isolation variable for our sample of 6,155 community-dwelling respondents. Cox regression determined how the interaction between social isolation and race-ethnicity was associated with incident dementia risk. RESULTS: Average longitudinal frequency of social isolation was higher among older Black (27.6%), Hispanic (26.6%) and Asian (21.0%) respondents than non-Hispanic White (19.1%) adults during the 11-year period (t = -7.35, p < .001). While a higher frequency of social isolation was significantly associated with an increased (approximately 47%) dementia risk after adjusting for sociodemographic covariates (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.47, 95% CI [1.15, 1.88], p < .01), this association was not significant after adjusting for health covariates (aHR = 1.21, 95% CI [0.96, 1.54], p = .11). Race-ethnicity was not a significant moderator in the association between social isolation and dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults from racial-ethnic minoritized populations experienced a higher longitudinal frequency of social isolation. However, race-ethnicity did not moderate the positive association observed between social isolation and dementia. Future research is needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms contributing to racial-ethnic disparities in social isolation and to develop targeted interventions to mitigate the associated dementia risk.
