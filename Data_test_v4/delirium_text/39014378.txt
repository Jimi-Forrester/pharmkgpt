39014378|a|BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in the United States necessitates further investigation into its impact on complications associated with total hip arthroplasty (THA). This study utilizes a large nationwide database to explore risk factors in DKD cases undergoing THA. METHODS: This research utilized a case-control design, leveraging data from the national inpatient sample for the years 2016 to 2019. Employing propensity score matching (PSM), patients diagnosed with DKD were paired on a 1:1 basis with individuals free of DKD, ensuring equivalent age, sex, race, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI), and insurance coverage. Subsequently, comparisons were drawn between these PSM-matched cohorts, examining their characteristics and the incidence of post-THA complications. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was then employed to evaluate the risk of early complications after surgery. RESULTS: DKD's prevalence in the THA cohort was 2.38%. A 7-year age gap separated DKD and non-DKD patients (74 vs. 67 years, P < 0.0001). Additionally, individuals aged above 75 exhibited a substantial 22.58% increase in DKD risk (49.16% vs. 26.58%, P < 0.0001). Notably, linear regression analysis yielded a significant association between DKD and postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI), with DKD patients demonstrating 2.274-fold greater odds of AKI in contrast with non-DKD individuals (95% CI: 2.091-2.473). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that DKD is a significant risk factor for AKI in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. Optimizing preoperative kidney function through appropriate interventions might decrease the risk of poor prognosis in this population. More prospective research is warranted to investigate the potential of targeted kidney function improvement strategies in reducing AKI rates after THA. The findings of this study hold promise for enhancing preoperative counseling by surgeons, enabling them to provide DKD patients undergoing THA with more precise information regarding the risks associated with their condition.
