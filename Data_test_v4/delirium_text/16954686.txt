16954686|a|BACKGROUND: The control of translation, involving the kinases mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and PKR (double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase), modulates cell survival and death and is altered in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD increased susceptibility of lymphocytes to apoptosis has been reported. METHODS: We investigated the level of the kinases mTOR and PKR and the eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) in lymphocytes of patients with AD in comparison with controls. In AD patients we also looked for a correlation between activated proteins and cognitive and memory tests. RESULTS: We report significant alterations of the levels of these kinases and eIF2alpha in lymphocytes of AD patients that were also significantly correlated with cognitive and memory test scores. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the levels of mTOR, PKR and eIF2alpha in lymphocytes could follow the cognitive decline in AD.
