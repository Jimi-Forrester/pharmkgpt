18684235|t|Resveratrol: a natural compound with pharmacological potential in neurodegenerative diseases.
18684235|a|Resveratrol is a phytoalexin structurally related to stilbenes, which is synthesized in considerable amounts in the skin of grapes, raspberries, mulberries, pistachios and peanuts, and by at least 72 medicinal and edible plant species in response to stress conditions. It was isolated in 1940 and did not maintain much interest for around five decades until its role in treatment of cardiovascular diseases was suggested. To date, resveratrol has been identified as an agent that may be useful to treat cancer, pain, inflammation, tissue injury, and other diseases. However, currently the attention is being focused in analyzing its properties against neurodegenerative diseases and as antiaging compound. It has been reported that resveratrol shows effects in in vitro models of epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and nerve injury. However, evidences in vivo as well as in human beings are still lacking. Thus, further investigations on the pharmacological effects of resveratrol in vivo are necessary before any conclusions on its effects on neurodegenerative diseases can be obtained.
