15450355|a|Changes in the amyloid-peptide (Abeta), neuronal and inducible nitric oxide (NO)synthase (nNOS, iNOS), nitrotyrosine, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and lectin from Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) were investigated in the cerebral cortex of transgenic mice (Tg2576) to amyloid precursor protein (APP), by immunohistochemistry (bright light, confocal, and electron microscopy). The expression of nitrergic proteins and synthesis of nitric oxide were analyzed by immunoblotting and NOS activity assays, respectively. The cerebral cortex of these transgenic mice showed an age-dependent progressive increase in intraneuronal aggregates of Abeta-peptide and extracellular formation of senile plaques surrounded by numerous microglial and reactive astrocytes. Basically, no changes to nNOS reactivity or expression were found in the cortical mantle of either wild or transgenic mice. This reactivity in wild mice corresponded to numerous large type I and small type II neurons. The transgenic mice showed swollen, twisted, and hypertrophic preterminal and terminal processes of type I neurons, and an increase of the type II neurons. The calcium-dependent NOS enzymatic activity was higher in wild than in the transgenic mice. The iNOS reactivity, expression and calcium-independent enzymatic activity increased in transgenic mice with respect to wild mice, and were related to cortical neurons and microglial cells. The progressive elevation of NO production resulted in a specific pattern of protein nitration in reactive astrocytes. The ultrastructural study carried out in the cortical mantle showed that the neurons contained intracellular aggregates of Abeta-peptide associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus. The endothelial vascular cells also contained Abeta-peptide deposits. This transgenic model might contribute to understand the role of the nitrergic system in the biological changes related to neuropathological progression of Alzheimer's disease.
