2515465|a|Because of the well-established reduction in the concentration of somatostatin in several brain areas of patients with histologically verified Alzheimer's disease, we sought to determine if growth hormone (GH) secretion is altered in Alzheimer's disease. In order to study this, we assessed the GH response to growth hormone releasing factor (GRF) in 8 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 8 age-matched controls. Although there was no difference between the magnitude of the GRF-induced GH response (delta max GH response or area under the curve) between the Alzheimer's disease patients and the controls, the Alzheimer's patients exhibited a delayed GH response to GRF.
