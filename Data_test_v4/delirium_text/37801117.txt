37801117|t|Immunolabelling perturbs the endogenous and antibody-conjugated elemental concentrations during immuno-mass spectrometry imaging.
37801117|a|Immuno-mass spectrometry imaging uses lanthanide-conjugated antibodies to spatially quantify biomolecules via laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The multi-element capabilities allow for highly multiplexed analyses that may include both conjugated antibodies and endogenous metals to reveal relationships between disease and chemical composition. Sample handling is known to perturb the composition of the endogenous elements, but there has been little investigation into the effects of immunolabelling and coverslipping. Here, we used cryofixed muscle sections to examine the impact of immunolabelling steps on the concentrations of a Gd-conjugated anti-dystrophin primary antibody, and the endogenous metals Cu and Zn. Primary antibody incubation resulted in a decrease in Zn, and an increase in Cu. Zn was removed from the cytoplasm where it was hypothesised to be more labile, whereas concentrated locations of Zn remained in the cell membrane in all samples that underwent the immunostaining process. Cu increased in concentration and was found mostly in the cell membrane. The concentration of the Gd-conjugated antibody when compared to the standard air-dried sample was not significantly different when coverslipped using an organic mounting medium, whereas use of an aqueous mounting medium significantly reduced the concentration of Gd. These results build on the knowledge of how certain sample handling techniques change elemental concentrations and distributions in tissue sections. Immunolabelling steps impact the concentration of endogenous elements, and separate histological sections are required for the quantitative analysis of endogenous elements and biomolecules. Additionally, coverslipping tissue sections for complementary immunohistochemical/immunofluorescent imaging may compromise the integrity of the elemental label, and organic mounting media are recommended over aqueous mounting media.
