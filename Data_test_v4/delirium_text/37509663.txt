37509663|t|Exploratory Longitudinal Study of Ocular Structural and Visual Functional Changes in Subjects at High Genetic Risk of Developing Alzheimer's Disease.
37509663|a|This study aimed to analyze the evolution of visual changes in cognitively healthy individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants with a first-degree family history of AD (FH+) and carrying the Epsilon4+ allele for the ApoE gene (ApoE epsilon4+) underwent retinal thickness analysis using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual function assessments, including visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity (CS), color perception, perception digital tests, and visual field analysis. Structural analysis divided participants into FH+ ApoE epsilon4+ and FH- ApoE epsilon4- groups, while functional analysis further categorized them by age (40-60 years and over 60 years). Over the 27-month follow-up, the FH+ ApoE epsilon4+ group exhibited thickness changes in all inner retinal layers. Comparing this group to the FH- ApoE epsilon4- group at 27 months revealed progressing changes in the inner nuclear layer. In the FH+ ApoE epsilon4+ 40-60 years group, no progression of visual function changes was observed, but an increase in VA and CS was maintained at 3 and 12 cycles per degree, respectively, compared to the group without AD risk at 27 months. In conclusion, cognitively healthy individuals at risk for AD demonstrated progressive retinal structural changes over the 27-month follow-up, while functional changes remained stable.
