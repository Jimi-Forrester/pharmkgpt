25084796|a|OBJECTIVE: Melatonin is effective in the prevention and treatment of delirium. Ramelteon has few adverse effects and higher affinity for MT1 and MT2 receptors than melatonin. The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of ramelteon in elderly patients with delirium caused by different primary diseases/conditions. METHOD: We treated 10 consecutive elderly patients having delirium with ramelteon. RESULTS: Of the 10 patients, six showed improvement, and no marked adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that ramelteon was a safe and useful alternative to melatonin for the treatment of delirium in elderly patients. Randomized, controlled studies are necessary to confirm the therapeutic benefits of ramelteon.
