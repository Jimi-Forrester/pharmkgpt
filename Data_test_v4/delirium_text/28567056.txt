28567056|t|Rapid Determination of Isomeric Benzoylpaeoniflorin and Benzoylalbiflorin in Rat Plasma by LC-MS/MS Method.
28567056|a|Benzoylpaeoniflorin (BP) is a potential therapeutic agent against oxidative stress related Alzheimer's disease. In this study, a more rapid, selective, and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method was developed to determine BP in rat plasma distinguishing with a monoterpene isomer, benzoylalbiflorin (BA). The method showed a linear response from 1 to 1000 ng/mL (r > 0.9950). The precision of the interday and intraday ranged from 2.03 to 12.48% and the accuracy values ranged from -8.00 to 10.33%. Each running of the method could be finished in 4 minutes. The LC-MS/MS method was validated for specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy, recovery, and stability and was found to be acceptable for bioanalytical application. Finally, this fully validated method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study in rats following oral administration.
