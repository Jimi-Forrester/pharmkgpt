34041204|t|Phase I Trial on Arterial Embolization with Hypoxia Activated Tirapazamine for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
34041204|a|BACKGROUND: Tirapazamine (TPZ) is a hypoxia activated drug that may be synergistic with transarterial embolization (TAE). The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of combining TPZ and TAE in patients with unresectable HCC and determine the optimal dose for Phase II. METHODS: This was a Phase 1 multicenter, open-label, non-randomized trial with a classic 3+3 dose escalation and an expansion cohort in patients with unresectable HCC, Child Pugh A, ECOG 0 or 1. Two initial cohorts consisted of I.V. administration of Tirapazamine followed by superselective TAE while the remaining three cohorts underwent intraarterial administration of Tirapazamine with superselective TAE. Safety and tolerability were assessed using NCI CTCAE 4.0 with clinical, imaging and laboratory examinations including pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and an electrocardiogram 1 day pre-dose, at 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 24 hours post-TPZ infusion and an additional PK at 15- and 30-minutes post-TPZ. Tumor responses were evaluated using mRECIST criteria. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (mean [range] age of 66.4 [37-79] years) with unresectable HCC were enrolled between July 2015 and January 2018. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Mean tumor size was 6.53 cm +- 2.60 cm with a median of two lesions per patient. Dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose were not reached. The maximal TPZ dose was 10 mg/m2 I.V. and 20 mg/m2 I.A. One adverse event (AE) was reported in all patients with fatigue, decreased appetite or pain being most common. Grade 3-5 AE were hypertension and transient elevation of AST/ALT in 70.4% of patients. No serious AE were drug related. Sixty percent (95% CI=38.7-78.9) achieved complete response (CR), and 84% (95% CI=63.9-95.5) had complete and partial response per mRECIST for target lesions. DISCUSSION: TAE with TPZ was safe and tolerable with encouraging results justifying pursuit of a Phase II trial.
