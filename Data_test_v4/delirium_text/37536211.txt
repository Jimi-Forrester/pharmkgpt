37536211|t|Neurofluid coupling during sleep and wake states.
37536211|a|BACKGROUND: In clinical populations, the movement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during sleep is a growing area of research with potential mechanistic connections in both neurodegenerative (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease) and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, we know relatively little about the processes that influence CSF movement. To inform clinical intervention targets this study assesses the coupling between (a) real-time CSF movement, (b) neuronal-driven movement, and (c) non-neuronal systemic physiology driven movement. METHODS: This study included eight young, healthy volunteers, with concurrently acquired neurofluid dynamics using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), neural activity using Electroencephalography (EEG), and non-neuronal systemic physiology with peripheral functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Neuronal and non-neuronal drivers were assessed temporally; wherein, EEG measured slow wave activity that preceded CSF movement was considered neuronally driven. Similarly, slow wave oscillations (assessed via fNIRS) that coupled with CSF movement were considered non-neuronal systemic physiology driven. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results document neural contributions to CSF movement were only present during light NREM sleep but low-frequency non-neuronal oscillations were strongly coupled with CSF movement in all assessed states - awake, NREM-1, NREM-2. The clinical/research implications of these findings are two-fold. First, neuronal-driven oscillations contribute to CSF movement outside of deep sleep (NREM-3); therefore, interventions aimed at increasing CSF movement may yield meaningful increases with the promotion of NREM sleep more generally - a focus on NREM S3 may not be needed. Second, non-neuronal systemic oscillations contribute across wake and sleep stages; therefore, interventions may increase CSF movement by manipulating systemic physiology.
