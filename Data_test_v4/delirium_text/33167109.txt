33167109|a|Objective: To evaluate the effect on bleeding volume and postoperative recovery of regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) guides controlled hypotension in elderly patients with hypertension undergoing spinal surgery. Methods: One hundred and twenty elderly patients who underwent spinal surgery in the department of anesthesiology of Qingdao Municipal Hospital and the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from January 2017 to December 2019 were selected and divided into 2 groups according to the random number table method (n=60): rSO(2) guides the controlled hypotension group (group A) and control group (group C). Both groups were performed with endotracheal intubation for general anesthesia, maintain anesthesia with sevoflurane and remifentanil, rSO(2) were monitored throughout the procedure. If necessary, sodium nitroprusside or esmolol were used to control blood pressure. In group A, the goal of controlled hypotension was that rSO(2) decreased <= 10% of the basic value or maintained at 64+-3 and the moderate operative field bleeding. Group C underwent routine anesthesia management. Intraoperative blood loss and urine output, the incidence of hypothermia after operation, postoperative delirium, chills, nausea and vomiting, the PACU residence time, postoperative drainage volume, eating time, postoperative hospital stay were compared between the two groups. Results: Compared with group C, the blood loss [(589+-157) vs (764+-213) ml] and urine output [(778+-121) vs (1 079+-239) ml] of group A were decreased (t=-5.120, -8.712, all P<0.05). The rates of hypothermia after operation (26.7% vs 45.0%), postoperative delirium (18.3% vs 36.7%), chills (10.0% vs 25.0%), nausea and vomiting (21.7% vs 40.0%) of group A were decreased (chi(2)=4.385, 5.057, 4.675, 4.728, all P<0.05) . The PACU residence time [(56+-9) vs (63+-11) min], postoperative drainage volume [(217+-66) vs (289+-81) ml], eating time [(17.8+-2.8) vs (22.3+-4.1) h] and numbers of days in hospital [(7.2+-2.7) vs (8.2+-2.9) d] were decreased of group A (t=-3.399, -5.334, -7.000, -2.031, all P<0.05). Conclusion: The guidance of controlled hypotension with rSO(2) monitoring can reduce the blood loss and infusion volume during spinal surgery in elderly patients with hypertension, reduce postoperative related complications and enhance recovery after surgery.
