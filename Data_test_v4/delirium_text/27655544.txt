27655544|t|[Fever, generalized pain, and multiple pulmonary nodules in a school-aged boy].
27655544|a|A 9-year-old boy was admitted to Xiangya Hospital due to pain after trauma in the left lower limb for 5 days and fever with generalized pain for 2 days. The results of X-ray of the left lower limb were normal. Pulmonary computed tomography (CT) showed multiple pulmonary nodules in both lungs. Adrenal CT showed marked enlargement of the left adrenal gland. The patient also experienced generalized herpes and intermittent delirium and had a blood pressure up to 155/93 mm Hg. He was transferred to our hospital with a suspected diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. On admission, the patient had a blood pressure of 86/44 mm Hg, sporadic maculopapule and herpes, touch-evoked pain, exposure of superficial veins, white pus coating on the right side of the tongue, and tension in the abdominal muscle. No skin damage was observed in the left lower limb, and the patient was forced to be in the extending position and experienced significant swelling below the knees. Laboratory examination showed a reduction in platelet count, hypoproteinemia, a significant increase in creatase, a C-reactive protein level of 348 mg/L, and a procalcitonin level of >100 ng/mL. Thoracoabdominal and pelvic CT showed multiple patchy and nodular lesions in both lungs, which had an undetermined nature, as well as an enlarged spleen. The tests of puncture fluid from the left knee joint and the periosteum of the left tibia, blood culture, and bone marrow culture all showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was given anti-shock treatment, anti-infective therapy with vancomycin, debridement and continuous irrigation/drainage of osteomyelitis lesions in the left tibia, but the patient still experienced recurrent shivering and severe fever and increased subcutaneous and pulmonary nodules. Linezolid was added on day 8 after admission, and the patient's body temperature returned to normal on day 24 after admission. Subcutaneous and pulmonary nodules were gradually reduced and disappeared. The patient was treated for 2 months and then evaluated as cured.
