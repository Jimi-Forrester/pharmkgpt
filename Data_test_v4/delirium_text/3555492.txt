3555492|a|The human amyloid beta protein is the major constituent of the brain amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer disease. The gene that encodes this protein is located on chromosome 21, and individuals with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) also exhibit an early onset form of Alzheimer disease. We have used the cloned human amyloid beta protein gene and a panel of somatic cell hybrids to map the location of the mouse homolog of this gene. We report here that the mouse gene is located on chromosome 16 within the region 16C3----ter, in common with three other genes which map within the Down syndrome region of human chromosome 21.
