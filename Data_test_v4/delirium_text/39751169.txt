39751169|t|Glial Biologist's Guide to Mass Spectrometry-Based Lipidomics: A Tutorial From Sample Preparation to Data Analysis.
39751169|a|Neurological diseases are associated with disruptions in the brain lipidome that are becoming central to disease pathogenesis. Traditionally perceived as static structural support in membranes, lipids are now known to be actively involved in cellular signaling, energy metabolism, and other cellular activities involving membrane curvature, fluidity, fusion or fission. Glia are critical in the development, health, and function of the brain, and glial regulation plays a major role in disease. The major pathways of glial dysregulation related to function are associated with downstream products of metabolism including lipids. Taking advantage of significant innovations and technical advancements in instrumentation, lipidomics has emerged as a popular omics discipline, serving as the prevailing approach to comprehensively define metabolic alterations associated with organismal development, damage or disease. A key technological platform for lipidomics studies is mass spectrometry (MS), as it affords large-scale profiling of complex biological samples. However, as MS-based techniques are often refined and advanced, the relative comfort level among biologists with this instrumentation has not followed suit. In this review, we aim to highlight the importance of the study of glial lipids and to provide a concise record of best practices and steps for MS-based lipidomics. Specifically, we outline procedures for glia lipidomics workflows ranging from sample collection and extraction to mass spectrometric analysis to data interpretation. To ensure these approaches are more accessible, this tutorial aims to familiarize glia biologists with sample handling and analysis techniques for MS-based lipidomics, and to guide non-experts toward generating high quality lipidomics data.
