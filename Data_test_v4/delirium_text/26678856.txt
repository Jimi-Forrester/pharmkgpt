26678856|t|gamma-Secretase Modulators and APH1 Isoforms Modulate gamma-Secretase Cleavage but Not Position of epsilon-Cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP).
26678856|a|The relative increase in Abeta42 peptides from familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) linked APP and PSEN mutations can be related to changes in both epsilon-cleavage site utilization and subsequent step-wise cleavage. Cleavage at the epsilon-site releases the amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD), and perturbations in the position of epsilon-cleavage are closely associated with changes in the profile of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) species that are produced and secreted. The mechanisms by which gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) or FAD mutations affect the various gamma-secretase cleavages to alter the generation of Abeta peptides have not been fully elucidated. Recent studies suggested that GSMs do not modulate epsilon-cleavage of APP, but the data were derived principally from recombinant truncated epitope tagged APP substrate. Here, using full length APP from transfected cells, we investigated whether GSMs modify the epsilon-cleavage of APP under more native conditions. Our results confirmed the previous findings that epsilon-cleavage is insensitive to GSMs. In addition, fenofibrate, an inverse GSM (iGSM), did not alter the position or kinetics of epsilon-cleavage position in vitro. APH1A and APH1B, a subunit of the gamma-secretase complex, also modulated Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio without any alterations in epsilon-cleavage, a result in contrast to what has been observed with PS1 and APP FAD mutations. Consequently, GSMs and APH1 appear to modulate gamma-secretase activity and Abeta42 generation by altering processivity but not epsilon-cleavage site utilization.
