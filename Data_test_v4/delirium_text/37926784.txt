This study aimed to detect the joint and interactive associations of socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle factors with incident dementia risk, and the underlying brain imaging alterations. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to test the joint and interactive associations. Partial correlation analysis was performed to reflect the brain imaging alterations. A total of 276,730 participants with a mean age of 55.9 (+-8.0) years old from UK biobank were included. Over 8.5 (+-2.6) years of follow-up, 3013 participants were diagnosed with dementia. Participants with high SES and most healthy lifestyle had a significantly lower risk of incident dementia (HR=0.19, 95% CI=0.14 to 0.26, P<2x10-16), Alzheimer's disease (AD, HR=0.19, 95% CI=0.13 to 0.29, P=8.94x10-15), and vascular dementia (HR=0.24, 95% CI=0.12 to 0.48, P=7.57x10-05) compared with participants with low SES and an unhealthy lifestyle. Significant interactions were found between SES and lifestyle on dementia (P=0.002) and AD (P=0.001) risks; the association between lifestyle and dementia was stronger among those of high SES. The combination of high SES and healthy lifestyle was positively associated with higher volumes in brain regions vulnerable to dementia-related atrophy. These findings suggest that SES and lifestyle significantly interact and influence dementia with its related brain structure phenotypes.
