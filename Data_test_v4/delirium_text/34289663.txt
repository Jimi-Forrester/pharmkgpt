34289663|a|The aim of this study was to establish the role of Porphyromonas gingivalis in Alzheimer's disease. An electronic search of publications was established from three electronic databases: Cochrane, PubMed and Web of Science. The search strategy used a combination of controlled vocabulary and free-text words. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined by the authors before the start of the study. The inclusion criteria were: all studies published in English language; in vitro analysis; in vivo on animals and postmortem biopsies on humans; studies analyzing the correlation between periodontal disease and Alzheimer. The search resulted in 262 titles. Only 9 articles were included in the quantitative analysis. An inflammatory status in the oral cavity might be connect to a brain degeneration syndrome such as dementia and AD. However, a strictly connection is still not evincible. More trials are recommended in order to investigate the role of periodontal bacteria and Porphyromonas gingivalis in AD pathogenesis and aggravation.
