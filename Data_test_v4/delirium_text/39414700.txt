39414700|t|Deciphering the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective potential of kaempferol: a comprehensive investigation.
39414700|a|Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by neuronal degradation, dysfunction, or death within the CNS. Oxidative and inflammatory stress play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. The interplay between these stressors and dysregulated cellular signaling pathways contributes to neurodegeneration. Downregulation of NRF-2 compromises antioxidant defense, exacerbating neuronal damage, while increased TLR-4/MAPK and TLR-4/NF-kappaB signaling promotes neuroinflammation. Excessive ROS production by NADPH oxidase leads to oxidative damage and neuronal apoptosis. The strategies targeting NRF-2, TLR-4-mediated inflammatory stress, and NADPH oxidase activity promise to mitigate neuronal damage and halt the progression of the disease. Kaempferol is a flavonoid polyphenol antioxidant found abundantly in various fruits and vegetables, including apples, grapes, tomatoes, and broccoli. It is widely found in medicinal plants including Equisetum spp., Sophora japonica, Ginkgo biloba, and Euphorbia pekinensis (Rupr.). A substantial body of in vitro and in vivo evidences have demonstrated the neuroprotective potential of kaempferol against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Kaempferol demonstrates multifaceted potential in mitigating neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in different neurodegenerative diseases through the modulation of various pathways including NRF-2, NADPH oxidase, TLR-4/MAPK, and TLR-4/NF-kappaB. This review article was developed through a comprehensive analysis and interpretation of research published between 2009 and 2024, sourced from multiple scientific databases, including PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. This review aims to provide an in-depth overview of the neuroprotective effects of kaempferol, focusing on its underlying molecular mechanisms. A total of 24 research evidence were included to elucidate the molecular pathways by which kaempferol exerts its protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases.
