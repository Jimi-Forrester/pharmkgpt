21109214|t|Psychiatric aspects of heart and lung disease in critical care.
21109214|a|Psychiatric issues are important in the management of patients with heart and lung disease in acute, intensive, and critical care. Adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders, depression, and delirium, sometimes in association with substance abuse and withdrawal problems, are the most common issues, and may affect risk and prognosis of the associated general medical conditions and management in the acute care setting. In children with lung and heart diseases requiring critical care, appreciation of cognitive and social-psychologic developmental milestones is necessary to provide adequate care.
