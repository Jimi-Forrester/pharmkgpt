34564161|a|Prevention of acute kidney injury caused by drugs is still a clinical problem to be solved urgently. Astaxanthin (AST) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are important marine-derived active ingredients, and they are reported to exhibit renal protective activity. It is noteworthy that the existing forms of AST in nature are mainly fatty acid-acylated AST monoesters and diesters, as well as unesterified AST, in which DHA is an esterified fatty acid. However, no reports focus on the different bioactivities of unesterified AST, monoesters and diesters, as well as the recombination of DHA and unesterified AST on nephrotoxicity. In the present study, vancomycin-treated mice were used to evaluate the effects of DHA-acylated AST monoesters, DHA-acylated AST diesters, unesterified AST, and the recombination of AST and DHA in alleviating nephrotoxicity by determining serum biochemical index, histopathological changes, and the enzyme activity related to oxidative stress. Results found that the intervention of DHA-acylated AST diesters significantly ameliorated kidney dysfunction by decreasing the levels of urea nitrogen and creatinine, alleviating pathological damage and oxidative stress compared to AST monoester, unesterified AST, and the recombination of AST and DHA. Further studies revealed that dietary DHA-acylated AST esters could inhibit the activation of the caspase cascade and MAPKs signaling pathway, and reduce the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These findings indicated that the administration of DHA-acylated AST esters could alleviate vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity, which represented a potentially novel candidate or therapeutic adjuvant for alleviating acute kidney injury.
