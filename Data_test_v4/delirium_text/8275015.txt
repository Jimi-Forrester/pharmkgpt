8275015|a|Endogenous proteins phosphorylated in vitro with nuclear extracts prepared from skin fibroblasts of familial and sporadic AD subjects and age/sex-matched controls show qualitative/quantitative changes which were dependent upon the addition of natural and synthetic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to assay mixtures. Control and AD cell-free homogenates showed a pronounced increase in four proteins migrating with molecular weights of 180- (p180), 75-(p75), 65- (p65), and 34-kD (p34). Optimal stimulation of each protein required a different concentration of dsDNA. In AD samples, an additional dsDNA-stimulated protein, p40, was observed. In extracts prepared from sporadic AD individuals, synthetic dsDNA stimulated the phosphorylation of two additional proteins, with molecular weights of 73- and 37-kD, which were not found in familial AD or control samples. These results suggest that dsDNA-stimulated phosphoprotein changes may be used to distinguish between familial and sporadic forms of AD.
