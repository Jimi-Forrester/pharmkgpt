35579487|t|Brexpiprazole-Associated Pisa Syndrome (Pleurothotonus) in a Patient With Dementia.
35579487|a|OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to report brexpiprazole-induced Pisa syndrome (PS) in a patient with Alzheimer disease and to discuss the pathophysiology and the treatment of PS. METHODS: We report a 71-year-old female patient with Alzheimer disease. After 2 months medication of brexpiprazole, she presented PS. By switching to quetiapine, the symptom was ameliorated; however, transient acute dystonia was occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-induced PS may be associated with dopamine-acetylcholine imbalance. This imbalance causes the dysfunction of the cortex and basal ganglia and the dysfunction of sensory and somatosensory system. Stopping the offending drugs is a choice for the treatment of PS. This is the first report of PS-induced brexpiprazole.
