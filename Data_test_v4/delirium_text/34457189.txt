34457189|a|Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is an infectious agent influencing as much as 50% of the world's population. It is the causative agent for several diseases, most especially gastric and duodenal peptic ulcer, gastric adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the stomach. A number of other, extragastric manifestations also are associated with H. pylori infection. These include neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, demyelinating multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. There is also evidence for a relationship between H. pylori infection and such dermatological diseases as psoriasis and rosacea as well as a connection with infection and open-angle glaucoma. Generally little is known about the relationship between H. pylori infection and diseases of the pancreas. Most evidence about H. pylori and its potential role in the development of pancreatic diseases concerns pancreatic adenocarcinoma and autoimmune forms of chronic pancreatitis. There is data (albeit not fully consistent) indicating modestly increased pancreatic cancer risk in H. pylori-positive patients. The pathogenetic mechanism of this increase is not yet fully elucidated, but several theories have been proposed. Reduction of antral D-cells in H. pylori-positive patients causes a suppression of somatostatin secretion that, in turn, stimulates increased secretin secretion. That stimulates pancreatic growth and thus increases the risk of carcinogenesis. Alternatively, H. pylori, as a part of microbiome dysbiosis and the so-called oncobiome, is proven to be associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma development via the promotion of cellular proliferation. The role of H. pylori in the inflammation characteristic of autoimmune pancreatitis seems to be explained by a mechanism of molecular mimicry among several proteins (mostly enzymes) of H. pylori and pancreatic tissue. Patients with autoimmune pancreatitis often show positivity for antibodies against H. pylori proteins. H. pylori, as a part of microbiome dysbiosis, also is viewed as a potential trigger of autoimmune inflammation of the pancreas. It is precisely these relationships (and associated equivocal conclusions) that constitute a center of attention among pancreatologists, immunologists and pathologists. In order to obtain clear and valid results, more studies on sufficiently large cohorts of patients are needed. The topic is itself sufficiently significant to draw the interest of clinicians and inspire further systematic research. Next-generation sequencing could play an important role in investigating the microbiome as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for pancreatic cancer.
