34771007|a|There are abundant natural diterpenoids in the plants of the genus Daphne from the Thymelaeaceae family, featuring a 5/7/6-tricyclic ring system and usually with an orthoester group. So far, a total of 135 diterpenoids has been isolated from the species of the genus Daphne, which could be further classified into three main types according to the substitution pattern of ring A and oxygen-containing functions at ring B. A variety of studies have demonstrated that these compounds exert a wide range of bioactivities both in vitro and in vivo including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-HIV, antifertility, neurotrophic, and cholesterol-lowering effects, which is reviewed herein. Meanwhile, the fascinating structure-activity relationship is also concluded in this review in the hope of providing an easy access to available information for the synthesis and optimization of efficient drugs.
