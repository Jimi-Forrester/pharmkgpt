9592068|t|EEG slowing and cerebrospinal fluid tau levels in patients with cognitive decline.
9592068|a|We explored the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau levels as indirect markers of tau-related pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and EEG slowing, a typical neurophysiological finding in the disease. A positive correlation between CSF tau levels and ratio of alpha/delta global field power was found in 14 AD patients (r = 0.65, p = 0.01). This relationship was better approximated by polynomial fit of 2nd degree (p = 0.002). A subgroup of AD patients (n = 7) with higher tau levels and shorter duration of illness showed a strong relationship between CSF tau levels and alpha/theta (r = 0.83, p = 0.02), and alpha/delta (r = 0.87, p = 0.01) ratios of the global field power. There were no significant correlations between EEG slowing and CSF tau levels in 12 patients with mild cognitive dysfunction or in 14 healthy control subjects. That a strong inverse linear correlation exists in AD patients with higher levels of tau and shorter duration of illness may imply that with longer illness duration CSF tau levels decrease due to neuronal death.
