36853571|a|BACKGROUND: Measures adopted to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 could have led to a reduction in the rate of non-COVID-19 infections. We assessed whether a similar reduction was present in patients with stroke. METHODS: We performed a hospital-based study nested in a prospective population-based registry. We compared prevalence of infections and in-hospital mortality in subjects admitted for acute stroke between the first pandemic year (study period, from March 2020 to February 2021) and the pre-pandemic year (control period, from March 2019 to February 2020). Infections were reported as pneumonia (PNA), urinary tract infections (UTI), and any infection (INF). RESULTS: From the control (n = 677) to the study period (n = 520), the prevalence of INF decreased from 11.5 to 4.6% (p < 0.001) and that of PNA decreased from 6.9 to 2.5% (p = 0.001). No changes in in-hospital mortality and length of hospital stay were observed between the two periods. CONCLUSIONS: The observed reduction of in-hospital pneumonias in patients with stroke was likely attributable to the use of protective measures and limitation of hospital visits. Maintaining some of those measures in the long term may contribute to control infections in hospitalized patients with stroke.
