23942088|a|BACKGROUND: Beta-amyloid (Abeta) protein is a key factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and it has been reported that mitochondria is involved in the biochemical pathway by which Abeta can lead to neuronal dysfunction. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an essential cofactor involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and has been suggested as a potential therapeutic agent in AD. Zinc toxicity also affects cellular energy production by decreasing oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and ATP turnover in human neuronal cells, which can be restored by the neuroprotective effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). METHOD: In the present study, using Seahorse XF-24 Metabolic Flux Analysis we investigated the effect of DHA and CoQ10 alone and in combination against Abeta- and zinc-mediated changes in the mitochondrial function of M17 neuroblastoma cell line. RESULTS: Here, we observed that DHA is specifically neuroprotective against zinc-triggered mitochondrial dysfunction, but does not directly affect Abeta neurotoxicity. CoQ10 has shown to be protective against both Abeta- and zinc-induced alterations in mitochondrial function. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that DHA and CoQ10 may be useful for the prevention, treatment and management of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.
