31862965|t|Jatrorrhizine Balances the Gut Microbiota and Reverses Learning and Memory Deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
31862965|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disorder influenced by both genetic and environmental components and has become a major public health issue throughout the world. Oxidative stress and inflammation play important roles in the evolution of those major pathological symptoms. Jatrorrhizine (JAT), a main component of a traditional Chinese herbal, coptidis rhizome, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects and we previously showed that it is also able to clear oxygen free radicals and reduce inflammatory responses. In this study, we demonstrated that JAT administration could alleviate the learning and memory deficits in AD. Furthermore, we also found that JAT treatment reduced the levels of Abeta plaques in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice. Other studies suggest that there are gut microbiome alterations in AD. In order to explore the underlying mechanisms between gut microbiota and AD, DNA sequencing for 16s rDNA V3-V4 was performed in fecal samples from APP/PS1 transgenic mice and C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice. Our results indicated that APP/PS1 mice showed less Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) abundance in gut microbiota than WT mice and with different composition. Furthermore, JAT treatment enriched OTUs abundance and alpha diversity in APP/PS1 mice compared to WT mice. High dose of JAT treatment altered the abundance of some specific gut microbiota such as the most predominant phylum Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in APP/PS1 mice. In conclusion, APP/PS1 mice display gut dysbiosis, and JAT treatment not only improved the memory deficits, but also regulated the abundance of the microbiota. This may provide a therapeutic way to balance the gut dysbiosis in AD patients.
