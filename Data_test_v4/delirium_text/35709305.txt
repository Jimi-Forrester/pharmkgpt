35709305|a|AIMS: To describe the incidence and impact of adverse clinical events (ACEs) during first 24 h of bedrest of patients after cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective observational study of patients aged over 18 years undergoing elective placement of permanent bicameral pacemaker (PM), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) PM, CRT defibrillator, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Patients were maintained on bedrest post-operatively for 24 h and delirium, post-operative urinary retention, severe post-operative pain, pressure ulcer, and sleep disturbance were recorded using standardized assessments. Of 90 patients, 66 (73.3%) were male and average age was 76 +- 10 years. The median time to first mobilization was 23 (21-24) h. The adverse clinical events occurred in 48/90, with severe pain (38/90), sleep disturbance (12/90), delirium (9/90), and urinary retention requiring urinary catheterization (8/90) most frequent. Patients receiving implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or CRT defibrillator experienced ACEs significantly more frequently than those receiving PM. Adverse clinical event was associated with prolonged hospital stay [odds ratio (OR) 2.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-6.17]. Patients with delirium were more dependent for daily living activities on admission (OR 8.0; 95% CI 1.55-41.3). CONCLUSION: Adverse clinical events frequently occur post-insertion of a CIED and impact patient clinical course and experience. The progressive increase in ageing and frailty of CIED implant candidates requires special nursing attention to improve patients' satisfaction and to prevent increased healthcare resource use.
