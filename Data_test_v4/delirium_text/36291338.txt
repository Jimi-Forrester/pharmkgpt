36291338|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be a challenge for healthcare systems, especially in terms of the care of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Age is one of the major risk factors for severe forms of COVID-19, most probably due to the presence of comorbidities and inflammations. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 invades nerve endings and olfactory nerves through the binding of the spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. This interaction triggers an inflammatory cascade that results in cognitive impairment. In turn, the isoform of apolipoprotein-E4 (APOE-4epsilon) in AD is a risk factor for increased neuroinflammation through microglia activation, increased oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration. AD and SARS-CoV-2 are associated with increases in levels of inflammatory markers, as well as increases in levels of APOE-4epsilon, ACE2 and oxidative stress. Thus, there is a synergistic relationship between AD and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the social isolation and other health measures resulting from the pandemic have led to a higher level of anxiety and depression among AD patients, a situation which may lead to a decline in cognitive function. Therefore, there is a need to develop strategies for keeping the patient calm but active.
