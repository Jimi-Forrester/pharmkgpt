35333108|a|Delirium prevention and management: Development and implementation of a non-pharmacological catalog of measures in the acute setting Abstract. Background: In October 2018, a new delirium management concept was developed in a university hospital for cardiovascular diseases. As part of a multi-professional approach, the previously established "Evidence-based Nursing working group (AK EBN)", consisting of academically qualified nurses from the hospital, was involved in the implementation process. Aim: The AK EBN aimed to identify effective non-pharmacological interventions to prevent and treat delirium and to establish how these interventions could influence delirium rates in hospital patients. Methods: The EbN method was employed to address the study question applying the PICO framework (Behrens & Langer, 2016) as the bases for systematic searches in different databases. Relevant studies were identified, data were extracted, displayed in tables and discussed within the AK using established critical appraisal tools for quality assessment. Results: Despite a heterogeneous study sample, results showed that there is meaningful evidence for the effectiveness of intervention bundles on the reduction of delirium rates. Bundles include for example, aspects of orientation and noise reduction. As a result, a catalogue of non-pharmacological interventions, communication aids, and a guide for involving caregivers in the prevention and treatment of delirium were developed. Additionally, continuing training events held by the participants of AK EBN were organized. Conclusions: To promote the successful implementation of projects in practice, the involvement of all stakeholders is important. As part of a skill-grade-mix, nurses made an important contribution in this multi-professional project.
