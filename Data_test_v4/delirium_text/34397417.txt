34397417|t|The Association Between Use of Rivastigmine and Pneumonia: Systematic Analysis of FDA Adverse Event Reporting System.
34397417|a|BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition induced by infection of the lungs and is frequently a cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some studies have shown an association between acetylcholinesterase inhibitor use and elevated pneumonia risk. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of the number of reported pneumonia cases in individuals prescribed rivastigmine relative to the number of reported cases by patients using other therapeutics including over-the-counter drugs and other AD therapeutics, as reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. METHODS: A disproportionality analysis was conducted to investigate the association between using rivastigmine and risk of pneumonia. Age, gender, dosage, temporality, and geographic distribution of reported cases were also assessed. RESULTS: Patients prescribed rivastigmine were more likely to report pneumonia as an adverse event than many drugs except galantamine. Males were found to be 46% more likely than females to report pneumonia as an adverse event while likelihood of pneumonia diagnosis increases 3-5-fold in patients older than 65 years of age. CONCLUSION: The observed elevated frequency of aspiration pneumonia in patients prescribed rivastigmine may be due to an induced cholinergic crisis that is selective for the medulla oblongata, resulting in gastrointestinal distress, impaired swallowing, heightened salivation, and labored breathing. The observed elevated frequency of infectious pneumonia in patients prescribed rivastigmine may also be linked to overstimulation of neurons in the medulla oblongata and downstream suppression of localized inflammatory responses.
