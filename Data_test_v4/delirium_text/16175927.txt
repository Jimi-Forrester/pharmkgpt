16175927|a|Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that may involve the central nervous system (CNS) resulting in neuropsychiatric manifestations. The associated psychiatric disorders include depression, psychosis, mood disorders, anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, and delirium/ encephalopathy. Several autoantibodies may play a role in the pathogenesis of psychiatric complications of SLE, particularly antibodies against ribosomal P-proteins (anti-P) and possibly antibodies against endothelial cells (AECA). The reported prevalence of anti-P is highly variable in SLE patients and is dependent on different ethnic backgrounds, sensitivity and specificity of the assays employed for autoantibody detection, and the time at which sera were analysed in relation to the clinical event. Controversial data exist on the association of anti-P with psychiatric manifestations of SLE. These autoantibodies have been suggested to be specific markers of the psychiatric manifestations of SLE, particularly of the psychosis and depression, and the antibody level varied with the clinical activity of the disease. Some studies have confirmed the hypothesis of an association of anti-P antibodies with psychiatric manifestations of neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) while others have disputed this relationship. This review summarizes the recent studies about relationship between anti-P antibodies and psychiatric manifestation of SLE.
