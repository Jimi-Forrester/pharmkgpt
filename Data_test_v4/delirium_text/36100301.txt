36100301|t|Curating a knowledge base for individuals with coinfection of HIV and SARS-CoV-2: a study protocol of EHR-based data mining and clinical implementation.
36100301|a|INTRODUCTION: Despite a higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease in individuals with HIV, the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and HIV infections remain unclear. To delineate these interactions, multicentre Electronic Health Records (EHR) hold existing promise to provide full-spectrum and longitudinal clinical data, demographics and sociobehavioural data at individual level. Presently, a comprehensive EHR-based cohort for the HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection has not been established; EHR integration and data mining methods tailored for studying the coinfection are urgently needed yet remain underdeveloped. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The overarching goal of this exploratory/developmental study is to establish an EHR-based cohort for individuals with HIV/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection and perform large-scale EHR-based data mining to examine the interactions between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infections and systematically identify and validate factors contributing to the severe clinical course of the coinfection. We will use a nationwide EHR database in the USA, namely, National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Ultimately, collected clinical evidence will be implemented and used to pilot test a clinical decision support prototype to assist providers in screening and referral of at-risk patients in real-world clinics. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the institutional review boards at the University of South Carolina (Pro00121828) as non-human subject study. Study findings will be presented at academic conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. This study will disseminate urgently needed clinical evidence for guiding clinical practice for individuals with the coinfection at Prisma Health, a healthcare system in collaboration.
