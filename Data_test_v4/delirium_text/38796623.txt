38796623|a|Cerebral infarction (CI) is a common cerebrovascular disease worldwide, and the burden caused by the sequelae of CI has increased significantly. However, current treatment guidelines lack standardized recommendations for pharmacotherapy of sequelae of CI. This retrospective study collected and analyzed 1.98 million prescriptions concerning sequelae of CI from patients admitted to Zhiyun Health Internet Hospital in 2022. The mean age of patients was 66.2 +- 11.4 years, and 52.40% were male. 79.73% had one or more comorbidities. For treatment, the prescriptions of 1-, 2- and >= 3-drug accounted for 64.55%, 23.77% and 11.68% respectively. Chinese patent medicine (CPM) prescriptions, western medicine (WM) prescriptions, and CPM and WM combined (CPM + WM) prescriptions accounted for 53.81%, 27.33%, and 18.86% respectively. In CPM prescriptions, the most frequently prescribed medications were Salvia miltiorrhiza (34.81%), Ginkgo biloba (24.96%), Panax notoginseng (20.67%), Gastrodia (7.15%) and Ligusticum Wallichii (4.90%). For WM prescriptions, the most commonly prescribed agents were anti-hypertensive (32.82%), anti-thrombotic (16.06%), vasodilator (15.70%), anti-dementia (10.88%), and lipid-lowering (9.58%) drugs. Among CPM + WM prescriptions, 72.61% had CPM/WM = 1, 21.20% had CPM/WM < 1, and 6.19% had CPM/WM > 1. This research utilized real-world data extracted from internet hospitals in China to present valuable evidence of online prescription patterns among patients experiencing sequelae of CI.
