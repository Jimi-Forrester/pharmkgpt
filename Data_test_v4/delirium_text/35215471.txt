35215471|t|Health Benefits of Apple Juice Consumption: A Review of Interventional Trials on Humans.
35215471|a|Although numerous studies have reported the benefits of apple consumption on cardiometabolic health parameters and chronic disease prevention, few have focused on the effects of apple juice specifically. Juice consumption may be a convenient way to take advantage of the health effects of the bioactive components present in apples. The present review aims to summarize the current literature on health benefits of apple juice as reported in clinical trials in humans. Of the 67 studies retained, 20 interventional studies on humans were reviewed. Overall, cloudy apple juice consumption was found to be associated with several markers of cardiovascular health that may ultimately be relevant for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Most of the documentation was found regarding oxidative stress, as well as observations with other parameters such as markers of inflammation, lipid profile, and diabetes. This review suggests that, in 20 studies, apple juice consumed in moderation exerts positive effects on markers of cardiovascular disease risk (particularly on oxidative stress).
