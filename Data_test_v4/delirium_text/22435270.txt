22435270|t|Postoperative maladaptive behavioral changes in children.
22435270|a|Induction of anesthesia can be a very stressful period for a child and his family and can be associated with increased risk of psychological disturbances. These disturbances are categorized as preoperative anxiety, emergence delirium and postoperative behavioral changes. Several tools have been developed to measure these psychological manifestations as well as the baseline personality traits of these patients. Postoperative negative behavioral changes, such as sleep and eating disorders, separation anxiety, temper tantrum, aggression toward authorities, may occur in up to 60% of all children undergoing general anesthesia. Several studies found a strong association between these postoperative behavioral changes, the distress of the child on induction and his individual personality characteristics, although a cause-effect relationship could not be determined. Understanding the risk factors for behavior changes helps us determine the best way for prevention and treatment of these changes in the perioperative period.
