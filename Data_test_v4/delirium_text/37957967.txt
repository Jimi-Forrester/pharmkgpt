37957967|a|Neuroprotective factors are essential to successful ageing. As such, digital device use was proposed as an easily accessible and stimulating available cognitive activity to enhance brain function. Nonetheless, there was a lack of studies inspecting the connection between digital device use and cognitive reserve, the risk of cognitive impairment, and cognition. This study aims to investigate the potential mediator and moderator of the association between digital device use, cognitive reserve, the risk of cognitive impairment, and cognition among healthy older adults. A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the relationship between digital device use and cognitive reserve, the risk of cognitive impairment, and cognition. A total of 210 healthy older adults were recruited through purposive sampling. The results obtained from this study revealed that there was a significant difference in cognitive reserve and cognition between healthy older adults who use a digital device for communication purpose only and who use a digital device for multiple purposes. A significant relationship was also found between cognitive reserve, the risk of cognitive impairment, and cognition. Although digital device use was found to be significantly associated with cognitive reserve and cognition, it was not significantly associated with the risk of cognitive impairment. Cognitive reserve partially mediated the relationship between digital device use and cognition, supporting the notion that cognitive reserve acts as an underlying mechanism in the relationship between digital device use and cognition. Hence, digital device use was suggested to be a good daily intervention for healthy older adults to build on their cognitive reserve and potentially protect their cognition from declining. Nevertheless, relying on digital device use alone is not sufficient, and other activities should be explored to enhance cognitive reserve among healthy older adults.
