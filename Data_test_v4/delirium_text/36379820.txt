36379820|a|In the COVID-19 pandemic era, antibody testing against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has proven an invaluable tool and herein we highlight some of the most useful clinical and/or epidemiological applications of humoral immune responses recording. Anti-spike circulating IgGs and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies can serve as predictors of disease progression or disease prevention, whereas anti-nucleocapsid antibodies can help distinguishing infection from vaccination. Also, in the era of immunotherapies we address the validity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody monitoring post-infection and/or vaccination following therapies with the popular anti-CD20 monoclonals, as well as in the context of various cancers or autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Additional crucial applications include population immunosurveillance, either at the general population or at specific communities such as health workers. Finally, we discuss how testing of antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid can inform us on the neurological complications that often accompany COVID-19.
