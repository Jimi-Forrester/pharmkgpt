20680156|a|We report a rare association of Turner syndrome with both Neurofibromatosis type I and Tuberous Sclerosis. The patient had XOkaryotype with Turners stigmata and also had features of Neurofibromatosis 1 in the form of significant cafe-au-lait spots and Plexiform neurofibroma along with typical features of Tuberous Sclerosis complex. Pedigree analysis revealed that the elder brother of the proband in the family also suffered from Tuberous Sclerosis without the manifestation of Neurofibromatosis or any other genetic disorders. We hypothesize that these associations could be due to new independent mutations and also increased maternal and paternal age in a pre-disposition of Turner syndrome.
