12973428|a|Since the synthesis of aspirin in 1897, aspirin-like or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been the mainstay of therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Although of diverse chemical structure, these drugs not only exhibit the same antipyretic, analgesic and antiinflammatory therapeutic actions, but they also manifest identical toxic actions on the gastric mucosa and the kidney. This indicated that a single pharmacological effect was responsible for the properties of NSAIDs, a theory that was confirmed by the epochal discovery by Vane in 1971, that inhibition of the enzyme-producing prostanoids (cyclooxygenase [COX]) produced both the therapeutic and side effects of aspirin-like drugs. However, at equivalent antiinflammatory doses, different NSAIDs exhibited different degrees of toxicity. The reason for this was resolved by the discovery that prostaglandins at sites of tissue damage were synthesized by an inducible COX (COX-2) formed by a gene distinct from that producing the constitutive enzyme (COX-1), responsible for the formation of prostaglandins that serve an essential physiological function. Modification of the structure of drugs showing a moderately selective effect on COX-2, and the elucidation of the crystal structure of both enzymes, has paved the way for the synthesis of NSAIDs that are highly selective for the inducible enzyme and which are, therefore, antiinflammatory without the typical side effects of the classical NSAIDs. The focus on COX-2 has also expanded our knowledge of the pathophysiological significance of prostanoids and raised the possibility of new uses for selective COX-2 inhibitors, for example, in colon cancer, premature labor and possibly Alzheimer's disease. However, the clinical effects of chronic administration of potent, selective COX-2 inhibitors must await the results of ongoing clinical trials.
