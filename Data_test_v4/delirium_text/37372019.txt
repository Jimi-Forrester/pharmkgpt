37372019|a|The incidence of neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and stroke, is increasing. An increasing number of studies have correlated these diseases with brain iron overload and the resulting oxidative damage. Brain iron deficiency has also been closely linked to neurodevelopment. These neurological disorders seriously affect the physical and mental health of patients and bring heavy economic burdens to families and society. Therefore, it is important to maintain brain iron homeostasis and to understand the mechanism of brain iron disorders affecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance, resulting in neural damage, cell death and, ultimately, leading to the development of disease. Evidence has shown that many therapies targeting brain iron and ROS imbalances have good preventive and therapeutic effects on neurological diseases. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms, pathogenesis and treatment strategies of brain iron metabolism disorders in neurological diseases.
