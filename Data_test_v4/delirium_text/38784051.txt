38784051|a|Objectives: The core objectives of this study centre on enhancing the quality of life and well-being of individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Our aim is to facilitate the monitoring of patient information, benefiting both caregivers and healthcare professionals. Methods: As part of the PROCare4Life platform sensorial ecosystem, a web application with six engaging cognitive games focusing on developing cognitive training and stimulating brain activity are developed. A set of metrics calculated by the application feed machine learning predictive models to evaluate the cognitive status and evolution over time. Long-term analysis of the daily cognitive ability information is used to generate high-level outcomes and identify deviations for each patient from the multimodal fusion engine. And based on these results, a recommender system provides a set of personalized notifications. Results: A 3-month pilot study that took place in five different countries shows the results obtained from 93 patients. An average of 22.4 games were completed per day and the recommender system generated a total of 260 game notifications, 37.7% of them were marked as read by the patients. The Cognitive State Score and the Deviations in Cognitive Abilities measurement, calculated by the multimodal fusion engine, when used in conjunction present a good overview of the patient's current state and potential deviations. Conclusion: The cognitive games application was well-received by elderly individuals who took part in the study. This tool can be valuable for caregivers and healthcare providers in assessing the cognitive function of patients through engaging in cognitive games.
