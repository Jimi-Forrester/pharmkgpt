33157341|t|COVID-19 pandemic: Coroner's database of death inquiries with clinical epidemiology and total and excess mortality analyses in the District of Kildare March to June 2020.
33157341|a|All Covid-19 deaths and all nursing home and residential home deaths in Ireland must by law be reported to the Coroner, the independent Judicial Officer of the State, in the District in which they occur. This enables accurate and early collation of these death reports. Between January 1, 2015 and June 30, 2020 3342 deaths were reported to the Coroner's District for Kildare. From March 11, 2020, when the first Covid-19 death occurred in Ireland in County Kildare, to June 30, 2020 there were 1738 Covid-19 deaths nationally of which 139 were reported in Kildare with 113 (81%) of these deaths in nursing and residential homes. The calculated excess number of deaths notified for January to June 2020 compared with 2015-2019 was 198 (41%) of the 484 total deaths reported with a 131 (45%) excess in the 293 deaths in nursing and residential homes. Covid-19 deaths accounted for 70% and 86% of these excess deaths respectively. Following subtraction of the 18 non-natural cause deaths and 139 Covid-19 deaths from the total excess there remained an unexplained excess of 60 deaths due to natural causes in March to June of 2020 compared with 2015-2019. The peak excess total death percentage was 359% in April 2020, commencing with a small excess in March (30%), continuing into May (63%) and falling again in June (37%). In the nursing and residential home setting those excess death percentages were most marked at 527% in April, with 27% in March, 54% in May and 17% in June. Underlying medical conditions were recorded in 99% of those dying from Covid-19 and the average age of the deceased was 82.5 years with median of 78 years and 55% of those dying were female and 45% male. The clinical epidemiology and documented excess mortality of the reported deaths are chronicled and analysed to learn also about the future challenges with the continuing Covid-19 infection. A centralized national mortality database providing near real-time death certification enhances infectious disease surveillance and prompt clinical epidemiology and mortality excess studies and reduces under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths.
