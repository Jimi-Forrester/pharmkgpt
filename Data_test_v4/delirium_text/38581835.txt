38581835|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complex and multifactorial, and its pathogenesis involves multiple factors and processes. This study pioneered the in situ growth of cerium oxide nanoparticles on macrophage membranes (Ce-RAW). Further, carbon quantum dots (CQD) were biomimetically modified by Ce-RAW, leading to the synthesis of a multifunctional nanocomposite (CQD-Ce-RAW). Within the framework of this research, CQD-Ce-RAW was strategically combined with photothermal therapy (PTT), aiming to achieve a more significant therapeutic effect. The macrophage membrane confers the system with anti-phagocytic and anti-inflammatory biological functions. More importantly, the ultra-small size of cerium oxide grown on the membrane acts as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger and alleviates the degree of oxidative stress. Meanwhile, CQD as a photosensitizer helps dissociate amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates and chelates excess copper ions, thus further inhibiting Abeta aggregation. Cell experiments showed that CQD-Ce-RAW combined with PTT could effectively degrade and inhibit the aggregation of Abeta, remove ROS, and improve cell survival rate. The results of in vivo photothermal experiments demonstrated that near-infrared light enhanced the efficiency of drug penetration through the blood-brain barrier and facilitated its accumulation in brain tissue. This comprehensive therapeutic approach can intervene in the disease progression from multiple pathways, providing a new prospect for treating AD.
