37959270|t|Self-Administered Virtual Reality for Postsurgical Pain Management: A Qualitative Study of Hospital Patients' Reported Experiences.
37959270|a|Virtual Reality (VR) has been shown to effectively reduce pain in patients with various pain conditions. However, questions arise on the use of VR in multimodal postsurgical pain management. Optimizing VR for pain management requires an understanding of intervention- and context-specific factors, based on patients' needs and expectations after major surgery. This substudy is part of a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of three VR interventions as an add-on, self-administered treatment for postsurgical pain. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to evaluate VR effects, software, hardware, prescriptions, and factors affecting the implementation of VR. Experiences across interventions were compared to identify relevant factors for successful implementation. Patients benefitted from self-administered VR in postsurgical pain management in various aspects and without serious drawbacks. Participants preferred an intuitive, 3D, 360-degree VR device with a large choice of applications matching their interests. The preferred frequency and duration of VR use was 2-3 sessions a day for 10-15 min each. Adjusting the VR use to individuals' needs and contexts was reported to be key for successful implementation, with attention paid to improving the awareness of VR as a non-pharmacological means of promoting postsurgical recovery among patients and healthcare professionals.
