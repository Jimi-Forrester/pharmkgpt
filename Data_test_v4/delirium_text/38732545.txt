38732545|t|Exploiting Natural Niches with Neuroprotective Properties: A Comprehensive Review.
38732545|a|Natural products from mushrooms, plants, microalgae, and cyanobacteria have been intensively explored and studied for their preventive or therapeutic potential. Among age-related pathologies, neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases) represent a worldwide health and social problem. Since several pathological mechanisms are associated with neurodegeneration, promising strategies against neurodegenerative diseases are aimed to target multiple processes. These approaches usually avoid premature cell death and the loss of function of damaged neurons. This review focuses attention on the preventive and therapeutic potential of several compounds derived from natural sources, which could be exploited for their neuroprotective effect. Curcumin, resveratrol, ergothioneine, and phycocyanin are presented as examples of successful approaches, with a special focus on possible strategies to improve their delivery to the brain.
