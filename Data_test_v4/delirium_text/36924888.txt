36924888|t|Causes of Death in Nonmalignant Meningioma.
36924888|a|OBJECTIVES: Nonmalignant meningioma (NM) is the most common brain tumor in the United States (U.S.), accounting for 54% of nonmalignant brain tumors. This study aims to investigate the causes of death in NM patients and their possible associations with demographic factors. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we analyzed 116,430 NM patients diagnosed between the years 2004 and 2018. RESULTS: A total of 31,640 deaths were observed. Non-tumor diseases accounted for 63.9% of all deaths. Out of these non-tumor deaths, we found that the most common causes were heart disease (18.7% of deaths), cerebrovascular disease (7.4% of deaths), and Alzheimer disease (4.5% of deaths). On the other hand, cancer was responsible for 27.4% of deaths, while in situ and benign tumor deaths accounted for only 8.7%. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first U.S. population-based study to investigate the causes of death in NM patients. We found that non-tumor diseases accounted for the majority of deaths. The risks of mortality caused by heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer disease were significantly elevated. These data can help improve survival outcomes for NM patients, particularly if adjusted by demographic risk factors.
