27284389|t|Reliability and Validity of Bedside Version of Persian WAB (P-WAB-1).
27284389|a|INTRODUCTION: In this study, we reported the reliability and validity of Bedside version of Persian WAB (P-WAB-1) adapted from Western Aphasia Battery (WAB-R) (1,2). P-WAB-1 is a clinical linguistic measuring tool to determine severity and type of aphasia in brain damaged patients based on Aphasia Quotient (AQ) as a functional measure. For the purposes of a quick clinical screening of aphasia in Persian, we adapted the bedside version of WAB-R to assess the performance of Persian aphasic patients. METHODS: The data we reported on adaptation, validity and reliability of P-WAB-1 are based on faithful translation and criterion validity ratio (CVR) taken from the expert panel and the performance of 60 consecutive brain damaged patients referred to different university clinics for rehabilitation and 30 healthy subjects as norms and 40 age-matched epileptic patients as the control group. RESULTS: Based on the results of this study, P-WAB-1 has internal consistency (a=0.71) and test-retest reliability (r=.65 P<0.001) and the subtests are sensitive enough to contribute to Aphasia Quotient (AQ) as a functional measure of severity of aphasia in Iranian brain damaged patients. Based on AQ results, our aphasic patients were classified into four distinct groups of severity. DISCUSSION: P-WAB-1 is the first clinical linguistic test to determine severity of aphasia based on an operational index and can be considered as a valid baseline for screening and diagnosis of aphasia among Persian speaking brain damaged patients. This study is the initial step on adaptation of different versions of WAB-R to measure the severity of aphasia using AQ, LQ and CQ as operational measures and to classify Persian speaking aphasic patients into different types.
