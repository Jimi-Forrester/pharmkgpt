961292|t|[Clinico-morphologic characteristics of cases of alcoholic delirium with lethal outcome].
961292|a|The authors conducted a clinico-morphogicaly analysis of 12 cases (10 males and 2 females) of alcoholic delirium with a lethal outcome. All 12 patients were alcohol abusers (from 5--22 years). Pathoanatomical changes of the brain and internal organs were characterized by traits of chronic alcoholic encephalopathy accompanied by elements of toxic damage of the nervous tissue. The main factor in the genesis of this severe disorder is a diffuse acute toxic damage of the minor vessels of the cortex and white brain matter (more expressed in the frontal areas of the hemispheres). The authors discuss the pathogenetical role of hepatic lesions in alcoholic delirium.
