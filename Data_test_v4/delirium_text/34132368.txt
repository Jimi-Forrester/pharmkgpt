34132368|a|Although diabetic encephalopathy (DE) is a major late complication of diabetes, the pathophysiology of postural instability in DE remains poorly understood. Prior studies have suggested that neuronal apoptosis is closely associated with cognitive function, but the mechanism remains to be elucidated. Green tea, which is a non-fermented tea, contains a number of tea polyphenols, alkaloids, amino acids, polysaccharides and other components. Some studies have found that drinking green tea can reduce the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases and improve cognitive dysfunction. We previously found that myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) regulates apoptosis in high glucose-induced hippocampal neurons. In neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, activation of the JNK signaling pathway promotes neuronal apoptosis. However, the relationship between JNK and MLCK remains to be elucidated. Green tea serum was obtained using seropharmacological methods and applied to hippocampal neurons. In addition, a type 1 diabetes rat model was established and green tea extract was administered, and the Morris water maze test, Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, flow cytometry, western blotting and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labelling assays were used to examine the effects of green tea on hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in diabetic rats. The results demonstrated that green tea can protect against hippocampal neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting the JNK/MLCK pathway and ultimately improves cognitive function in diabetic rats. The present study provided novel insights into the neuroprotective effects of green tea.
