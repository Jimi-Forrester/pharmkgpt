Despite legislative advancements, gaps remain in addressing the medical and ethical challenges of EOL care for patients with advanced dementia, particularly in evaluating treatment options like nasogastric tube (NGT) use and mechanical ventilation (MV). This study investigates the attitudes of the general population (GP) and clinicians in Korea towards EOL treatment decisions. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted among 500 members of the GP and 200 clinicians from a university hospital. Case vignettes were used to assess attitudes towards EOL treatment decisions, specifically focusing on NGT and MV use, and to explore the influencing factors. RESULTS: There was a notable difference in favorable attitudes toward NGT withdrawal between the GP (62.2%) and clinicians (39.0%). Otherwise, both groups showed higher acceptance of MV withholding (82.2% [GPs] and 82.5% [clinicians]) when informed of the patient's verbal intention regarding life-sustaining treatment (LST), and attitudes were more positive with written advance directives. Also, it was decreased when patient intentions were unclear. CONCLUSION: The results suggested the need to consider NGT as a medical intervention requiring a risk-benefit analysis. Although LST decision-making in patients with advanced dementia is still limited in Korea, this study showed the shared recognition among the GP and clinicians of the importance of EOL treatment decisions that consider patient wishes and quality of life for patients with advanced dementia.
