39665869|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The homozygous PiZ mutation (PIZZ genotype) constitutes the predominant cause of severe alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency and leads to liver disease via hepatocellular AAT aggregation. We systematically analysed the composition of AAT aggregates and studied the impact of bile acids. METHODS: AAT inclusions were isolated from livers of PiZ overexpressing mice and PIZZ humans via fluorescence-activated and immunomagnetic sorting (FACS/MACS), while insoluble proteins were obtained via Triton-X extraction. Inclusion composition was evaluated through mass-spectrometry (MS), immunoblotting and immunostaining. Hepatocytes with versus without AAT aggregates were obtained via microdissection. Serum bile acids were assessed in 57 PIZZ subjects and 19 controls. Mice were administered 2% cholic acid (CA)-supplemented chow for 7 days. RESULTS: MS identified the key endoplasmic reticulum chaperone 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) in FACS/MACS pulldowns. GRP78 was also enriched in insoluble fractions from PiZ mice versus wild types and detected in insoluble fractions/MACS isolates from PIZZ liver explants. In cultured cells/primary hepatocytes, PiZ overexpression was associated with increased GRP78 mRNA/protein levels. In human livers, hepatocytes with AAT aggregates had higher GRP78 levels than hepatocytes without. PIZZ subjects displayed higher serum bile acid levels than controls and the highest levels were seen in individuals with liver injury/fibrosis. In PiZ mice, CA-mediated bile acid challenge resulted in increased liver injury and translocation of GRP78 into the aggregates. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that GRP78 is sequestered within AAT inclusions. Bile acid accumulation, as seen in PIZZ subjects with liver disease, may promote GRP78 segregation and thereby augment liver damage. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02929940.
