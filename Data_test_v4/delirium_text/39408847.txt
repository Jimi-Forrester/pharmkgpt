39408847|a|Momordica charantia (bitter melon), a traditional medicinal plant, has been demonstrated to have potential in managing diabetes, gastrointestinal problems, and infections. Among its bioactive compounds, momordicine I, a cucurbitane-type triterpenoid, has attracted attention due to its substantial biological activities. Preclinical studies have indicated that momordicine I possesses antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antihypertrophic, antifibrotic, and antioxidative properties, indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent for cardiovascular diseases. Its mechanisms of action include modulating insulin signaling, inhibiting inflammatory pathways, and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. The proposed mechanistic pathways through which momordicine I exerts its cardiovascular benefits are via the modulation of nitric oxide, angiotensin-converting enzymes, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (Akt), oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effects of momordicine I are pivotal. Momordicine I might reduce inflammation through the following mechanisms: inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines, reducing adhesion molecules expression, suppressing NF-kappaB activation, modulating the Nrf2 pathway and suppressing c-Met/STAT3 pathway. However, its therapeutic use requires the careful consideration of potential side effects, contraindications, and drug interactions. Future research should focus on elucidating the precise mechanisms of momordicine I, validating its efficacy and safety through clinical trials, and exploring its pharmacokinetics. If proven effective, momordicine I could considerably affect clinical cardiology by acting as a novel adjunct or alternative therapy for cardiovascular diseases. To date, no review article has been published on the role of bitter-melon bioactive metabolites in cardiovascular prevention and therapy. The present work constitutes a comprehensive, up-to-date review of the literature, which highlights the promising therapeutic potential of momordicine I on the cardiovascular system and discusses future research recommendations.
