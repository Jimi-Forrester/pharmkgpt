38110923|a|BACKGROUND: Up to 75% of residents from residential aged care facilities (RACF) are transferred to emergency departments (ED) annually to access assessment and care for unplanned or acute health events. Emergency department presentations of RACF residents can be both expensive and risky, and many are unnecessary and preventable. Processes or triage systems to assess residents with a health event, prior to transfer, may reduce unnecessary ED transfer. The Aged Care Emergency (ACE) service is a nurse-led ED outreach service that provides telephone support to RACF nurses regarding residents' health events. This service is available Monday to Friday, 8am to 4 pm (ED ACE hours). The primary objective of this study was to assess whether the augmentation of the phone-based ED ACE service with the addition of a visual telehealth consultation (VTC) would reduce RACF rate of ED presentations compared to usual care. The secondary objectives were to 1) monitor presentations to ED within 48 h post VTC to detect any adverse events and 2) measure RACF staff perceptions of VTC useability and acceptability. METHODS: This implementation study used a stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial design. Study settings were four public hospital EDs and 16 RACFs in two Local Health Districts. Each ED was linked to 4 RACFs with approximately 350 RACF beds, totalling 1435 beds across 16 participating RACFs. Facilities were randomised into eight clusters with each cluster comprising one ED and two RACFs. RESULTS: A negative binomial regression demonstrated a 29% post-implementation reduction in the rate of ED presentations (per 100 RACF beds), within ED ACE hours (IRR [95% CI]: 0.71 [0.46, 1. 09]; p = 0.122). A 29% reduction, whilst not statistically significant, is still clinically important and impactful for residents and EDs. A post-hoc logistic regression demonstrated a statistically significant 69% reduction in the probability that an episode of care resulted in an ED presentation within ED ACE hours post-implementation compared to pre-implementation (OR [95% CI]: 0.31 [0.11, 0.87]; p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Findings have shown the positive impact of augmenting ACE with a VTC. Any reduction of resident presentations to a busy ED is beneficial to healthcare overall, but more so to the individual older person who can recover safely and comfortably in their own RACF.
