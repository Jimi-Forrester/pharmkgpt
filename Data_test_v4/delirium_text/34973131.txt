34973131|a|Exosomes are extracellular vesicles secreted by a variety of living cells, which have a certain degree of natural targeting as nano-carriers. Almost all exosomes released by cells will eventually enter the blood circulation or be absorbed by other cells. Under the action of content sorting mechanism, some specific surface molecules can be expressed on the surface of exosomes, such as tetraspanins protein and integrin. To some extent, these specific surface molecules can fuse with specific cells, so that exosomes show specific cell natural targeting. In recent years, exosomes have become a drug delivery system with low immunogenicity, high biocompatibility and high efficacy. Nucleic acids, polypeptides, lipids, or small molecule drugs with therapeutic function are organically loaded into exosomes, and then transported to specific types of cells or tissues in vivo, especially tumor tissues, to achieve targeting drug delivery. The natural targeting of exosome has been found and recognized in some studies, but there are still many challenges in effective clinical treatments. The use of the natural targeting of exosomes alone is incapable of accurately transporting the goods loaded to specific sites. Besides, the natural targeting of exosomes is still an open question in disease targeting and efficient gene/chemotherapy combined therapy. Engineering transformation and modification on exosomes can optimize its natural targeting and deliver the goods to a specific location, providing wide use in clinical treatment. This review summarizes the research progress of exosomal natural targeting and transformation strategy of obtained targeting after transformation. The mechanism of natural targeting and obtained targeting after transformation are also reviewed. The potential value of exosomal targeting in clinical application is also discussed.
