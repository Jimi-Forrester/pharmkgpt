39361291|t|Longitudinal Assessment of Retinal Microvasculature in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease.
39361291|a|Purpose: To investigate if changes in vessel density (VD) and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) occur in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease (pAD) over time. Methods: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) was used to image VD and FAZ at baseline and for a follow-up period of 2 years. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to determine the amyloid beta (Abeta) status of participants. Results: The VD and FAZ of 148 participants (54% female) were analyzed at baseline and follow-up (mean time between measurements, 2.24 +- 0.35 years). The mean age of the participants was 68.3 +- 6.0 years at baseline and 70.3 +- 5.9 years at follow-up. Participants were divided into three groups: control group, participants who had negative Abeta status at both measurements (Abeta-, n = 116); converter group, participants who transitioned from negative to positive between baseline and follow-up (Abeta-+, n = 18); and participants who were consistently positive at both visits (Abeta++, n = 14). The VD of both Abeta+ groups demonstrated non-significant increases over time in both macula and optic nerve head (ONH) regions. The Abeta- group was found to be significantly higher in both ONH and macular regions. The VD of the Abeta++ group was significantly higher in the macula inner and outer rings compared to the Abeta-+ and Abeta- groups. No significant change was found in FAZ values over time. Conclusions: Alterations in VD seem to manifest already in pAD, exhibiting distinct variations between the ONH and macula. Further longitudinal studies with a longer follow-up design and known amyloid pathology should be undertaken to validate these observations.
