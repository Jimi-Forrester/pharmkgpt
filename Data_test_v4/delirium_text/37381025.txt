37381025|a|BACKGROUND: Datura metel (DM) stramonium is a medicinal plant often abused by Nigerians due to its psychostimulatory properties. Hallucinations, confusion, agitation, aggressiveness, anxiety, and restlessness are reported amongst DM users. Earlier studies suggest that DM induces neurotoxicity and affect brain physiology. However, the exact neurological effects of DM extract in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampal morphology have not been elucidated. In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that oral exposure to DM extract exerts a neurotoxic effect by increasing oxidative stress in the mPFC and the hippocampus and induces behavioral deficits in mice. RESULTS: DM methanolic extract exposure significantly increased MDA and NO levels and reduced SOD, GSH, GPx and CAT activities in mice brains. In addition, our results showed that DM exposure produced cognitive deficits, anxiety, and depressive-like behaviour in mice following oral exposure for 28 days. Moreover, the mPFC and hippocampus showed neurodegenerative features, loss of dendritic and axonal arborization, a dose-dependent decrease in neuronal cell bodies' length, width, area, and perimeter, and a dose-dependent increase in the distance between neuronal cell bodies. CONCLUSIONS: Oral exposure to DM in mice induces behavioural deficits, mPFC and hippocampal neuronal degenerations via redox imbalance in the brain of mice. These observations confirm the neurotoxicity of DM extracts and raises concerns on the safety and potential adverse effects of DM in humans.
