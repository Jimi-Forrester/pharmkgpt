35989212|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is predicted to affect 132 million people by 2050. Targeting modifiable lifestyle risk factors that are associated with an increased risk of AD could prevent a large proportion of dementia cases, allowing people to reach the end of their life dementia free. However, evidence obtained from the observational studies does not take into account how risk factors are correlated with one another, and whether they causally contribute to increased AD risk. In this study, we determine whether the relationship between previously speculated AD risk factors and AD susceptibility is consistent with causality using large-scale genetic data. We focus on educational attainment (EA), intelligence and household income which have been previously shown to be causally associated with AD. Using GWAS-by-subtraction and Multivariable Mendelian Randomization we show that of these, only the cognitive component of EA (intelligence) is independently causally associated with AD. This work has ramifications for the modifiability of lifestyle risk factors for AD.
