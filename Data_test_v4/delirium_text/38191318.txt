38191318|a|BACKGROUND: Delayed neurocognitive recovery and neurocognitive disorder are common postoperative complications among older adults. The assessment of these complications traditionally relies on analog neurocognitive tests, predominantly using the test battery from the ISPOCD-study as the standard approach. However, analog tests are time-consuming and necessitate trained staff which poses limitations. The potential availability of a digital neurocognitive test as an alternative to the ISPOCD remains unknown. We conducted a comparative study between the analog test battery from ISPOCD and the self-administrated digital test battery developed by Mindmore. METHODS: We conducted a crossover study with 50 cognitively healthy older adults >= 60 years of age recruited in Stockholm Sweden, between February and April 2022. The primary outcome focused on measuring comparability between the two test batteries. Our secondary outcomes included assessing participants' perceptions and attitudes about the tests with qualitative interviews and their usability experiences. RESULTS: Fifty older adults, mean age 76, female 56%, with a university or college degree 48% participated in the study. The sub tests in two test batteries demonstrated a medium-large correlation (r = 0.3-0.5), except for one measure. For four out of six measures, significant differences were found with medium to large effect sizes, ranging from 0.57-1.43. Two categories were recognized in the qualitative analysis: self-competing in a safe environment, and experience with technology. Participants expressed feeling safe and at ease during the assessment, with some preferring the digital test over the analog. Participants reported a high level of usability with the digital test and a majority participants (n = 47) reported they would undergo the digital test for a potential future surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The digital test battery developed by Mindmore offers several advantages, including rapid access to test results, easy comprehension, and use for participants, thereby increased accessibility of cognitive screening.
