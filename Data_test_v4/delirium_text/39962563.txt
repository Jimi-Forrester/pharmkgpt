39962563|t|Exploring apathy components and their relationship in cognitive decline: insights from a network cross-sectional study.
39962563|a|BACKGROUND: Apathy worsens with age and cognitive decline, particularly in Alzheimer's, leading to functional and cognitive deterioration. Comprehending its broad impact is vital for customized, preventive treatments. METHODS: The study examined 214 adults divided in three groups-Mild Cognitive Impairment, mild Alzheimer's, and controls-using neuropsychological tests and questionnaires, with statistical and network analysis to explore apathy's links with other group variables related to demographics and treatment. RESULTS: Notable differences were observed among the groups' performance of administered tests. While inferential statistics failed to return a predictive model of apathy in mild Alzheimer's, networks and cluster analyses indicate that the demographic variables analysed have different importance at different times of disease progression and that cognitive apathy is particularly prominent in AD-related decline. CONCLUSIONS: Network analysis revealed insights into dementia risk differentiation, notably the impact of sex and demographic factors, beyond the scope of traditional statistics. It highlighted cognitive apathy as a key area for personalized intervention strategies more than behavioural and emotional, emphasizing the importance of short-term goals and not taking away the person's autonomy when not strictly necessary.
