32030384|a|Ultrasensitive detection of monomeric beta-amyloid peptides is of fundamental significance for studying the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this article, by facilely engineering a gold microelectrode interface, we developed a novel electrochemical biosensor for sensitive and selective monitoring of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) monomers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Through specific Cu2+-Abeta-hemin coordination, Abeta directed the assembly of Cu2+-PEI/AuNPs-hemin nanoprobes into network aggregates on a microelectrode interface, which promoted the enrichment of Abeta monomers on the microelectrode. Furthermore, the AuNP aggregate promotes the deposition of silver nanoparticles, which were utilized for the electrochemical stripping analysis of the Abeta monomer. The proposed method displayed ultra-sensitivity for Abeta monomers with the detection limit down to 0.2 pM. Besides, high selectivity toward Abeta monomers was observed. These remarkable analytical performances render the electrochemical biosensor useful for evaluating the dynamic change of Abeta monomer level in CSF of live mice with AD, promoting the investigation of the role that Abeta monomers play in brain events.
