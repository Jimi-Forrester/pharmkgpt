37009872|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), one of the main types of Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by dysfunctional pancreatic beta-cells and/or peripheral insulin resistance, resulting in impaired glucose and lipid metabolism. Genetic, metabolic, multiple lifestyle, and sociodemographic factors are known as related to high T2DM risk. Dietary lipids and lipid metabolism are significant metabolic modulators in T2DM and T2DM-related complications. Besides, accumulated evidence suggests that altered gut microbiota which plays an important role in the metabolic health of the host contributes significantly to T2DM involving impaired or improved glucose and lipid metabolism. At this point, dietary lipids may affect host physiology and health via interaction with the gut microbiota. Besides, increasing evidence in the literature suggests that lipidomics as novel parameters detected with holistic analytical techniques have important roles in the pathogenesis and progression of T2DM, through various mechanisms of action including gut-brain axis modulation. A better understanding of the roles of some nutrients and lipidomics in T2DM through gut microbiota interactions will help develop new strategies for the prevention and treatment of T2DM. However, this issue has not yet been entirely discussed in the literature. The present review provides up-to-date knowledge on the roles of dietary lipids and lipidomics in gut-brain axis in T2DM and some nutritional strategies in T2DM considering lipids- lipidomics and gut microbiota interactions are given.
