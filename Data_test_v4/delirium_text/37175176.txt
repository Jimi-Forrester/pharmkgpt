37175176|t|The Effects of Essential Oils on the Nervous System: A Scoping Review.
37175176|a|Essential oils are a mixture of natural aromatic volatile oils extracted from plants. The use of essential oils is ancient, and has prevailed in different cultures around the world, such as those of the Egyptians, Greeks, Persians, and Chinese. Today, essential oils are used in traditional and complimentary medicines, aromatherapy, massage therapies, cosmetics, perfumes and food industries. The screening effect of essential oils has been studied worldwide. They demonstrate a range of biological activities, such as antiparasitic, antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiaging, and neuroprotective properties. In this scoping review, we provide a 10-year updated comprehensive assessment of volatile oils and their effects on the nervous system. MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar were systematically and strategically searched for original studies investigating these effects from 2012 to 2022. Approximately seventy studies were selected as included studies. Among these studies, several outcomes were reported, including antistress, antianxiety, analgesic, cognitive, and autonomic effects. Some essential oils showed developmental benefits, with the potential to induce neurite outgrowth. The neurotransmitter receptor level can also be modified by essential oil application. Physiological and pathophysiological outcome measures were reported. For physiological outcomes, arousal, cognitive performance, circadian eating behavior, emotional modulation, consumer acceptance, preferences, and willingness to buy were investigated. For pathophysiological conditions, pain, depression, anxiety, stress, sleep disorder, mental fatigue, agitated behavior, and quality of life were measured. In conclusion, essential oils showed promising effects on the nervous system, which can be further applied to their use in functional foods, drinks, and alternative therapy.
