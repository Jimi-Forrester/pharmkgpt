16673842|a|OBJECTIVE: Delirium is a common condition frequently seen in consultation-liaison psychiatry. It is especially common among medically compromised patients, and is an indicator of the severity of the medical illness. In addition, it is associated with a higher morbidity, mortality, and longer hospitalization. Traditionally, haloperidol has been used to treat agitation as it may occur in delirium. However, atypical antipsychotics are being increasingly used to treat delirium. METHOD: In this article, we will describe two cases of delirium successfully treated with aripiprazole. RESULTS: Both patients had significant improvement in their delirium as measured by the delirium rating scale. CONCLUSION: Aripiprazole appears to be effective in reducing the symptoms of delirium.
