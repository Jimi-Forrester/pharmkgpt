38107647|t|Static and dynamic functional connectivity combined with the triple network model in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
38107647|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are characterized by abnormal functional connectivity (FC) of default-mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN). Static FC (sFC) and dynamic FC (dFC) combined with triple network model can better study the dynamic and static changes of brain networks, and improve its potential diagnostic value in the diagnosis of AD spectrum disorders. Methods: Differences in sFC values and dFC variability patterns among the three brain networks of the three groups (53 AD patients, 40 aMCI patients, and 40 NCs) were computed by ANOVA using Gaussian Random Field theory (GRF) correction. The correlation between FC values (sFC values and dFC variability) in the three networks and cognitive scores (MMSE and MoCA) in AD and aMCI groups was analyzed separately. Results: Within the DMN network, there were significant differences of sFC values in right/left medial superior frontal gyrus and dFC variability in left opercular part inferior frontal gyrus and right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus among the three groups. Within the CEN network, there were significant differences of sFC values in left superior parietal gyrus. Within the SN network, there were significant differences of dFC variability in right Cerebelum_7b and left opercular part inferior frontal gyrus. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between FC values (sFC values of CEN and dFC variability of SN) and MMSE and MoCA scores. Conclusion: It suggests that sFC, dFC combined with triple network model can be considered as potential biomarkers for AD and aMCI.
