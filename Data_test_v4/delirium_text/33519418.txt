33519418|a|Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been widely employed in MCI research. However, there is no reliable systematic evidence regarding the effects of rTMS on MCI. The aim of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rTMS in the treatment of MCI. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of nine electronic databases was performed to identify articles published in English or Chinese before June 20, 2019. The identified articles were screened, data were extracted, and the methodological quality of the included trials was assessed. The meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan 5.3 software. We used the GRADE approach to rate the quality of the evidence. Results: Nine studies comprising 369 patients were included. The meta-analysis showed that rTMS may significantly improve global cognitive function (standardized mean difference [SMD] 2.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 3.24, p = 0.0004, seven studies, n = 296; low-quality evidence) and memory (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.72, p = 0.002, six studies, n = 204; moderate-quality evidence). However, there was no significant improvement in executive function and attention (p > 0.05). Subgroup analyses revealed the following: (1) rTMS targeting the left hemisphere significantly enhanced global cognitive function, while rTMS targeting the bilateral hemispheres significantly enhanced global cognitive function and memory; (2) high-frequency rTMS significantly enhanced global cognitive function and memory; and (3) a high number of treatments >=20 times could improve global cognitive function and memory. There was no significant difference in dropout rate (p > 0.05) between the rTMS and control groups. However, patients who received rTMS had a higher rate of mild adverse effects (risk ratio 2.03, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.52, p = 0.01, seven studies, n = 317; moderate-quality evidence). Conclusions: rTMS appears to improve global cognitive function and memory in patients with MCI and may have good acceptability and mild adverse effects. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted cautiously due to the relatively small number of trials, particularly for low-frequency rTMS.
