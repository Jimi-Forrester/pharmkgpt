36079052|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies have confirmed that both healthy diets and physical exercise have preventive effects with respect to cognitive decline with aging. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the associations of physical exercise with cognitive impairment differ in community-dwelling older adults with different dietary habits. METHODS: In the 2008/2009 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, 14,966 community-dwelling older adults (>=65 years) were included for analyses. Dietary habits (including daily intake of fruits, vegetables, tea, meat, fish, eggs, food made from beans, salt-preserved vegetables, sugar, garlic, milk products, nut products, mushroom or algae, vitamins and medicinal plants) and physical exercise were assessed. Cognitive impairment was evaluated using the Chinese version of the MMSE in the 2008/2009 and 2011/2012 waves. The effect modifications of physical exercise on cognitive impairment by dietary habits were estimated using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Older adults who practiced physical exercise exhibited a trend of decreased probability of cognitive impairment at baseline and follow-up (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.80-1.06, p = 0.273; OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.65-1.05, p = 0.123, respectively) compared with those who did not practice physical exercise. When stratified by dietary habits, physical exercise had a protective effect with respect to prevalent cognitive impairment in older adults who ate fruits (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.58-0.94, p = 0.016), ate food made from beans (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.62-0.93, p = 0.007), did not eat sugar (OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.68-0.98, p = 0.028) and ate milk products (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.57-0.97, p = 0.030); in the longitudinal analyses, physical exercise had a protective effect with respect to incident cognitive impairment in older adults who ate fruits (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.41-0.98, p = 0.040) and milk products (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.35-0.94, p = 0.027). Fruits, food made from beans and milk products modified the associations of physical exercise with prevalent cognitive impairment (p values for interaction = 0.008, 0.005 and 0.082, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The associations of physical exercise with cognitive impairment could be modified by certain dietary habits. Physical exercise was not found to be significantly protective with respect to cognitive impairment in older adults unless they had specific dietary habits. Thus, dietary habits should be emphasized when investigating the beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults.
