3947256|t|Cerebrospinal fluid neuron-specific enolase is reduced in Alzheimer's disease.
3947256|a|Neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a glycolytic enzyme enolase found in brain, was examined in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum of 30 patients with presumptive Alzheimer's disease (AD) and of 13 healthy controls and evaluated as a measure of neuronal functional activity associated with AD. The cerebrospinal fluid NSE levels of patients with AD were significantly reduced and serum NSE levels were significantly increased from controls. Cerebrospinal fluid NSE levels may be representative of central nervous system cell loss or a decrease in neuronal functional activity associated with AD.
