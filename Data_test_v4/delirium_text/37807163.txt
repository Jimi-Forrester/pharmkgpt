37807163|t|A - 30 Risk Factors for Poor Sleep Quality and Subjective Cognitive Decline during the COVID-19 Pandemic in an Ethnoracially Diverse US Sample.
37807163|a|OBJECTIVE: Poor sleep quality is associated with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment. These relationships are understudied in ethnoracially diverse groups. We examined associations between sociodemographic characteristics, sleep changes during the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., increased problems/poorer quality), and SCD in ethnoracially diverse older individuals in the US. METHOD: 870 older adults (126 Latino, 74 Black, 33 Asian, and 637 White; Mage = 67.0 [7.6]) completed an online survey including sociodemographic information, the Everyday Cognition scale (ECog), which measures SCD, and a question inquiring about increased sleep problems/worsened sleep quality during the pandemic. Chi-square tests and analyses of variance assessed sociodemographic and SCD differences between groups. Regression and correlation analyses assessed relationships among sociodemographic factors, changes in sleep quality, and SCD. RESULTS: White participants were older (p < 0.001), and White and Asian groups had higher education levels (p = 0.009) than Latinos. There were more female (p = 0.016) and middle-income (p = 0.019) White respondents. There were no group differences in ECog ratings (p = 0.143) or the proportion of respondents endorsing changes in sleep during the pandemic (p = 0.197). Changes in sleep were associated with greater SCD (beta = 0.214, p < 0.001). Younger age (p < 0.001), female sex (p = 0.001), and lower income (p = 0.016) were significant predictors of changes in sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Poorer sleep quality resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with SCD concerns. Notably, younger, female, and lower-income adults may have been at greater risk for increased sleep problems. Future work is needed to comprehensively examine sleep quality, SCD, and objective cognitive functioning in more representative samples.
