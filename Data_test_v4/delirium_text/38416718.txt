38416718|t|Temporal and region-specific tau hyperphosphorylation in the medulla and forebrain coincides with development of functional changes in male obese Zucker rats.
38416718|a|Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with development of tauopathies that contribute to cognitive decline. Without functional leptin receptors, male obese Zucker rats (OZRs) develop MetS, and they have increased phosphorylated tau (ptau) and impaired cognitive function. In addition to regulating energy balance, leptin enhances activation of the hippocampus, which is essential for spatial learning and memory. Whether spatial learning and memory is always impaired in OZRs or develops with MetS is unknown. We hypothesized that male OZRs develop MetS traits that promote regional increases in ptau and functional deficits associated with those brain regions. In the medulla and cortex, tau-pSer199,202 and tau-pSer396 were comparable in juvenile (7-8-weeks-old) lean Zucker rats (LZRs) and OZRs but increased in 18-19-week-old OZRs. Elevated tau-pSer396 was concentrated in the dorsal vagal complex of the medulla, and by this age OZRs had hypertension with increased arterial pressure variability. In the hippocampus, tau-pSer199,202 and tau-pSer396 were still comparable in 18-19-week-old OZRs and LZRs but elevated in 28-29-week-old OZRs with emergence of deficits in Morris water maze performance. Comparable escape latencies observed during acquisition in 18-19-week-old OZRs and LZRs were increased in 28-29-week-old OZRs with greater use of non-spatial search strategies. Increased ptau developed with changes in the insulin/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the hippocampus and cortex but not medulla, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. These data demonstrate leptin is not required for spatial learning and memory in male OZRs. Furthermore, early development of MetS-associated autonomic dysfunction by the medulla may be predictive of later hippocampal dysfunction and cognitive impairment.
