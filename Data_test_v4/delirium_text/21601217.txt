21601217|a|Anti-inflammatory drugs represent a potential new strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and to reach brain tissues is a critical point for these drugs and is strictly related to their lipophilicity. Naproxen (NAP) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) under active investigation for AD. To improve its lipophilic character, NAP was conjugated through a diethylamine spacer (EDA) to lipoamino acids (LAA), alpha-amino acids containing a long alkyl side chain, to obtain the NAP-EDA-LAA10 and NAP-EDA-LAA14 prodrugs. The interaction of NAP and prodrugs with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine phospholipids, forming either multilamellar vesicles or monolayers (at the air/water interface) and used as biomembrane models, was studied by differential scanning calorimetry and Langmuir-Blodgett techniques. Experimental data showed that NAP conjugation with LAA residues was able to enhance the drug interaction with such biomembrane models.
