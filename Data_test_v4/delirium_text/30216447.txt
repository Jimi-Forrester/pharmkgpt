30216447|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with aging and characterized pathologically by the presence of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurite and synapse loss. Amyloid beta-peptide (1-42) [Abeta(1-42)], a major component of senile plaques, is neurotoxic and induces oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. Redox proteomics has been used to identify proteins oxidatively modified by Abeta(1-42) in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we discuss these proteins in the context of those identified to be oxidatively modified in animal models of AD, and human studies including familial AD, pre-clinical AD (PCAD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), early AD, late AD, Down syndrome (DS), and DS with AD (DS/AD). These redox proteomics studies indicate that Abeta(1-42)-mediated oxidative stress occurs early in AD pathogenesis and results in altered antioxidant and cellular detoxification defenses, decreased energy yielding metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, loss of synaptic plasticity and cell structure, neuroinflammation, impaired protein folding and degradation, and altered signal transduction. Improved access to biomarker imaging and the identification of lifestyle interventions or treatments to reduce Abeta production could be beneficial in preventing or delaying the progression of AD.
