31545396|a|In the present study, a polyphenolic mixture was isolated from Seomae mugwort (SM; a native Korean variety of Artemisia argyi H.) via extraction with aqueous 70% methanol followed by the elution of ethyl acetate over a silica gel column. Each polyphenolic compound was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, and compared with the literature. In addition to the 14 characterized components, one hydroxycinnamate, six flavonoids, and one lignan were reported for the first time, to the best our knowledge, in Artemisia argyi H. The anti-inflammatory properties of SM polyphenols were studied in lipopolysaccharide-treated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. The SM polyphenols attenuated the activation of macrophages via the inhibition of nitric oxide production, nuclear factor-kappaB activation, the mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1beta, and the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Our results suggested that SM polyphenols may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of inflammatory-related diseases.
