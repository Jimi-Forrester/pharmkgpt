33922687|t|Serum Calcium Level as a Useful Surrogate for Risk of Elevated Intraocular Pressure.
33922687|a|BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) plays a principal role in the deterioration of glaucoma, and the intraocular pressure is also accepted as the most important modifiable factor. Calcium ion has been found to play a vital role in regulating the resistance of the trabecular meshwork in humans. However, the relationship between serum total calcium and IOP has not been well-established. METHODS: We investigated the association between serum total calcium and the IOP in a large population (14,037 eligible participants, consisting of 7712 men and 6325 women, were included) at the Tri-Service General Hospital from 2010 to 2016. Several models of covariate adjustments associated with IOP were designed. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was performed for gender differences in the association between the serum total calcium level and IOP. RESULTS: There was a significant relationship between serum total calcium levels and IOP in women and men with a beta coefficient of 0.050 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.030-0.069) and 0.025 (95%CI, 0.007-0.043). Notably, participants in the highest tertiles of serum total calcium levels had significantly higher IOP, in both the male and female participants. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that IOP is significantly associated with serum total calcium levels in a large Asian population. This study supports the notion that serum total calcium may play an important role in groups at high risk for elevated IOP.
