38848182|t|Dementia Ideal Care: Ecosystem Map of Best Practices and Care Pathways Enhanced by Technology and Community.
38848182|a|Background: Globally, much work has been done by nonprofit, private, and academic groups to develop best practices for the care of people living with dementia (PLWD), including Alzheimer's disease. However, these best practices reside in disparate repositories and tend to focus on one phase of the patient journey or one relevant group. Objective: To fill this gap, we developed a Dementia Ideal Care Map that everyone in the dementia ecosystem can use as an actionable tool for awareness, policy development, funding, research, training, service delivery, and technology design. The intended audience includes (and not limited to) policymakers, academia, industry, technology developers, health system leaders, clinicians, social service providers, patient advocates, PLWD, their families, and communities at large. Methods: A search was conducted for published dementia care best practices and quality measures, which were then summarized in a visual diagram. The draft diagram was analyzed to identify barriers to ideal care. Then, additional processes, services, technologies, and quality measures to overcome those challenges were brainstormed. Feedback was then obtained from experts. Results: The Dementia Ideal Care Map summarizes the ecosystem of over 200 best practices, nearly 100 technology enablers, other infrastructure, and enhanced care pathways in one comprehensive diagram. It includes psychosocial interventions, care partner support, community-based organizations; awareness, risk reduction; initial detection, diagnosis, ongoing medical care; governments, payers, health systems, businesses, data, research, and training. Conclusions: Dementia Ideal Care Map is a practical tool for planning and coordinating dementia care. This visualized ecosystem approach can be applied to other conditions.
