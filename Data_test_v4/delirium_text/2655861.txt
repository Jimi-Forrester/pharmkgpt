2655861|a|Several lines of evidence have implicated acetylcholine (ACh) as one of the neurotransmitters found to be decreased in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Various methods of cholinergic augmentation have been attempted, with mixed results. Tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is currently being investigated at the McGill Centre for Studies in Aging. Preliminary uncontrolled data from a 10-week clinical trial of THA and lecithin, reported elsewhere, suggest a clinically modest but statistically significant beneficial effect on cognition, although problems exist with side effects, particularly gastrointestinal. Since the suggestion by Janowsky in 1972 that cholinergic neurotransmission may exert an inhibitory or depressant effect on mood, the evidence accumulated in the literature has been inconclusive. We undertook to assess several potential pretreatment correlates of depressive symptoms in AD and to monitor the course of these symptoms during the 10 week treatment period, using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) of Brink and Yesavage. Pretreatment GDS scores were found to correlate with degree of overall disability and dementia as measured by the Rapid Disability Rating Scale (RDRS) and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMS), respectively. GDS scores over the treatment period did not change to a statistically significant degree. The meaning of these results is discussed, particularly with reference to the difficulty of diagnosis and measurement of depression in the setting of dementia.
