2898011|t|Topographical distribution of neurochemical changes in Alzheimer's disease.
2898011|a|Biochemical indices of cortical nerve cells affected in Alzheimer's disease have been proposed (excitatory dicarboxylic amino acid, EDAA, sodium-dependent carrier; phosphate-activated glutaminase activity; serotonin type 2 recognition site; somatostatin-like immunoreactivity). These and the content of EDAAs and two related amino acids, and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity have been measured in up to 13 areas of cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex from 16 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 17 controls. Reduction of the index of the serotonin recognition site, somatostatin content and another biochemical index of interneurones coincide and indicate a rather unexpected focal loss of such neurones from the parietal lobe. No unequivocal measure of the integrity of pyramidal neurones could be established as the content of no amino acid was reduced, the index of the EDAA carrier showed evidence of change in few brain regions and glutaminase activity was subject to unexplained variability. ChAT activity alone closely paralleled a previous report of the distribution of morphological degeneration. The results are discussed in relation to therapy and positron emission tomography.
