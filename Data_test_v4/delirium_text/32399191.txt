32399191|a|Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common, severe complication of advanced chronic liver disease (CLD) and has a devastating impact on the patient's quality of life and prognosis. The neurotoxin ammonia and the presence of systemic and neurological inflammation are considered the key drivers of this neuropsychiatric syndrome. Treatment options available in routine clinical practice are limited, and the development of novel therapies is hampered owing to the complexity and heterogeneity of HE. This review article aims to outline the current understanding of the pathomechanisms of HE and the recent advances in the identification and development of novel therapeutic targets.
