METHODS: We measured the plasma biomarkers with Simoa (n = 1199), applied LASSO regression for biomarker selection and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses to determine diagnostic accuracy. We validated our findings in two independent cohorts and constructed a visualization approach. RESULTS: P-tau181, GFAP, and NfL were selected. This combination had area under the curve (AUC) = 83% to identify amyloid positivity in pre-dementia stages, AUC = 87%-89% to differentiate Alzheimer's or controls from frontotemporal dementia, AUC = 74%-76% to differentiate Alzheimer's or controls from dementia with Lewy bodies. Highly reproducible AUCs were obtained in independent cohorts. The resulting visualization tool includes UpSet plots to visualize the stand-alone biomarker results and density plots to visualize the biomarker results combined. DISCUSSION: Our multimarker blood test interpretation tool is ready for testing in real-world clinical dementia settings. HIGHLIGHTS: We developed a multimarker blood test interpretation tool for clinical dementia practice. Our interpretation tool includes plasma biomarkers P-tau, GFAP, and NfL. Our tool is particularly useful for Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia diagnosis.
