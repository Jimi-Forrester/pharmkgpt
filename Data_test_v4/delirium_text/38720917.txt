38720917|t|Antipsychotic Prescribing in Older Adults after In-Hospital Initiation.
38720917|a|Background: In older adults, the use of antipsychotics to treat delirium or the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia is potentially inappropriate and may be associated with adverse effects. Antipsychotics newly initiated in hospital may be inadvertently continued after discharge. In the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) - Regina area, the frequency and duration of antipsychotic continuation for older adults after initiation during a hospital stay is unknown. Objectives: To describe potentially inappropriate antipsychotic use in older adults after discharge from hospital, specifically rates of postdischarge antipsychotic therapy after initiation in hospital and continuation up to 180 days after discharge; prescribing regimens used; risk factors associated with continuation; pharmacist involvement; and plans for antipsychotic discontinuation, tapering, and/or follow-up. Methods: This retrospective chart review included inpatients 65 years of age or older who were discharged from medicine units at SHA - Regina area hospitals between September 30, 2021, and June 28, 2022. Outpatient dispensing histories were also gathered. Results: Of the 189 patients included in the analysis, 60 (31.7%) had continuation of antipsychotic therapy at discharge. Of these, 48 (80.0%), 33 (55.0%), and 24 (40.0%) had continuation of antipsychotic therapy at 30, 90, and 180 days after discharge, respectively. Of the patients with continuing antipsychotic therapy, 53 (88.3%) were 75 years of age or older, and 9 (15.0%) had documentation of an outpatient antipsychotic follow-up plan. Conclusions: Postdischarge continuation of antipsychotics was similar to that reported in the literature. Patients continued on antipsychotics after discharge were at a greater than 50% risk of continuation at 90 days and were unlikely to have a follow-up plan. Future quality improvement efforts should include standardized prioritization of medication reviews, documentation of indications, and regular reassessment of therapy.
