32351392|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies was to ascertain to effects of TNF-alpha inhibitor therapy on body weight and BMI. METHODS: Three databases (PubMed, OVID, and EMBASE) were systematically searched from inception to August 2018. We identified prospective, retrospective, and randomized controlled studies in adults with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors based on pre-specified inclusion criteria. A random-effects model was used to estimate standardised mean change (SMCC). RESULTS: Twenty-six longitudinal studies with a total of 1,245 participants were included in the meta-analysis. We found evidence for a small increase in body weight (SMCC = 0.24, p = .0006, 95% CI [0.10, 0.37]) and in BMI (SMCC = 0.26, p < .0001, 95% CI [0.13, 0.39]). On average, patients gained 0.90kg (SD = 5.13) under infliximab, 2.34kg (D = 5.65) under etanercept and 2.27kg (SD = 4.69) during treatment with adalimumab within the duration of the respective studies (4-104 weeks). CONCLUSION: Our results yield further support the for the view that TNF-alpha inhibitors increase body weight and BMI as a potential side effect. Modulating cytokine signaling could be a future therapeutic mechanism to treat disorders associated with weight changes such as anorexia nervosa.
