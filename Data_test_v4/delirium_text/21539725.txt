21539725|t|Investigational drugs for the treatment of AD: what can we learn from negative trials?
21539725|a|Given the level of interest and activity in the race to find a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, it is expected that a reasonably safe and effective drug will be identified within the next decade. It may be worthwhile to pause periodically during the course of this race to take stock of what we have learned. Over the past few years, a number of trials have been conducted with promising new compounds (including some with novel mechanisms of action) that failed to meet primary endpoints and so were discontinued from clinical development. This article reviews a set of molecules with a range of mechanisms that have been trialed but with negative results. This article also examines the reasons for the negative findings and summarizes some of what we have learned from these experiences.
