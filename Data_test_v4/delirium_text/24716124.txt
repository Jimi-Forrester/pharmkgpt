24716124|a|UNLABELLED: A stroke often results in post-stroke dementia, a rapid decline in memory and intelligence causing dysfunctions in daily life. The Chinese medicine doctor uses 4 examinations of inspection, listening, smelling, and feeling to determine the Chinese medicine pattern (CMP). Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the CMP in patients with post-stroke dementia. A total of 101 stroke patients were examined, consistent with the DSM IV diagnostic criteria of the American Psychiatric Association, as well as the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Association International pour Ia Recherche et I'Enseignement en Neurosciences vascular dementia diagnostic criteria of post-stroke dementia. RESULTS: 100 patients (99.0%) were KEDP (kidney essence deficiency pattern, shen jing kui xu zheng, ), 83 patients were AHLYP (ascendant hyperactivity of liver yang pattern, gan yang shang kang zheng, ), 83 patients were QBDP (qi-blood deficiency pattern, qi xue kui xu zheng, ), 81 patients were SBOCP (static blood obstructing the collaterals pattern, yu xue zu luo zheng, ), 72 patients were BSTRP (bowels stagnation turbidity retention pattern, fu zhi zhuo liu zheng, ), 50 patients were FHIEP (fire heat interior excess pattern, huo re nei sheng zheng, ), and 39 participants (38.6%) were PTOOP (phlegm turbidity obstructing the orifices pattern, tan zhuo zu qiao zheng, ); one to 31 patients have at least 2 CMPs simultaneously. In conclusion, the most CMP is KEDP CMP in the post-stroke dementia patients, and one patient may have one or at least 2 CMPs simultaneously.
