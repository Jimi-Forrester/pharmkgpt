26122432|t|C-Terminal Threonine Reduces Abeta43 Amyloidogenicity Compared with Abeta42.
26122432|a|Abeta43, a product of the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein APP, is related to Abeta42 by an additional Thr residue at the C-terminus. Abeta43 is typically generated at low levels compared with the predominant Abeta42 and Abeta40 forms, but it has been suggested that this longer peptide might have an impact on amyloid-beta aggregation and Alzheimer's disease that is out of proportion to its brain content. Here, we report that both Abeta42 and Abeta43 spontaneously aggregate into mature amyloid fibrils via sequential appearance of the same series of oligomeric and protofibrillar intermediates, the earliest of which appears to lack beta-structure. In spite of the additional beta-branched amino acid at the C-terminus, Abeta43 fibrils have fewer strong backbone H-bonds than Abeta42 fibrils, some of which are lost at the C-terminus. In contrast to previous reports, we found that Abeta43 spontaneously aggregates more slowly than Abeta42. In addition, Abeta43 fibrils are very inefficient at seeding Abeta42 amyloid formation, even though Abeta42 fibrils efficiently seed amyloid formation by Abeta43 monomers. Finally, mixtures of Abeta42 and Abeta43 aggregate more slowly than Abeta42 alone. Both in this Abeta42/Abeta43 co-aggregation reaction and in cross-seeding by Abeta42 fibrils, the structure of the Abeta43 in the product fibrils is influenced by the presence of Abeta42. The results provide new details of amyloid structure and assembly pathways, an example of structural plasticity in prion-like replication, and data showing that low levels of Abeta43 in the brain are unlikely to favorably impact the aggregation of Abeta42.
