38583129|a|Despite considerable research efforts, it is still not clear which mechanisms underlie neuronal cell death in neurodegenerative diseases. During the last 20 years, multiple pathways have been identified that can execute regulated cell death (RCD). Among these RCD pathways, apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, autophagy-related cell death, and lysosome-dependent cell death have been intensively investigated. Although RCD consists of numerous individual pathways, multiple common proteins have been identified that allow shifting from one cell death pathway to another. Another layer of complexity is added by mechanisms such as the endosomal machinery, able to regulate the activation of some RCD pathways, preventing cell death. In addition, restricted axonal degeneration and synaptic pruning can occur as a result of RCD activation without loss of the cell body. RCD plays a complex role in neurodegenerative processes, varying across different disorders. It has been shown that RCD is differentially involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), among the most common neurodegenerative diseases. In AD, neuronal loss is associated with the activation of not only necroptosis, but also pyroptosis. In ALS, on the other hand, motor neuron death is not linked to canonical necroptosis, whereas pyroptosis pathway activation is seen in white matter microglia. Despite these differences in the activation of RCD pathways in AD and ALS, the accumulation of protein aggregates immunoreactive for p62/SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1) is a common event in both diseases and many other neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we describe the major RCD pathways with clear activation in AD and ALS, the main interactions between these pathways, as well as their differential and similar involvement in these disorders. Finally, we will discuss targeting RCD as an innovative therapeutic concept for neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and ALS. Considering that the execution of RCD or "cellular suicide" represents the final stage in neurodegeneration, it seems crucial to prevent neuronal death in patients by targeting RCD. This would offer valuable time to address upstream events in the pathological cascade by keeping the neurons alive.
