39475966|t|The impact of alcohol misuse in trauma patients: A scoping review protocol.
39475966|a|BACKGROUND: Alcohol use is a contributing factor in many cases of traumatic injury. There is conflicting evidence on the impact of alcohol use at the time of physical trauma on severity of injury and hospital course. Similarly, the significance of alcohol use disorder on outcomes in hospitalized trauma patients is unclear. This scoping review aims to provide a concise overview of the current literature surrounding peri-trauma alcohol use and alcohol use disorder on injury severity, in-hospital complications, patient outcomes, and long-term health impact of alcohol use in trauma. We will also explore the associated healthcare costs of this patient population. METHODS: A systematic search of the following databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library will be completed to extract all studies that meet our inclusion criteria from January 2000 onwards. Case reports will be excluded. Two reviewers will screen all citations, abstracts, and full text articles. A third reviewer will act as tiebreaker at each stage of the screening process. A narrative synthesis without meta-analysis will be conducted and assessed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. DISCUSSION: This review will contribute to the literature by providing a concise overview of the current data on the impact of alcohol on outcomes following trauma. We will explore the overall themes in the literature, limitations, and future directions to focus forthcoming research in this patient population.
