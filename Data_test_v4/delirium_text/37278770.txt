37278770|a|PURPOSE: For patients with blood malignancies, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a significant challenge. These patients have hope to be completely cured after the transplantation, but deal with the dread of dying at the same time. This study presents a deep understanding of the psychological process of the treatment including perception, emotion, interactions, and its consequences in patients undergoing HSCT. METHODS: This study utilized a qualitative method based on the Strauss and Corbin Approach toward the grounded theory. The research population comprised all patients undergoing HSTC in Taleghani Hospital (Tehran, Iran) who were able to communicate effectively. The data were collected through deep and unstructured interviews with consenting patients. The sampling started with a purposive method and continued until the theoretical saturation was met. The 17 participants were interviewed individually and the data were analyzed via Strauss and Corbin Approach (2015). RESULTS: According to the findings of the present study, the threat to survival was the main concern of patients during the transplant process. The patients tried to cope with the threat to survival through strategies that were conceptualized as survival protection. These strategies led to the consequences such as debris removal and fondness for life, through which the patients rebuilt themselves, while on the alert for transplant rejection. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that dealing with HSCT affects personal and social aspects of a patient's life. This means, taking measures to facilitate psychological affairs and financial expenses, increasing the nursing manpower, and helping patients to reduce tension play a vital role to improve their fighting spirit.
