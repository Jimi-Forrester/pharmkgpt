3359332|a|Nerve growth factor (NGF), a well-characterized target-derived growth factor, has been postulated to promote neuronal differentiation and survival of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. In the present paper, we demonstrate that a developmental change in NGF action occurs in postnatal rat basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in culture. Firstly, NGF acts as maturation factor by increasing choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and acts later as a survival factor. In dissociated cell cultures of septal neurons from early postnatal (P1-4) rats, ChAT activities were increased by the addition of NGF. That is, ChAT activities in P1 septal cells cultured for 7 days was increased 4-fold in the presence of NGF at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. However, the number of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-positive neurons was not significantly different between these groups. In contrast, septal neurons from P8 to P14 rats showed different responses to NGF. Although the P14 septal neurons in culture for 7 days without NGF lost about half of the ChAT activity during a 7-day cultivation, cells cultured with NGF retained the activity at the initial level. The number of AChE-positive neurons counted in cultures with NGF was much greater than the number without NGF. These results suggest that, during the early postnatal days, the action of NGF on the septal cholinergic neurons in culture changes from induction of ChAT activity to the promotion of cholinergic neuronal cell survival. During this developmental period in vivo, septal neurons are terminating their projections to the hippocampal formation. Similar NGF-regulated changes in cholinergic neurons were observed in cultured postnatal neurons from vertical limb of diagonal band. An analogy has been pointed out between the neuronal death of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and a similar neuronal death in senile dementia, especially Alzheimer's type. The work reported here might present a possibility that NGF could play a role in preventing the loss of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in this disease.
