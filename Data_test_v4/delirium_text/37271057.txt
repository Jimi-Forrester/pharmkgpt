37271057|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is well-recognized in adult inpatient care. However, it is often overlooked in children, being mistaken for pain, anxiety, or age-appropriate agitation. METHODS: To assess the impact of a formal teaching session on the diagnostic rates and management of pediatric delirium (PD) in a tertiary care center, we conducted a retrospective chart review of all hospitalized children diagnosed with PD between August 2003 and August 2018 at the CHU Sainte-Justine (Montreal, Canada). Diagnostic incidence and management were compared before (2003 to 2014) and after (2015 to 2018) a formal teaching session provided to pediatric residents, staff pediatricians, and intensive care physicians in December 2014. RESULTS: The two cohorts displayed similar demographics, PD symptomatology, PD duration (median: 2 days), and hospital stay duration (median: 11.0 and 10.5 days). However, we saw a major increase in diagnosis frequency after 2014 (from 1.84 to 7.09 cases/year). This increased diagnostic rate was most striking in the pediatric intensive care unit setting. Although symptomatic treatment with antipsychotics and alpha-2 agonists was similar between the two cohorts, patients diagnosed after 2014 were more often weaned from offending medications (benzodiazepines, anesthetics, and anticholinergics). All patients recovered fully. CONCLUSIONS: Formal teaching on the symptoms and management of PD was associated with an increase in diagnostic rate and an improved management of PD in our institution. Larger studies are required to assess standardized screening tools that may further enhance diagnostic rates and improve care for children with PD.
