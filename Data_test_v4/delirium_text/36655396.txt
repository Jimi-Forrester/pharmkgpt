36655396|a|BACKGROUND: Patients presenting for inpatient rehabilitation following injury or illness are commonly affected by comorbid psychiatric illness. Currently, little is known about the utilization of a psychiatry consult service in an inpatient rehabilitation hospital. OBJECTIVE: To identify which rehabilitation patient populations most frequently received psychiatric consultation and recognize the most common psychiatric comorbidities after the implementation of a psychiatry consult liaison (PCL) service. DESIGN: A retrospective observational study in the form of a chart review examining the utilization patterns of a psychiatric consultation liaison service in the inpatient rehabilitation setting. Chart review was performed to extract patient demographics (age and sex), rehabilitation diagnosis, cause of rehabilitation diagnosis (intentional, accident, self-inflicted, or disease), reason for referral to psychiatry, and psychiatric diagnosis on initial consultation. Statistical software was used for statistical analysis to answer the pre-specified research questions. SETTING: A 178 bed, free-standing, academic rehabilitation hospital located in an urban Canadian center. PATIENTS: Any patient admitted to the inpatient rehabilitation hospital who received a psychiatric consultation between September 2016 and December 2019 was eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: A total of 1016 charts were reviewed in the initial chart review and  1008 were included. The most common rehabilitation diagnoses that were associated with a psychiatric consult were (% admissions receiving consultation): amputations (38%); burns (35%), neurologic disorder (28%), deconditioning (14%), and musculoskeletal injury (7%). Although 20% of patients did not meet criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis, most common psychiatric diagnoses included mood disorder, adjustment disorder, neurocognitive disorder, and delirium. CONCLUSION: There are significant perceived needs for psychiatric services in the inpatient rehabilitation setting. Although some patient groups such as patients with amputations, burns, and trauma may exhibit the highest utilization, the service supports mental health needs from many patient groups.
