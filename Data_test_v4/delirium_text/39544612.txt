39544612|t|Marchiafava-Bignami Disease in a Postoperative Non-alcoholic Patient.
39544612|a|Marchiafava-Bignami disease (MBD) is a neuropathological condition characterized by demyelination and necrosis of the corpus callosum. This condition is commonly found in malnourished and alcoholic patients, but it is rarely observed in non-alcoholic individuals. In this case report, we describe a non-alcoholic patient who underwent two consecutive gastrointestinal surgeries. After the surgeries, he developed seizures and was diagnosed with MBD based on a plain head MRI. However, with the proper treatment, his condition stabilized, and he was discharged. This case serves as a beacon of hope, demonstrating that MBD, even in non-alcoholic patients, can be reversible with appropriate imaging and treatment.
