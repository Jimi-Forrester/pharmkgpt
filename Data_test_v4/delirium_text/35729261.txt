35729261|t|Integrative transcriptome-wide analysis of atopic dermatitis for drug repositioning.
35729261|a|Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases, which significantly impact the quality of life. Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was conducted to estimate both transcriptomic and genomic features of AD and detected significant associations between 31 expression quantitative loci and 25 genes. Our results replicated well-known genetic markers for AD, as well as 4 novel associated genes. Next, transcriptome meta-analysis was conducted with 5 studies retrieved from public databases and identified 5 additional novel susceptibility genes for AD. Applying the connectivity map to the results from TWAS and meta-analysis, robustly enriched perturbations were identified and their chemical or functional properties were analyzed. Here, we report the first research on integrative approaches for an AD, combining TWAS and transcriptome meta-analysis. Together, our findings could provide a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of AD and suggest potential drug candidates as alternative treatment options.
