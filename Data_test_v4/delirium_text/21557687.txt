21557687|t|Characterization of AbetapN3 deposition in the brains of dogs of various ages and other animal species.
21557687|a|Senile plaques (SP) are characteristic histopathological manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but are also found in normal aging (NA). Recent studies have demonstrated that beta amyloid (Abeta) proteins that have been truncated at the N-terminal position 3 (AbetapN3) are the predominant component of SP in AD, but not in NA. The present study revealed that AbetapN3 was deposited in an age-dependent manner in canine brains. Moreover, AbetapN3 was the main component of the SP that developed in very old dogs. The deposition of AbetapN3 increased in accordance with the number of SP, but that of N-terminally intact Abeta (AbetaN1) did not. In addition, AbetapN3 was also deposited in the SP of a Japanese macaque and an American black bear, but not in a feline brain. Focal microvascular cerebral amyloid angiopathy was also observed in the deep cortices and the white matter of the dogs and a woodpecker. Those were always composed of both AbetapN3 and AbetaN1. In conclusion, though non-human animals do not develop full pathology of AD of the human type, AbetapN3 is widely deposited in the brains of senescent vertebrates.
