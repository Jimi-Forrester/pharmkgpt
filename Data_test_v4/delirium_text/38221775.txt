38221775|t|Unraveling the neuroprotective mechanisms of naltrexone against aluminum-induced neurotoxicity.
38221775|a|Aluminum (Al) is a known neurotoxic trace element linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, has shown promising effects in reducing neuroinflammation at lower doses than those prescribed for addiction. This study aimed to determine the neuroprotective effects of naltrexone on Al-induced neurotoxicity in an in vitro AD model. The SH-SY5Y cells were first cultivated in a standard growth medium. Subsequently, the cells were induced to differentiate by decreasing the concentration of fetal bovine serum and introducing retinoic acid (RA) into the culture media. Subsequently, the inclusion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was implemented in conjunction with RA. The process of differentiation was concluded on the seventh day. Study groups (n = 3) were designed as the control group, naltrexone group, Al group, Al-Nal group, Alzheimer' model (AD) group, Alzheimer model + Al-exposed group (AD-Al), Alzheimer model + Nal applied group (AD-Nal) and Alzheimer model + Al-exposed + Nal applied group (AD-Al-Nal). Hyperphosphorylated Tau protein as the specific marker of AD was measured in all groups. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)beta, Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), Akt and Wnt signaling pathways were analyzed comparatively. In addition, oxidative stress parameters (total antioxidant capacity, lipid peroxidase, protein carbonyl and reactive oxygen species) were measured comparatively in the study groups. The results showed that naltrexone reduced hyperphosphorylated tau protein levels by regulating GSK-3beta, PP2A, Akt and Wnt signaling. Also, exposure to naltrexone decreased oxidative stress parameters. Based on these results, naltrexone shows promise as a potential therapy for AD, subject to additional clinical assessments.
