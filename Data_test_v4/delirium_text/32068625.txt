32068625|t|Using Evidence to Create a Toolkit to Enable Sleep Among Hospitalized Patients.
32068625|a|Studies show sleep deprivation impacts patients' ability to perform physical activities and can lead to delirium, depression, and other psychiatric impairments. One of the Choosing Wisely  recommendations is "Do not wake the patient for routine care unless the patient's condition requires it." The authors discuss the development of an evidence-based toolkit to facilitate opportunities for patients to sleep during hospitalization, exemplifying the translation of a Choosing Wisely recommendation into clinical practice.
