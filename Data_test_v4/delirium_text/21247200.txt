21247200|t|Inhibition mechanism of rat alpha3beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor by the Alzheimer therapeutic tacrine.
21247200|a|Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) were studied in detail in the past regarding their interaction with therapeutic and drug addiction related compounds. Using fast kinetic whole-cell recording, we have now studied effects of tacrine, an agent used clinically to treat Alzheimer's disease, on currents elicited by activation of rat alpha(3)beta(4) nAChR heterologously expressed in KXalpha3beta4R2 cells. Characterization of receptor activation by nicotine used as agonist revealed a K(d) of 23 +- 0.2 muM and 4.3 +- 1.3 for the channel opening equilibrium constant, Phi(-1). Experiments were performed to investigate whether tacrine is able to activate the alpha(3)beta(4) nAChR. Tacrine did not activate whole-cell currents in KXalpha3beta4R2 cells but inhibited receptor activity at submicromolar concentration. Dose-response curves obtained with increasing agonist or inhibitor concentration revealed competitive inhibition of nAChRs by tacrine, with an apparent inhibition constant, K(I), of 0.8 muM. The increase of Phi(-1) in the presence of tacrine suggests that the drug stabilizes a nonconducting open channel form of the receptor. Binding studies with TCP and MK-801 ruled out tacrine binding to common allosteric sites of the receptor. Our study suggests a novel mechanism for action of tacrine on nAChRs besides inhibition of acetylcholine esterase.
