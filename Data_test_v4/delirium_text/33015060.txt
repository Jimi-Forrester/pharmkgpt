33015060|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that has no effective therapies. Prickle planar cell polarity protein 2 (Prickle2), is an important cytoplasmic regulator of Wnt/PCP signaling. It has been reported that Prickle2 deficiency reduced neurite outgrowth levels in mouse N2a cells and led to autism-like behaviors and hippocampal synaptic dysfunction in mice. However, much less is known about the relationship of Prickle2 to AD pathogenesis. RT-qPCR, Western blot and IHC results showed that the mRNA and protein levels of Prickle2 were reduced in APP/PS1/Tau transgenic (3xTg) mice. Intravenous injection of Prickle2-overexpressing AAV-PHP.eB vectors improved the cognitive deficits in 3xTg mice. We also demonstrated that Prickle2 could repress oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, ameliorate the amyloid beta (Abeta) plaque pathology and reduce Tau hyperphosphorylation in APP/PS1 mice. Further investigation of the mechanism of Prickle2 in AD revealed that Prickle2 inhibited Wnt/PCP/JNK pathway in vivo and in vitro. Our results suggest that Prickle2 might be a potential candidate for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.
