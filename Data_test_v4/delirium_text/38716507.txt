38716507|a|Behavioral changes or neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) are common features in dementia and are associated with accelerated cognitive impairment and earlier deaths. However, how NPSs are intertwined with cognitive decline remains elusive. In this study, we identify that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is associated with mood disorders and memory decline in the AD course. During the process from pre- to post-onset in AD, the dysfunction of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons and pyramidal neurons in the amygdala leads to hyperactivity of pyramidal neurons in the basal state and insensitivity to external stimuli. We further demonstrate that serotonin (5-HT) receptors in distinct neurons synergistically regulate the BLA microcircuit of AD rather than 5-HT levels, in which both restrained inhibitory inputs by excessive 5-HT1AR signaling in PV interneurons and depolarized pyramidal neurons via upregulated 5-HT2AR contribute to aberrant neuronal hyperactivity. Downregulation of these two 5-HT receptors simultaneously enables neurons to resist beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) neurotoxicity and ameliorates the mood and cognitive defects. Therefore, our study reveals a crucial role of 5-HT receptors for regulating neuronal homeostasis in AD pathogenesis, and this would provide early intervention and potential targets for AD cognitive decline.
