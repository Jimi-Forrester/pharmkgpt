32161208|t|Application of Aortic Balloon Occlusion in Total Aortic Arch Replacement with Frozen Elephant Trunk on Clinical Endpoints for Aortic Dissection Patients.
32161208|a|PURPOSE: Total aortic arch replacement (TAR) with frozen elephant trunk (FET) is the standard operation for treating aortic dissection (AD) patients involving aortic arch with high operative risk due to long circulatory arrest (CA). We used aortic balloon occlusion technique that safely reduced the CA time to 5 min in average and investigated whether it can improve the clinical endpoints. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with AD and underwent TAR with FET operation (123 with aortic balloon occlusion and 221 with conventional method) in Fuwai Hospital during August 2017 and February 2019 was reviewed in this retrospective observational study. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, the 30-day mortality of aortic balloon occlusion group and conventional group was 4.88% and 11.38% (P = 0.062), respectively. In multivariate analysis, aortic balloon occlusion is one of the factors that reduced the risk for renal and hepatic injury, shortened postoperative conscious revival time, and reduced red blood cell (RBC) transfusion during operation. CONCLUSIONS: The aortic balloon occlusion technique, as a perfusion strategy during operation, could alleviate postoperative complication. This method deserves further attention in future clinical practice for its value in treating patients with higher operative risks.
