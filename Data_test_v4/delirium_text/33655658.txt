33655658|t|Single center experience of uniportal VATS anatomical lung resections: Mid-term oncological outcomes.
33655658|a|BACKGROUND: Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) anatomical lung resection has become widely accepted for its favorable outcomes with regard to pain. However, oncological outcomes, especially mid- or long-term outcomes, are still lacking. The objective of this study was to present our eight-year experience of uniportal VATS anatomical lung resection, including mid-term oncological outcomes. METHODS: All consecutive patients undergoing uniportal VATS anatomical lung resection between June 2012 and February 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: We analyzed data of 170 patients (100 male and 70 female), with a median age of 67 years. The median follow-up time was 21 months (range 11-41). The DFS of the entire cohort was 66.3 months. Stage-correlated DFS was 73.1 months for stage I, 42.6 months for stage II, 30.6 months for stage III and 12.5 months for stage IV. The OS of the entire court was 67 months. Stage-correlated OS was 75.6 months for stage I, 50.2 months for stage II, 31.7 months for stage III and 12.5 months for stage IV. CONCLUSIONS: Uniportal VATS anatomical lung resection for lung cancer can be performed with satisfactory mid-term histology- and stage-related outcomes, which is consistent with prior results of traditional VATS or thoracotomy.
