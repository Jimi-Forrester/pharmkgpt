39770924|t|Associations of Coffee and Tea Consumption on Neural Network Connectivity: Unveiling the Role of Genetic Factors in Alzheimer's Disease Risk.
39770924|a|BACKGROUND: Coffee and tea are widely consumed beverages, but their long-term effects on cognitive function and aging remain largely unexplored. Lifestyle interventions, particularly dietary habits, offer promising strategies for enhancing cognitive performance and preventing cognitive decline. METHODS: This study utilized data from the UK Biobank cohort (n = 12,025) to examine the associations between filtered coffee, green tea, and standard tea consumption and neural network functional connectivity across seven resting-state networks. We focused on networks spanning prefrontal and occipital areas that are linked to complex cognitive and behavioral functions. Linear mixed models were used to assess the main effects of coffee and tea consumption, as well as their interactions with Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genetic risk-the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). RESULTS: Higher filtered coffee consumption was associated with increased functional connectivity in several networks, including Motor Execution, Sensorimotor, Fronto-Cingular, and a Prefrontal + 'What' Pathway Network. Similarly, greater green tea intake was associated with enhanced connectivity in the Extrastriate Visual and Primary Visual Networks. In contrast, higher standard tea consumption was linked to reduced connectivity in networks such as Memory Consolidation, Motor Execution, Fronto-Cingular, and the "What" Pathway + Prefrontal Network. The APOE4 genotype and family history of AD influenced the relationship between coffee intake and connectivity in the Memory Consolidation Network. Additionally, the APOE4 genotype modified the association between standard tea consumption and connectivity in the Sensorimotor Network. CONCLUSIONS: The distinct patterns of association between coffee, green tea, and standard tea consumption and resting-state brain activity may provide insights into AD-related brain changes. The APOE4 genotype, in particular, appears to play a significant role in modulating these relationships. These findings enhance our knowledge of how commonly consumed beverages may influence cognitive function and potentially AD risk among older adults.
