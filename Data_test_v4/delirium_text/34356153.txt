34356153|t|Role of Standardized Plant Extracts in Controlling Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome-An Experimental Study.
34356153|a|Patients with alcohol use disorder experience alcohol withdrawal syndrome due to the sudden cessation of alcohol. This study was designed to evaluate the protective effect of Ashwagandha and Brahmi on alcohol withdrawal in rats. Thirty rats of either sex were taken and randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 5). Their normal diet was replaced by a modified liquid diet (MLD). Ethanol was added gradually except in the MLD group for a period of 21 days and withdrawn suddenly. Four treatment groups were administered Ashwagandha (3.75 mg of withanolide glycosides per kg body weight), Brahmi (10 mg of bacosides per kg body weight), Ashwagandha + Brahmi (3.75 mg withanolide glycosides + 10 mg bacosides per kg body weight) orally and diazepam (1 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) 45 min before alcohol withdrawal. Rats were assessed for behavioural changes (agitation score and stereotypic behaviour), anxiety and locomotor activity at 2nd and 6th hours of alcohol withdrawal. Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling seizures were assessed at 6th hour of alcohol withdrawal. Ashwagandha and Brahmi alone and in combination significantly reduced the behavioural changes in alcohol withdrawal rats at 2nd hour and their combination in 6th hour. Ashwagandha and Brahmi suppressed PTZ kindling seizures effectively and improved locomotory activity at 2nd hour and 6th hour of alcohol withdrawal. Reduction in anxiety was significant among Ashwagandha at 2nd hour and the combination group at 2nd and 6th hour. The results were comparable to diazepam. Ashwagandha and Brahmi have beneficial effects in controlling the behavioural changes, anxiety and seizures in alcohol withdrawal symptoms in rats and improved locomotory activity.
