37113150|t|Deciphering mechanisms of action of ACE inhibitors in neurodegeneration using Drosophila models of Alzheimer's disease.
37113150|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no cure. Recently, several studies have reported a significant reduction in the incidence and progression of dementia among some patients receiving antihypertensive medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Why these drugs are beneficial in some AD patients and not others is unclear although it has been shown to be independent of their role in regulating blood pressure. Given the enormous and immediate potential of ACE-Is and ARBs for AD therapeutics it is imperative that we understand how they function. Recently, studies have shown that ACE-Is and ARBs, which target the renin angiotensin system in mammals, are also effective in suppressing neuronal cell death and memory defects in Drosophila models of AD despite the fact that this pathway is not conserved in flies. This suggests that the beneficial effects of these drugs may be mediated by distinct and as yet, identified mechanisms. Here, we discuss how the short lifespan and ease of genetic manipulations available in Drosophila provide us with a unique and unparalleled opportunity to rapidly identify the targets of ACE-Is and ARBs and evaluate their therapeutic effectiveness in robust models of AD.
