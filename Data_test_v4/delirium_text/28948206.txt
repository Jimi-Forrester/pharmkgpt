28948206|a|INTRODUCTION: Plasma amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides have been previously studied as candidate biomarkers to increase recruitment efficiency in secondary prevention clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Free and total Abeta42/40 plasma ratios (FP42/40 and TP42/40, respectively) were determined using ABtest assays in cognitively normal subjects from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Flagship Study. This population was followed-up for 72 months and their cortical Abeta burden was assessed with positron emission tomography. RESULTS: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses showed an inverse association of Abeta42/40 plasma ratios and cortical Abeta burden. Optimized as a screening tool, TP42/40 reached 81% positive predictive value of high cortical Abeta burden, which represents 110% increase over the population prevalence of cortical Abeta positivity. DISCUSSION: These findings support the use of plasma Abeta42/40 ratios as surrogate biomarkers of cortical Abeta deposition and enrichment tools, reducing the number of subjects submitted to invasive tests and, consequently, recruitment costs in clinical trials targeting cognitively normal individuals.
