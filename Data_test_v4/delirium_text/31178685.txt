31178685|t|The Complex Interactions Between Obesity, Metabolism and the Brain.
31178685|a|Obesity is increasing at unprecedented levels globally, and the overall impact of obesity on the various organ systems of the body is only beginning to be fully appreciated. Because of the myriad of direct and indirect effects of obesity causing dysfunction of multiple tissues and organs, it is likely that there will be heterogeneity in the presentation of obesity effects in any given population. Taken together, these realities make it increasingly difficult to understand the complex interplay between obesity effects on different organs, including the brain. The focus of this review is to provide a comprehensive view of metabolic disturbances present in obesity, their direct and indirect effects on the different organ systems of the body, and to discuss the interaction of these effects in the context of brain aging and the development of neurodegenerative diseases.
