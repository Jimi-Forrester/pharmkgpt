37870702|t|Neuropathological and sociodemographic factors associated with the cortical amyloid load in aging and Alzheimer's disease.
37870702|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive abilities. A pathological hallmark of AD is a region-specific accumulation of the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta). Here, we explored the association between regional Abeta deposition, sociodemographic, and local biochemical factors. We quantified the Abeta burden in postmortem cortical samples from parietal (PCx) and temporal (TCx) regions of 27 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 15 AD donors, aged 78-100 + years. Histological images of Abeta immunohistochemistry and local concentrations of pathological and inflammatory proteins were obtained at the "Aging, Dementia and TBI Study" open database. We used the area fraction fractionator stereological methodology to quantify the Abeta burden in the gray and white matter within each cortical region. We found higher Abeta burdens in the TCx of AD octogenarians compared to CU ones. We also found higher Abeta loads in the PCx of AD nonagenarians than in AD octogenarians. Moreover, AD women exhibited increased Abeta deposition compared to CU women. Interestingly, we observed a negative correlation between education years and Abeta burden in the white matter of both cortices in CU samples. In AD brains, the Abeta40, Abeta42, and pTau181 isoforms of Abeta and Tau proteins were positively correlated with the Abeta burden. Additionally, in the TCx of AD donors, the proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha showed a positive correlation with the Abeta load. These novel findings contribute to understanding the interplay between sociodemographic characteristics, local inflammatory signaling, and the development of AD-related pathology in the cerebral cortex.
