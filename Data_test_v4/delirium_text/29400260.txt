29400260|t|Noteworthy Literature published in 2017 for Cardiothoracic Anesthesiologists.
29400260|a|The year 2017 was a year dominated by large-scale clinical studies reporting the outcome of various interventions in cardiac surgery and heart failure (HF) patients, relevant to all cardiothoracic anesthesiologists. Among them were studies investigating the addition of levosimendan, an alternative inotropic agent, to standard management of patients with HF undergoing cardiac surgery. Also, corticosteroids have been used for various purposes in cardiac patients. Here, a new study reports the effect of high-dose methylprednisolone on recovery and delirium. Furthermore, with increasing evidence that transfusions increase morbidity and mortality, a publication reports the use of rotational thromboelastometry to reduce transfusion requirements. In addition, several randomized controlled multicenter studies report the outcomes of patients undergoing cardiac procedures: surgical versus transcatheter aortic valve replacement in intermediate-risk patients and the use of centrifugal-flow versus axial-flow left-ventricular devices in patients with HF. These studies demonstrate the dynamic and ever-evolving state of perioperative cardiovascular medicine and show us the direction of future developments.
