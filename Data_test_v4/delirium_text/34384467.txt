34384467|t|TPEN attenuates amyloid-beta25-35-induced neuronal damage with changes in the electrophysiological properties of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels.
34384467|a|To understand the role of intracellular zinc ion (Zn2+) dysregulation in mediating age-related neurodegenerative changes, particularly neurotoxicity resulting from the generation of excessive neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, this study aimed to investigate whether N, N, N', N'-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN), a Zn2+-specific chelator, could attenuate Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity and the underlying electrophysiological mechanism. We used the 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay to measure the viability of hippocampal neurons and performed single-cell confocal imaging to detect the concentration of Zn2+ in these neurons. Furthermore, we used the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to detect the evoked repetitive action potential (APs), the voltage-gated sodium and potassium (K+) channels of primary hippocampal neurons. The analysis showed that TPEN attenuated Abeta25-35-induced neuronal death, reversed the Abeta25-35-induced increase in intracellular Zn2+ concentration and the frequency of APs, inhibited the increase in the maximum current density of voltage-activated sodium channel currents induced by Abeta25-35, relieved the Abeta25-35-induced decrease in the peak amplitude of transient outward K+ currents (IA) and outward-delayed rectifier K+ currents (IDR) at different membrane potentials, and suppressed the steady-state activation and inactivation curves of IA shifted toward the hyperpolarization direction caused by Abeta25-35. These results suggest that Abeta25-35-induced neuronal damage correlated with Zn2+ dysregulation mediated the electrophysiological changes in the voltage-gated sodium and K+ channels. Moreover, Zn2+-specific chelator-TPEN attenuated Abeta25-35-induced neuronal damage by recovering the intracellular Zn2+ concentration.
