37325640|a|Introduction: Osteopontin (OPN; also known as SPP1), an immunomodulatory cytokine highly expressed in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMPhi), is known to regulate diverse cellular and molecular immune responses. We previously revealed that glatiramer acetate (GA) stimulation of BMMPhi upregulates OPN expression, promoting an anti-inflammatory, pro-healing phenotype, whereas OPN inhibition triggers a pro-inflammatory phenotype. However, the precise role of OPN in macrophage activation state is unknown. Methods: Here, we applied global proteome profiling via mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to gain a mechanistic understanding of OPN suppression versus induction in primary macrophage cultures. We analyzed protein networks and immune-related functional pathways in BMMPhi either with OPN knockout (OPNKO) or GA-mediated OPN induction compared with wild type (WT) macrophages. The most significant differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were validated using immunocytochemistry, western blot, and immunoprecipitation assays. Results and discussion: We identified 631 DEPs in OPNKO or GA-stimulated macrophages as compared to WT macrophages. The two topmost downregulated DEPs in OPNKO macrophages were ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and the anti-inflammatory Heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX-1), whereas GA stimulation upregulated their expression. We found that UCHL1, previously described as a neuron-specific protein, is expressed by BMMPhi and its regulation in macrophages was OPN-dependent. Moreover, UCHL1 interacted with OPN in a protein complex. The effects of GA activation on inducing UCHL1 and anti-inflammatory macrophage profiles were mediated by OPN. Functional pathway analyses revealed two inversely regulated pathways in OPN-deficient macrophages: activated oxidative stress and lysosome-mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (e.g., ROS, Lamp1-2, ATP-synthase subunits, cathepsins, and cytochrome C and B subunits) and inhibited translation and proteolytic pathways (e.g., 60S and 40S ribosomal subunits and UPS proteins). In agreement with the proteome-bioinformatics data, western blot and immunocytochemical analyses revealed that OPN deficiency perturbs protein homeostasis in macrophages-inhibiting translation and protein turnover and inducing apoptosis-whereas OPN induction by GA restores cellular proteostasis. Taken together, OPN is essential for macrophage homeostatic balance via the regulation of protein synthesis, UCHL1-UPS axis, and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic processes, indicating its potential application in immune-based therapies.
