34931538|a|AIMS: Single-shot adductor canal block (ACB) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for postoperative analgesia is a common modality. Patients can experience breakthrough pain when the effect of ACB wears off. Local anaesthetic infusion through an intra-articular catheter (IAC) can help manage breakthrough pain after TKA. We hypothesized that combined ACB with ropivacaine infusion through IAC is associated with better pain relief compared to ACB used alone. METHODS: This study was a prospective double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of combined ACB+ IAC-ropivacaine infusion (study group, n = 68) versus single-shot ACB+ intra-articular normal saline placebo (control group, n = 66) after primary TKA. The primary outcome was assessment of pain, using the visual analogue scale (VAS) recorded at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after surgery. Secondary outcomes included active knee ROM 48 hours after surgery and additional requirement of analgesia for breakthrough pain. RESULTS: The study group (mean visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score of 5.5 (SD 0.889)) experienced significant reduction in pain 12 hours after surgery compared to the control group (mean VAS 6.62 (SD 1.356); mean difference = 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.46 to 0.67; p < 0.001), and pain scores on postoperative day (POD) 1 and POD-2 were lower in the study group compared to the control group (mean difference in VAS pain = 1.04 (-1.39 to -0.68, 95% CI, p < 0.001). Fewer patients in the study group (0 vs 3 in the control group) required additional analgesia for breakthrough pain, but this was not statistically significant. The study group had significantly increased active knee flexion (mean flexion 86.4  (SD 7.22 )), compared to the control group (mean 73.86  (SD 7.88 ), mean difference = 12.54, 95% CI 9.97 to 15.1; p < 0.014). CONCLUSION: Combined ACB+ ropivacaine infusion via IAC is a safe, reproducible analgesic modality after primary TKA, with superior analgesia compared to ACB alone. Further large volume trials are warranted to generate evidence on clinical significance on analgesia after TKA. Cite this article: Bone Jt Open 2021;2(12):1082-1088.
