25177333|a|BACKGROUND: We investigated the demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological characteristics of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) from the Clinical Research Center for Dementia of South Korea (CREDOS)-FTD registry. METHODS: A total of 200 consecutive patients with FTD recruited from 16 neurological clinics in Korea were evaluated by cognitive and functional assessments, a screening test for aphasia, behavioral questionnaires, motor assessments, and brain MRI or PET. RESULTS: In our registry, 78 patients were classified as having been diagnosed with behavioral-variant FTD (bvFTD), 70 with semantic dementia (SD), 33 with progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), and 8 with motor neuron disease plus syndrome (MND-plus). The patients with language variants of dementia were older than those with bvFTD. There were no differences in sex ratio, duration of illness, or level of education among the four subgroups. Overall, the patients with bvFTD showed a significantly better performance in cognitive tests. A higher frequency of motor symptoms and a lower frequency of behavioral symptoms were found in PNFA than in bvFTD and SD. The Global Language Index was significantly lower in SD than in bvFTD and PNFA. The MND-plus group had a poorer performance than all the others in all cognitive domains. CONCLUSION: The neuropsychological, behavioral, motor, and language characteristics of the four subtypes are comparable with those from other series. However, the proportion of SD (37.0%), which was similar to that of bvFTD (41.3%), was higher in our registry than in other series.
