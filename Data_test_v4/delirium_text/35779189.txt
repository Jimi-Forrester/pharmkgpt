35779189|a|INTRODUCTION: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers assessed the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single ascending doses of intravenously administered NX210-a linear peptide derived from subcommissural organ-spondin-and explored the effects on blood/urine biomarkers and cerebral activity. METHODS: Participants in five cohorts (n = 8 each) were randomized to receive a single intravenous dose of NX210 (n = 6 each) (0.4, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) or placebo (n = 2 each); in total, 10 and 29 participants received placebo and NX210, respectively. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetics within 180 min post dosing. Plasma and urine were collected from participants (cohorts: 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) for biomarker analysis and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings within 48 h post dosing. Safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetic data were assessed before ascending to the next dose. RESULTS: The study included 39 participants. All dosages were safe and well tolerated. All treatment-emergent adverse events (n = 17) were of mild severity and resolved spontaneously (except one with unknown outcome). Twelve treatment-emergent adverse events (70.6%) were deemed drug related; seven of those (58.3%) concerned nervous system disorders (dizziness, headache, and somnolence). The pharmacokinetic analysis indicated a short half-life in plasma (6-20 min), high apparent volume of distribution (1870-4120 L), and rapid clearance (7440-16,400 L/h). In plasma, tryptophan and homocysteine showed dose-related increase and decrease, respectively. No drug dose effect was found for the glutamate or glutamine plasma biomarkers. Nevertheless, decreased blood glutamate and increased glutamine were observed in participants treated with NX210 versus placebo. EEG showed a statistically significant decrease in beta and gamma bands and a dose-dependent increasing trend in alpha bands. Pharmacodynamics effects were sustained for several hours (plasma) or 48 h (urine and EEG). CONCLUSION: NX210 is safe and well tolerated and may exert beneficial effects on the central nervous system, particularly in terms of cognitive processing.
