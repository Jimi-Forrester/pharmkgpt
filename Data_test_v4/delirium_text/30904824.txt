30904824|a|BACKGROUND: Although previous studies have suggested that insulin plays a role in brain function, it still remains unclear whether or not insulin has a region-specific association with neuronal and synaptic activity in the living human brain. We investigated the regional pattern of association between basal blood insulin and resting-state cerebral glucose metabolism (CMglu), a proxy for neuronal and synaptic activity, in older adults. METHOD: A total of 234 nondiabetic, cognitively normal (CN) older adults underwent comprehensive clinical assessment, resting-state 18F-fluodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) and blood sampling to determine overnight fasting blood insulin and glucose levels, as well as apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping. RESULTS: An exploratory voxel-wise analysis of FDG-PET without a priori hypothesis demonstrated a positive association between basal blood insulin levels and resting-state CMglu in specific cerebral cortices and hippocampus, rather than in non-specific overall cerebral regions, even after controlling for the effects of APOE e4 carrier status, vascular risk factor score, body mass index, fasting blood glucose, and demographic variables. Particularly, a positive association of basal blood insulin with CMglu in the right posterior hippocampus and adjacent parahippocampal region as well as in the right inferior parietal region remained significant after multiple comparison correction. Conversely, no region showed negative association between basal blood insulin and CMglu. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding suggests that basal fasting blood insulin may have association with neuronal and synaptic activity in specific cerebral regions, particularly in the hippocampal/parahippocampal and inferior parietal regions.
