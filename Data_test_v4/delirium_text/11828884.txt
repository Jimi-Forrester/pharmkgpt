11828884|t|Protein "AGEing"--cytotoxicity of a glycated protein increases with its degree of AGE-modification.
11828884|a|Non-enzymatic glycation of proteins with reducing sugars and subsequent transition metal-catalyzed oxidations leads to the formation of protein-bound "advanced glycation endproducts" (AGEs). They accumulate on long-lived proteins including on and in the vicinity of the beta-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since the AGE modification of a protein increases with time, and such a "long-term incubation" might also occur in the AD brain, we investigated whether an increase in the cytotoxic effects of an AGE-modified model protein occurs over time. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was modified by glucose for defined time periods, and the viability of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, incubated with the differentially AGE-modified BSA samples, was measured with the MTT assay. Cytotoxicity of the AGE-modified BSAs increased in correlation to the incubation time with glucose. Among the AGE-specific markers, browning (OD 400) correlated best with cytotoxicity, followed by AGE-specific fluorescence and the defined AGE, carboxymethyllysine. Since AGEs accumulate in AD over time, they may be one of the "age-related" factors contributing to neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's disease.
