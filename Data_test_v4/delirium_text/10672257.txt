10672257|t|Neurotoxicity and oxidative damage of beta amyloid 1-42 versus beta amyloid 1-40 in the mouse cerebral cortex.
10672257|a|Senile plaques (SP), a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are characterized by extracellular accumulations of beta amyloid (A beta). SP predominantly contain A beta 42 with a small amount of associated A beta 40. We determined the neurotoxic properties of A beta 42 as compared to A beta 40 by injections into the frontal cortex of three month old C57BL/6 mice. A beta 42 was associated with a significantly larger area of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity and a greater density of reactive astrocytes than A beta 40. Immunohistochemical staining for markers of oxidative damage against 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHDG) were significantly more intense around the A beta 42 injection compared to the A beta 40 injection sites. These findings are consistent with previous in vitro studies and suggest that A beta 42 is more neurotoxic and may generate more free radical damage than A beta 40.
