29574296|a|OBJECTIVES: Prescription stimulants are vulnerable to oral and parenteral abuse. Intravenous forms of abuse may be most detrimental due to an enhanced risk of dependence, overdose, and infectious diseases. Our objective was to discover an orally active prodrug of a stimulant that would not be easily converted to its parent when injected, thus hindering intravenous abuse. METHODS: Following an initial analysis of stimulant structures, the fencamfamine isomer [(-)-FCF; (N-ethyl-3-phenylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-amine)] was chosen as a parent drug due to its favorable biochemical properties. Subsequently, PRX-P4-003 {(-)-N-(Octadecanoyloxymethoxycarbonyl)-N-ethyl-3-phenylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-amine} qualified for further development. Experimental testing of PRX-P4-003 included radioligand binding assays, stability studies, and rodent pharmacokinetic and locomotor assays. RESULTS: Prodrug PRX-P4-003 is a pharmacologically inactive, hydrophobic compound, whereas its parent (-)-FCF is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor with weaker effects on norepinephrine reuptake (Ki = 0.07 and 0.80 muM, respectively). PRX-P4-003 is metabolized to (-)-FCF in simulated intestinal fluid (with pancreatin) but not in simulated gastric fluid (with pepsin). Finally, PRX-P4-003 shows a significant oral but no intravenous increase in locomotion, correlating with its pharmacokinetics by these different routes of administration. CONCLUSIONS: PRX-P4-003 is a novel prodrug stimulant enzymatically activated in the gut. Our data suggest a pancreatic, lipase-based mechanism of activation and as only 1% of this enzyme is found in the systemic circulation, PRX-P4-003 is unlikely to be bioactive if injected intravenously. Enzymatic release of (-)-FCF is needed prior to its systemic absorption, which may discourage oral abuse (e.g., by chewing). PRX-P4-003 is being developed for apathy in Alzheimer's disease and binge eating disorder.
