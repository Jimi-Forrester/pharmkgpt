39697969|t|Dysarthria and Altered Mental Status Following Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) in a Patient With Polycythemia Vera: A Case Report.
39697969|a|Although rare, neurological complications following electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can have significant consequences. Recognizing patient populations that may be at high risk of neurological complications following ECT can reduce the likelihood of these patients developing such complications. We report a case of a patient with a history of polycythemia vera presenting with a worsening episode of depression with psychotic features who demonstrated a significant change in neurological status following ECT, suspected to be due to cerebral ischemia. This case report highlights the risk factors for cerebral ischemia in patients with polycythemia vera while undergoing ECT and provides important clues that may assist in distinguishing neuropsychiatric disturbances associated with polycythemia vera from the complications of a primary psychiatric illness.
