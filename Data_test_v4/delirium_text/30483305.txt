30483305|t|A Longitudinal Study of Peripheral and Central Auditory Function in Alzheimer's Disease and in Mild Cognitive Impairment.
30483305|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: Central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) might precede the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A method of evaluating CAPD is the dichotic digits test (DDT). The aim was to address this in a longitudinal setting. METHODS: A total of 136 individuals were assessed with peripheral and central hearing tests at baseline and at 5-year follow-up. RESULTS: Subjects with AD showed a significant decline in DDT scores of the right ear from baseline to follow-up. The other groups retained high DDT scores. Peripheral auditory function declined as expected according to age. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that DDT performance reflects an ongoing process resulting in dementia.
