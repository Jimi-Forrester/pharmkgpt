36831713|t|Frequency and Correlates of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Myasthenia Gravis.
36831713|a|BACKGROUND: Antibodies against acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) can also target nicotinic AChRs that are present throughout the central nervous system, thus leading to cognitive dysfunctions in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). However, the presence of cognitive impairment in MG is controversial, and the factors that may influence this risk are almost completely unknown. In this study, the frequency of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in MG, as well as the clinical, immunological, and behavioral correlates of MCI in MG were evaluated. METHODS: A total of 52 patients with MG underwent a comprehensive assessment including motor and functional scales, serological testing, and neuropsychological and behavioral evaluation. RESULTS: The frequency of MCI was 53.8%, and the most impaired cognitive domains were, in order, visuoconstructive/visuospatial skills, memory, and attention. After multivariate analysis, only pyridostigmine use was inversely associated with the presence of MCI, while a trend toward a positive association between MCI and disease severity and arms/legs hyposthenia was found. Correlation analyses showed that daily doses of prednisone and azathioprine significantly correlated with depressive symptomatology, while disease severity significantly correlated with depressive symptomatology and sleep disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of MCI is rather frequent in MG and is characterized by multidomain amnestic impairment. Such preliminary data need further confirmation on larger case series.
