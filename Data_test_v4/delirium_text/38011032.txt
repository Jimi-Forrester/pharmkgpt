38011032|t|Efficacy and Safety of Risperidone in Patients With Delirium: The RIDDLE Pilot Study.
38011032|a|BACKGROUND: The cornerstone treatment of delirium is to assess and treat its underlying causes and prevent further complications. Drug therapy may be necessary to control agitation and behavioral symptoms associated with delirium. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of a randomized placebo controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risperidone in the treatment of delirium. METHODS: This was a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial. Patients were enrolled in the study if they were hospitalized and 65 years or older and had a diagnosis of delirium. Delirium Rating Scale revised 98 was used to determine delirium and motor agitation. RESULTS: A total of 14 participants with 57% being men and having a mean age of 86 years were included. There were no statistically significant differences between the risperidone and placebo group for the Delirium Rating Scale revised 98 score. There were no severe adverse reactions reported in the study, and no patients discontinued the study for adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone at low doses (1 mg daily or less) was well tolerated for the treatment of delirium. Future large-scale trials are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of delirium. This pilot study taught us that the phase 2 RIsperDone DELirium trial will need a multicenter design with more research personnel to increase the number of participants enrolled.
