35732922|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease featured with memory loss and cognitive function impairments. Chronic mitochondrial stress is a vital pathogenic factor for AD and finally leads to massive neuronal death. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. By proteomic analysis, we identified a new mitochondrial protein, cell-cycle exit and neuronal differentiation 1 (CEND1), which was decreased significantly in the brain of 5xFAD mice. CEND1 is a neuronal specific protein and locates in the presynaptic mitochondria. Depletion of CEND1 leads to increased mitochondrial fission mediated by upregulation of dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1), resulting in abnormal mitochondrial functions. CEND1 deficiency leads to cognitive impairments in mice. Overexpression of CEND1 in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice rescued cognitive deficits. Moreover, we identified that CDK5/p25 interacted with and phosphorylated CEND1 which promoted its degradation. Our study provides new mechanistic insights in mitochondrial function regulations by CEND1 in Alzheimer's disease.
