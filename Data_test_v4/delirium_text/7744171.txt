7744171|t|Stability and change in optimism: a study among spouse caregivers.
7744171|a|The extent to which caregivers (N = 30) for spouses with probable Alzheimer's disease show lability in optimism was explored. The relationship between caregivers' level of state optimism and level of affect was examined as well. The caregivers completed a measure of optimism and affect every day for 30 consecutive days. They showed variability in optimism over time, and their state optimism could be differentiated from their affect. In addition, we found individual differences in lead-lag relationships between optimism and affect over time. The results section clearly shows that most individuals did not show lead-lag relationships. These findings are integrated into the literature on caregiving.
