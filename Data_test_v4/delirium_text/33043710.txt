33043710|a|Plaques formed by abnormal accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) lead to onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pharmacological treatments do not reduce Abeta aggregation neither restore learning and memory. Noninvasive techniques have emerged as an alternative to treat AD, such as stimulation with electromagnetic fields (EMF) that decrease Abeta deposition and reverses cognitive impairment in AD mice, even though some studies showed side effects on parallel magnetic fields stimulation. As a new approach of magnetic field (MF) stimulation, vortex magnetic fields (VMF) have been tested inducing a random movement of charged biomolecules in cells, promoting cell viability and apparently safer than parallel magnetic fields. In this study we demonstrate the effect of VMF on Abeta aggregation. The experimental strategy includes, i) design and construction of a coil capable to induce VMF, ii) evaluation of VMF stimulation on Abeta peptide induced-fibrils-formation, iii) evaluation of VMF stimulation on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line in the presence of Abeta peptide. We demonstrated for the first time that Abeta aggregation exposed to VMF during 24 h decreased ~ 86% of Abeta fibril formation compared to control. Likewise, VMF stimulation reduced Abeta fibrils-cytotoxicity and increase SH-SY5Y cell viability. These data establish the basis for future investigation that involve VMF as inhibitor of Abeta-pathology and indicate the therapeutic potential of VMF for AD treatment.
