38939361|t|Eg5 and Diseases: From the Well-Known Role in Cancer to the Less-Known Activity in Noncancerous Pathological Conditions.
38939361|a|Eg5 is a protein encoded by KIF11 gene and is primarily involved in correct mitotic cell division. It is also involved in nonmitotic processes such as polypeptide synthesis, protein transport, and angiogenesis. The scientific literature sheds light on the ubiquitous functions of KIF11 and its involvement in the onset and progression of different pathologies. This review focuses attention on two main points: (1) the correlation between Eg5 and cancer and (2) the involvement of Eg5 in noncancerous conditions. Regarding the first point, several tumors revealed an overexpression of this kinesin, thus pushing to look for new Eg5 inhibitors for clinical practice. In addition, the evaluation of Eg5 expression represents a crucial step, as its overexpression could predict a poor prognosis for cancer patients. Referring to the second point, in specific pathological conditions, the reduced activity of Eg5 can be one of the causes of pathological onset. This is the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which Abeta and Tau work as Eg5 inhibitors, or in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), in which Tat-mediated Eg5 determines the loss of CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Reduced Eg5 activity, due to mutations of KIF11 gene, is also responsible for pathological conditions such as microcephaly with or without chorioretinopathy, lymphedema, or intellectual disability (MCLRI) and familial exudative vitreous retinopathy (FEVR). In conclusion, this review highlights the double impact that overexpression or loss of function of Eg5 could have in the onset and progression of different pathological situations. This emphasizes, on one hand, a possible role of Eg5 as a potential biomarker and new target in cancer and, on the other hand, the promotion of Eg5 expression/activity as a new therapeutic strategy in different noncancerous diseases.
