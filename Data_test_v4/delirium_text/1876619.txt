1876619|a|The recognition, management, and treatment of fatigue and depression in the patient in the intensive care unit has been presented in a framework to allow consideration of intrapsychic, interpersonal, environmental, and disease factors that can be altered by various means. It is rare that fatigue so seriously complicates the primary illness as to be life threatening itself. Depression and delirium are associated with increased morbidity and mortality on their own; therefore, prompt attention to major depressive disorders and organic effective disorders is necessary. Through it all, attention to the person who has the disease with fatigue, depression, or both is essential.
