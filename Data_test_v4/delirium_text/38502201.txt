38502201|t|Sandwich-type aptamer-based biosensors for thrombin detection.
38502201|a|Thrombin, a proteolytic enzyme, plays an essential role in catalyzing many blood clotting reactions. Thrombin can act as a marker for some blood-related diseases, such as leukemia, thrombosis, Alzheimer's disease and liver disease. Therefore, its diagnosis is of great importance in the fields of biological and medical research. Biosensors containing sandwich-type structures have attracted much consideration owing to their superior features such as reproducible and stable responses with easy improvement in the sensitivity of detection. Sandwich-type platforms can be designed using a pair of receptors that are able to bind to diverse locations of the same target. Herein, we investigate recent advances in the progress and applications of thrombin aptasensors containing a sandwich-type structure, in which two thrombin-binding aptamers (TBAs) identify different parts of the thrombin molecule, leading to the formation of a sandwich structure and ultimately signal detection. We also discuss the pros and cons of these approaches and outline the most logical approach in each section.
