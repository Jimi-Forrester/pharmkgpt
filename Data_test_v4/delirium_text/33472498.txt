33472498|t|An Evaluation of Dementia Dialogues : A Program for Informal and Formal Caregivers in North and South Carolina.
33472498|a|In 2019, the University of South Carolina's Office for the Study of Aging (OSA) remodeled the curriculum for the nationally registered Dementia Dialogues  program that delivers high-quality education to formal and informal caregivers of persons who exhibit signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). This study evaluated new knowledge acquired and program satisfaction by North and South Carolina program participants (N = 235) after completing updated modules. Pre/post module survey data were analyzed using means and percentiles, McNemar's test, and paired t tests. Results demonstrated significant positive increases in caregiver knowledge attainment, with differences in overall knowledge change in specific modules among caregivers and noncaregivers (p < .0001-<.05). Dementia Dialogues  may serve as a useful tool in providing important information that increases caregiver knowledge of persons living with ADRD. Further research is recommended to examine how knowledge improvement translates into caregiving practices.
