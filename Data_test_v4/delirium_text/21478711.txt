21478711|t|Promoting safety in the cardiac intensive care unit: the role of the geriatric resource nurse in early identification of patient risk for falls and delirium.
21478711|a|Patient safety is an overarching theme inherent in hospital care. The aging of the population increases the potential for serious consequences from a lapse in safety.
