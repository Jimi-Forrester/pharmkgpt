36231041|t|[18F]NOS PET Brain Imaging Suggests Elevated Neuroinflammation in Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease.
36231041|a|Neuroinflammation is implicated as a key pathologic mechanism in many neurodegenerative diseases and is thought to be mediated in large part by microglia, native phagocytic immune cells of the CNS. Abnormal aggregation of the protein alpha-synuclein after phagocytosis by microglia is one possible neuropathophysiological mechanism driving Parkinson's disease (PD). We conducted a human pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of targeting the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase using the [18F]NOS radiotracer to measure neuroinflammation in idiopathic PD. Ten adults consisting of 6 PD patients and 4 healthy controls (HC) underwent one hour of dynamic [18F]NOS positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging with arterial blood sampling. We observed increased [18F]NOS whole brain distribution volume (VT) in PD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls (p < 0.008) via a 1-tissue compartment (TC) model. The rate constant K1 for transport from blood into tissue did not differ between groups (p = 0.72). These findings suggest elevated oxidative stress, a surrogate marker of inflammation, is present in early-stage idiopathic PD and indicate that [18F]NOS PET imaging is a promising, non-invasive method to measure neuroinflammation.
