38927092|a|Reactive oxygen species (ROSs) are byproducts of normal cellular metabolism and play pivotal roles in various physiological processes. Disruptions in the balance between ROS levels and the body's antioxidant defenses can lead to the development of numerous diseases. Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), a key component of the body's antioxidant system, is an oxidoreductase enzyme. GPX3 mitigates oxidative damage by catalyzing the conversion of hydrogen peroxide into water. Beyond its antioxidant function, GPX3 is vital in regulating metabolism, modulating cell growth, inducing apoptosis and facilitating signal transduction. It also serves as a significant tumor suppressor in various cancers. Recent studies have revealed aberrant expression of GPX3 in several non-neoplastic diseases, associating it with multiple pathological processes. This review synthesizes the current understanding of GPX3 expression and regulation, highlighting its extensive roles in noncancerous diseases. Additionally, this paper evaluates the potential of GPX3 as a diagnostic biomarker and explores emerging therapeutic strategies targeting this enzyme, offering potential avenues for future clinical treatment of non-neoplastic conditions.
