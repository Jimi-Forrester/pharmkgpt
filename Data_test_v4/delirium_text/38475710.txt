38475710|t|GDF-15: a novel biomarker of heart failure predicts short-term and long-term heart-failure rehospitalization and short-term mortality in patients with acute heart failure syndrome.
38475710|a|BACKGROUND: Acute heart failure (AHF) is a potentially life-threatening clinical syndrome, usually requiring hospital admission. Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF-15) is a distant member of the transforming growth factor-beta. The increased expression of GDF-15 has been observed during heart failure (HF) and is associated with worse outcomes. However, the relationship between GDF-15 and AHF is not well understood with limited evidence among Thai patients. PURPOSE: Investigate the correlation between biomarker levels (measured upon admission and discharge) and short- and long-term adverse outcomes, encompassing all-cause mortality and heart-failure (HF) rehospitalization (at 30, 90, and 180 days, as well as throughout the entire follow-up duration) in individuals experiencing acute HF. METHODS: This is a prospective single-center investigation involving patients admitted for AHF. Biomarkers, including GDF-15, high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT), and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), were assessed upon admission and discharge. Outcomes, including all-cause mortality and HF rehospitalization, were examined. Logarithmic transformations were applied to the biomarker variables for subsequent analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses of cause-specific hazards were conducted using the Cox proportional hazards regression model, while subdistribution hazards were assessed using the Fine-Gray regression model to evaluate outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients were enrolled (mean age of 69 years, 52% females). The GDF-15 level significantly decreased during admission (median at the time of admission 6,346 pg/mL, median at the time of discharge 5,711 pg/mL; p < 0.01). All-cause mortality at 30 days and 180 days were 6.0% and 16.7%, respectively. HF rehospitalization at 30 days and 180 days were 15.5% and 28.6%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that total orthoedema congestion score (p = 0.02) and admission GDF-15 level (p = 0.01) were associated with 30-day all-cause mortality, whereas hsTnT or NT-proBNP levels did not show significant associations. However, higher levels of NT-proBNP upon admission were associated with all-cause mortality when considering the entire follow-up period (p < 0.01). Both univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that lower discharge GDF-15 levels and a greater reduction in GDF-15 levels from admission to discharge were associated with a lower risk of 30-day rehospitalization. Similarly, univariate analysis revealed that a greater reduction in NT-proBNP levels from admission to discharge was associated with lower 30-day rehospitalization rates. At 180 days, a greater reduction in GDF-15 levels remained associated with lower hazards and incidence of rehospitalization. CONCLUSION: The significant decrease in Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF-15) levels during hospitalization suggests its potential as a dynamic marker reflecting the course of AHF. Importantly, higher GDF-15 levels at admission were associated with an increased risk of 30-day all-cause mortality, highlighting its prognostic value in this patient population. Moreover, lower discharge GDF-15 levels, reductions in GDF-15 from admission to discharge, and decreases in NT-proBNP from admission to discharge were associated with a reduced risk of 30-day rehospitalization.
