39217079|a|Agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AAD) is a troubling condition experienced by many of the 6.9 million people living with Alzheimer's disease in the United States. The Gerontological Society of America (GSA) initially published an evidence-based care pathway to treat this condition, Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: A Decision Tree for Healthcare Providers, in 2022 and updated this resource in 2023 with the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) consensus definition of agitation. A new, research-informed screening tool launched in November 2023, the Agitation in Alzheimer's Screener for Caregivers (AASCTM), supports care teams in identifying individuals with AAD who can benefit from the evidence-based care outlined in the decision tree. This column features an interview with interprofessional dementia care experts from Emory Integrated Memory Care who share their insights into AAD, the significance of the condition, and how care teams can use the AASCTM and other strategies to detect AAD. By detecting AAD and implementing person-centered care to address the condition, care teams can improve quality of life for the individual with the condition and their caregiver.
