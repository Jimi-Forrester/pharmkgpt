26439379|a|BACKGROUND: The social or familial factors influencing the location chosen for end-of-life (EOL) care for terminally ill breast cancer patients are unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 195 patients with recurrent or progressive breast cancer who received anticancer treatment at the National Cancer Center Hospital between January 2008 and May 2012. Detailed data concerning the patients' demographic, familial, and clinical characteristics were collected, and multivariate and Cox logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of these characteristics on the place of EOL care and on survival, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients (34.9 %) died in a hospital, 26 patients (13.3 %) at home, and 101 patients (51.8 %) in hospice. Most of the patients having caregivers received EOL care at palliative care facilities (hospice or home) [odds ratio (OR) 2.57; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1-6.6; p = 0.05]. In contrast, patients with factors suggesting a clinically severe status (performance status >=2, use of opioids, delirium, and ascites) more often received EOL care in a hospital. Among patients who received EOL care at hospice or home, patients with minor children received EOL care at home (OR 0.08; 95 % CI 0.02-0.38; p = 0.001). Patients with brain metastases chose hospice (OR 12.37; 95 % CI 2.25-68.13; p = 0.004). Furthermore, having a caregiver was associated with prolonged survival (hazard ratio 0.62; 95 % CI 0.39-0.97; p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Familial factors such as having children and caregivers significantly influenced the place of EOL care for terminally ill breast cancer patients.
