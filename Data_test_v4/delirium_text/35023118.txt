The researches were identified in three electronic databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science) and were examined in accordance with the examined population, the draft of the research, the kinds of intervention, and the assessment tools which were used.Results - Conclusions: The majority of researches seem to converge to the aspect that the physical activity offers considerable benefits to the people suffering from the Alzheimer's disease or any other kind of dementia.
