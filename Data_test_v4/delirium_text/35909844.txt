35909844|t|IoMT-Based Mitochondrial and Multifactorial Genetic Inheritance Disorder Prediction Using Machine Learning.
35909844|a|A genetic disorder is a serious disease that affects a large number of individuals around the world. There are various types of genetic illnesses, however, we focus on mitochondrial and multifactorial genetic disorders for prediction. Genetic illness is caused by a number of factors, including a defective maternal or paternal gene, excessive abortions, a lack of blood cells, and low white blood cell count. For premature or teenage life development, early detection of genetic diseases is crucial. Although it is difficult to forecast genetic disorders ahead of time, this prediction is very critical since a person's life progress depends on it. Machine learning algorithms are used to diagnose genetic disorders with high accuracy utilizing datasets collected and constructed from a large number of patient medical reports. A lot of studies have been conducted recently employing genome sequencing for illness detection, but fewer studies have been presented using patient medical history. The accuracy of existing studies that use a patient's history is restricted. The internet of medical things (IoMT) based proposed model for genetic disease prediction in this article uses two separate machine learning algorithms: support vector machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Experimental results show that SVM has outperformed the KNN and existing prediction methods in terms of accuracy. SVM achieved an accuracy of 94.99% and 86.6% for training and testing, respectively.
