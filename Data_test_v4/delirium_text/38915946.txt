38915946|a|Sevoflurane is one of the most commonly used volatile anesthetics in clinical practice and is often used in pediatric anesthesia and intraoperative maintenance. Microglia exist in the central nervous system and are innate immune cells in the central nervous system. Under external stimulation, microglia are divided into two phenotypes: proinflammatory (M1 type) and anti-inflammatory (M2 type), maintaining the stability of the central nervous system through induction, housekeeping, and defense functions. Sevoflurane can activate microglia, increase the expression of inflammatory factors through various inflammatory signaling pathways, release inflammatory mediators to cause oxidative stress, damage nerve tissues, and eventually develop into neurodegenerative diseases. In this article, the relationship between sevoflurane anesthesia and microglia inflammation expression and the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases is reviewed as follows.
