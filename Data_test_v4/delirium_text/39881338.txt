39881338|a|Many diseases and disorders of the nervous system suffer from a lack of adequate therapeutics to halt or slow disease progression, and to this day, no cure exists for any of the fatal neurodegenerative diseases. In part this is due to the incredible diversity of cell types that comprise the brain, knowledge gaps in understanding basic mechanisms of disease, as well as a lack of reliable strategies for delivering new therapeutic modalities to affected areas. With the advent of single cell genomics, it is now possible to interrogate the molecular characteristics of diverse cell populations and their alterations in diseased states. More recently, much attention has been devoted to cell populations that have historically been difficult to profile with bulk single cell technologies. In particular, cell types that comprise the cerebrovasculature have become increasingly better characterized in normal and neurodegenerative disease contexts. In this review, we describe the current understanding of cerebrovasculature structure, function, and cell type diversity and its role in the mechanisms underlying various neurodegenerative diseases. We focus on human and mouse cerebrovasculature studies and discuss both origins and consequences of cerebrovascular dysfunction, emphasizing known cell type-specific vulnerabilities in neuronal and cerebrovascular cell populations. Lastly, we highlight how novel insights into cerebrovascular biology have impacted the development of modern therapeutic approaches and discuss outstanding questions in the field.
