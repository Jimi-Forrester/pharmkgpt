31410046|a|Western populations harbor a chronic inflammation pattern that lacks organ cardinal signs (edema, increased temperature, pain, and impaired function), releases increased levels of C-reactive protein, and often runs a creeping clinical course with generalized debilitating disease superimposed on system-specific involvement, mostly including nervous tissue (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's syndromes), joints (arthritis), and skin (psoriasis). A finalistic interpretation may apply to the consideration of the gut as the source of inflammation. In fact, these kind of local events as well as the remote manifestations named above, could be conditioned by the microbiome, the huge cell population indwelling the gut which is under growing scrutiny. The role of the gut as a barrier organ justifies lingering submucosal inflammation as a patrolling activity to maintain bodily integrity; the microbiome, launching inflammogenic signals in response to abrupt diet changes, confers to gut inflammation a socioeconomic vector calling for hitherto unrecognized multi-disciplinary interventions.
