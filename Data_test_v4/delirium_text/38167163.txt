38167163|a|OBJECTIVE: The study was performed to explore the association between blood lipids and cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: This study included 336 patients with T2DM. Relevant clinical data including total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B were collected, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score were used to assess the cognitive function in patients with T2DM. RESULTS: Serum apolipoprotein A1 levels were significantly increased in T2DM patients with cognitive impairment compared with T2DM patients without cognitive impairment (p = 0.017). Serum apolipoprotein A1 levels were significantly negatively correlated with MoCA score (r = - 0.143, p = 0.009) and MMSE score (r = - 0.132, p = 0.016) in patients with T2DM. In multivariable-adjusted regression model, serum apolipoprotein A1 was independently associated with cognitive impairment in patients with T2DM (OR = 5.201, p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: Serum apolipoprotein A1 is associated with cognitive impairment in patients with T2DM, but not TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, and apolipoprotein B, indicating that increased serum apolipoprotein A1 may be a risk factor of cognitive impairment in patients with T2DM.
