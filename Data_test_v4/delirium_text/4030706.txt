4030706|t|Partial resolution of ranitidine-associated delirium with physostigmine: case report.
4030706|a|A healthy 25-year-old woman experienced probable ranitidine-induced confusion that partially resolved with intravenous physostigmine. The only known prior report of confusion associated with this relatively new agent was in a severely ill 86-year-old woman. Clinicians should be alert for mental status changes with ranitidine and consider a trial of physostigmine when indicated.
