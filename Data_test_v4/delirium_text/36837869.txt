36837869|t|Association of Plasma Lipopolysaccharide-Binding Protein Concentration with Dietary Factors, Gut Microbiota, and Health Status in the Japanese General Adult Population: A Cross-Sectional Study.
36837869|a|The influx of intestinal bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the blood has attracted attention as a cause of diseases. The aim of this study is investigating the associations between the influx of LPS, dietary factors, gut microbiota, and health status in the general adult population. Food/nutrient intake, gut microbiota, health status and plasma LPS-binding protein (LBP; LPS exposure indicator) were measured in 896 residents (58.1% female, mean age 54.7 years) of the rural Iwaki district of Japan, and each correlation was analyzed. As the results, plasma LBP concentration correlated with physical (right/left arms' muscle mass [beta = -0.02, -0.03]), renal (plasma renin activity [beta = 0.27], urine albumin creatinine ratio [beta = 0.50]), adrenal cortical (cortisol [beta = 0.14]), and thyroid function (free thyroxine [beta = 0.05]), iron metabolism (serum iron [beta = -0.14]), and markers of lifestyle-related diseases (all Qs < 0.20). Plasma LBP concentration were mainly negatively correlated with vegetables/their nutrients intake (all betas <= -0.004, Qs < 0.20). Plasma LBP concentration was positively correlated with the proportion of Prevotella (beta = 0.32), Megamonas (beta = 0.56), and Streptococcus (beta = 0.65); and negatively correlated with Roseburia (beta = -0.57) (all Qs < 0.20). Dietary factors correlated with plasma LBP concentration correlated with positively (all betas >= 0.07) or negatively (all betas <= -0.07) the proportion of these bacteria (all Qs < 0.20). Our results suggested that plasma LBP concentration in the Japanese general adult population was associated with various health issues, and that dietary habit was associated with plasma LBP concentration in relation to the intestinal bacteria.
