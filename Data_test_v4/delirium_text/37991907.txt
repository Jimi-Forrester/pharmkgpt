37991907|t|Graph-Based Fusion of Imaging, Genetic and Clinical Data for Degenerative Disease Diagnosis.
37991907|a|Graph learning methods have achieved noteworthy performance in disease diagnosis due to their ability to represent unstructured information such as inter-subject relationships. While it has been shown that imaging, genetic and clinical data are crucial for degenerative disease diagnosis, existing methods rarely consider how best to use their relationships. How best to utilize information from imaging, genetic and clinical data remains a challenging problem. This study proposes a novel graph-based fusion (GBF) approach to meet this challenge. To extract effective imaging-genetic features, we propose an imaging-genetic fusion module which uses an attention mechanism to obtain modality-specific and joint representations within and between imaging and genetic data. Then, considering the effectiveness of clinical information for diagnosing degenerative diseases, we propose a multi-graph fusion module to further fuse imaging-genetic and clinical features, which adopts a learnable graph construction strategy and a graph ensemble method. Experimental results on two benchmarks for degenerative disease diagnosis (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative) demonstrate its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art graph-based methods. Our findings should help guide further development of graph-based models for dealing with imaging, genetic and clinical data.
