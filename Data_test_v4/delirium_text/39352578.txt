39352578|t|Vitamin D and hip protectors in osteosarcopenia: a combined hip fracture preventing approach.
39352578|a|Osteosarcopenia is an emerging clinical condition highly prevalent in the older people. Affected subjects due to their intrinsic skeletal fragility and propensity to falls are at elevated risk of hip fractures which can increase morbidity and mortality. Strategies for attenuating the impact of predisposing factors on hip fractures are not yet well defined and should derive from multidisciplinary care and collaborations. Our aim was to narratively review available data on the preventive role of vitamin D and hip protectors on hip fractures in older patients with sarcopenia. Older subjects are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency and of falls due to several concomitant factors besides osteosarcopenia. Vitamin D protective actions against hip fractures may be mediated by both skeletal (increased mineralization) and extra-skeletal (reduced risk of falls) actions. Hip protectors may act downstream attenuating the effects of falls although their use is still not yet enough widespread due to the suboptimal compliance obtained by traditional hard devices. Concomitant use of vitamin D and hip protectors may represent an effective strategy in the prevention of hip fractures which need to be tested in ad hoc designed clinical trials.
