38051889|t|Lactate: a prospective target for therapeutic intervention in psychiatric disease.
38051889|a|ABSTRACT: Although antipsychotics that act via monoaminergic neurotransmitter modulation have considerable therapeutic effect, they cannot completely relieve clinical symptoms in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. This may be attributed to the limited range of neurotransmitters that are regulated by psychotropic drugs. Recent findings indicate the need for investigation of psychotropic medications that target less-studied neurotransmitters. Among these candidate neurotransmitters, lactate is developing from being a waste metabolite to a glial-neuronal signaling molecule in recent years. Previous studies have suggested that cerebral lactate levels change considerably in numerous psychiatric illnesses; animal experiments have also shown that the supply of exogenous lactate exerts an antidepressant effect. In this review, we have described how medications targeting newer neurotransmitters offer promise in psychiatric diseases; we have also summarized the advances in the use of lactate (and its corresponding signaling pathways) as a signaling molecule. In addition, we have described the alterations in brain lactate levels in depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia and have indicated the challenges that need to be overcome before brain lactate can be used as a therapeutic target in psychopharmacology.
