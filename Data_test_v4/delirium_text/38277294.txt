38277294|t|Communication Regarding the Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion and Cognitive Impairment: A Narrative Literature Review.
38277294|a|Coronary artery disease is a prevalent ischemic disease that results in insufficient blood supply to the heart muscle due to narrowing or occlusion of the coronary arteries. Various reperfusion strategies, including pharmacological thrombolysis and percutaneous coronary intervention, have been developed to enhance blood flow restoration. However, these interventions can lead to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI), which can cause unpredictable complications. Recent research has highlighted a compelling association between MI/RI and cognitive function, revealing pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain altered brain cognition. Manifestations in the brain following MI/RI exhibit pathological features resembling those observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), implying a potential link between MI/RI and the development of AD. The pro-inflammatory state following MI/RI may induce neuroinflammation via systemic inflammation, while impaired cardiac function can result in cerebral under-perfusion. This review delves into the role of extracellular vesicles in transporting deleterious substances from the heart to the brain during conditions of MI/RI, potentially contributing to impaired cognition. Addressing the cognitive consequence of MI/RI, the review also emphasizes potential neuroprotective interventions and pharmacological treatments within the MI/RI model. In conclusion, the review underscores the significant impact of MI/RI on cognitive function, summarizes potential mechanisms of cardio-cerebral communication in the context of MI/RI, and offers ideas and insights for the prevention and treatment of cognitive dysfunction following MI/RI.
