38466466|a|PURPOSE: We investigated the role of lnc_AABR07044470.1 on the occurrence and development of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and neuronal injury by targeting the miR-214-3p/PERM1 axis to find a novel clinical drug target and prediction and treatment of AIS. METHODS: The mouse AIS animal model was used in vivo experiments and hypoxia/reoxygenation cell model in vitro was established. Firstly, infarction volume and pathological changes of mouse hippocampal neurons were detected using HE staining. Secondly, rat primary neuron apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry assay. The numbers of neuron, microglia and astrocytes were detected using immunofluorescence (IF). Furthermore, binding detection was performed by bioinformatics database and double luciferase reporter assay. Lnc_AABR07044470.1 localization was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).Lnc_AABR07044470.1, miR-214-3pand PERM1mRNA expression was performed using RT-qPCR. NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1 and PERM1 protein expression was performed using Western blotting. IL-1beta was detected by ELISA assay. RESULTS: Mouse four-vessel occlusion could easily establish the animal model, and AIS animal model had an obvious time-dependence. HE staining showed that, compared with the sham group, infarction volume and pathological changes of mouse hippocampal neurons were deteriorated in the model group. Furthermore, compared with the sham group, neurons were significantly reduced, while microglia and astrocytes were significantly activated. Moreover, the bioinformatics prediction and detection of double luciferase reporter confirmed the binding site of lnc_AABR07044470.1 to miR-214-3p and miR-214-3p to Perm1. lnc_AABR07044470.1 and PERM1 expression was significantly down-regulated and miR-214-3pexpression was significantly up-regulated in AIS animal model in vivo. At the same time, the expression of inflammasome NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1 and pro-inflammatory factor IL-1beta was significantly up-regulated in vivo and in vitro. The over-expression of lnc_AABR07044470.1 and miR-214-3p inhibitor could inhibit the neuron apoptosis and the expression of inflammasome NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1 and pro-inflammatory factor IL-1beta and up-regulate the expression of PERM1 in vitro. Finally, over-expression of lnc_AABR07044470.1 and miR-214-3p inhibitor transfected cell model was significant in relieving the AIS and neuronal injury. CONCLUSION: Lnc_AABR07044470.1 promotes inflammatory response to neuronal injury via miR-214-3p/PERM1 axis in AIS.
