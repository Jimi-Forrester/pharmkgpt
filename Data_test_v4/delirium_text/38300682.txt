38300682|a|Polypharmacotherapy is an ever-increasing issue with an ageing patient population. Anticholinergic medications make up a large proportion of patient medication but cause significant side effects, contributing to well-documented issues within the older population and in hospital medicine. This review explores the documented impact of anticholinergic burden in older surgical patients on postoperative delirium, infection, length of stay and readmission, urinary retention, ileus and mortality. It also highlights the need for further high-quality research into anticholinergic burden management among older surgical patients to further impact practice and policy in the area.
