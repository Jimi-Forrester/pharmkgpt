38426638|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia and a leading cause of mortality in the elderly population. Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease has traditionally relied on evaluation of clinical symptoms for cognitive impairment with a definitive diagnosis requiring post-mortem demonstration of neuropathology. However, advances in disease pathogenesis have revealed that patients exhibit Alzheimer's disease pathology several decades before the manifestation of clinical symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in the management of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The clinical availability of molecular MRI (mMRI) contrast agents can revolutionize the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In this article, we review advances in nanoparticle contrast agents, also referred to as nanoprobes, for mMRI of Alzheimer's disease.
