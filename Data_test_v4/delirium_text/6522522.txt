6522522|t|[Clinical and cisternographic differential diagnosis between presenile dementia and Hakim syndrome].
6522522|a|The authors compared with regard clinical and the radionuclide cisternography examination 27 patients with Hakim-Syndrome and 11 with Alzheimer-Disease. In all cases, dementia was a stable symptom. Patients with Hakim-Syndrome have an early gait disturbance, ataxia and epileptic seizures. Only in case of patients with Alzheimer-Disease we found aphasia, apraxia and psychotic disorders. 24 hours after the injection radionuclide cisternography showed ventricular retention and absence of parasagital accumulation only in patients with Hakim-Syndrome. Lighter changes (mixed cisternographic pattern) were found in patients with Alzheimer-Disease as well.
