35625622|a|Neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD) and the most frequent, Alzheimer's disease (AD), represent one of the most urgent medical needs worldwide. Despite a significantly developed understanding of disease development and pathology, treatments that stop AD progression are not yet available. The recent approval of sodium oligomannate (GV-971) for AD treatment in China emphasized the potential value of natural products for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Many current clinical studies include the administration of a natural compound as a single and combination treatment. The most prominent mechanisms of action are anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities, thus preserving cellular survival. Here, we review current natural products that are either approved or are in testing for a treatment of neurodegeneration in AD. In addition to the most important compounds of plant origin, we also put special emphasis on compounds from algae, given their neuroprotective activity and their underlying mechanisms of neuroprotection.
