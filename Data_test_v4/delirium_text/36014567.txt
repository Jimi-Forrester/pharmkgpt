36014567|t|Bio-Derived Fluorescent Carbon Dots: Synthesis, Properties and Applications.
36014567|a|The transformation of biowaste into products with added value offers a lucrative role in nation-building. The current work describes the synthesis of highly water-soluble, luminous carbon quantum dots (CQDs) in the size range of 5-10 nm from discarded rice straw. The small spherical CQDs that were formed had outstanding optical and luminescent qualities as well as good photostabilities. By performing quantitative multi-assay tests that included antioxidant activities, in vitro stability and colloidal assay investigations as a function of different CQD concentrations, the biocompatibility of CQDs was evaluated. To clearly visualize the type of surface defects and emissive states in produced CQDs, excitation-dependent fluorescence emission experiments have also been carried out. The "waste-to-wealth" strategy that has been devised is a successful step toward the quick and accurate detection of Cu2+ ion in aqueous conditions. The fluorescence-quenching behavior has specified the concentration dependency of the developed sensor in the range of 50 muM to 10 nM, with detection limit value of 0.31 nM. The main advantage of the current research is that it offers a more environmentally friendly, economically viable and scaled-up synthesis of toxicologically screened CQDs for the quick fluorescence detection of Cu2+ ions and opens up new possibilities in wastewater management.
