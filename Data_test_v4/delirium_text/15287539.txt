15287539|a|A prolonged period of oral surgery is a potential risk factor of postoperative mental disorders although no such report has been published to date. We retrospectively studied perioperative features in 36 patients who underwent prolonged (10 hours or more) of oral surgery. Patients were categorized as pre-delirium (Pre-D) when they manifested 1 or 2 symptoms and delirium (D) when they showed more than 2 symptoms, according to the modified International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition. Of the 36 patients who returned to a normal mental state without drug therapy, 13 were classified as D and 14 were Pre-D. A number of patients had moderate complications preoperatively, and massive hemorrhaging occurred during the operation in some Pre-D and D patients. Age was greater in D (62.0 +/- 9.9 years) than in Pre-D (56.0 +/- 13.8 years) patients. Propofol-based general anesthesia was most commonly employed. The time prior to appearance of pre-delirium was significantly shorter in D (30.0 +/- 16.7 hours) than in Pre-D (55.0 +/- 35.0 hours) group patients. Our results indicate that, in general, patients predisposed to postoperative mental disorders have moderate complications preoperatively, are generally older than 50-years-old, receive propofol-based general anesthesia and/or experience a massive hemorrhage during the operation.
