37873537|a|This study aimed to investigate the effect of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) on tau protein aggregation in neurodegeneration and persistent neuroinflammation after cerebral microinfarcts. A model of diffuse ischemic brain injury was established, and adenovirus was injected stereotactically through the lateral ventricle of mice. The water content of the brain tissue was measured. The co-expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and AQP4 and the aggregation of p-tau and neuronal marker were detected through immunofluorescence double staining. The expression of phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (p-tau, Ser202/Thr205, Thr205, Ser396, Ser404), interleukin(IL)-6, IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, growth associated protein43 (GAP43), GFAP, and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) was detected through Western blot. It was found that the brain water content in the model group was increased and decreased after the AQP4 interference. Compared with the sham group, the expression of GFAP, p-tau, IL-1beta, TNF-a, Iba1, and p-tau was increased in the model group (p < 0.05). Compared with the model group, the expression of p-tau, IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF-a, GFAP, and Iba1 was decreased after AQP4 interference (p < 0.05). It is indicated that AQP4 positively regulates neurodegeneration and persistent neuroinflammation caused by tau protein aggregation after cerebral microinfarcts.
