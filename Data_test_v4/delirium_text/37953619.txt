37953619|t|An Insight into the Protein Aggregation in Alzheimer's Disease and its Inhibition.
37953619|a|Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disease, is a progressive and irreversible disease that has become a global challenge due to its increasing prevalence and absence of available potential therapies. Protein misfolding and aggregation are known to be the root of several protein neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Protein aggregation is a phenomenon where misfolded proteins accumulate and clump together intra-or extracellularly. This accumulation of misfolded amyloid proteins leads to the formation of plaquesin the neuronal cells, also known as amyloid beta plaques. The synthesis of amyloid beta plaques and tau protein aggregation are the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Potential therapeutics must be developed in conjunction with an understanding of the possible root cause involving complex mechanisms. The development of therapeutics that can inhibit protein misfolding and aggregation, involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, could be one of the potential solutions to the disease.
