39853561|t|Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms (BPSD) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD): Development and Treatment.
39853561|a|Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), such as agitation, apathy, and psychosis, are highly prevalent and have a significant impact on patients and their care partners. The neurobiology of BPSD involves a complex interplay of structural brain changes and alterations in the neurotransmitter system. Various genetic and plasma biomarkers have also been studied. Research in BPSD has been limited by heterogeneity in the diagnostic criteria and assessment tools. As such, there have been ongoing efforts to develop a gold-standard assessment tool and diagnostic criteria. Current practice guidelines recommend nonpharmacological therapies as first-line treatments. Pharmacological options are often used when there is an insufficient response to nonpharmacological strategies, but there can be serious adverse effects with existing pharmacological agents. This has resulted in growing efforts to develop novel therapeutics with more favorable tolerability profiles, with some showing promising results. Other biological therapies, such as neurostimulation, have also demonstrated positive results. As our understanding of BPSD evolves, ongoing research efforts in treatment of BPSD are warranted in order to enhance the quality of life for patients and their care partners.
