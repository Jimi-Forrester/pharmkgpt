33255271|t|Cut-off Values of the Respiratory Muscle Power and Peak Cough Flow in Post-Stroke Dysphagia.
33255271|a|Background and objectives: This study aimed to determine the cut-off values of the following three respiratory pressure meters; the voluntary peak cough flow (PCF), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) and maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP); associated with post-stroke dysphagia and assess which of these parameters show good diagnostic properties associated with post-stroke dysphagia. Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database. Records of patients with first-ever diagnosed dysphagia attributable to cerebrovascular disease, who had performed spirometry measurements for the PCF, MIP and MEP. Results: From a total of 237 stroke patients, 163 patients were diagnosed with dysphagia. Those with dysphagia had significantly lower PCF values than those without dysphagia (116.3 +- 75.3 vs. 219.4 +- 91.8 L/min, p < 0.001). In addition, the former group also had lower MIP (30.5 +- 24.7 vs. 41.6 +- 25.7 cmH2O, p = 0.0002) and MEP (41.0 +- 27.9 vs. 62.8 +- 32.3 cmH2O, p < 0.001) values than the latter group. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the PCF cut-off value of 151 L/min (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.81; sensitivity 72%; specificity 78.8%) was associated with post-stroke dysphagia. The optimum MEP and MIP cut-off were 38 cmH2O (AUC 0.70, sensitivity 58%; specificity 77.7%) and 20 cmH2O (AUC 0.65, sensitivity 49%; specificity 84%). PCF showed the highest AUC results. Results from the univariate analysis indicated that PCF values of <=151 L/min increased risk of dysphagia by 9.51-fold (4.96-18.23). Multivariable analysis showed that after controlling of other clinical factor, the PCFs at this cut-off value still showed increased risk of by 4.19 (2.02-83.69) but this was not observed with the MIPs or MEPs. Conclusions: Our study has provided cut-off values that are associated with increased risk of dysphagia. Among the three parameters, PCF showed increased association with post-stroke dysphagia.
