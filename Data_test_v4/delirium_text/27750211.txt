27750211|t|INPP5D rs35349669 polymorphism with late-onset Alzheimer's disease: A replication study and meta-analysis.
27750211|a|Inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase (INPP5D) was reported to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) through modulating the inflammatory process and immune response. A recent genome-wide association study discovered a new locus single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs35349669) of INPP5D which was significantly associated with susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Caucasians. In this study, we investigated the relations between the INPP5D polymorphism rs35349669 and LOAD in Han Chinese population comprising 984 LOAD cases and 1352 healthy controls being matched for age and gender. Our results showed no obvious differences in the genotypic or allelic distributions of rs35349669 polymorphism between LOAD cases and healthy controls (genotype: p = 0.167; allele: p = 0.094). Additionally, when these data were stratified by APOEepsilon4 status, there are still no evident differences in the genotypic or allelic distributions in APOEepsilon4 carriers (p > 0.05). Furthermore, meta-analysis of 81964 individuals confirmed that rs35349669 was significantly associated with the risk for LOAD (OR=1.08, 95%CI=1.06-1.11), but the results remained negative in Chinese subgroup (OR=0.77, 95%CI=0.53-1.13). Overall, the current evidence did not indicate that INPP5D rs35349669 polymorphism play a role in the genetic predisposition to LOAD in Chinese population.
