37815334|t|Selective Deionization of Thin-Layer Samples Using Tandem Carbon Nanotubes-Polymeric Membranes.
37815334|a|Herein, we investigate the selective deionization (i.e., the removal of ions) in thin-layer samples (<100 mum in thickness) using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) covered with an ionophore-based ion-selective membrane (ISM), resulting in a CNT-ISM tandem actuator. The concept of selective deionization is based on a recent discovery by our group ( Anal. Chem. 2022, 94, 21, 7455-7459), where the activation of the CNT-ISM architecture is conceived on a mild potential step that charges the CNTs to ultimately generate the depletion of ions in a thin-layer sample. The role of the ISM is to selectively facilitate the transport of only one ion species to the CNT lattice. To estimate the deionization efficiency of such a process, a potentiometric sensor is placed less than 100 mum away from the CNT-ISM tandem, inside a microfluidic cell. This configuration helped to reveal that the selective uptake of ions increases with the capacitance of the CNTs and that the ISM requires a certain ion-exchanger capacity, but this does not further affect its efficiency. The versatility of the concept is demonstrated by comparing the selective uptake of five different ions (H+, Li+, Na+, K+, and Ca2+), suggesting the possibility to remove any cation from a sample by simply changing the ionophore in the ISM. Furthermore, ISMs based on two ionophores proved to achieve the simultaneous and selective deionization of two ion species using the same actuator. Importantly, the relative uptake between the two ions was found to be governed by the ion-ionophore binding constants, with the most strongly bound ion being favored over other ions. The CNT-ISM actuator concept is expected to contribute to the analytical sensing field in the sense that ionic interferents influencing the analytical signal can selectively be removed from samples to lower traditional limits of detection.
