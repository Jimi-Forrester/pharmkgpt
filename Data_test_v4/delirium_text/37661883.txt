37661883|a|Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone exerting neurosteroid-like properties. Its well-known nuclear hormone receptor, and recently proposed as a mitochondrial transcription factor, vitamin D receptor, acts for its primary functions. The second receptor is an endoplasmic reticulum protein, protein disulfide isomerase A3 (PDIA3), suggested to act as a rapid response. Vitamin D has effects on various systems, particularly through calcium metabolism. Among them, the nervous system has an important place in the context of our subject. Recent studies have shown that vitamin D and its receptors have numerous effects on the nervous system. Neurodegeneration is a long-term process. Throughout a human life span, so is vitamin D deficiency. Our previous studies and others have suggested that the out-come of long-term vitamin D deficiency (hypovitaminosis D or inefficient utilization of vitamin D), may lead neurons to be vulnerable to aging and neurodegeneration. We suggest that keeping vitamin D levels at adequate levels at all stages of life, considering new approaches such as agonists that can activate vitamin D receptors, and utilizing other derivatives produced in the synthesis process with UVB are crucial when considering vitamin D-based intervention studies. Given most aspects of vitamin D, this review outlines how vitamin D and its receptors work and are involved in neurodegeneration, emphasizing Alzheimer's disease.
