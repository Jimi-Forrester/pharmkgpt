35428634|t|Patients' experiences of cognitive impairment following critical illness: a scoping review protocol.
35428634|a|INTRODUCTION: Critical illness and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) can affect patients for months or years following discharge as many suffer from cognitive impairment. Long-term cognitive impairment affects patients' quality of life and ability to adapt to everyday life. Exploring their experiences on how and which cognitive impairments are affecting their everyday lives facilitates planning of relevant research on interventions that may serve to alleviate the burden of post-ICU cognitive impairment. The objective of this scoping review is to map the existing research on patients' experiences of cognitive impairment following critical illness. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The methodology will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines for scoping reviews. The databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Embase will be searched to identify studies appropriate for inclusion. Any peer-reviewed original studies meeting the inclusion criteria and include statements from adult patients about how they experience cognitive impairment following critical illness and ICU admission will be considered. Studies published in English and Scandinavian languages will be included, with no further geographical or cultural limitations. The included studies will be screened by two independent researchers using a standardised data extraction tool and the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool will be used for critical appraisal. The results will be presented in a tabular form, and data will be supported by narrative descriptions or a narrative summary. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Since the scoping review methodology aims at synthetising existing research on patients' experiences of cognitive impairment following critical illness, the scoping review does not require ethical approval. The results will be disseminated though a peer-reviewed publication in a scientific journal.
