39039682|t|An Overview of the Natural Neuroprotective Agents for the Management of Cognitive Impairment Induced by Scopolamine in Zebrafish (Danio rerio).
39039682|a|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by dementia and cognitive decline. AD is essentially associated with the presence of aggregates of the amyloid-beta peptide and the hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau. The available AD therapies can only alleviate the symptoms; therefore, the development of natural treatments that exhibit neuroprotective effects and correct the behavioral impairment is a critical requirement. The present review aims to collect the natural substances that have been evaluated for their neuroprotective profile against AD-like behaviors induced in zebrafish (Danio rerio) by scopolamine. We focused on articles retrieved from the PubMed database via preset searching strings from 2010 to 2023. Our review assembled 21 studies that elucidated the activities of 28 various natural substances, including bioactive compounds, extracts, fractions, commercial compounds, and essential oils. The listed compounds enhanced cognition and showed several mechanisms of action, namely antioxidant potential, acetylcholinesterase's inhibition, and reduction of lipid peroxidation. Additional studies should be achieved to demonstrate their preventive and therapeutic activities in cellular and rodent models. Further clinical trials would be extremely solicited to support more insight into the neuroprotective effects of the most promising drugs in an AD context.
