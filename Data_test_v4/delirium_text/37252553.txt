37252553|t|Psychological Problem Diagnosis and Management in the Geriatric Age Group.
37252553|a|The definition of geriatrics is very complex to explain though it can be written as the treatment and care provided by healthcare and medical systems primarily to more venerable and senior citizens group of the population. The age group considered to be entering the old group is believed to be those who have reached their sixth decade of life. However, most of the global geriatric population doesn't need treatment until their seventh decade. Bodily impairment, both physical and mental, due to various reasons, for example, financial or personal reasons or feeling ignored, is reasonable for clinicians to anticipate caring for a growing proportion of older patients with complicated medical and psychosocial concerns. Complex ethical quandaries could develop as a result of these difficulties and problems. Who should anticipate ethical challenges faced by doctors early during management? We offer practical recommendations for improving communication because ineffective patient-clinician communication might result in moral dilemmas. Physical impairment, hopelessness, and cognitive decline are all more prevalent as people age. Politicians and healthcare providers of nations should step in to search for a measure to reduce the uprising of the condition; otherwise, it will lead to an uprising of the cases in an exponential manner. It is necessary to increase the financial challenges faced by the elderly. In addition, awareness should be increased, as well as programs aimed at enhancing their standard of living.
