32274599|a|Proteinopathies are characterized by aging related accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates. Irreversible covalent modifications of aging proteins may significantly affect the native three dimentional conformation of proteins, alter their function and lead to accumulation of misfolded protein as dysfunctional aggregates. Protein misfolding and accumulation of aberrant proteins are known to be associated with aging-induced proteinopathies such as amyloid ss and tau proteins in Alzheimer's disease, alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and islet amyloid polypeptides in Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Protein oxidation processes such as S-nitrosylation, dityrosine formation and some of the newly elucidated processes such as carbamylation and citrullination recently drew the attention of researchers in the field of Gerontology. Studying over these processes and illuminating their relations between proteinopathies may help to diagnose early and even to treat age related disorders. Therefore, we have chosen to concentrate on aging-induced proteinopathic nature of these novel protein modifications in this review.
