20008648|t|Mild cognitive impairment: ten years later.
20008648|a|In the past 10 years, there has been a virtual explosion in the literature concerning the construct of mild cognitive impairment. The interest in this topic demonstrates the increasing emphasis on the identification of the earliest features of cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer disease and other dementias. Mild cognitive impairment represents the earliest clinical features of these conditions and, hence, has become a focus of clinical, epidemiologic, neuroimaging, biomarker, neuropathological, disease mechanism, and clinical trials research. This review summarizes the progress that has been made while also recognizing the challenges that remain.
