36771160|t|Novel Indane Derivatives with Antioxidant Activity from the Roots of Anisodus tanguticus.
36771160|a|Four novel indane derivatives, anisotindans A-D (1-4), were isolated from the roots of Anisodus tanguticus. Their structures were established using comprehensive spectroscopic analyses, and their absolute configurations were determined by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Anisotindans C and D (3 and 4) are two unusual indenofuran analogs. ABTS + and DPPH + assays of radical scavenging activity reveal that all compounds (1-4) are active. Specifically, the ABTS + assay results show that anisotindan A (1) exhibits the best antioxidant activity with an IC50 value of 15.62 +- 1.85 muM (vitamin C, IC50 = 22.54 +- 5.18 muM).
