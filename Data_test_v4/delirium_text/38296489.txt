38296489|a|We investigated the effect of gallic acid against neurodegenerative pathophysiology relevant to PD in mice with rotenone-induced toxicity. Forty male ICR mice were randomly divided into four groups: sham-veh, PD-veh (received subcutaneous injection with 2.5 mg/kg/48 h of rotenone); PD-Gal50; and PD-Gal100 (the latter two groups received subcutaneous injection with 2.5 mg/kg/48 h of rotenone and oral gavage with gallic acid 50 and 100 mg/kg/48 h, respectively). All treatments continued for 5 weeks with motor ability assessments once per week using hanging and rotarod tests. Brain tissue evaluation of oxidative status, together with striatal and substantia nigra par compacta (SNc) histological and immunohistological assessments were performed. The results indicate that rotenone significantly induced muscle weakness and motor coordination deficit from the first week of rotenone injection, and a significant increase in neuronal degeneration was presented in both the striatum and SNc. Decreased tyrosine hydroxylase and increment of glia fibrillary acidic protein expression in SNc were depicted. The deteriorating effects of rotenone were ameliorated by gallic acid treatment, especially 100 mg/kg dose. Rotenone did not induce a significant change of lipid peroxidation indicated, but gallic acid exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the lipid peroxidation increment. Rotenone showed a significant reduction of superoxide dismutase activity, and neither 50 nor 100 mg/kg of gallic acid could alleviate this enzyme activity. In conclusion, gallic acid ameliorated motor deficits and preserving SNc neurons which led to maintaining of the dopaminergic source, including a nurturing effect on supporting astrocytes in mice with rotenone-induced neurodegeneration.
