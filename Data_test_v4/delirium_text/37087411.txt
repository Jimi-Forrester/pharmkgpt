We here performed the single-cell transcriptome sequencing from lung, blood, and bone marrow of two dead COVID-19 patients and detected the cellular communication among them. Our results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection increase the frequency of cellular communication between alveolar type I cells (AT1) or alveolar type II cells (AT2) and myeloid cells triggering immune activation and inflammation microenvironment and then induce the disorder of fibroblasts, club, and ciliated cells, which may cause increased pulmonary fibrosis and mucus accumulation. Further study showed that the increase of T cells in the lungs may be mainly recruited by myeloid cells through ligands/receptors (e.g., ANXA1/FPR1, C5AR1/RPS19, and CCL5/CCR1). Interestingly, we also found that certain ligands/receptors (e.g., ANXA1/FPR1, CD74/COPA, CXCLs/CXCRs, ALOX5/ALOX5AP, CCL5/CCR1) are significantly activated and shared among lungs, blood and bone marrow of COVID-19 patients, implying that the dysregulation of ligands/receptors may lead to immune cell's activation, migration, and the inflammatory storm in different tissues of COVID-19 patients. Collectively, our study revealed a possible mechanism by which the disorder of cell communication caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection results in the lung inflammatory microenvironment and systemic immune responses across tissues in COVID-19 patients.
