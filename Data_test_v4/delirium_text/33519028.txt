33519028|a|Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease, which has caused a pandemic in 2020. This healthcare crisis has had a significant repercussion on the mental health of people who have had the disease itself, those who have undergone restrictive lockdowns, and healthcare professionals who have been working directly or indirectly in patient care. Although the pathological mechanisms related to neuropsychiatric manifestations in patients with COVID-19 are currently unknown, different methods of action through which the central nervous system could be affected have been proposed, including direct or indirect methods. Among them, inflammatory activation through what is known as a "cytokine storm," which is present in both COVID-19 and some mental disorders, seems to play a fundamental role. We also analyze the effects the pandemic has had on the general population, which has had to be remain in lockdown, as well as on healthcare professionals who have been working.
