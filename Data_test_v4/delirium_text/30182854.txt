30182854|t|Crosstalk between Gut Microbiota and Central Nervous System: A Focus on Alzheimer's Disease.
30182854|a|The role of diet and gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, has recently come under intense investigation. Studies suggest that human gut microbiota may contribute to the modulation of several neurochemical and neurometabolic pathways, through complex systems that interact and interconnect with the central nervous system. The brain and intestine form a bidirectional communication axis, or vice versa, they form an axis through bi-directional communication between endocrine and complex immune systems, involving neurotransmitters and hormones. Above all, studies suggest that dysbiotic and poorly diversified microbiota may interfere with the synthesis and secretion of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, gammaaminobutyric acid and N-methyl D-Aspartate receptors, widely associated with cognitive decline and dementia. In this context, the present article provides a review of the literature on the role of the gutbrain axis in Alzheimer's disease.
