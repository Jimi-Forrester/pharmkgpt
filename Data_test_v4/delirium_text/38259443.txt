38259443|t|Current understanding of macrophages in intracranial aneurysm: relevant etiological manifestations, signaling modulation and therapeutic strategies.
38259443|a|Macrophages activation and inflammatory response play crucial roles in intracranial aneurysm (IA) formation and progression. The outcome of ruptured IA is considerably poor, and the mechanisms that trigger IA progression and rupture remain to be clarified, thereby developing effective therapy to prevent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) become difficult. Recently, climbing evidences have been expanding our understanding of the macrophages relevant IA pathogenesis, such as immune cells population, inflammatory activation, intra-/inter-cellular signaling transductions and drug administration responses. Crosstalk between macrophages disorder, inflammation and cellular signaling transduction aggravates the devastating consequences of IA. Illustrating the pros and cons mechanisms of macrophages in IA progression are expected to achieve more efficient treatment interventions. In this review, we summarized the current advanced knowledge of macrophages activation, infiltration, polarization and inflammatory responses in IA occurrence and development, as well as the most relevant NF-kappaB, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) regulatory signaling modulation. The understanding of macrophages regulatory mechanisms is important for IA patients' clinical outcomes. Gaining insight into the macrophages regulation potentially contributes to more precise IA interventions and will also greatly facilitate the development of novel medical therapy.
