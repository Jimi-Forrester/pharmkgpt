27693186|a|INTRODUCTION: Individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are at elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. METHODS: With data from the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study, we used the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes classifications to conduct a cross-sectional analysis assessing the relationship between cognitive state and various direct and indirect costs and health care utilization patterns. RESULTS: Patients with aMCI had less medical expenditures than patients with moderate and severe AD dementia (P < .001) and were also significantly less likely to have been hospitalized (P = .04) and admitted to nursing home (P < .001). Compared to individuals with normal cognition, patients with aMCI had significantly less household income (P = .018). DISCUSSION: Patients with aMCI had lower medical expenditures than patients with AD dementia. Poor cognitive status was linearly associated with lower household income, higher medical expenditures, higher likelihood of nursing and home care services, and lower likelihood of outpatient visits.
