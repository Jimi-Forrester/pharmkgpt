33263705|t|Oxidative stress and decreased tissue HSP70 are involved in the genesis of sepsis: HSP70 as a therapeutic target.
33263705|a|Sepsis is a systemic infection that causes multiple organ dysfunction. HSP70 is a protein responsive to cell stress, in particular oxidative stress. Therefore, this literature review sought to investigate the roles of HSP70 and oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of sepsis and the possibility of HSP70 as a therapeutic target. HSP70 exerts a protective effect when located in cells (iHSP70), and its decrease, as well as its increase in the extracellular environment (eHSP70), under oxidative stress is a biomarker of sepsis severity. In addition, therapies that increase iHSP70 and treatment with HSP70 promote sepsis improvement.
