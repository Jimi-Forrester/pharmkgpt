38342181|a|BACKGROUND: The development of efficient therapies for Alzheimer''s disease is essential since it is a serious public health problem. This investigation sought to ascertain any potential synergistic benefits of treating Alzheimer's disease with IRL-1620 monotherapy in addition to Donepezil. Additionally, the effect of IRL-1620 was evaluated using different doses (5 mug/kg,7 mug/kg, and 9 mug/kg). The study further assessed neurobehavioral, biochemical, molecular, and histopathological parameters to evaluate the efficacy of both IRL1620 by its own and in association with Donepezil. Fifty-eight adult male Wistar rats were allocated to eight experimental groups. A dose-ranging study of IRL-1620 was conducted using different doses administered via intravenous injection. Alzheimer's disease was induced by Abeta administration, and treatment arms included disease Control (Sham), Donepezil monotherapy, and combination treatment with IRL-1620 5 mug/kg (Dose selected from the dose-ranging study). The treatment using IRL-1620 (9 mug/kg) intravenously and Donepezil (1 mg/kg orally) both on its own and in addition substantially enhanced memory in comparison with the control group (p < 0.05). Dose of IRL-1620 (9 mug/kg) intravenously, escape latency decreased and the time spent in the target quadrant was considerably increased, and they further benefited from combination therapy. Moreover, IRL-1620 (9 mug/kg) intravenously and combination treatment reduced lipid peroxidation and acetylcholinesterase levels while increasing antioxidant enzyme levels. Immunohistochemistry and molecular analysis revealed enhanced expression of neurotrophic factors with combination treatment. The combination of IRL-1620 and Donepezil showed significant improvements in memory and neurobehavioral parameters (p < 0.05). Alzheimer's disease in male Wistar rats. These results indicate to the probable therapeutic advantages of IRL-1620 and Donepezil in the management of Alzheimer's disease. The combination treatment exhibited enhanced effects compared to monotherapy, highlighting its potential promising therapeutic approach. Additional research is required to understand the mechanisms behind these synergistic benefits and to establish the ideal dosage and duration of therapy for therapeutic applications.
