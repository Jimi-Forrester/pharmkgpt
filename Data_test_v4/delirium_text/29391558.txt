29391558|a|In a previous study, we reported ten new polyoxygenated cyathane diterpenoids, neocyathins A-J, and their anti-neuroinflammatory effects from the liquid culture of the medicinal Basidiomycete Cyathus africanus. In the present study, eight new highly polyoxygenated cyathane diterpenoids, named neocyathins K-R (1-8), were isolated from the solid culture of C. africanus cultivated on cooked rice, together with three known congeners (9-11). The structures and the absolute configurations of the new compounds were elucidated through comprehensive NMR and HRESIMS spectroscopic data, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) data, and chemical conversion. Compounds 1 and 2 represent the first reported naturally occurring compounds with 4,9-seco-cyathane carbon skeleton incorporating an unprecedented medium-sized 9/7 fused ring system, while the 3,4-seco-cyathane derivative (3) was isolated from Cyathus species for the first time. All compounds were evaluated for their neurotrophic and anti-neuroinflammatory activity. All the isolates at 1-25 muM displayed differential nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth-promoting activity in PC-12 cells, while one of the compounds, allocyathin B2 (11), inhibited NO production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglia BV-2 cells. In addition, molecular docking studies showed that compound 11 generated interactions with the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein.
