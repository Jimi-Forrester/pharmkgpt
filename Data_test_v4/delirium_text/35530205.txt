35530205|t|Identification of proteins in housefly (Musca domestica) larvae powder by LC-MS/MS and their potential medical relevance.
35530205|a|Housefly larvae (HL) powder was used to cure wounds centuries ago for its good nutritional and pharmacological values. At present, most of the medical studies are about the crude extracts of HL, while the specific pharmacological material basis is still unclear. We ground third-instar Musca domestica larvae into a powder, degreasing and preparing the protein extract. The protein extract was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis, and the enzymatic hydrolysis products were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We identified a variety of highly trusted proteins (false discovery rate is less than or equal to 1%), including catalysis-related proteins, antioxidant proteins and antimicrobial peptides, which may be closely related to the anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant and other pharmacological effects of HL. We identified the amino acid sequences of these proteins, and further confirmed HL's protective effect on APP/PS1 transgenic Alzheimer's mice. The results of this work provide material basis for further medical research on HL.
