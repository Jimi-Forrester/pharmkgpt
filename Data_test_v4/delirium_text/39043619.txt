39043619|t|(Poly)phenols and brain health - beyond their antioxidant capacity.
39043619|a|(Poly)phenols are a group of naturally occurring phytochemicals present in high amounts in plant food and beverages with various structures and activities. The impact of (poly)phenols on brain function has gained significant attention due to the growing interest in the potential benefits of these dietary bioactive molecules for cognitive health and neuroprotection. This review will therefore summarise the current knowledge related to the impact of (poly)phenols on brain health presenting evidence from both epidemiological and clinical studies. Cellular and molecular mechanisms in relation to the observed effects will also be described, including their impact on the gut microbiota through the modulation of the gut-brain axis. Although (poly)phenols have the potential to modulate the gut-brain axis regulation and influence cognitive function and decline through their interactions with gut microbiota, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, further research, including randomised controlled trials and mechanistic studies, is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and establish causal relationships between (poly)phenol intake and brain health.
