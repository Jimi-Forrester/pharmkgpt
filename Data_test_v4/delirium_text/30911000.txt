30911000|t|Connectivity map identifies luteolin as a treatment option of ischemic stroke by inhibiting MMP9 and activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
30911000|a|This study aimed to explore potential new drugs in the treatment of ischemic stroke by Connectivity Map (CMap) and to determine the role of luteolin on ischemic stroke according to its effects on matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Based on published gene expression data, differentially expressed genes were obtained by microarray analysis. Potential compounds for ischemic stroke therapy were obtained by CMap analysis. Cytoscape and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were used to discover signaling pathways connected to ischemic stroke. Cell apoptosis and viability were, respectively, evaluated by flow cytometry and an MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide) assay. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis were used to test the expression of MMP9 and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway-related proteins in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and tissues. Additionally, the infarct volume after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was determined by a TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) assay. The microarray and CMap analyses identified luteolin as a promising compound for future therapies for ischemic stroke. Cytoscape and GSEA showed that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was crucial in ischemic stroke. Cell experiments revealed that luteolin enhanced cell viability and downregulated apoptosis via inhibiting MMP9 and activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Experiments performed in vivo also demonstrated that luteolin reduced the infarct volume. These results suggest that luteolin has potential in the treatment of ischemic stroke through inhibiting MMP9 and activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
