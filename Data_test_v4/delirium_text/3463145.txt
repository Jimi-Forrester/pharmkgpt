3463145|t|The treatment of delirium tremens and of incomplete alcoholic delirium--a brief history.
3463145|a|Following the introduction of chlormethiazole for the treatment of delirium tremens a striking reduction in the death rate occurred. The mortality range in most statistics is 1-4%. The patient's age and complications concerning various internal organs affect the clinical outcome and so does the time at which chlormethiazole treatment is initiated. However, this has given rise to the habit of prescribing chlormethiazole at the slightest suspicion of the early stages of delirium tremens. In some cases the use of the drug was no doubt unnecessary, but equally certainly this measure has often prevented the development of complete delirium tremens which is now seen far more rarely than it was 20 years ago. The availability of this well-tolerated and easily controllable drug has made the treatment of most cases of delirium tremens a manageable task for any reasonably experienced physician. However, it should never be forgotten that delirium tremens is a life-threatening condition with many potential complications. Therefore, the initiation of any chlormethiazole therapy calls for careful monitoring by the physician.
