23226850|t|Alcohol-dependence syndrome: Postural challenge on heart rate variability.
23226850|a|BACKGROUND: Cardiac autonomic involvement in Alcohol-Dependence Syndrome (ADS) patients has been demonstrated using conventional autonomic tests. Resting heart rate variability (HRV) without normalization has also been reported. AIMS: To evaluate cardiac autonomic changes with postural challenge using HRV in ADS and controls while controlling for confounding factors. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Cross-sectional study involving 27 male subjects with ADS and age-matched healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical assessments included Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry and Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire. Spectral measures of HRV while lying and with active standing were assessed. RESULTS: There was an attenuated response in delta high-frequency (P=0.06) and delta low-frequency (P=0.04) power to standing in ADS subjects compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Patients with ADS appear to have attenuated cardiac vagal and sympathetic responses to standing. HRV with postural challenge may help earlier recognition of autonomic dysfunction in ADS.
