29118109|t|Activation of gamma-Secretase Trimming Activity by Topological Changes of Transmembrane Domain 1 of Presenilin 1.
29118109|a|gamma-Secretase is an intramembrane cleaving protease that is responsible for the generation of amyloid-beta peptides, which are linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Recently, gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) have been shown to specifically decrease production of the aggregation-prone and toxic longer Abeta species, and concomitantly increase the levels of shorter Abeta. We previously found that phenylimidazole-type GSMs bind to presenilin 1 (PS1), the catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase, and allosterically modulate gamma-secretase activity. However, the precise conformational alterations in PS1 remained unclear. Here we mapped the amino acid residues in PS1 that is crucial for the binding and pharmacological actions of E2012, a phenylimidazole-type GSM, using photoaffinity labeling and the substituted cysteine accessibility method. We also demonstrated that a piston-like vertical motion of transmembrane domain (TMD) 1 occurs during modulation of Abeta production. Taking these results together, we propose a model for the molecular mechanism of phenylimidazole-type GSMs, in which the trimming activity of gamma-secretase is modulated by the position of the TMD1 of PS1 in the lipid bilayer.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Reduction of the toxic longer amyloid-beta peptide is one of the therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer disease. A subset of small compounds called gamma-secretase modulators specifically decreases the longer amyloid-beta production, although its mechanistic action remains unclear. Here we found that the modulator compound E2012 targets to the hydrophilic loop 1 of presenilin 1, which is a catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase. Moreover, E2012 triggers the piston movement of the transmembrane domain 1 of presenilin 1, which impacts on the gamma-secretase activity. These results illuminate how gamma-secretase modulators allosterically affect the proteolytic activity, and highlight the importance of the structural dynamics of presenilin 1 in the complexed process of the intramembrane cleavage.
