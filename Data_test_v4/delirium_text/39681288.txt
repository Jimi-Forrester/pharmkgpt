39681288|a|Microorganisms in the gut play a pivotal role in human health, influencing various pathophysiological processes. Certain microorganisms are particularly essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis, reducing inflammation, supporting nervous system function, and regulating metabolic processes. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are a subset of fatty acids produced by the gut microbiota (GM) during the fermentation of indigestible polysaccharides. The interaction between GM and SCFAs is inherently bidirectional: the GM not only shapes SCFAs composition and metabolism but SCFAs also modulate microbiota's diversity, stability, growth, proliferation, and metabolism. Recent research has shown that GM and SCFAs communicate through various pathways, mainly involving mechanisms related to inflammation and immune responses, intestinal barrier function, the gut-brain axis, and metabolic regulation. An imbalance in GM and SCFA homeostasis can lead to the development of several chronic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus, Alzheimer's disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review explores the synergistic interactions between GM and SCFAs, and how these interactions directly or indirectly influence the onset and progression of various diseases through the regulation of the mechanisms mentioned above.
