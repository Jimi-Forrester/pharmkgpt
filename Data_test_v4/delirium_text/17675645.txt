17675645|a|BACKGROUND: Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) has superseded vascular dementia and multi-infarct dementia as the concept to be used in cognitive decline due to cerebrovascular disease. METHOD: The literature was reviewed with regard to the concept of VCI and its incidence, pathophysiological substrate, clinical features and management. RESULTS: A change in the diagnostic paradigm from the current Alzheimer-based definition of vascular dementia to VCI will allow the earlier identification of cases and will identify a different population from that recognized using the current criteria for vascular dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Case identification at the earliest possible stage affords the greatest opportunity for treatment that may slow the rate of progression.
