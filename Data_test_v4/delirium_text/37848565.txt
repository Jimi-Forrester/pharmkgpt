37848565|a|Polypharmacy is a significant concern for older adults. Taking multiple medicines to prevent and treat comorbidities is very common in older adults, potentially leading to polypharmacy. Polypharmacy is associated with the development of geriatric syndromes, including cognitive impairment, delirium, falls, frailty, urinary incontinence, and weight loss. The prevalence of polypharmacy varies according to the literature. There is a paucity of data regarding the prevalence of polypharmacy among older adults. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of polypharmacy among older adults in Ethiopia. A comprehensive search of databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Hinari, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, International Scientific Indexing, Cochrane library and Web of Science, and Google Scholar, was conducted. STATA statistical software (version 17) was used to analyze the data. Forest plot and I2 heterogeneity test were computed to examine the existence of heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were done to explore the source of heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated by using funnel plots and Egger's test. A random effect model was used to determine the pooled prevalence of polypharmacy. After reviewing 123 studies, 13 studies with a total of 3547 older adults fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. The result from 13 studies revealed that the pooled prevalence of polypharmacy among older adults in Ethiopia was 37.10% (95CI: 28.28-45.91). A Subgroup Meta-analysis showed that the heterogeneity level was slightly lower among studies done in Oromia region (I2 = 46.62, P-value = 0.154). Higher pooled polypharmacy prevalence was found among older adults with cardiovascular disorders (42.7%) and admitted patients (51.4%). In general, it was found that the pooled prevalence of polypharmacy among older adults in Ethiopia was high. More than one in three older adults take five or more medications at a time. Thus, intervention focusing on rational geriatric pharmacotherapy is significant to prevent unnecessary pill burden, adverse drug events, medical costs, geriatric morbidity, and mortality. Furthermore, enhancing pharmacist roles towards medication therapy management and safety monitoring in older adults is also indicated.
