38393046|t|Chemical and Pharmacological Prospection of the Ascidian Cystodytes dellechiajei.
38393046|a|Marine invertebrates are a traditional source of natural products with relevant biological properties. Tunicates are soft-bodied, solitary or colonial, sessile organisms that provide compounds unique in their structure and activity. The aim of this work was to investigate the chemical composition of the ascidian Cystodytes dellechiajei, selected on the basis of a positive result in biological screening for ligands of relevant receptors of the innate immune system, including TLR2, TLR4, dectin-1b, and TREM2. Bioassay-guided screening of this tunicate extract yielded two known pyridoacridine alkaloids, shermilamine B (1) and N-deacetylshermilamine B (2), and a family of methyl-branched cerebrosides (3). Compounds 2 and 3 showed selective binding to TREM2 in a dose-dependent manner. N-deacetylshermilamine B (2), together with its acetylated analogue, shermilamine B (1), was also strongly cytotoxic against multiple myeloma cell lines. TREM2 is involved in immunomodulatory processes and neurodegenerative diseases. N-deacetylshermilamine B (2) is the first example of a polycyclic alkaloid to show an affinity for this receptor.
