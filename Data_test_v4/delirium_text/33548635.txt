33548635|t|Amyloid-beta and tau aggregation dual-inhibitors: A synthetic and structure-activity relationship focused review.
33548635|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common types of dementia, especially in elderly, with an increasing number of people suffering from this disease worldwide. There are no available disease-modifying therapies and only four drugs are approved for the relief of symptoms. Currently, the therapeutic approach used for AD treatment is based on single target drugs, which are not capable to stop its progression. To address this issue, multi-target compounds, combining two or more pharmacophores in a single molecular entity, have gained increasing interest to deal with the multiple factors related to AD. The exact cause of AD is not yet completely disclosed, and several hallmarks have been associated to this neurodegenerative disease. Even though, the accumulation of both amyloid-beta plaques (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are fully accepted as the main AD hallmarks, being object of lots of research for early-stage diagnosis and pharmacological therapy. In this context, this review summarizes the state-of-the-art in the field of dual-target inhibitors of both Abeta and tau aggregation simultaneously, including the design and synthetic strategy of the dual-target compounds, as well as a brief structure-activity relationships (SAR) analysis.
