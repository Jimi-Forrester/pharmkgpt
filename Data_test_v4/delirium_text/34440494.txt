34440494|a|The processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a critical event in the formation of amyloid plaques. Platelets contain most of the enzymatic machinery required for APP processing and correlates of intracerebral abnormalities have been demonstrated in platelets of patients with AD. The goal of the present paper was to analyze studies exploring platelet APP metabolism in Alzheimer's disease patients trying to assess potential reliable peripheral biomarkers, to offer new therapeutic solutions and to understand the pathophysiology of the AD. According to the PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic review through the PubMed database up to June 2020 with the search terms: "((((((APP) OR Amyloid Precursor Protein) OR AbetaPP) OR Beta Amyloid) OR Amyloid Beta) OR APP-processing) AND platelet". Thirty-two studies were included in this systematic review. The papers included are analytic observational studies, namely twenty-nine cross sectional studies and three longitudinal studies, specifically prospective cohort study. The studies converge in an almost unitary way in affirming that subjects with AD show changes in APP processing compared to healthy age-matched controls. However, the problem of the specificity and sensitivity of these biomarkers is still at issue and would deserve to be deepened in future studies.
