24365321|a|Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly used agents in clinical practice. They are employed as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic agents for a wide spectrum of clinical conditions. Their anti-inflammatory properties are primarily due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. In this paper we review the neurological effects associated with the use of NSAIDs. Acute CNS toxicity related to NSAID use is pervasive and varied. A prospective study looking at ibuprofen overdose noted that 30% of patients experience CNS effects ranging from drowsiness to coma. Case reports have identified numerous neurologic sequelae including ataxia, vertigo, dizziness, recurrent falls, nystagmus, headache, encephalopathy, and disorientation. Seizures have also been reported, mostly after overdose ingestions, but even therapeutic doses have occasionally been associated with seizures. One of the important neurologic side-effects attributed to the use of NSAIDs is aseptic meningitis. The clinical signs of drug-induced meningitis are similar to those of infectious meningitis and include fever, headache, photophobia, and stiff neck. The laboratory findings are also similar, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis of several hundred or thousand cells, mainly neutrophils, elevated levels of protein, normal or low glucose levels and negative cultures. Drug-induced meningitis is a transient disorder with an excellent prognosis. Most or all drugs used for the treatment of headache, including NSAIDs, may cause a condition known as medication overuse headache - a refractory chronic daily headache that tends to resolve following discontinuation of the analgesics. Reye's syndrome is a rare severe illness occurring mainly in children and adolescents and characterized by abnormal liver function, vomiting, and encephalopathy, with a mortality rate approaching 40%. The pathogenesis is currently unknown, but commonly the syndrome is preceded by a viral episode, with an intermediate latent period of 3-5 days. An association with aspirin use is strongly suggested. Aspirin, the classic and most commonly used NSAID, has a well-documented effect in inhibiting intravascular clotting, thus reducing the occurrence of ischemic strokes and other vascular events. NSAIDs, however, have a double impact on coagulation. On the one hand, most agents inhibit the synthesis of thromboxane in the platelets, thereby inhibiting coagulation. On the other hand, they also inhibit the production of prostacyclin by endothelial cells, resulting in a prothrombotic state. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by drugs such as rofecoxib (Vioxx) and valdecoxib (Bextra) results in specific inhibition of synthesis of prostaglandins participating in inflammation and was found to lead to vascular complications including an increased risk for stroke. The connection between inflammation and neuronal degeneration is well established. Most studies, including the prospective Rotterdam study, have found an inverse correlation between the use of NSAIDs and the risk for dementia. Two meta-analyses have found 40% and 25% reduction, respectively, in the risk of Alzheimer's disease among NSAID users. However, some large, well designed studies failed to confirm these results, and some even found that NSAID use is associated with cognitive decline. The clinical impact of NSAIDs on Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. While some studies showed that chronic NSAID use is protective against PD, other studies could not confirm the existence of a significant relationship. A recent meta-analysis indicated that the use of non-aspirin NSAID, particularly ibuprofen, reduces the risk of PD by 15% while the use of aspirin did not show any effect.
