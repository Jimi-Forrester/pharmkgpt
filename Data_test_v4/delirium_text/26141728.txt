26141728|a|INTRODUCTION: The deposition of the amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Removal of Abeta by Abeta-antibody treatment has been developed as a potential treatment strategy against AD. First clinical trials showed neither a stop nor a reduction of disease progression. Recently, we have shown that the formation of soluble and insoluble Abeta aggregates in the human brain follows a hierarchical sequence of three biochemical maturation stages (B-Abeta stages). To test the impact of the B-Abeta stage on Abeta immunotherapy, we treated transgenic mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) carrying the Swedish mutation (KM670/671NL; APP23) with the Abeta-antibody beta1 or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) beginning 1) at 3 months, before the onset of dendrite degeneration and plaque deposition, and 2) at 7 months, after the start of Abeta plaque deposition and dendrite degeneration. RESULTS: At 5 months of age, first Abeta aggregates in APP23 brain consisted of non-modified Abeta (representing B-Abeta stage 1) whereas mature Abeta-aggregates containing N-terminal truncated, pyroglutamate-modified AbetaN3pE and phosphorylated Abeta (representing B-Abeta stage 3) were found at 11 months of age in both beta1- and PBS-treated animals. Protective effects on commissural neurons with highly ramified dendritic trees were observed only in 3-month-old beta1-treated animals sacrificed at 5 months. When treatment started at 7 months of age, no differences in the numbers of healthy commissural neurons were observed between beta1- and PBS-treated APP23 mice sacrificed with 11 months. CONCLUSIONS: Abeta antibody treatment was capable of protecting neurons from dendritic degeneration as long as Abeta aggregation was absent or represented B-Abeta stage 1 but had no protective or curative effect in later stages with mature Abeta aggregates (B-Abeta stage 3). These data indicate that the maturation stage of Abeta aggregates has impact on potential treatment effects in APP23 mice.
