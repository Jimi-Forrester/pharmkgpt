7847590|t|Clinical predictors of alcohol withdrawal delirium.
7847590|a|Up to now, clinical predictors for the course of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome, especially for the occurrence of a delirium, are lacking. Thus, this study was undertaken to examine whether clinical routine investigations at admission before the withdrawal syndrome can reveal factors indicating a higher risk for the development of a delirium. Our results showed that decreased serum electrolyte concentrations (i.e., chloride and potassium), elevated ALT, and gamma-glutamyltransferase serum levels, as well as ataxia and polyneuropathy at the neurological examination, indicate a higher risk for the development of an alcohol withdrawal delirium.
