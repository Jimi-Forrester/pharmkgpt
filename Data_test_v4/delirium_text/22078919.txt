22078919|t|Delirium prevention and treatment.
22078919|a|Little is known of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic delirium prevention and treatment in the critical care setting. Trials emphasizing early mobilization suggest that this nonpharmacologic approach is associated with an improvement in delirium incidence. Titration and reduction of opiate analgesics and sedatives may improve subsyndromal delirium rates. All critical care caregivers should rigorously screen for alcohol abuse, apply alcohol withdrawal scales in alcoholic patients, and titrate sedative drugs accordingly. No nonpharmacologic approach or drug has been shown to be beneficial once delirium is established. Considering the importance and the consequences of delirium in the critical care setting, studies to further address prevention and rigorous trials addressing pharmacologic intervention are urgently needed.
