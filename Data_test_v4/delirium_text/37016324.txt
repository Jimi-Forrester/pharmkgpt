37016324|a|BACKGROUND: Older patients are vulnerable to experiencing drug related problems (DRPs), which may result in emergency department (ED) visits. However, it is not standard practice to conduct medications reviews during ED visit. The aim of this study was to assess the number of DRPs in older patients living with frailty at the ED, identified through pharmacist-led medication reviews within a geriatric care team, and to determine the acceptance rate of pharmacists' recommendations among hospital physicians and general practitioners or elderly care specialists. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed in patients >= 70 years living with frailty at the ED at Tergooi Medical Center. Pharmacist-led medication reviews were conducted to identify and classify DRPs as part of a larger geriatric assessment. The acceptance rate of given recommendations was determined during follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 356 ED visits were included. The mean (standard deviation, SD) age of patients was 83 (6.8) years. About 76% of patients had at least one DRP. In total, 548 DRPs were identified with a mean of 1.5 DRP (SD 1.3) per patient. The acceptance rate of medication recommendations in admitted patients was 55%, and 32% among general practitioners/elderly care specialists in discharged patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacist-led medication reviews as part of a geriatric care team identified DRPs in 76% of older patients living with frailty at the ED. The acceptance rate was substantially higher in admitted patients compared to discharged patients.
