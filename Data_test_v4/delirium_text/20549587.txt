20549587|a|A high level of suspicion is necessary to detect postoperative sepsis in good time. It may be difficult to differentiate sepsis from normal SIRS in the postoperative setting. Early signs and symptoms include delirium and respiratory compromise. These should trigger the search for a septic focus aggressively with special attention to the original site of surgery. Key recommendations include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hour of diagnosis, and source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method. In cases of severe abdominal sepsis the concept of relaparotomy on-demand has become most popular.
