39044500|t|Novel Blood-Based Biomarkers and Disease Modifying Therapies for Alzheimer's Disease. Are We Ready for the New Era?
39044500|a|Recent positive trials for novel disease modifying therapies of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies represent a paradigm shift in the prevention and management of Alzheimer's disease, a relentlessly progressive and debilitating disease of old age. The reported efficacy of these new agents when given early in the disease trajectory is dependent on an early and accurate disease diagnosis, which is currently based on cerebrospinal fluid tests or/and neuro-imaging studies such as positron emission tomography. These confirmatory tests provide in vivo evidence of the pathological signature of Alzheimer's disease, of increased cerebral amyloid and tau burden and neurodegeneration. The emergence of blood-based biomarkers represents another breakthrough, offering a less invasive and scalable diagnostic tool that could be applied in both primary and specialist care settings, potentially revolutionizing Alzheimer's disease clinical pathways. However, healthcare systems face challenges in the adoption of these new technologies and therapies due to diagnostic and treatment capacity constraints, as well as financial and infrastructure requirements.
