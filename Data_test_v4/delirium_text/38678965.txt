38678965|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global medical challenge. Studies have shown that neurotoxicity caused by pathological aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) is an important factor leading to AD. Therefore, inhibiting the pathological aggregation of Abeta is the key to treating AD. The recombinant human HspB5-ACD structural domain protein (AHspB5) prepared by our group in the previous period has been shown to have anti-amyloid aggregation effects, but its inability to penetrate biological membranes has limited its development. In this study, we prepared a recombinant fusion protein (T-AHspB5) of TAT and AHspB5. In vitro experiments showed that T-AHspB5 inhibited the formation of Abeta1-42 protofibrils and had the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier; in cellular experiments, T-AHspB5 prevented Abeta1-42-induced oxidative stress damage, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses in neuronal cells, and its mechanism of action was related to microglia activation and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. In animal experiments, T-AHspB5 improved memory and cognitive dysfunction and inhibited pathological changes of AD in APP/PS1 mice. In conclusion, this paper is expected to reveal the intervention mechanism and biological effect of T-AHspB5 on pathological aggregation of Abeta1-42, provide a new pathway for the treatment of AD, and lay the foundation for the future development and application of T-AHspB5.
