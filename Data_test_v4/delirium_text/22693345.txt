22693345|a|Default-mode network (DMN) connectivity at rest is disrupted in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), but it is unknown whether this abnormality is a static feature, or if it varies across cognitive states. We measured DMN integrity in 16 patients with mild AD and 18 controls during resting state and a simple visual task. Patients showed resting-state deficits in the parahippocampal gyrus and posterior cingulate. No group differences were found during the task. Controls exhibited higher DMN connectivity of multiple regions during rest than task, while the patient group showed no modulation of the DMN between states. However, the relative degree of increased resting- versus task-state co-activation in the posterior cingulate and precuneus was predictive of mini-mental status exam (MMSE) scores in AD patients, while measures at rest or task alone were not associated with MMSE. These findings suggest that a resting state may be more suited to detecting DMN abnormalities in AD than a simple task. However, the degree of state-dependent modulation in the DMN may be a better predictor of the individual cognitive status than a single-state acquisition. This study demonstrates an apparent reduction in the capacity for DMN modulation in individuals with mild AD, the degree of which uniquely predicted cognitive status.
