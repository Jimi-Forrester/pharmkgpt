25618762|a|A rapid hydrostatic counter-current chromatography-thin-layer chromatography-electrospray-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CCC-TLC-ESI-TOF-MS) technique was established for use in seeking potent anti-Alzheimer's drugs among the acethylcholinesterase inhibitors in Argemone mexicana L. underground parts, with no need to isolate components in pure form. The dichloromethane extract from the roots of Mexican prickly poppy that was most rich in secondary metabolites was subjected to hydrostatic-CCC-based fractionation in descending mode, using a biphasic system composed of petroleum ether-ethyl acetate-methanol-water at the ratio of 1.5:3:2.1:2 (v/v). The obtained fractions were analyzed in a TLC-based AChE-inhibition "Fast Blue B" test. All active components in the fractions, including berberine, protopine, chelerithrine, sanguinarine, coptisine, palmatine, magnoflorine, and galanthamine, were identified in a direct TLC-HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS assay with high accuracy. This is the first time galanthamine has been reported in the extract of Mexican prickly poppy and the first time it has been identified in any member of the Papaveraceae family, in the significant quantity of 0.77%.
