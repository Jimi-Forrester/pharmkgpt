38138592|t|Effect of Gaseous Ozone and Storage Time on Polyphenolic Profile and Sugar Content in Fruits of Selected Vaccinium corymbosum L. Genotypes.
38138592|a|One of the best sources of antioxidant and health-promoting bioactive substances is the fruit of V. corymbosum. A potent oxidizing agent, ozone (O3), can effectively eliminate bacteria. The application of ozone gas to V. corymbosum fruit during storage had a favorable impact on the fruit's phenolic component and sugar content in the current investigation. After 7 days of storage, phenolic content in all highbush blueberry cultivars and clones tested increased on average by 28.60%, including anthocyanins by 34%. After 14 days of storage, an average increase of 16.50% in phenolic compounds was observed, including a 20.53% increase in anthocyanins. Among all the tested varieties, clone BOR-21 treated with a dose of 0.01 mL L-1 ozone for 30 min after 14 days had the highest TPC-143.73 mg 100 g-1 f.w. The sugar content of berries treated with a dose of 0.01 mL L-1 ozone for 30 min, on day 7 and day 14 of storage increased by 9.2% and 6.3%, respectively. On day 7, the highest amount of total sugar (22.74 g 100 g-1) was observed in Duke cultivar after being exposed to 0.01 mL L-1 ozone for 15 min. The ozonation treatments enhanced the fruit's saturation with nutrients, which raises the fruit's value as food.
