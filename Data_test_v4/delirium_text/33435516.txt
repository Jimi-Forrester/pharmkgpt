33435516|a|Owing to their antioxidant properties, caffeoylquinic acid (CQA)-derivatives could potentially improve the impaired metabolism in hepatic cells, however, their effect on mitochondrial function has not been demonstrated yet. Here, we evaluated the impact of three CQA-derivatives extracted from purple sweet potato, namely 5-CQA, 3,4- and 4,5-diCQA, on mitochondrial activity in primary hepatocytes using an extracellular flux analyzer. Notably, an increase of maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity were observed when 5-CQA and 3,4-diCQA were added to the system indicating the improved mitochondrial function. Moreover, 3,4-diCQA was shown to considerably increase glycolytic reserve which is a measure of cell capability to respond to an energy demand through glycolysis. Conversely, 4,5-diCQA did not modify mitochondrial activity but increased glycolysis at low concentration in primary hepatocytes. All compounds tested improved cellular capacity to oxidize fatty acids. Overall, our results demonstrated the potential of test CQA-derivatives to modify mitochondrial function in hepatic cells. It is especially relevant in case of dysfunctional mitochondria in hepatocytes linked to hepatic steatosis during obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.
