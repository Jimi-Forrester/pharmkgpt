38596509|a|Introduction: Critically ill patients experience various stressful symptoms of discomfort, including dyspnea, pain, and sleep disruption. Notably, ventilated patients have difficulty self-reporting discomfort symptoms. Nurses need to assess discomfort symptoms to alleviate them, but limited research exists on discomfort symptom assessment and management in critically ill patients. Objective: To identify the practices, attitudes, and barriers among nurses related to the assessment of discomfort symptoms in mechanically ventilated patients. Methods: Using a cross-sectional, descriptive study design, a web-based survey was conducted between May and June 2022 with critical care nurses sampled through Japanese academic societies and social networking services. The survey contained questions relative to the above-stated objective. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed without sample size calculation because of the descriptive and exploratory nature of this study. Results: There were 267 respondents to the questionnaire. The discomfort symptoms that nurses perceived as important to assess were pain (median 100 [interquartile range, IQR 90-100]), insomnia (99 [80-100]), and dyspnea (96.5 [75-100]). Most participants (89.8%) routinely assessed pain in mechanically ventilated patients using a scale; however, other discomfort symptoms were assessed by less than 40% (dyspnea [28.4%], fatigue [8.1%], thirst [13.1%], insomnia [37.3%], and anxiety [13.6%]). Two major barriers to assessing discomfort symptoms were lack of assessment culture within the intensive care unit and lack of knowledge of the relevant evaluation scales. Conclusions: Nurses were aware of the importance of using scales to assess the discomfort symptoms experienced by mechanically ventilated patients. However, except for pain, most nurses did not routinely use scales to assess discomfort symptoms. Barriers to routine discomfort symptom assessment included the lack of an assessment culture and the lack of knowledge of the assessment scales. Clinicians should be educated regarding the existence of validated rating scales and develop additional rating scales utilizable for minor discomforts in mechanically ventilated patients.
