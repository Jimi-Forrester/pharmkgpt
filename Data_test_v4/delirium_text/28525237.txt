28525237|a|Major and minor neurocognitive disorders are common and increase with age. In the 70s, similarities between " senile " and " presenile " dementia led to their homogenization in a unique illness, the Alzheimer's disease. Systematic specific psychosocial support of patients and caregivers is crucial and allows to discuss an advance care plan. We propose such a multidisciplinary program and discuss some of them. Various drugs and a variety of possible physiopathogenic targets are actually studied and should in the near future offer new therapeutics in dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
