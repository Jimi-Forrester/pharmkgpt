37361347|t|Futuristic Thinking about Engineering "Geneospirituality" to Help Prevent Relapse of Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) Behaviors.
37361347|a|It is with a saddened heart that we are dedicating this article to the loving memory of our dear departed friend and associate B. William Downs. Bill was well known in the nutritional space worldwide for his major contributions to the health and welfare of millions around the globe. The founder of Victory Nutrition International (VNI) in conjunction with Kim Downs, as well as so many contributions to scientific literature, to those that knew him personally will forever be touched. Bill was a highly spirited human with a never ending love for caring and helping so many individuals. To know Bill is to walk in the face of a music lover playing drums, trained as a martial artist, and riding through the winds of a Beamer driven by an iconic man driven to victory. Our hearts may be saddened but Bills spirit to those that know him will be forever. In this article we discuss and review some potential futuristic concepts and technological advancements in terms of geneospirituality engineering to help prevent relapse and or even protect against an unwanted predisposition to RDS behaviors. Futuristic development may contribute to an attenuation of both DNA antecedents as well as epigenetic reward system insults leading to unwanted substance and non-substance addictive behaviors.
