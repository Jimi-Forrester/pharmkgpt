25205210|a|Increases in plasma kynurenic acid (KYNA) concentration relate to the severity of inflammation. The aim of this study was to analyse changes in plasma KYNA concentration and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in cardiac surgery patients. Additionally, the effect of anaesthesia was analysed. Adult cardiac surgery patients under intravenous general anaesthesia were studied. Additionally, some patients received sevoflurane (SEV) prior to cardiopulmonary bypass. Plasma KYNA concentration and NLR were measured before anaesthesia, just after surgery and on postoperative days 1, 2 and 3. Patients were assigned to two groups: patients who did not receive SEV (NonSEV group) and patients who received SEV (SEV group). Forty-three patients were studied. Twenty-four of them received SEV. KYNA increased immediately after surgery and remained elevated through postoperative day 3 in the NonSEV group, whereas it was similar to the preoperative concentration in the SEV group. NLR increased immediately after surgery in both groups, and higher values were noted in the NonSEV group than in the SEV group at postoperative days 2 and 3. Plasma KYNA concentration correlated with NLR in the NonSEV group. Cardiac surgery caused an increase in NLR. Plasma KYNA increased in the NonSEV group and correlated with NLR. Administration of SEV inhibited the increase in KYNA, most likely due to its anti-inflammatory properties.
