38236817|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with both genetic and non-genetic causes. Animal research models are available for a multitude of diseases and conditions affecting the central nervous system (CNS), and large-scale CNS gene expression data exist for many of these. Although there are several models specifically for AD, each recapitulates different aspects of the human disease. In this study we evaluate over 500 animal models to identify those with CNS gene expression patterns matching human AD datasets. Approaches included a hypergeometric based scoring system that rewards congruent gene expression patterns but penalizes discordant gene expression patterns. The top two models identified were APP/PS1 transgenic mice expressing mutant APP and PSEN1, and mice carrying a GFAP mutation that is causative of Alexander disease, a primary disorder of astrocytes in the CNS. The APP/PS1 and GFAP models both matched over 500 genes moving in the same direction as in human AD, and both had elevated GFAP expression and were highly congruent with one another. Also scoring highly were the 5XFAD model (with five mutations in APP and PSEN1) and mice carrying CK-p25, APP, and MAPT mutations. Animals with the APOE3 and 4 mutations combined with traumatic brain injury ranked highly. Bulbectomized rats scored high, suggesting anosmia could be causative of AD-like gene expression. Other matching models included the SOD1G93A strain and knockouts for SNORD116 (Prader-Willi mutation), GRID2, INSM1, XBP1, and CSTB. Many top models demonstrated increased expression of GFAP, and results were similar across multiple human AD datasets. Heatmap and Uniform Manifold Approximation Plot results were consistent with hypergeometric ranking. Finally, some gene manipulation models, including for TYROBP and ATG7, were identified with reversed AD patterns, suggesting possible neuroprotective effects. This study provides insight for the pathobiology of AD and the potential utility of available animal models.
