36615525|t|Research Progress of H2S Donors Conjugate Drugs Based on ADTOH.
36615525|a|H2S is an endogenous gas signaling molecule and its multiple biological effects have been demonstrated. The abnormal level of H2S is closely related to the occurrence and development of many diseases, and H2S donors has important pharmacological implications. In recent years, H2S donors represented by ADTOH (5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione) are often used to synthesize new 'conjugate' compounds that can release H2S and parent drugs. These hybrids retain the pharmacological activity of the parent drugs and H2S and have a synergistic effect. ADTOH and parent drug hybrids have become one of the important strategies for the development of H2S donor conjugate drugs. This review summarizes molecular hybrids between ADTOH and clinical drugs to provide new ideas for the study of H2S donor drug design.
