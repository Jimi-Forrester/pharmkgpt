33052182|a|Accidental or suicidal poisoning with yellow phosphorus or metal phosphides (YPMP) such as aluminum (AlP) zinc phosphide (Zn3P2) commonly cause acute liver failure (ALF) and cardiotoxicity. These are used as household, agricultural and industrial rodenticides and in production of ammunitions, firecrackers and fertilizers. In absence of a clinically available laboratory test for diagnosis or toxin measurement or an antidote, managing their poisoning is challenging even at a tertiary care center with a dedicated liver intensive care unit (LICU) and liver transplant facility. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with YPMP related ALF were monitored using standardized clinical, hemodynamic, biochemical, metabolic, neurological, electrocardiography (ECG) and SOFA score and managed using uniform intensive care, treatment and transplant protocols in LICU. Socio-demographic characteristics, clinical and biochemical parameters and scores were summarized and compared between 3 groups i.e. spontaneous survivors, transplanted patients and non-survivors. Predictors of spontaneous survival and the need for liver transplant are also evaluated. RESULTS: Nineteen patients with YPMP related ALF were about 32 years old (63.2% females) and presented to us at a median of 3 (0 - 10) days after poisoning. YPMP related cardiotoxicity was rapidly progressive and fatal whereas liver transplant was therapeutic for ALF. Spontaneous survivors had lower dose ingestion (<17.5 grams), absence of cardiotoxicity, < grade 3 HE, lactate < 5.8, SOFA score < 14.5, and increase in SOFA score by < 5.5. Patients with renal failure need for CVVHDF and KCC positivity on account of PT-INR > 6.5 had higher mortality risk. Patients undergoing liver transplant and with spontaneous recovery required longer ICU and hospital stay. At median follow-up of 3.4 (2.6 - 5.5) years, all spontaneous survivors and transplanted patients are well with normal liver function. CONCLUSIONS: Early transfer to a specialized center, pre-emptive close monitoring, and intensive care and organ support with ventilation, CVVHDF, plasmapheresis and others may maximize their chances of spontaneous recovery, allow accurate prognostication and a timely liver transplant.
