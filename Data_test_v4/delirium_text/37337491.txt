37337491|a|Background Aspiration pneumonia is common in older adults admitted for community-acquired pneumonia and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Factors that put this population at higher risk of aspiration include cognitive impairment, neuromuscular dysfunction, and dysphagia. This study aimed to determine whether a concurrent diagnosis of dysphagia conferred a higher risk of complications in the elderly admitted for aspiration pneumonia. Methods The National Inpatient Sample 2001-2013 database was queried for patients, aged 65 or older, with a diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes. Sepsis, respiratory failure, and intubation were identified with their respective ICD-9 codes. A chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis were used to examine socio-demographic and complication variables, with a significance level of alpha <0.001. Results A total of 1,097,325 patients were admitted for aspiration pneumonia, of which 349,861 (24.2%) had dysphagia. After incorporating socio-demographic variables, the dysphagia group had a significantly lower likelihood of having sepsis (OR=0.72), respiratory failure (OR=0.92), intubation (OR=0.52), and inpatient mortality (OR = 0.59). Patients with dysphagia had a significantly higher likelihood of increased length of stay (OR=1.24). Conclusions Elderly patients admitted with aspiration pneumonia with a co-diagnosis of dysphagia were less likely to have inpatient morbidity and mortality compared to their counterparts. This may be due to improved speech evaluation and treatment in patients with dysphagia allowing for better control of macro and micro aspiration. Future research is needed to examine if universal speech therapy can reduce hospitalization and long-term mortality for such patients.
