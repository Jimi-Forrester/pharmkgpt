37663879|t|The impact of pulmonary cachexia on inpatient outcomes: A national study.
37663879|a|BACKGROUND: Cachexia has been associated with chronic lung disease (pulmonary cachexia syndrome), which is associated with increased mortality. However, studies that looked into this association was relatively small, and national level data are lacking. Herein, we aim to study the association between chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and cachexia. RESEARCH QUESTION: Do patients with COPD and cachexia has worse inpatient outcomes in comparison to those with no cachexia? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We used the Nationwide Readmissions Database from 2016 to 2019, extracting adult patients with a primary diagnosis of COPD who were admitted between January and November of each year studied. We excluded patients with missing data on event time or length of stay. Furthermore, we excluded all cases with cormobidities associated with cachexia. We used SAS 9.4 for data exploration and analysis. RESULTS: We included 1,446,431 COPD-related weighted hospitalizations for which 115,276 cases (7.9%) had a concurrent diagnosis of cachexia (or cachexia-related diagnoses). Overall, patients with cachexia (COPD-C), compared to patients with COPD and no cachexia (COPD-NC), were older (mean age 69 vs. 66 years, respectively, P < 0.001) with similar gender distribution (58%). COPD-C patients had more inpatient complications including cardiac arrest, and use of mechanical ventilation (P < 0.001). Furthermore, they had longer mean lengths of stay (5.2 days vs. 3.8 days, P < 0.001). In-hospital mortality during index, admission was significantly higher in these patients at 2.2% compared to 0.5% for COPD-NC (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: COPD-related cachexia is associated with increased inpatient mortality, resource utilization, and prolonged hospitalization.
