35986174|a|The pathophysiology of bipolar disorder remains to be elucidated and there are no diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for the condition. In this explorative proteomic study, we analyzed 201 proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from mood stable bipolar disorder patients and control subjects sampled from two independent cohorts, amounting to a total of 204 patients and 144 controls. We used three Olink Multiplex panels, whereof one specifically targets immune biomarkers, to assess a broad set of CSF protein concentrations. After quality control and removal of proteins with a low detection rate, 105 proteins remained for analyses in relation to case-control status and clinical variables. Only case-control differences that replicated across cohorts were considered. Results adjusted for potential confounders showed that CSF concentrations of growth hormone were lower in bipolar disorder compared with controls in both cohorts. The effect size was larger when the analysis was restricted to bipolar disorder type 1 and controls. We found no indications of immune activation or other aberrations. Growth hormone exerts many effects in the central nervous system and our findings suggest that growth hormone might be implicated in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.
