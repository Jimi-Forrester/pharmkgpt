17267378|t|Efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.
17267378|a|Behavioral symptoms start to appear in mild and moderate dementia and become increasingly severe with the progression of the disease. Agitation, aggressiveness, and psychosis can be seen in Alzheimer's disease, and in particular are common manifestations in Lewy body dementia. It is the behavioral disturbances rather than the cognitive disorders that are more often the cause of the institutionalization of these patients because of the heavy assistance and emotional burden they represent for caregivers. Traditionally, these kinds of symptoms were controlled by classical antipsychotic agents, which after long-term use cause severe extrapyramidal effects, late dyskinesia, sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and cognitive function impairment. More recently, atypical antipsychotic agents have shown a better tolerability profile, with a reduced incidence of extrapyramidal effects, orthostatic hypotension, sedation, and a reduced impact on cognitive function. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine in a group of patients with a diagnosis of dementia and concomitant psychotic disorders. The response to treatment was evaluated by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD). The NPI and BEHAVE-AD were administered at baseline and after 4 weeks and 12 weeks of therapy. Tolerability was assessed by the incidence of clinically evident side effects. The results show that quetiapine is effective in reducing behavioral symptoms, deliria and hallucinations, aggressiveness, and sleep disturbances. Quetiapine tolerability proved to be satisfactory. The only side effect of clinical significance was orthostatic hypotension, which was, however, partially preventable by a slower drug titration.
