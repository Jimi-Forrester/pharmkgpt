30008224|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate how intravenously injected bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are distributed in the body of an Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal model. METHODS: Stem cells were collected from bone marrow of mice and labeled with Indium-111 (111In). The 111In-labeled BMSCs were infused intravenously into 3xTg-AD mice in the AD group and non-transgenic mice (B6129SF2/J) as controls. Biodistribution was evaluated with a gamma counter and gamma camera 24 and 48 h after injecting the stem cells. RESULTS: A gamma count of the brain showed a higher distribution of labeled cells in the AD model than in the control group at 24 (p = .0004) and 48 h (p = .0016) after injection of the BMSCs. Similar results were observed by gamma camera imaging (i.e., brain uptake in the AD model was significantly higher than that in the control group). Among the other organs, uptake by the spleen was the highest in both groups. More BMSCs were found in the lungs of the control group than in those of the AD group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that more intravenously infused BMSCs reached the brain in the AD model than in the control group, but the numbers of stem cells reaching the brain was very small.
