34484427|t|Update on the management of overactive bladder.
34484427|a|Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is a common condition characterised by urinary urgency, with or without urgency incontinence, frequency and nocturia, in the absence of any other pathology. Clinical diagnosis is based upon patient self-reported symptomology. Currently there is a plethora of treatments available for the management of OAB. Clinical guidelines suggest treatment via a multidisciplinary pathway including behavioural therapy and pharmacotherapy, which can be commenced in primary care, with referral to specialist services in those patients refractory to these treatments. Intradetrusor botulinum A and sacral neuromodulation provide safe and efficacious management of refractory OAB. Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation and augmentation cystoplasty remain available and efficacious in a select group of patients. Unfortunately, there remains a high rate of patient dissatisfaction and discontinuation in all treatments and thus there remains a need for emerging therapies in the management of OAB.
