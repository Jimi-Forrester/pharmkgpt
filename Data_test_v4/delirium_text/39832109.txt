39832109|a|Scientific reports from various areas of the world indicate the potential role of tocopherols (vitamin E) in particular alpha-tocopherol in the prevention and therapy of Alzheimer's disease. The current phenomenon is related to the growing global awareness of eating habits and is also determined by the need to develop the prevention, management and therapy of Alzheimer's disease. This article is a review of current research on the action of the active form of vitamin E-alpha-tocopherol and its impact on the development and course of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, to contrast this information, selected primary research on this topic was included. The aim of this article is to analyze and summarize the available scientific information on the effects of the active form of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol, on the development and course of Alzheimer's disease. In the structure of the review, particular attention was paid to the analysis of the pathophysiological processes of the disease and the biochemical features of the action of alpha-tocopherol. To discuss the relationship between the effect of alpha-tocopherol and the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease, a literature review was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, and Elsevier. During the search process, the following keywords were used: "tocopherols", "vitamin E", "alpha-tocopherol", "Alzheimer's disease" in various combinations. The process was conducted in accordance with the adopted search strategy taking into account the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common, irreversible neurodegenerative disease, so many scientists are actively looking for substances and/or strategies to prevent its development and to slow down its course in patients. Alpha-tocopherols (ATF) are a factor that inhibits the pathophysiological processes associated with the development of AD by reducing the formation of atherogenic amyloid B (AB). Additionally, this type of tocopherols has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and has a positive effect on the metabolic functioning of mitochondria. It has been shown that a higher intake of alpha-tocopherol (ATF) was associated with a reduced risk of developing dementia and the occurrence of mild types of cognitive impairment (MCI). Various sources indicate an insufficient supply of ATF in the diet. ATF supplementation may potentially help to slow down the course of Alzheimer's disease, which is why this substance may be popularized in the treatment of this disease in the future. However, there is a need for further research on this issue.
