37483351|a|The pathological involvement of the central nervous system in SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) patients is established. The burden of pathology is most pronounced in the brain stem including the medulla oblongata. Hypoxic/ischemic damage is the most frequent neuropathologic abnormality. Other neuropathologic features include neuronophagia, microglial nodules, and hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases: astrogliosis and microglial reactivity. It is still unknown if these pathologies are secondary to hypoxia versus a combination of inflammatory response combined with hypoxia. It is also unknown how astrocytes react to neuroinflammation in COVID-19, especially considering evidence supporting the neurotoxicity of certain astrocytic phenotypes. This study aims to define the link between astrocytic and microglial pathology in COVID-19 victims in the inferior olivary nucleus, which is one of the most severely affected brain regions in COVID-19, and establish whether COVID-19 pathology is driven by hypoxic damage. Here, we conducted neuropathologic assessments and multiplex-immunofluorescence studies on the medulla oblongata of 18 COVID-19, 10 pre-pandemic patients who died of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 7-8 control patients with no ARDS or COVID-19. The comparison of ARDS and COVID-19 allows us to identify whether the pathology in COVID-19 can be explained by hypoxia alone, which is common to both conditions. Our results showed increased olivary astrogliosis in ARDS and COVID-19. However, microglial density and microglial reactivity were increased only in COVID-19, in a region-specific manner. Also, olivary hilar astrocytes increased YKL-40 (CHI3L1) in COVID-19, but to a lesser extent than ARDS astrocytes. COVID-19 astrocytes also showed lower levels of Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), and Metallothionein-3 in subsets of COVID-19 brain regions. Cluster analysis on immunohistochemical attributes of astrocytes and microglia identified ARDS and COVID-19 clusters with correlations to clinical history and disease course. Our results indicate that olivary glial pathology and neuroinflammation in the COVID-19 cannot be explained solely by hypoxia and suggest that failure of astrocytes to upregulate the anti-inflammatory YKL-40 may contribute to the neuroinflammation. Notwithstanding the limitations of retrospective studies in establishing causality, our experimental design cannot adequately control for factors external to our design. Perturbative studies are needed to confirm the role of the above-described astrocytic phenotypes in neuroinflammation.
