23892727|a|The membrane roughness of Neuro-2a neroblastoma cells is measured by using noninterferometric wide-field optical profilometry. The cells are treated with the fibril and oligomer conformers of amyloid-beta (Abeta) 42, which is a peptide of 42 amino acids related to the development of Alzheimer's disease. We find that both the Abeta42 fibrils and Abeta42 oligomers reduced the cell membrane roughness, but the effect of Abeta42 oligomers was faster and stronger than that of the fibrils. We also apply direct-current electric field (dcEF) stimulations on the cells. A dcEF of 300 mV/mm can increase the membrane roughness under the treatment of Abeta42. These results suggest that Abeta42 can decrease the membrane compliance of live neuroblastoma cells, and dcEFs may counteract this effect.
