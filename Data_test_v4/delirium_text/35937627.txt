35937627|a|[Purpose] This study compared the motor skills and cognitive functions of elderly participants who required support with those who did not require support. We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of impairment in sub-items of cognitive function in patients who needed support to predict future clinical issues. [Participants and Methods] We surveyed 31 participants requiring support under the day care service insurance system for which they attended day care service centers in Japan (rehabilitation users) and 10 healthy participants who attended a university for lifelong learning (healthy elders). Data on personal attributes of the participants were collected, and the Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index and motor and cognitive functions were assessed. [Results] Although the participants undergoing rehabilitation were, on average, 6 years older than the healthy elders, we found no significant differences between the two groups in closed-eye, one-legged standing, grip strength, or quadriceps muscle strength. In terms of the Tokyo Cognitive Assessment for mild cognitive impairment, we found no significant differences between those undergoing rehabilitation and healthy elders in clock drawing performance, serial 7 task performance, or orientation; however, there were significant differences in erase character, copy of triangular pyramid, composition, read of digits, go/no-go, word recall, story reproduction, ToCA total score. [Conclusion] We believe that it is imperative for day care service centers to conduct programs that maintain cognitive function in addition to programs for improvement of physical function.
