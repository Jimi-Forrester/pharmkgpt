39588497|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by cognitive impairment and depression, is currently one of the intractable problems due to the insufficiency of intervention strategies. Diethyl butylmalonate (DBM) has recently attracted extensive interest due to its anti-inflammatory role in macrophages. However, it is still unknown whether DBM has a beneficial effect on cognitive deficits and depression. Methods: DBM was administrated to 5xFAD and C57BL/6J mice by intraperitoneal injection. Novel object recognition, Y-maze spatial memory, Morris water maze and nest building tests were used to evaluate cognitive function. Moreover, the tail suspension test, forced swimming test, open field test and the elevated plus maze test were used to assess depression. Transmission electron microscopy, Golgi-Cox staining, immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR and western blot were utilized to determine the neuropathological changes in the hippocampus and amygdala of mice. Results: Multiple behavioral tests showed that DBM effectively mitigated cognitive deficit and depression in 5xFAD mice. Moreover, DBM significantly attenuated synaptic ultrastructure and neurite impairment in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice, paralleled by the improvement of the deficits of PSD95 and BDNF proteins. In addition, DBM decreased the accumulation of microglia and downregulated neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and amygdala of 5xFAD mice. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that DBM ameliorates cognitive deficits and depression via improvement of the impairment of synaptic ultrastructure and neuroinflammation, suggesting that DBM is a potential drug candidate for treating AD-related neurodegeneration.
