29595076|t|Anti-Apoptotic Mechanisms of Acupuncture in Neurological Diseases: A Review.
29595076|a|Apoptosis, known as programmed cell death, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. Most of these diseases can be obviously alleviated by means of acupuncture treatment. Current research studies have shown that the efficacy of acupuncture to these medical conditions is closely associated with the anti-apoptotic potentials. Mainly based on the acupuncture's anti-apoptotic efficacy in prevalent neurological disorders, including cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, Alzheimer's disease, depression or stress related-modes, spinal cord injuries, etc., this review comes to a conclusion that the anti-apoptotic effect of acupuncture treatment for neurological diseases, evidently reflected through Bcl-2, Bax or caspase expression change, results from regulating mitochondrial or autophagic dysfunction as well as reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. The possible mechanisms of acupuncture's anti-apoptotic effect are associated with a series of downstream signaling pathways and the up-regulated expression of neurotrophic factors. It is of great importance to illuminate the exact mechanisms of acupuncture treatment for neurological dysfunctions.
