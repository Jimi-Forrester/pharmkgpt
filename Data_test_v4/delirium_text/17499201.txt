17499201|t|A proline-rich polypeptide complex (PRP) isolated from ovine colostrum. Modulation of H2O2 and cytokine induction in human leukocytes.
17499201|a|A proline-rich polypeptide complex (PRP) has immunoregulatory properties and also shows beneficial effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is known that the unregulated activation of microglial cells in AD may result in chronic inflammatory response. There is a link between the activation of immune cells on the periphery and in the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, we studied the effect of the PRP on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated by LPS with PHA (LP) or PMA as proinflammatory activators. PRP and its nonapeptide fragment (NP) inhibited by 40-60% production of H(2)O(2) induced by PMA. The peptides also inhibited activity of superoxide dismutase. Both peptide preparations showed differential effects on the secretion of cytokines. NP induced TNF-alpha only while PRP induced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha. On the other hand, the release of TNF-alpha and IL-10 induced by LP in PBMCs was inhibited by PRP while NP inhibited the release of IFN-gamma and IL-10. The results obtained showed that PRP may affect not only adaptive immunity but also innate immunity and thus may regulate secretions of mediators of inflammation. The regulatory effect of the PRP on the innate immunity may shed some light on understanding the beneficial effects of this polypeptide complex in AD patients.
