37247962|a|INTRODUCTION: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common cognitive disturbance in elderly individuals that is characterised by acute and fluctuating impairments in attention and awareness. Remimazolam tosylate is a novel, ultrashort-acting benzodiazepine, and there is limited evidence of its correlation with the incidence of early POD. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of POD after anaesthesia induction and maintenance with remimazolam tosylate or propofol in elderly patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-centre, randomised controlled trial. 636 elderly patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery will be enrolled and randomised at a 1:1 ratio to receive total intravenous anaesthesia with either remimazolam tosylate or propofol. The primary outcome is the incidence of POD within 5 days after surgery. Delirium will be assessed twice daily by the 3 min Diagnostic Interview for the Confusion Assessment Method or the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit (ICU) for ICU patients. Secondary outcomes are the onset and duration of delirium, cognitive function at discharge and within 1-year postoperatively, postoperative analgesia within 5 days, chronic pain at 3 months, quality of recovery and postoperative inflammatory biomarker levels. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (approval No. 22/520-3722). Written informed consent will be obtained from each patient before enrolment. The results of this trial will be presented at scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
