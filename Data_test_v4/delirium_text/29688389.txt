29688389|a|Background: It is widely accepted that cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, are affected in depression, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions of these 2 disorders are not clearly understood. Recently, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3beta)/beta-catenin signaling was shown to play an important role in the regulation of learning and memory. Methods: The present study used a rat model of depression, chronic unpredictable stress, to determine whether hippocampal GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling was involved in learning and memory alterations. Results: Our results demonstrated that chronic unpredictable stress had a dramatic influence on spatial cognitive performance in the Morris water maze task and reduced the phosphorylation of Ser9 of GSK-3beta as well as the total and nuclear levels of beta-catenin in the hippocampus. Inhibition of GSK3beta by SB216763 significantly ameliorated the cognitive deficits induced by chronic unpredictable stress, while overexpression of GSK3beta by AAV-mediated gene transfer significantly decreased cognitive performance in adult rats. In addition, chronic unpredictable stress exposure increased the expression of the canonical Wnt antagonist Dkk-1. Furthermore, chronic administration of corticosterone significantly increased Dkk-1 expression, decreased the phosphorylation of Ser9 of GSK-3beta, and resulted in the impairment of hippocampal learning and memory. Conclusions: Our results indicate that impairment of learning and memory in response to chronic unpredictable stress may be attributed to the dysfunction of GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling mediated by increased glucocorticoid signaling via Dkk-1.
