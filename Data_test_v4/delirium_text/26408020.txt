26408020|t|New discovery rarely runs smooth: an update on progranulin/TNFR interactions.
26408020|a|Progranulin (PGRN) is a growth factor implicated in various pathophysiological processes, including wound healing, inflammation, tumorigenesis, and neurodegeneration. It was previously reported that PGRN binds to tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFR) and has therapeutic effects in inflammatory arthritis (Tang et. al, in Science 332:478-484, 2011); however, Chen et al. reported their inability to demonstrate the PGRN-TNFR interactions under their own conditions (Chen et. al, in J Neurosci 33:9202-9213, 2013). A letter-to-editor was then published by the original group in response to the Chen et al. paper that discussed the reasons for the latter's inability to recapitulate the interactions. In addition, the group published follow-up studies that further reinforced and dissected the interactions of PGRN-TNFR. Recently, the dispute about the legitimacy of PGRN-TNFR interactions appears to be finally settled with independent confirmations of these interactions in various conditions by numerous laboratories. This review presents a chronological update on the story of PGRN-TNFR interactions, highlighting the independent confirmations of these interactions in various diseases and conditions.
