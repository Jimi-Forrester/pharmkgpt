36449200|t|The Behavioral and Neurochemical Changes Induced by Boldenone and/or Tramadol in Adult Male Rats.
36449200|a|Boldenone and tramadol are abused among large sectors of adolescents. Therefore, the behavioral changes concerned with memory and cognitive functions and neurochemical variations were investigated in the cortex of rats treated with boldenone and/or tramadol. Rats were divided into control and rats treated with boldenone, tramadol, or both drugs. At the end of the treatment period, the memory and cognitive functions were evaluated by the Y-maze test (YMT) and elevated plus maze test (EPMT) and the motor activity was determined by the open field test (OFT). The cortex was dissected to carry out the neurochemical analyses. Rats treated with boldenone and/or tramadol showed impaired memory and cognitive functions and reduced motor activity. A significant increase in lipid peroxidation (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and a significant decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) were observed in the cortex of rats treated with boldenone and/or tramadol. The levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) decreased significantly. Western blot data showed a significant decrease in Bcl2 and a significant increase in caspase-3 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in rats treated with boldenone and/or tramadol. These changes were associated with neuronal death as indicated from the histopathological examination.The present findings indicate that boldenone and/or tramadol induced impairment in memory and cognitive functions. These changes could be mediated by the increase in oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, reduced AChE level, and reduced number of survived neurons in the cortex as indicated from the decreased Bcl2 level and the histological examination.
