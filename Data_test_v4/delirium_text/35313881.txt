35313881|t|Roles of sirtuin family members in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
35313881|a|The globally increasing annual incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a common chronic disease, poses a serious risk to public health. Although the exact mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of COPD remains unclear, a large number of studies have shown that its pathophysiology and disease course are closely related to oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy, and aging. The key players involved in COPD include the sirtuin family of NAD-dependent deacetylases that comprise seven members (SIRT1-7) in mammals. Sirtuins play an important role in metabolic diseases, cell cycle control, proliferation, apoptosis, and senescence. Owing to differences in subcellular localization, sirtuins exhibit anisotropy. In this narrative review, we discuss the roles and molecular pathways of each member of the sirtuin family involved in COPD to provide novel insights into the prevention and treatment of COPD and how sirtuins may serve as adjuvants for COPD treatment.
