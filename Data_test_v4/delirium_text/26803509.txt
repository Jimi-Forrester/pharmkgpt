26803509|a|BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested that vascular dysfunction plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease. AIMS: We hypothesized that significant differences might be observed in the levels of blood endothelial biomarkers across elderly population of subjects with dementia. METHODS: We analyzed, in a prospective monocentric study, three different endothelial biomarkers, endothelial microparticles (EMPs), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs) in 132 older patients who underwent a full evaluation of a memory complaint. RESULTS: There was no difference in specific EMP, EPC or CEC levels between demented or non-demented patients, nor considering cognitive decline. DISCUSSION: Blood endothelial biomarkers may be too sensitive and it is likely that the multimorbidity observed in our patients may lead to opposite and confounding effects on endothelial biomarkers levels. CONCLUSION: Unlike younger AD patients, our results suggest that endothelial biomarkers are not valuable for the diagnosis of dementia in elderly patients.
