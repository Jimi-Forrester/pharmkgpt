36827051|a|This retrospective study compared the mortality and short-term complications according to the choice of general anesthesia or regional anesthesia in patients who underwent a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We searched the Korean National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort database to analyze data from patients who received a TKA between January 2002 and December 2015. Before comparing the general and the regional anesthesia groups, the bias was reduced by propensity score matching. After matching, the mortality and complications occurring within 30 days after a TKA were compared between the 2 groups. In the database, 6491 primary TKA cases were identified. Nine hundred forty-three patients (14.5%) had a TKA performed under general anesthesia, and 5548 (85.5%) had a TKA performed under regional anesthesia. After propensity score matching, the data of 1886 patients were analyzed, with 943 patients in each group. There was no significant difference in mortality (0.32% vs 0.00%), transfusion rate (84.52% vs 84.73%, P = .8989), and length of hospital stay (50 vs 53, P = .5391) between the general and regional anesthesia groups. Most of the complications were not significantly different, but the major complications, including myocardial infarction (1.70% vs 0.64%, P = .0414) and acute renal failure (0.85% vs 0.11%, P = .0391), were higher in the general anesthesia group than in the regional anesthesia group. Also, admission to the intensive care unit (8.48% vs 2.33%, P < .0001) and total cost ($8067, 400 vs $7487, 940, P = .0002) were higher in the general anesthesia group than in the regional anesthesia group. Our study found that regional anesthesia for TKA is associated with a decrease in major complications, including myocardial infarction and acute renal failure, and medical costs.
