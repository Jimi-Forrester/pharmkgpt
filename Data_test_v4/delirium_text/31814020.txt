31814020|t|Ethnicity-specific and overlapping alterations of brain hydroxymethylome in Alzheimer's disease.
31814020|a|5-Methylcytosine (5mC), generated through the covalent addition of a methyl group to the fifth carbon of cytosine, is the most prevalent DNA modification in humans and functions as a critical player in the regulation of tissue and cell-specific gene expression. 5mC can be oxidized to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes, which is enriched in brain. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, and several studies using the samples collected from Caucasian cohorts have found that epigenetics, particularly cytosine methylation, could play a role in the etiological process of AD. However, little research has been conducted using the samples of other ethnic groups. Here we generated genome-wide profiles of both 5mC and 5hmC in human frontal cortex tissues from late-onset Chinese AD patients and cognitively normal controls. We identified both Chinese-specific and overlapping differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs) with Caucasian cohorts. Pathway analyses revealed specific pathways enriched among Chinese-specific DhMRs, as well as the shared DhMRs with Caucasian cohorts. Furthermore, two important transcription factor-binding motifs, hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha (HIF2alpha) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha), were enriched in the DhMRs. Our analyses provide the first genome-wide profiling of DNA hydroxymethylation of the frontal cortex of AD patients from China, emphasizing an important role of 5hmC in AD pathogenesis and highlighting both ethnicity-specific and overlapping changes of brain hydroxymethylome in AD.
