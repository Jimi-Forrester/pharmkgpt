30847942|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major health problem worldwide, with no effective treatment approach. Curcumin is the main ingredient of turmeric traditionally used in Asian medicine. Several experimental studies have indicated the protective effect of curcumin and its novel formulations in AD. Curcumin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic activities, proposing a strong potential to prevent neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are no sufficient clinical trials to confirm curcumin use in AD patients. Low bioavailability following oral administration of curcumin limits its usage in human. The present study was designed to gather the effects of curcumin and its modified formulations in human and experimental models of AD.
