11953458|a|beta-Site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) initiates the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to the generation of beta-amyloid, the main component of Alzheimer's disease senile plaques. BACE (Asp2, memapsin 2) is a type I transmembrane aspartic protease responsible for the beta-secretase cleavage of APP producing a soluble form of the ectodomain (sAPPbeta) and the membrane-bound, carboxy-terminal intermediates C99 and C89. BACE maturation involves cysteine bridge formation, N -glycosylation and propeptide removal. We investigated variants of BACE in which the disulphide bonds of the catalytic domain spanning between Cys216/Cys420, Cys278/Cys443 and Cys330/Cys380 were removed by mutagenesis. When transfected in cultured cells, these mutants showed impaired maturation. Nevertheless, a fraction of mutated protein retained both the competence to mature as well as the activity to process APP. For the generation of a functional enzyme the conserved Cys330/Cys380 bond was the most critical, whereas the two bonds between Cys216/Cys420 and Cys278/Cys443, which are typical for the membrane-bound BACE, appeared to be less important.
