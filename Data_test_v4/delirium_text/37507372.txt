37507372|a|Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as atherosclerosis, myocardial remodeling, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, heart failure, and oxidative stress are among the greatest threats to human health worldwide. Cardiovascular pathogenesis has been studied for decades, and the influence of epigenetic changes on CVDs has been extensively studied. Post-translational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation, glycosylation, methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, ubiquitin-like and nitrification, play important roles in the normal functioning of the cardiovascular system. Over the past decade, with the application of high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), an increasing number novel acylation modifications have been discovered, including propionylation, crotonylation, butyrylation, succinylation, lactylation, and isonicotinylation. Each change in protein conformation has the potential to alter protein function and lead to CVDs, and this process is usually reversible. This article summarizes the mechanisms underlying several common PTMs involved in the occurrence and development of CVDs.
