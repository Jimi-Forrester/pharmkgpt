36571372|a|Reactive oxygen species and other free radicals cause oxidative stress which is the underlying pathogenesis of cellular injury in various neurological diseases. Molecular hydrogen therapy with its unique biological property of selectively scavenging pathological free radicals has demonstrated therapeutic potential in innumerable animal studies and some clinical trials. These studies have implicated several cellular pathways affected by hydrogen therapy in explaining its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. This article reviews relevant animal and clinical studies that demonstrate neuroprotective effects of hydrogen therapy in stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, neurotrauma, and global brain injury.
