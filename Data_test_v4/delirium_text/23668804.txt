23668804|a|OBJECTIVE: Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant drug, augmenting serotonin reuptake and preventing stress-associated changes in the brain. In this paper, we present the use of tianeptine in eight American treatment-resistant patients with major depressive disorder. METHODS: Two male and six female patients with major depressive disorder, aged 44-72 years with duration of the illness 3-40 years, were studied. All met criteria for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) as they failed four or more trials of medication, and two failed both ECT and Vagal Nerve Stimulation trials. In three patients, the drug was used as monotherapy, and in five, it was added to ongoing antidepressant treatment. RESULTS: The remission (<= 7 points on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) after 8 weeks of treatment was obtained in four female patients (50%). Of them, three still require other psychotropic medications to remain in remission and all four responders have been in remission with ongoing treatment with tianeptine for > 2 years. In two patients, the drug was terminated due to the incidence of delirium, and in one, it was due to severe agitation. CONCLUSION: The results may suggest a possible usefulness of tianeptine in selected patients with TRD. They also point to a possible serious side effect of this drug not hitherto reported.
