35194433|t|The Evaluation of Melatonin Effects on Mobilization and Engraftment in Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients; A Randomized, Double-blind and Placebo-controlled Trial.
35194433|a|Mobilization and engraftment of Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) are challenging issues in Autologous HSC transplantation (AHSCT) so several attempts such as colony-stimulating factors (CSF) and plerixafor have been used for enhancement of HSCs mobilization and engraftment. In this randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the melatonin's efficacy and safety, as endogenous CSF inducer, co-administered with Filgrastim in mobilizing and engraftment of HSC. AHSCT patients were randomized to receive either Melatonin or placebo plus filgrastim. Of Fifty-one patients, 26 patients received the melatonin (In mobilization phase 3 mg sublingual twice daily, then 9 mg single dose 30 min before apheresis session and then 3 mg twice daily from +1 until engraftment) and 25 patients received the placebo. The mean number of CD34 cells/kg x 106 in the melatonin group was 6.54 versus 4.22 in the placebo group (p = 0.025). The mean day to neutrophil engraftment in the melatonin group was 11.69 +- 2.093, whereas 12.68 +- 2.42 days in the placebo group (p = 0.021). In this study, the second apheresis session requirement, the use of plerixafor and hospital stay duration, were comparable between the two groups. Considering the result of the study, it could be suggested that melatonin plus Filgrastim can be effectively used in AHSCT patients to enhance the number of peripheral CD34 cells/kg x 106 and decrease the day number of neutrophil engraftment.
