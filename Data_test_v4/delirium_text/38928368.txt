38928368|t|Copper, Iron, Cadmium, and Arsenic, All Generated in the Universe: Elucidating Their Environmental Impact Risk on Human Health Including Clinical Liver Injury.
38928368|a|Humans are continuously exposed to various heavy metals including copper, iron, cadmium, and arsenic, which were specifically selected for the current analysis because they are among the most frequently encountered environmental mankind and industrial pollutants potentially causing human health hazards and liver injury. So far, these issues were poorly assessed and remained a matter of debate, also due to inconsistent results. The aim of the actual report is to thoroughly analyze the positive as well as negative effects of these four heavy metals on human health. Copper and iron are correctly viewed as pollutant elements essential for maintaining human health because they are part of important enzymes and metabolic pathways. Healthy individuals are prepared through various genetically based mechanisms to maintain cellular copper and iron homeostasis, thereby circumventing or reducing hazardous liver and organ injury due to excessive amounts of these metals continuously entering the human body. In a few humans with gene aberration, however, liver and organ injury may develop because excessively accumulated copper can lead to Wilson disease and substantial iron deposition to hemochromatosis. At the molecular level, toxicities of some heavy metals are traced back to the Haber Weiss and Fenton reactions involving reactive oxygen species formed in the course of oxidative stress. On the other hand, cellular homeostasis for cadmium and arsenic cannot be provided, causing their life-long excessive deposition in the liver and other organs. Consequently, cadmium and arsenic represent health hazards leading to higher disability-adjusted life years and increased mortality rates due to cancer and non-cancer diseases. For unknown reasons, however, liver injury in humans exposed to cadmium and arsenic is rarely observed. In sum, copper and iron are good for the human health of most individuals except for those with Wilson disease or hemochromatosis at risk of liver injury through radical formation, while cadmium and arsenic lack any beneficial effects but rather are potentially hazardous to human health with a focus on increased disability potential and risk for cancer. Primary efforts should focus on reducing the industrial emission of hazardous heavy metals.
