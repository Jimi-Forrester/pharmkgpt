38298897|t|Transcriptional response to mild therapeutic hypothermia in noise-induced cochlear injury.
38298897|a|Introduction: Prevention or treatment for acoustic injury has been met with many translational challenges, resulting in the absence of FDA-approved interventions. Localized hypothermia following noise exposure mitigates acute cochlear injury and may serve as a potential avenue for therapeutic approaches. However, the mechanisms by which hypothermia results in therapeutic improvements are poorly understood. Methods: This study performs the transcriptomic analysis of cochleae from juvenile rats that experienced noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) followed by hypothermia or control normothermia treatment. Results: Differential gene expression results from RNA sequencing at 24 h post-exposure to noise suggest that NIHL alone results in increased inflammatory and immune defense responses, involving complement activation and cytokine-mediated signaling. Hypothermia treatment post-noise, in turn, may mitigate the acute inflammatory response. Discussion: This study provides a framework for future research to optimize hypothermic intervention for ameliorating hearing loss and suggests additional pathways that could be targeted for NIHL therapeutic intervention.
