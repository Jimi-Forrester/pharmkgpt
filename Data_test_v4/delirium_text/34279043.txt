34279043|t|Longitudinal Changes in Hippocampal Network Connectivity in Alzheimer's Disease.
34279043|a|OBJECTIVE: The hippocampus is connected to 2 distinct cortical brain networks, the posterior-medial and the anterior-temporal networks, involving different medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. The aim of this study was to assess the functional alterations of these 2 networks, their changes over time, and links to cognition in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We assessed MTL connectivity in 53 amyloid-beta-positive patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia and 68 healthy elderly controls, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. First, we compared the functional connectivity of the posterior-medial and anterior-temporal networks within the control group to highlight their specificities. Second, we compared the connectivity of these networks between groups, and between baseline and 18-month follow-up in patients. Third, we assessed the association in the connectivity changes between the 2 networks, and with cognitive performance. RESULTS: We found decreased connectivity in patients specifically between the hippocampus and the posterior-medial network, together with increased connectivity between several MTL subregions and the anterior-temporal network. Moreover, changes in the posterior-medial and anterior-temporal networks were interrelated such that decreased MTL-posterior-medial connectivity was associated with increased MTL-anterior-temporal connectivity. Finally, both MTL-posterior-medial decrease and MTL-anterior-temporal increase predicted cognitive decline. INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate that longitudinal connectivity changes in the posterior-medial and anterior-temporal hippocampal networks are linked together and that they both contribute to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. These results shed light on the critical role of the posterior-medial and anterior-temporal networks in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and clinical symptoms. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:391-406.
