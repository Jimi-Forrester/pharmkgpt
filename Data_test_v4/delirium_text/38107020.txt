38107020|a|Background: COVID-19 patients can report 'brain fog' and may exhibit cognitive symptoms for months after recovery (Cognitive COVID). However, evidence on whether and the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts cognition irrespective of COVID-19 course and severity is limited to clinical samples and mainly comes from prognostic studies. We aimed to explore the association between serologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and cognitive functioning in community-based and institutionalized older adults, irrespective of COVID-19 symptoms. Methods: We conducted a case-control study nested into two cohorts in Southern Switzerland. Eligible subjects were Italian speaking older adults, without a previous diagnosis of dementia, who underwent serological testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between November 2020 and July 2021. We manually selected age-, sex- and education-matched cases (i.e., individuals with a serologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection), with seronegative controls, and we conducted in-person neuropsychological assessments using validated, highly sensitive cognitive tests. Results: We completed 38 neuropsychological assessments in a mostly female sample of older adults (Mean age: 83.13 +- 8.95; 86.8% women). 17 were community dwelling individuals while 21 lived in a nursing home. As expected, socio-demographic characteristics of age, gender and educational level were similarly distributed between cases (n = 14) and controls (n = 24). In linear regression models, cases had significantly lower scores in cognitive tasks of memory (beta = -0.367, p = 0.023), attention (beta = 0.428, p = 0.008) and executive functions (beta = 0.326, p = 0.046). We found no significant difference in tests of language and spatial-temporal orientation (all p values > 0.05). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with cognitive impairment in memory, attention, and executive functions in older adults. Our findings are consistent with mechanistic evidence of the neurotropism of the virus and provide empirical support for the "Cognitive COVID" construct also in non-clinical samples. With nearly 800 million COVID-19 cases (in April 2023), and many more infections worldwide, the clinical and public health implications of Cognitive COVID due to SARS-CoV-2 infection may be massive and warrant further epidemiological investigations.
