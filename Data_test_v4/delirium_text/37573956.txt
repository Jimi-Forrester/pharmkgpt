37573956|a|The progressive myoclonic epilepsies (PMEs) are a group of rare neurodegenerative diseases characterized by myoclonus, epileptic seizures, and progressive neurological deterioration with cerebellar involvement. They include storage diseases like Gaucher disease, Lafora disease, and forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). To date, 13 NCLs have been reported (CLN1-CLN8, CLN10-CLN14), associated with mutations in different genes. These forms, which affect both children and adults, are characterized by seizures, cognitive and motor impairments, and in most cases visual loss. In NCLs, as in other PMEs, central nervous system (CNS) neurodegeneration is widespread and involves different subpopulations of neurons. One of the most affected regions is the cerebellar cortex, where motor and non-motor information is processed and transmitted to deep cerebellar nuclei through the axons of Purkinje cells (PCs). PCs, being GABAergic, have an inhibitory effect on their target neurons, and provide the only inhibitory output of the cerebellum. Degeneration of PCs has been linked to motor impairments and epileptic seizures. Seizures occur when some insult upsets the normal balance in the CNS between excitatory and inhibitory impulses, causing hyperexcitability. Here we review the role of PCs in epilepsy onset and progression following their PME-related loss. In particular, we focus on the involvement of PCs in seizure phenotype in NCLs, highlighting findings from case reports and studies of animal models in which epilepsy can be linked to PC loss.
