33653170|a|OBJECTIVE: Delirium is stressful for both the patient and caregiver. However, caregivers have attracted minimal attention. We here identify depressed moods and associated factors among caregivers and caregiver knowledge of the delirium and non-pharmacological management. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Caregiver and patient demographic characteristics, and patient clinical data, were collected. Caregiver depressed mood was analysed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale (HADS-D). We explored caregiver understanding of delirium and knowledge of non-pharmacological management. We used a multivariate linear regression model to identify factors associated with caregiver depressed mood. RESULTS: For 224 caregivers, the median (interquartile range) HADS-D score was 8.0 (4.0-11.8). More than half (54.9%) had scores >=8. Answers to multiple choice questions revealed that delirium was frequently misinterpreted as "anxiety" (25.9%) or "dementia" (25.4%). Of all caregivers, 74% had received no information on non-pharmacological delirium management. Younger age of patient, a longer time from delirium detection to consultation, a patient past history of depression, a spousal relation with the patient, and misinterpretation of delirium as dementia were associated with the depressed mood of caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: The mental health of caregivers of patients with delirium requires more attention; they should be recommended to be informed and educated about delirium. Also, the clinicians need to find an easier term for the delirium to help caregivers understand.
