38396946|t|Long Non-Coding RNAs: New Insights in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
38396946|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are gradually becoming a burden to society. The adverse effects and mortality/morbidity rates associated with these NDDs are a cause of many healthcare concerns. The pathologic alterations of NDDs are related to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation, which further stimulate the progression of NDDs. Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have attracted ample attention as critical mediators in the pathology of NDDs. However, there is a significant gap in understanding the biological function, molecular mechanisms, and potential importance of lncRNAs in NDDs. This review documents the current research on lncRNAs and their implications in NDDs. We further summarize the potential implication of lncRNAs to serve as novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers for patients with NDDs.
