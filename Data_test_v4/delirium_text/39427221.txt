39427221|t|Amyloid deposition and its association with depressive symptoms and cognitive functions in late-life depression: a longitudinal study using amyloid-beta PET images and neuropsychological measurements.
39427221|a|BACKGROUND: Although depression is linked to an increased risk of dementia, the association between late-onset depression (LOD) and amyloid burden remains unclear. This study aimed to determine amyloid deposition in patients with LOD compared to healthy controls (HC) using amyloid-beta (Abeta) positron emission tomography (PET) images and neuropsychological assessments. METHODS: Forty patients first diagnosed with major depressive disorder after the age of 60 (LOD) and twenty-one healthy volunteers (HC) were enrolled. Depression and anxiety were evaluated using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and Clinical Global Impression Scale. Cognitive function was assessed using the Korean versions of the Mini-Mental Status Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery at baseline and 3-month follow-up. 18F-florbetapir PET images were co-registered with T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in Abeta deposition between LOD and HC groups. No significant correlation between Abeta burden and depressive symptom severity was found in LOD patients. Higher somatic anxiety was correlated with lower Abeta burden in multiple brain regions, including the left inferior frontal lobe (p = 0.009), right anterior cingulate (p = 0.003), and right superior frontal lobe (p = 0.009). Despite cognitive recovery in areas such as attention (Digit Span Forward, p = 0.026), memory (Auditory Verbal Learning Test Recall Total, p = 0.010; Rey Complex Figure Test Delayed Recall, p = 0.039), and frontal executive function (Contrasting Program, p = 0.033) after three months of antidepressant treatment, cognitive improvement showed no association with amyloid deposition. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest distinct mechanisms may underlie amyloid deposition in neurodegenerative changes associated with depression. While amyloid burden in specific brain regions negatively correlated with somatic anxiety, it showed no significant correlation with the severity of depression or overall cognitive function.
