35930103|t|Distribution Patterns of Astrocyte Populations in the Human Cortex.
35930103|a|Astrocytes are a major class of glial cell in the central nervous system that have a diverse range of types and functions thought to be based on their anatomical location, morphology and cellular properties. Recent studies highlight that astrocyte dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of neurological conditions. However, few studies have described the pattern, distribution and density of astrocytes in the adult human cortex. This study mapped the distribution and density of astrocytes immunolabelled with a range of cytoskeletal and membrane markers in the human frontal cortex. Distinct and overlapping astrocyte populations were determined. The frontal cortex from ten normal control cases (75 +- 9 years) was immunostained with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 L1 (ALDH1L1), connexin-43 (Cx43), aquaporin-4 (AQP4), and glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1). All markers labelled populations of astrocytes in the grey and white matter, separate cortical layers, subpial and perivascular regions. All markers were informative for labelling different cellular properties and cellular compartments of astrocytes. ALDH1L1 labelled the largest population of astrocytes, and Cx43-immunopositive astrocytes were found in all cortical layers. AQP4 and GLT-1 labelled distal astrocytic process and end-feet in the same population of astrocytes (98% of GLT-1-immunopositive astrocytes contained AQP4). In contrast, GFAP, the most widely used marker, predominantly labelled astrocytes in superficial cortical layers. This study highlights the diversity of astrocytes in the human cortex, providing a reference map of the distribution of distinct and overlapping astrocyte populations which can be used for comparative purposes in various disease, inflammatory and injury states involving astrocytes.
