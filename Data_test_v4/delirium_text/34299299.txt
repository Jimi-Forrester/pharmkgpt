34299299|t|Small Rab GTPases in Intracellular Vesicle Trafficking: The Case of Rab3A/Raphillin-3A Complex in the Kidney.
34299299|a|Small Rab GTPases, the largest group of small monomeric GTPases, regulate vesicle trafficking in cells, which are integral to many cellular processes. Their role in neurological diseases, such as cancer and inflammation have been extensively studied, but their implication in kidney disease has not been researched in depth. Rab3a and its effector Rabphillin-3A (Rph3A) expression have been demonstrated to be present in the podocytes of normal kidneys of mice rats and humans, around vesicles contained in the foot processes, and they are overexpressed in diseases with proteinuria. In addition, the Rab3A knockout mice model induced profound cytoskeletal changes in podocytes of high glucose fed animals. Likewise, RphA interference in the Drosophila model produced structural and functional damage in nephrocytes with reduction in filtration capacities and nephrocyte number. Changes in the structure of cardiac fiber in the same RphA-interference model, open the question if Rab3A dysfunction would produce simultaneous damage in the heart and kidney cells, an attractive field that will require attention in the future.
