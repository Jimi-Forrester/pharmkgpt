38666085|a|INTRODUCTION: Soluble amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers have been suggested as initiating Abeta related neuropathologic change in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but their quantitative distribution and chronological sequence within the AD continuum remain unclear. METHODS: A total of 526 participants in early clinical stages of AD and controls from a longitudinal cohort were neurobiologically classified for amyloid and tau pathology applying the AT(N) system. Abeta and tau oligomers in the quantified cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured using surface-based fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (sFIDA) technology. RESULTS: Across groups, highest Abeta oligomer levels were found in A+ with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment. Abeta oligomers were significantly higher in A+T- compared to A-T- and A+T+. APOE epsilon4 allele carriers showed significantly higher Abeta oligomer levels. No differences in tau oligomers were detected. DISCUSSION: The accumulation of Abeta oligomers in the CSF peaks early within the AD continuum, preceding tau pathology. Disease-modifying treatments targeting Abeta oligomers might have the highest therapeutic effect in these disease stages. Highlights: Using surface-based fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (sFIDA) technology, we quantified Abeta oligomers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of the DZNE-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (DELCODE) cohortAbeta oligomers were significantly elevated in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)Amyloid-positive subjects in the subjective cognitive decline (SCD) group increased compared to the amyloid-negative control groupInterestingly, levels of Abeta oligomers decrease at advanced stages of the disease (A+T+), which might be explained by altered clearing mechanisms.
