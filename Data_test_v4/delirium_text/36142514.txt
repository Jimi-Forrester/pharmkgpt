36142514|a|L-serine is a non-essential amino acid endogenously produced by astrocytes and is abundant in human diets. Beneficial roles of the metabolic products from L-serine in various conditions in the brain including neuronal development have been reported. Through several preclinical studies, L-serine treatment was also shown to offer beneficial therapeutic effects for brain damage such as ischemic stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Despite evidence for the value of L-serine in the clinic, however, its beneficial effects on the propionic acid (PPA)-induced neuronal toxicity and underlying mechanisms of L-serine-mediated neuroprotection are unknown. In this study, we observed that PPA-induced acidic stress induces abnormal lipid accumulation and functional defects in lysosomes of hippocampal neurons. L-serine treatment was able to rescue the structure and function of lysosomes in PPA-treated hippocampal neuronal cells. We further identified that L-serine suppressed the formation of lipid droplets and abnormal lipid membrane accumulations inside the lysosomes in PPA-treated hippocampal neuronal cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that L-serine can be utilized as a neuroprotective agent for the functionality of lysosomes through restoration of cathepsin D in disease conditions.
