11455910|t|[Clomethiazole as an adjuvant in the treatment of confusional psychosis].
11455910|a|We report on the successful treatment of two female patients with the clinical features of severe confusional psychosis. The clinical picture of these cases was characterized by lability of mood, disorientation, delusions, hallucinations, misidentification of persons, severe thought disorder and impaired memory. A 55-year old female inpatient suffered from a psychotic episode with the clinical features of confusional psychosis. Medical history showed three proceeding confusional psychotic episodes. In the second case a 32-year old female inpatient suffered from a severe postpartum psychosis with the clinical features of confusional psychosis. In this case there was no clinical history of psychotic episodes. After nonresponsive treatment with neuroleptics and mood-stabilizers, both responded rapidly to additional medication with clomethiazole within a week, exhibiting a marked reduction in clinical signs and symptoms. A brief review about this delirium-like psychosis and current knowledge of therapeutic strategies is presented. We discuss clomethiazole as a possible potential adjunct in the treatment of confusional psychoses.
