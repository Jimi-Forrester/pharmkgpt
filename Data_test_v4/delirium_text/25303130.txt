25303130|a|UNLABELLED: Delirium is frequently observed in intensive care unit patients and its occurrence is related to increased morbidity and mortality, length of stay, functional decline and high costs. The Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit is a tool that facilitates early identification and occurrence of delirium among intubated patients. OBJECTIVE: To verify the aspects of delirium studied by means of the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit. A literature review was conducted in the LILACS, MedLine, PubMed and CINAHL databases, from 2001, when the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit was validated, to 2008. Descriptors used for LILACS, MedLine and PubMed were delirium and intensive care unit, while for the CINAHL database, delirium and intensive care were used. From 293 articles, 35 were selected. The aspects analyzed disclosed, different types of delirium in different intensive care units. Variation in sensitivity was of 93% to 100% and variation in specificity, 89% to 100% of the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit, an important tool for detection, characterization and control of delirium and its impact. The aspects of delirium studied by means of the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit were: the performance index, identification, management, cost of treatment, morbidity and mortality due to delirium.
