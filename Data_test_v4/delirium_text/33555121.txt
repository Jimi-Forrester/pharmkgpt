33555121|a|OBJECTIVE: Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are relatively fast-growing tumours, and delay of treatment is associated with tumour progression and adverse outcomes. The aim of this study is to identify determinants of delay in a head and neck oncology centre. METHODS: This cohort study with prospectively collected data investigated associations between patient (including geriatric assessment at first consultation), tumour and treatment characteristics and treatment delay. Two quality indicator intervals assessing value-based healthcare were studied: care pathway interval (CPI, interval between first visit in an HNOC and treatment initiation) and time-to-treatment initiation (TTI, interval between histopathological confirmation of HNSCC and treatment initiation), using regression analyses. RESULTS: Stage-IV tumours and initial radiotherapy were independent predictors of delay in CPI. Initial radiotherapy was associated with delay in TTI. Overall, 37% of the patients started treatment within 30 days after first consultation (67% in case of initial surgical treatment and 11.5% if treated with (chemo)radiation, p < 0.001). Geriatric assessment outcomes were not associated with delay. Indicators for delay in initial surgery patients were stage-IV tumours (CPI). CONCLUSION: The majority of HNSCC patients encounter delay in treatment initiation, specifically in patients with advanced-stage tumours or when radiotherapy is indicated.
