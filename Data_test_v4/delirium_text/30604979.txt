30604979|a|The objective of this article is to review and integrate interrelated areas of research on personality and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prospective studies indicate that individuals who score higher on conscientiousness (more responsible and self-disciplined) and lower on neuroticism (less anxious and vulnerable to stress) have a reduced risk of developing dementia, even in the presence of AD neuropathology. Personality is also related to measures of cognitive performance and cognitive decline, with effect sizes similar to those of other clinical, lifestyle, and behavioral risk factors. These associations are unlikely to be due to reverse causality: Long-term prospective data indicate that there are no changes in personality that are an early sign of the disease during the preclinical phase of AD. With the onset and progression of dementia, however, there are large changes in personality that are reported consistently by caregivers in retrospective studies and are consistent with the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of dementia. The review also discusses potential mechanisms of the observed associations and emphasizes the need for prospective studies to elucidate the interplay of personality traits with AD neuropathology (amyloid and tau biomarkers) in modulating the risk and timing of onset of clinical dementia. The article concludes with the implications of personality research for identifying those at greater risk of AD and the potential of personality-tailored interventions aimed at the prevention and treatment of AD.
