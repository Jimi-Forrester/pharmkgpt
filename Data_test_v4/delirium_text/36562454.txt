36562454|t|Arterial Spin-Labeling Parameters and Their Associations with Risk Factors, Cerebral Small-Vessel Disease, and Etiologic Subtypes of Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.
36562454|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral small-vessel disease may alter cerebral blood flow (CBF) leading to brain changes and, hence, cognitive impairment and dementia. CBF and the spatial coefficient of variation can be measured quantitatively by arterial spin-labeling. We aimed to investigate the associations of demographics, vascular risk factors, location, and severity of cerebral small-vessel disease as well as the etiologic subtypes of cognitive impairment and dementia with CBF and the spatial coefficient of variation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred ninety patients with a diagnosis of no cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment no dementia, vascular cognitive impairment no dementia, Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia were recruited from the memory clinic. Cerebral microbleeds and lacunes were categorized into strictly lobar, strictly deep, and mixed-location and enlarged perivascular spaces into the centrum semiovale and basal ganglia. Total and region-specific white matter hyperintensity volumes were segmented using FreeSurfer. CBF (n = 333) and the spatial coefficient of variation (n = 390) were analyzed with ExploreASL from 2D-EPI pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling images in white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM). To analyze the effect of demographic and vascular risk factors as well as the location and severity of cerebral small-vessel disease markers on arterial spin-labeling parameters, we constructed linear regression models, whereas logistic regression models were used to determine the association between arterial spin-labeling parameters and cognitive impairment no dementia, vascular cognitive impairment no dementia, Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia. RESULTS: Increasing age, male sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of heart disease, and smoking were associated with lower CBF and a higher spatial coefficient of variation. Higher numbers of lacunes and cerebral microbleeds were associated with lower CBF and a higher spatial coefficient of variation. Location-specific analysis showed mixed-location lacunes and cerebral microbleeds were associated with lower CBF. Higher total, anterior, and posterior white matter hyperintensity volumes were associated with a higher spatial coefficient of variation. No association was observed between enlarged perivascular spaces and arterial spin-labeling parameters. A higher spatial coefficient of variation was associated with the diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairment no dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced CBF and an increased spatial coefficient of variation were associated with cerebral small-vessel disease, and more specifically lacunes, whereas cerebral microbleeds and white matter hyperintensities were associated with WM-CBF and GM spatial coefficient of variation. The spatial coefficient of variation was associated with cognitive impairment and dementia, suggesting that hypoperfusion might be the key underlying mechanism for vascular brain damage.
