34944462|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disease that is the most common cause of dementia. The incidence of AD is rapidly rising because of the aging of the world population. Because AD is presently incurable, early diagnosis is very important. The disease is characterized by pathological changes such as deposition of senile plaques and decreased concentration of the amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42) peptide in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The concentration of Abeta42 in the CSF is a well-studied AD biomarker. The specific peptide probe was screened through four rounds of biopanning, which included the phage display process. The screened peptide showed strong binding affinity in the micromolar range, and the enzyme-linked peptide assay was optimized using the peptide we developed. This diagnostic method showed specificity toward Abeta42 in the presence of other proteins. The peptide-binding site was also estimated using molecular docking analysis. Finally, the diagnostic method we developed could significantly distinguish patients who were classified based on amyloid PET images.
