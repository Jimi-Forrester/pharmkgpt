33783982|a|AIMS/INTRODUCTION: We aimed to examine the association between diabetes-related parameters and hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus atrophy (HPGA) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus to elucidate the risk factors for HPGA, which is often accompanied by Alzheimer's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 137 patients aged >=50 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean age 67.8 +- 9.8 years) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging scans and comprehensive health examinations. We measured the volume of interest - a portion of the inner temporal lobe that includes the hippocampus, amygdala and entorhinal cortex (frontal part of the parahippocampal gyrus) - using the voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer's disease in each patient. The diabetes-related parameters included glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, C-peptide (CPR) index (serum CPR / fasting plasma glucose x 100) and duration of diabetes. RESULTS: The mean glycated hemoglobin was 9.3 +- 2.2%, the median CPR index was 1.29 (interquartile range 0.85-1.74) and the median duration of diabetes was 10 years (interquartile range 3-20 years). The severity score of volume of interest atrophy was >1.0 in 36 patients. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that age (odds ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.15) and CPR index (odds ratio 0.451, 95% confidence interval 0.216-0.940) were significantly associated with HPGA. CONCLUSIONS: Lower insulin secretion was significantly associated with HPGA in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The results of this study support the hypothesis that insulin-signaling abnormalities are involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.
