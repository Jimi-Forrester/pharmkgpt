34084662|a|From the early stages of any neurodegenerative-disease mitochondrial functionality has been mortally extricated, though the exact timeline of these events is still unclear, it is likely to represent a progressive neurons-decline and cognitive-functions. Hence strategies suggested by herbal extract to restore mitochondrial functions may be a remedial approach to chronic neurodegenerative disorder like Alzheimer's disease (AD). This research was designed to evaluate if Abeta1-40 induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction could be inhibited by Allium Sativum (AS) supplementation. AD was induced by a single intra-hippocampal injection of Abeta1-40 (5 mug/4 mul), while herbal supplementation was given orally (100, 250, 500 mg/kg body weight, daily) for 3 weeks. Morris water maze was used to assess cognitive function shows deficits in Abeta1-40 treated animals, there is no significant alteration in locomotor function as examined by actophotometer. This was accompanied by enhancement in oxidative stress indicating by accentuated ROS and protein carbonyl levels. Concomitantly, decrease in activity of antioxidant enzymes was observed in diseased animals; as expressed by reduced superoxide-dismutase and catalase activity, as well as reduction in GSH levels and impaired mitochondrial functions. Medium dose of AS has been found effective in restoring the memory impairment along with antioxidant levels but high dose is more efficient as observed in the Abeta1-40 treated rats. High dose of AS, on the other hand significantly ameliorates the mitochondrial-dysfunction in comparison to medium dose. Taken together, the findings reveal that AS reverses Abeta1-40 induced brain alteration, it could be an efficient clinical mitigation action against AD growth.
