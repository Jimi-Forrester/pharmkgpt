35463515|t|Research on Pathogenic Hippocampal Voxel Detection in Alzheimer's Disease Using Clustering Genetic Random Forest.
35463515|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurological disease, which is closely associated with hippocampus, and subdividing the hippocampus into voxels can capture subtle signals that are easily missed by region of interest (ROI) methods. Therefore, studying interpretable associations between voxels can better understand the effect of voxel set on the hippocampus and AD. In this study, by analyzing the hippocampal voxel data, we propose a novel method based on clustering genetic random forest to identify the important voxels. Specifically, we divide the left and right hippocampus into voxels to constitute the initial feature set. Moreover, the random forest is constructed using the randomly selected samples and features. The genetic evolution is used to amplify the difference in decision trees and the clustering evolution is applied to generate offspring in genetic evolution. The important voxels are the features that reach the peak classification. The results demonstrate that our method has good classification and stability. Particularly, through biological analysis of the obtained voxel set, we find that they play an important role in AD by affecting the function of the hippocampus. These discoveries demonstrate the contribution of the voxel set to AD.
