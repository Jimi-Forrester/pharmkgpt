36314209|t|Hypothalamic Functional Connectivity and Apathy in People with Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitively Normal Healthy Controls.
36314209|a|BACKGROUND: Earlier studies have described the neural markers of apathy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but few focused on the motivation circuits. Here, we targeted hypothalamus, a hub of the motivation circuit. OBJECTIVE: To examine hypothalamic resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in relation to apathy. METHODS: We performed whole-brain regression of hypothalamic rsFC against Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) total score and behavioral, cognitive, and emotional subscores in 29 patients with AD/MCI and 28 healthy controls (HC), controlling for age, sex, education, cognitive status, and depression. We evaluated the results at a corrected threshold and employed path analyses to assess possible interaction between hypothalamic rsFCs, apathy and depression/memory. Finally, we re-examined the findings in a subsample of amyloid-beta-verified AD. RESULTS: AES total score correlated negatively with hypothalamic precuneus (PCu)/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and positively with left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and supramarginal gyrus rsFCs. Behavioral subscore correlated negatively with hypothalamic PCu/PCC and positively with middle frontal gyrus rsFC. Cognitive subscore correlated positively with hypothalamic MTG rsFC. Emotional subscore correlated negatively with hypothalamic calcarine cortex rsFC. In path analyses, hypothalamic-PCu/PCC rsFC negatively modulated apathy and, in turn, depression. The model where hypothalamic MTG rsFC and memory independently modulated apathy also showed a good fit. The findings of diminished hypothalamic-PCu/PCC rsFC in relation to apathy and, in turn, depression were confirmed in amyloid-verified AD. CONCLUSION: The findings together support a role of altered hypothalamic connectivity in relation to apathy and depression, and modulation of apathy by memory dysfunction.
