35313365|a|Human serum paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) is a critical antioxidant defense system against lipid oxidation. Decreased PON-1 activity has been associated with systemic oxidative stress in several disease states. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of plasma/serum concentrations of PON-1 paraoxonase and arylesterase activity in psoriasis, a chronic immune-mediated and inflammatory skin disease. The electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from inception to November 2021. In total, 14 studies in 691 psoriatic patients and 724 healthy controls were included in the meta-analysis. Serum paraoxonase activity was significantly lower in psoriatic patients (SMD = - 2.30, 95% CI - 3.17 to - 1.42; p < 0.001); however, no significant between-group differences were observed in serum arylesterase activity (SMD = - 0.34, 95% CI - 0.11 to 0.80; p = 0.14). The pooled SMD values were not substantially altered in sensitivity analysis. There was no publication bias. In conclusion, our meta-analysis has shown that serum paraoxonase, but not arylesterase, activity is significantly lower in psoriasis, suggesting an impaired antioxidant defense in these patients.
