31096866|t|Pain, Opioid Intake, and Delirium Symptoms in Adults Following Joint Replacement Surgery.
31096866|a|This study examined the effects of pain and opioid intakes on subsyndromal delirium in older adults who had joint replacement surgery. Delirium assessments of 53 older adults were completed on the first, second, and third days following joint replacement surgery using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Statistical relationships were analyzed using correlations and multiple regressions. Subsyndromal delirium developed in 68% (n = 36) of participants. Pain was significantly related (p < .05) to increased delirium symptoms after accounting for preoperative risk factors of comorbidity, cognitive status, fall history, and preoperative fasting times, whereas opioid intake was not significantly associated with increased delirium symptoms. Findings suggest older adults with increased pain levels are at higher risk for subsyndromal delirium as well as delirium after joint replacement surgery.
