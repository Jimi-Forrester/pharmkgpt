31572186|t|Neuroinflammation as a Common Feature of Neurodegenerative Disorders.
31572186|a|Neurodegenerative diseases share the fact that they derive from altered proteins that undergo an unfolding process followed by formation of beta-structures and a pathological tendency to self-aggregate in neuronal cells. This is a characteristic of tau protein in Alzheimer's disease and several tauopathies associated with tau unfolding, alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease, and huntingtin in Huntington disease. Usually, the self-aggregation products are toxic to these cells, and toxicity spreads all over different brain areas. We have postulated that these protein unfolding events are the molecular alterations that trigger several neurodegenerative disorders. Most interestingly, these events occur as a result of neuroinflammatory cascades involving alterations in the cross-talks between glial cells and neurons as a consequence of the activation of microglia and astrocytes. The model we have hypothesized for Alzheimer's disease involves damage signals that promote glial activation, followed by nuclear factor NF-kbeta activation, synthesis, and release of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-12 that affect neuronal receptors with an overactivation of protein kinases. These patterns of pathological events can be applied to several neurodegenerative disorders. In this context, the involvement of innate immunity seems to be a major paradigm in the pathogenesis of these diseases. This is an important element for the search for potential therapeutic approaches for all these brain disorders.
