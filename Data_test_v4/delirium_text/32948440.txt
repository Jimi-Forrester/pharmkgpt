32948440|t|Glycogen synthase kinase-3: A putative target to combat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.
32948440|a|The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had turned out to be highly pathogenic and transmittable. Researchers throughout the globe are still struggling to understand this strain's aggressiveness in search of putative therapies for its control. Crosstalk between oxidative stress and systemic inflammation seems to support the progression of the infection. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk-3) is a conserved serine/threonine kinase that mainly participates in cell proliferation, development, stress, and inflammation in humans. Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is an important structural protein responsible for viral replication and interferes with the host defence mechanism by the help of Gsk-3 protein. The viral infected cells show activated Gsk-3 protein that degrades the Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) protein, resulting in excessive oxidative stress. Activated Gsk-3 also modulates CREB-DNA activity, phosphorylates NF-kappaB, and degrades beta-catenin, thus provokes systemic inflammation. Interaction between these two pathophysiological events, oxidative stress, and inflammation enhance mucous secretion, coagulation cascade, and hypoxia, which ultimately leads to multiple organs failure, resulting in the death of the infected patient. The present review aims to highlight the pathogenic role of Gsk-3 in viral replication, initiation of oxidative stress, and inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The review also summarizes the potential Gsk-3 pathway modulators as putative therapeutic interventions in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.
