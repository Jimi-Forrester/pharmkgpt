31773421|t|Nanotechnology to improve the Alzheimer's disease therapy with natural compounds.
31773421|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a form of dementia with high impact worldwide, accounting with more than 46 million cases. It is estimated that the number of patients will be four times higher in 2050. The initial symptoms of AD are almost imperceptible and typically involve lapses of memory in recent events. However, the available medicines still focus on controlling the symptoms and do not cure the disease. Regarding the advances in the discovery of new treatments for this devastating disease, natural compounds are gaining increasing relevance in the treatment of AD. Nevertheless, they present some limiting characteristics such as the low bioavailability and the low ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that hinder the development of effective therapies. To overcome these issues, the delivery of natural products by targeting nanocarriers has aroused a great interest, improving the therapeutic activity of these molecules. In this article, a review of the research progress on drug delivery systems (DDS) to improve the therapeutic activity of natural compounds with neuroprotective effects for AD is presented.
