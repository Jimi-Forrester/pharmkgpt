35758356|a|ABSTRACT: A growing body of literature suggests that oral health can influence cognitive function during aging. However, it is currently unclear whether reduced masticatory efficiency influences cognitive impairment in longitudinal studies.This study sought to investigate the effects of reduced chewing ability on the incidence of cognitive impairment using national representative data from 10 years of follow-up in Korea. Among the 10,254 people recruited in 2006 (1st wave), 7568 with normal cognitive function were selected. The participants were followed up every 2 years. The number of participants followed up until the 6th wave was 5020 in 2016. Chewing ability and scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination were recorded using self-reported questionnaires. Risk factors for dementia taken from systematic literature reviews were used as covariates. We performed logistic regression and created general estimating equation models after controlling for all covariates to assess the relationship between chewing ability and cognitive decline. Decreased chewing function was associated with mild cognitive impairment after controlling for confounding variables.The odds ratio for cognitive impairment was about 1.28 times higher than in people with poor chewing function as in those with good chewing function. We identified changes in chewing function from the 1st wave to the 6th wave; the odds ratios were 2.21 (95% confidence interval = 1.90-2.58) in the good-poor group and 2.11 (95% confidence interval = 1.74-2.55) in the poor-poor group.We identified an impairment in cognitive function in the poor (poor-poor and good-poor) chewing ability group. Therefore, we have confirmed that reduced mastication efficiency may contribute to a deterioration in cognitive function. People with deteriorated chewing ability must be given additional attention to aid in the prevention of cognitive decline.
