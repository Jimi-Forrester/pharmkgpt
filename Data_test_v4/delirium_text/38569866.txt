38569866|t|Diffusion Tensor Image Analysis ALong the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS): Revisiting the Meaning and Significance of the Method.
38569866|a|More than 5 years have passed since the Diffusion Tensor Image Analysis ALong the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS) method was proposed with the intention of evaluating the glymphatic system. This method is handy due to its noninvasiveness, provision of a simple index in a straightforward formula, and the possibility of retrospective analysis. Therefore, the ALPS method was adopted to evaluate the glymphatic system for many disorders in many studies. The purpose of this review is to look back and discuss the ALPS method at this moment.The ALPS-index was found to be an indicator of a number of conditions related to the glymphatic system. Thus, although this was expected in the original report, the results of the ALPS method are often interpreted as uniquely corresponding to the function of the glymphatic system. However, a number of subsequent studies have pointed out the problems on the data interpretation. As they rightly point out, a higher ALPS-index indicates predominant Brownian motion of water molecules in the radial direction at the lateral ventricular body level, no more and no less. Fortunately, the term "ALPS-index" has become common and is now known as a common term by many researchers. Therefore, the ALPS-index should simply be expressed as high or low, and whether it reflects a glymphatic system is better to be discussed carefully. In other words, when a decreased ALPS-index is observed, it should be expressed as "decreased ALPS-index" and not directly as "glymphatic dysfunction". Recently, various methods have been proposed to evaluate the glymphatic system. It has become clear that these methods also do not seem to reflect the entirety of the extremely complex glymphatic system. This means that it would be desirable to use various methods in combination to evaluate the glymphatic system in a comprehensive manner.
