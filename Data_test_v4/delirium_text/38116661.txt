38116661|a|INTRODUCTION: Providing integrated and evidence-based support to individuals and families following a diagnosis of dementia is essential in order to optimise their quality of life and assist them to live well. Memory clinics provide multidisciplinary services specialising in the assessment and post-diagnostic treatment of people with dementia. This study sought to identify current practices, barriers and facilitators to provision of postdiagnostic support and to obtain health professionals' opinion of ideal post-diagnostic support to be offered in Australian memory clinics. METHODOLOGY: This was a cross-sectional qualitative exploratory study. Data was collected from health professionals familiar with the process of diagnosis and post-diagnostic support through two expert panel meetings (n = 22). In addition, 5 focus groups (n = 22) were conducted including health professionals who are employed in Australian memory clinics. Data was collected between October 2020 and November 2021. Reflexive thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Seven themes and three subthemes were identified under the three topics: Current Practices, Barriers and Facilitators, and Desirable Support. Themes relating to Current Practices were: Tailored Communication and feedback about diagnosis; Prescription of medications and follow-up; and Referrals to health and community services. Themes relating to Barriers and Facilitators were: The structure of the current system; Lack of funding; Lack of resources; Call for government investment. Themes relating to Desirable support were: A key/single point of support; Cognitive interventions; and Counselling and education. CONCLUSION: Post-diagnostic support in Australian memory clinics focused primarily on ensuring people understood their diagnosis, information about postdiagnostic support was provided, and dementia medications were prescribed. There were notable differences in practices in metropolitan compared to regional areas. A key concern was the need for increased funding, particularly to support the establishment of a single point of contact to facilitate continuity of care.
