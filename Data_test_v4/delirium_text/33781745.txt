33781745|t|Discovery and characterization of small-molecule inhibitors of NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes.
33781745|a|Inflammasomes are macromolecular complexes involved in the host response to external and endogenous danger signals. Inflammasome-mediated sterile inflammation plays a central role in several human conditions such as autoimmune diseases, type-2 diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders, indicating inflammasomes could be appealing therapeutic targets. Previous work has demonstrated that inhibiting the ATPase activity of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), disrupts inflammasome assembly and function. However, there is a necessity to find new potent compounds with therapeutic potential. Here we combine computational modeling of the target and virtual screening to discover a group of novel compounds predicted to inhibit NLRP3. We characterized the best compounds and determined their potency, specificity, and ability to inhibit processes downstream from NLRP3 activation. Moreover, we analyzed in mice the competence of a lead candidate to reduce lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation. We also validated the active pharmacophore shared among all the NLRP3 inhibitors, and through computational docking, we clarify key structural features for compound positioning within the inflammasome ATP-binding site. Our study sets the basis for rational design and optimization of inflammasome-targeting probes and drugs.
