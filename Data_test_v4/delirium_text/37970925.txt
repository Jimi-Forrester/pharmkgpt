37970925|t|Characterization of the normal fetal circulatory system of the ductus venosus using sound complexity parameters.
37970925|a|The aim of this study was to characterize the normality of the fetal circulatory system through the time between ventricular systoles of the ductus venosus in the three gestational trimesters in healthy fetuses using nonlinear methods of the complexity of the signal. A prospective cohort study was conducted at the Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP) from December 2019 to May 2020. Pregnant women between 11 and 14 weeks, with intrauterine pregnancy and healthy fetus were included. Patients with multiple gestation, positive screening for congenital malformation, including heart disease, and under 18 years of age were excluded. Doppler velocimetry ultrasonography of the ductus venosus was performed between the 11th and 14th weeks, 20th and 24th weeks, and 28th and 32nd weeks of gestation, and then the sound signal was extracted and segmented from the videos. To compare the means between the gestational trimesters of the approximate entropy (ApEn) and Lempel-Ziv complexity (CLZ) of the time between ventricular systoles, the Friedman test was used, with a significance level of 5%. No statistically significant difference was found between the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters regarding the mean ApEn (P=0.281) and CLZ (P=0.595) of the time between ventricular systoles of the ductus venosus. Ductus venosus systolic time was not sensitive to differentiate fetal cardiovascular dynamics between gestational trimesters. This study pioneered the characterization of cardiovascular normality by nonlinear parameters of the fetal ductus venosus in all three trimesters.
