38929505|t|Role of Histone Modifications in Kidney Fibrosis.
38929505|a|Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by persistent kidney dysfunction, ultimately resulting in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Renal fibrosis is a crucial pathological feature of CKD and ESRD. However, there is no effective treatment for this condition. Despite the complex molecular mechanisms involved in renal fibrosis, increasing evidence highlights the crucial role of histone modification in its regulation. The reversibility of histone modifications offers promising avenues for therapeutic strategies to block or reverse renal fibrosis. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory implications of histone modifications in fibrosis may provide novel insights into more effective and safer therapeutic approaches. This review highlights the regulatory mechanisms and recent advances in histone modifications in renal fibrosis, particularly histone methylation and histone acetylation. The aim is to explore the potential of histone modifications as targets for treating renal fibrosis.
