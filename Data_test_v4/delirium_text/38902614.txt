38902614|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication among elderly patients after surgery. The Naples Prognostic Score (NPS), a novel prognostic marker based on immune-inflammatory and nutritional status, was widely used in the assessment of the prognosis of surgical patients. However, no study has evaluated the relationship between NPS and POD. The aim of this article was to investigate the association between NPS and POD and test the predictive efficacy of preoperative NPS for POD in elderly patients with gastrointestinal tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, we retrospectively collected perioperative data of 176 patients (>= 60 years) who underwent elective gastrointestinal tumor surgery from June 2022 to September 2023. POD was defined according to the chart-based method and the NPS was calculated for each patient. We compared all the demographics and laboratory data between POD and non-POD groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to explore risk factors of POD. Moreover, the accuracy of NPS in predicting POD was further assessed by utilizing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: 20 had POD (11.4%) in a total of 176 patients, with a median age of 71 (65-76). The outcomes by univariate analysis pointed out that age, ASA status >= 3, creatinine, white blood cell count, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and NPS were associated with the risk of POD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis further showed that age, ASA grade >= 3, FBG and NPS were independent risk factors of POD. Additionally, the ROC curves revealed that NPS allowed better prognostic capacity for POD than other variables with the largest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.798, sensitivity of 0.800 and specificity of 0.667, respectively. CONCLUSION: Age, ASA grade >= 3, and FBG were independent risk factors for POD in the elderly underwent gastrointestinal tumor surgery. Notably, the preoperative NPS was a more effective tool in predicting the incidence of POD, but prospective trials were still needed to further validate our conclusion. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The registration information for the experiment was shown below. (date: 3rd January 2024; number: ChiCTR2400079459).
