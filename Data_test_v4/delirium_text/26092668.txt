26092668|t|The role of mitochondrial disturbances in Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington diseases.
26092668|a|Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles involved in a multitude of cellular events. Disturbances of mitochondrial function and dynamics are associated with cells degeneration and death. Neurons, perhaps more than any other cell, depend on mitochondria for their survival. In fact, accumulating evidence reveals that mitochondria take center stage in several neurodegenerative diseases. Here we will give an overview of the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of a healthy mitochondrial pool in neuronal cells and how disturbances in these processes underlie the pathophysiology of three common neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington diseases. Additionally, we will discuss the role of sirtuins in neurodegeneration and how mitohormesis and vitagenes activation may counteract neurodegenerative events.
