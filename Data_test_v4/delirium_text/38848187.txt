38848187|t|Lung Function and Brain MRI Outcomes in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study.
38848187|a|Background: Brain imaging studies may provide etiologic insight into observed links between lung function and dementia and stroke. Objective: We evaluated associations of lung function measures with brain MRI markers of vascular and neurodegenerative disease in the ARIC Neurocognitive Study, as few studies have examined the associations. Methods: Lung function was measured at participants' midlife in 1990-1992 (mean age = 56+-5 years) and later-life in 2011-2013 (mean age = 76+-5 years), and brain MRI was performed in 2011-2013. Linear regression models were used to examine the associations of lung function with brain and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes, and logistic regression models were used for cerebral infarcts and microbleeds, adjusting for potential confounders. Results: In cross-sectional analysis (i.e., examining later-life lung function and MRI markers, n = 1,223), higher forced-expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were associated with larger brain and lower WMH volumes [e.g., 8.62 (95% CI:2.54-14.71) cm3 greater total brain volume per one-liter higher FEV1]. No association was seen with microbleeds in the overall sample, but higher FVC was associated with lower odds of microbleeds in never-smokers and higher odds in ever-smokers. In the cross-temporal analysis (i.e., associations with midlife lung function, n = 1,787), higher FVC levels were significantly associated with lower later-life brain volumes. Conclusions: Our results support modest associations of better lung function with less neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathology, although findings for microbleeds were unexpected in ever-smokers.
