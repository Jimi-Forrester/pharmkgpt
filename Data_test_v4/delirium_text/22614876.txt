22614876|a|Alzheimer's disease is growing in prevalence worldwide. Though many Western countries have developed programs of surveillance and care around Alzheimer's disease and dementia, certain regions of the world are beginning to recognize the magnitude of the disease burden in the general population. In the Middle East, there is growing awareness of the burden of Alzheimer's disease and how it impacts health economics, care delivery, and research. Here we summarize the proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease in the Middle East. We had speakers from 20 countries updating the audience on progress toward improving healthcare and research related to AD in this region of the world.
