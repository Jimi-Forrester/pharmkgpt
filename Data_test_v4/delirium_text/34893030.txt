34893030|a|BACKGROUND: Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) may help screen vascular cognitive impairment. A recently estimated CSVD score system was suggested to capture the overall CSVD burden. The study aimed to detect the association between systemic evaluation score of cerebral vascular imaging parameters with cognitive functions. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in community settings. From October 2017 to September 2018, elder ( 60) residents were recruited through on-site visit in 6 communities from Shanghai, China. The participants underwent brain MRI, carotid ultrasound, laboratory tests of blood and urine samples. Cognitive function was evaluated using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). MRI score of CSVD was calculated according to the 2012 standard for the evaluation of statistical changes in imaging. RESULTS: Total 171 subjects completed survey and examinations. There were 55 participants diagnosed with cognitive impairment, with a total percentage of 32.2%. Participants with and without cognitive impairment showed significant differences in age, BMI and education level. Cognitive impaired participant had more disease history/comorbidity of hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency, higher level of creatinine, as well as lower level of full blood count (FBC) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). A significant difference was detected in CSVD score between participants with and without cognitive impairment. Results of linear regression analysis showed significant negative correlations between MMSE score and both left and right carotid artery peak systolic velocity (PSV), however the CSVD score was only borderline (P = 0.0566) positively correlated with MMSE. Multivariate linear correlation analysis including all collected risk factor data showed that left carotid artery PSV score was among the independent negative correlated factors of MMSE. Multivariate binary logistic analysis showed that age, education and history of hypertension were the only statistically associated factors of cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: The current study identified high prevalence of cognitive impairment in a Chinese community. In addition, correlations between cerebral vascular disease imaging status and cognitive functions were confirmed although the sample size limited the possibility of screening cognitive impairment with imaging technique.
