38257800|t|Investigating the Potential Shared Molecular Mechanisms between COVID-19 and Alzheimer's Disease via Transcriptomic Analysis.
38257800|a|SARS-CoV-2 caused the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 may elevate the risk of cognitive impairment and even cause dementia in infected individuals; it may accelerate cognitive decline in elderly patients with dementia, possibly in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, the mechanisms underlying the interplay between AD and COVID-19 are still unclear. To investigate the underlying mechanisms and associations between AD progression and SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a series of bioinformatics research into SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, COVID-19 patients, AD patients, and SARS-CoV-2-infected AD patients. We identified the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in COVID-19 patients, AD patients, and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, and these DEGs are enriched in certain pathways, such as immune responses and cytokine storms. We constructed the gene interaction network with the signaling transduction module in the center and identified IRF7, STAT1, STAT2, and OAS1 as the hub genes. We also checked the correlations between several key transcription factors and the SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 pathway-related genes. We observed that ACE2 expression is positively correlated with IRF7 expression in AD and coronavirus infections, and interestingly, IRF7 is significantly upregulated in response to different RNA virus infections. Further snRNA-seq analysis indicates that NRGN neurons or endothelial cells may be responsible for the increase in ACE2 and IRF7 expression after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The positive correlation between ACE2 and IRF7 expressions is confirmed in the hippocampal formation (HF) of SARS-CoV-2-infected AD patients. Our findings could contribute to the investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between AD and COVID-19 and to the development of effective therapeutic strategies for AD patients with COVID-19.
