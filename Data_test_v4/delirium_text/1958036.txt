1958036|a|During research about high pressure, some divers presented an organic syndrome with delirium when the mixed gaz (hydrogen with oxygen) was in a particular level. All the divers were better and mental symptom disappeared during the coming back to normal level of gaz pressure. With the same pressure and mixed gaz animals show a distortion of dopamine's receptors and the authors try to give an explanation for that "hydrogen syndrome" occurrence. Pressure effects and ionizing power of hydrogen could be the beginning of dopamine's distortion.
