32707935|a|BACKGROUND: Differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex task due to the clinical similarity among neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies showed the role of lipid peroxidation in early AD development. However, the clinical validation of potential specific biomarkers in minimally invasive samples constitutes a great challenge in early AD diagnosis. METHODS: Plasma samples from participants classified into AD (n = 138), non-AD (including MCI and other dementias not due to AD) (n = 70) and healthy (n = 50) were analysed. Lipid peroxidation compounds (isoprostanes, isofurans, neuroprostanes, neurofurans) were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis for biomarkers' clinical validation was based on Elastic Net. RESULTS: A two-step diagnosis model was developed from plasma lipid peroxidation products to diagnose early AD specifically, and a bootstrap validated AUC of 0.74 was obtained. CONCLUSION: A promising AD differential diagnosis model was developed. It was clinically validated as a screening test. However, further external validation is required before clinical application.
