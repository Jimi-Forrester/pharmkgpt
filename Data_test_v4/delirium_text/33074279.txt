33074279|a|Excess aggregation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) is a fatal cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which leads to physiological toxicity. Inhibiting and disaggregating the Abeta aggregates is an effective strategy to reduce physiological toxicity in neuronal cells. Herein, conjugated polymer-based thermoresponsive micelles (CPMs) were designed with an efficient thermoresponsive surface and a reactive-oxygen-species (ROS)-generating core. In this work, the CPMs exhibited a strong capability to capture the toxic Abeta aggregates at physiological temperature. Under white-light irradiation, ROS was generated in the CPMs, and the toxic Abeta aggregates were efficiently disaggregated through the oxidation of ROS, leading to appropriate Abeta homeostasis between aggregation and disaggregation and reduced the Abeta-induced cytotoxicity. Therefore, the multifunctional micelles of CPMs with both capturing shells and ROS functional cores present a promising strategy to reduce Abeta fibrillation-induced cytotoxicity.
