35008671|a|Current data strongly suggest herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection in the brain as a contributing factor to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The consequences of HSV-1 brain infection are multilateral, not only are neurons and glial cells damaged, but modifications also occur in their environment, preventing the transmission of signals and fulfillment of homeostatic and immune functions, which can greatly contribute to the development of disease. In this review, we discuss the pathological alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) cells that occur, following HSV-1 infection. We describe the changes in neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes related to the production of inflammatory factors, transition of glial cells into a reactive state, oxidative damage, Abeta secretion, tau hyperphosphorylation, apoptosis, and autophagy. Further, HSV-1 infection can affect processes observed during brain aging, and advanced age favors HSV-1 reactivation as well as the entry of the virus into the brain. The host activates pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) for an effective antiviral response during HSV-1 brain infection, which primarily engages type I interferons (IFNs). Future studies regarding the influence of innate immune deficits on AD development, as well as supporting the neuroprotective properties of glial cells, would reveal valuable information on how to harness cytotoxic inflammatory milieu to counter AD initiation and progression.
