39232792|t|Postoperative physical rehabilitation in the elderly patient after emergency surgery. Influence on functional, cognitive and quality of live recovery: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial.
39232792|a|BACKGROUND: The progressive aging of the population has meant the increase in elderly patients requiring an urgent surgery. Older adults, especially those with frailty, have a higher risk for complications, functional and cognitive decline after urgent surgery. These patients have their functional and physiological reserve reduced which makes them more vulnerable to the effects of being bedridden. The consequences are at multiple levels emphasizing the functional loss or cognitive impairment, longer stays, mortality and institutionalization, delirium, poor quality of life and increased use of resources related to health. We aim to determine whether postoperative physical rehabilitation can prevent functional and cognitive decline and modify the posterior trajectory. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a randomized clinical trial, simple blinded, conducted in the Department of Surgery of a tertiary public hospital in Navarra (Hospital Universitario de Navarra), Spain. Patients >  = 70 years old undergoing urgent abdominal surgery who meet inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The intervention will consist of a multicomponent physical training programme, which will include progressive and supervised endurance, resistance and balance training for 4 weeks, twice weekly sessions with a total of 8 sessions, and the group control will receive the usual care. The primary outcome measure is the change in functional (SPPB) and cognitive status (Mini-Mental State Examination) and the change of quality of life (EuroQol-5D-VAS) during the study period. The secondary outcomes are postoperative complications, length of stay, delirium, mortality, use of health resources, functional status (Barthel Index and handgrip strength tests), cost per quality-adjusted life year and mininutritional assessment. The data for both the intervention group and the control group will be obtained at four different times: the initial visit during hospital admission and at months 1, 3 and 6 months after hospital discharge. DISCUSSION: If our hypothesis is correct, this project could show that individualized and progressive exercise programme provides effective therapy for improving the functional capacity and achieve a better functional, cognitive and quality of life recovery. This measure, without entailing a significant expense for the administration, probably has an important repercussion both in the short- and long-term recovery, improving care and functional parameters and could determine a lower subsequent need for health resources. To verify this, we will carry out a cost-effectiveness study. The clinical impact of this trial can be significant if we help to modify the traditional management of the elderly patients from an illness model to a more person-centred and functionally oriented perspective. Moreover, the prescription of individualized exercise can be routinely included in the clinical practice of these patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05290532. Version 1.
