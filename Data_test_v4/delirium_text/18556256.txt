18556256|t|Serial protein labeling with infrared maleimide dyes to identify cysteine modifications.
18556256|a|Cysteine thiol modifications are increasingly recognized to occur under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions, making their accurate detection, identification and quantification of growing importance. However, saturation labeling of thiols with fluorescent dyes results in poor protein recuperation and therefore requires the use of large quantities of starting material. This is especially important in sequential dye-labeling steps when applied for an identification of cysteine modifications. First, we studied the effects of different detergents during labeling procedure, i.e. Tween 20, Triton X-100 and CHAPS, on protein yield and composition. Tween 20 and Triton X-100 resulted in yields of around 50% labeled proteins compared to only 10% with PBS alone and a most diversified 2-DE protein pattern. Secondly, Tween 20 was used for serial protein labeling with maleimid fluorophores, first to conjugate to accessible thiols and after a reduction to label with another fluorophore previously masked di-sulphide and/or oxidized proteins in frontal cortex autopsy tissue of a subject with mild Alzheimer's disease. Two-DE DIGE revealed a complex protein pattern of readily labeled thiols and di-sulphide and/or oxidized proteins. Seventeen proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF and by peptide fingerprints. Several proteins were oxidized and involved in Alzheimer's disease. However methionine oxidation was prevalent. Infrared DIGE may provide an additional tool for an identification of oxidation susceptible proteins.
