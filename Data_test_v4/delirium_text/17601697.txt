17601697|t|[Management of Alzheimer disease].
17601697|a|Management of Alzheimer disease is based on drug and nondrug treatments. Specific drug treatment includes acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. They show moderate efficacy superior to that of placebo for global condition, cognitive disorders, need for care, and behavioral problems, but do not prevent further decline. These treatments remain underused. The efficacy of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, neuroleptics, and antipsychotic agents) in treating behavioral problems is not well documented. Nondrug activities and interventions have not been sufficiently evaluated scientifically. These involve interventions against the consequences of the disease (loss of autonomy, malnutrition) and helping patients' family caregivers. Among these activities, the best evaluated and most interesting are: educational programs for caregivers, occupational therapy at home, and interventions at home by nurses specially trained as case managers.
