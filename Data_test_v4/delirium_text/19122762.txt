19122762|t|Synthesis of Fluorescent Probes based on Stilbenes and Diphenylacetylenes targeting beta-Amyloid Plaques.
19122762|a|Three fluorescent probes were synthesized aiming for optical imaging to detect amyloid plaques present in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These compounds were prepared via Sonogashira coupling of a well-defined fluorophore (4-bora-3a, 4a-diaza s-indacene, BODIPY) with the pharmacophore possessing either a stilbene or a diphenylacetylene moiety. Different polyethylene glycol chain lengths were used as linkers between the fluorophore and the pharmacophore to adjust the lipophilicity of these probes. These compounds exhibit strong fluorescence emission between 665-680 nm and have very high extinction coefficients comparable to the parent fluorophore, BODIPY dye.
