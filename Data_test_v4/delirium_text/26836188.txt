26836188|a|Recent studies have revealed that the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 nAChR) is a critical link between inflammation and neurodegeneration, which is closely associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways contribute to the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of alpha7nAChR. Our previous studies have shown that treatment with gx-50 improves cognitive function and is neuroprotective. Here, we investigated the effect of gx-50 on alpha7 nAChR and Abeta-induced inflammation in microglia. First, the binding affinity of gx-50 to alpha7 nAChR was examined using the fluorescence-based Octet RED system, and the expression of alpha7 nAChR was detected using real-time PCR and western blotting. We also investigated downstream events of alpha7 nAChR activity, including the translocation of p-STAT3 and the phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, PI3K, and AKT. Finally, the effect of gx-50 on Abeta-induced inflammation via alpha7 nAChR-mediated signaling pathways was investigated using cytokine assays. The results showed that gx-50 is able to act as a specific ligand to activate alpha7 nAChR, which then upregulates the JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways to inhibit the secretions of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1beta. In conclusion, the results suggest that gx-50 could inhibit the Abeta-induced inflammatory response in microglia via alpha7 nAChR activity, which might be a successful therapeutic target against AD.
