36059360|t|Malignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma: A Challenging Case for Palliative Care.
36059360|a|Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and very aggressive malignancy of serosal membranes, which typically presents with abdominal pain, distension, and ascites. Due to its rarity and nonspecific symptoms, it is usually diagnosed late, when the disease burden is extensive and the therapy is inevitably palliative. It represents a complex challenge for clinicians because the treatment options are very poor and the illness has a great impact on patients' life. We present a complex case of a young patient with MPM who was admitted to our palliative care unit.
