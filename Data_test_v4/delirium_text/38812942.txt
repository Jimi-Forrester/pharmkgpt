38812942|a|Introduction: This study focuses on the assessment of extra virgin olive-oil and olive fruit-based formulations enriched with natural antioxidants as potential nutritional supplements for alleviating symptoms and long-term consequences of illnesses whose molecular pathophysiology is affected by oxidative stress and inflammation, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: Besides evaluating cell viability and proliferation capacity of human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells exposed to formulations in culture, hepatotoxicity was also considered as an additional safety measure using quantitative real-time PCR on RNA samples isolated from the cell cultures and applying approaches of targeted molecular analysis to uncover potential pathway effects through gene expression profiling. Furthermore, the formulations investigated in this work contrast the addition of natural extract with chemical forms and evaluate the antioxidant delivery mode on cell toxicity. Results: The results indicate minimal cellular toxicity and a significant beneficial impact on metabolic molecular pathways in HepG2 cell cultures, thus paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies using olive-oil and antioxidants in dietary supplements to minimize the long-term effects of oxidative stress and inflammatory signals in individuals being suffered by disorders like AD. Discussion: Overall, the experimental design and the data obtained support the notion of applying innovative molecular methodologies and research techniques to evidently advance the delivery, as well as the scientific impact and validation of nutritional supplements and dietary products to improve public health and healthcare outcomes.
