39559507|t|Neuro-meningeal tuberculosis: A pediatric case report and review of the literature.
39559507|a|Pediatric neuro-meningeal tuberculosis leads to high rates of mortality and morbidity. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment are challenging; imaging findings play a key role in establishing the presumptive diagnosis. General brain imaging findings are well reported; however, specific data on cerebral vascular and spinal involvement in children are sparse. We report the case of a 10-month-old infant who presented to the emergency department with an acute febrile meningeal syndrome, complicating a prior delay in motor development. A brain MRI, including sections through the thorax, revealed cerebro-meningeal and thoracic lesions compatible with multifocal tuberculous involvement revealed by the neurological symptoms.
