30023827|t|Phytochemicals as Dynamic Surface Ligands To Control Nanoparticle-Protein Interactions.
30023827|a|The rapid formation of the protein corona on to the nanoparticle (NP) surface is the key that confers biological identity to NPs and subsequently dictates their fate both in vitro and in vivo. Despite significant efforts, the inability to control the spontaneous interaction of serum proteins with the administered NPs remains a major constraint in clinical translation of nanomedicines. The ligands present on the NP surface offer promise in controlling their biological interactions; however, their influence on the NP-protein interaction is not well-understood. The current study investigates the potential of phytochemical-capped silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) toward allowing a control over NP interactions with the human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant protein in the biological fluids. Specifically, we demonstrate the ability of curcumin (Cur) and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) to independently act as reducing agents to produce phytochemical-capped AgNPs that show biologically desirable interactions with HSA. The key finding of our study is that the phytochemical-capped AgNPs initially interact with HSA more strongly compared to the citrate-stabilized AgNPs; however, the resultant NP-HSA complexes are less stable in the case of the former, which causes a lesser degree of changes in the protein conformation during interactions. Further, the choice of the phytochemical allows control over NP-HSA interactions, such that Cur- and EGCG-capped AgNPs interacted with HSA in a static versus dynamic manner, respectively. The diversity of the functional groups present in natural phytochemicals and their potential as in situ capping ligands during synthesis offer new opportunities in controlling the interactions of NPs with complex biological fluids, with implications in nanodiagnostics and nanomedicine.
