2406882|t|[Alcohol and epilepsy].
2406882|a|Two kinds of epileptic events are frequently related to alcohol consumption: 1) seizures triggered by alcohol withdrawal. Often multiple, they occur within between 10 and 48 hours after discontinuing or reducing alcohol intakes and can be followed by a delirium tremens. 2) recurring unprovoked seizures. They are usually rare, 1 or 2 yearly. The risk is increased for heavy drinkers but returns to normal for ex-drinkers. Seizures related to alcoholism are usually generalized tonico clonic seizures with normal EEG and CT-scan. When partial seizures are identified they are attributed to preceding brain damage, head trauma or stroke.
