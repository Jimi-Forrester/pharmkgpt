30881710|t|First Report of Hereditary Lysozyme Amyloidosis in a South Asian Family.
30881710|a|Lysozyme amyloidosis (ALys) is an exceedingly rare autosomal dominant hereditary type of systemic amyloidosis that can be misdiagnosed as other common types of systemic amyloidosis. The gastrointestinal tract and the kidney are the most common sites of organ involvement. No specific treatment exists for ALys, and the management primarily consists of organ-directed supportive care. To our knowledge, this disorder has been previously reported only in European ancestries; here, we first report the occurrence of ALys in South Asian ancestry. This report highlights the need of awareness amongst physicians regarding the extension of this unique and challenging disorder to non-European ancestries.
