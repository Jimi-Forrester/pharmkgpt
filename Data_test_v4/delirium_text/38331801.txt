38331801|a|The current scientific literature has extensively explored the potential role of proteasome inhibitors (PIs) in the NF-kappaB pathway of leukemia and lymphoma. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a critical component in regulating protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. PIs, such as BTZ, are used to target the 26S proteasome in hematologic malignancies, resulting in the prevention of the degradation of tumor suppressor proteins, the activation of intrinsic mitochondrial-dependent cell death, and the inhibition of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. NF-kappaB is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis, cell proliferation, differentiation, inflammation, angiogenesis, and tumor migration. Despite the successful use of PIs in various hematologic malignancies, there are limitations such as resistant to these inhibitors. Some reports suggest that PIs can induce NF-kappaB activation, which increases the survival of malignant cells. This article discusses the various aspects of PIs' effects on the NF-kappaB pathway and their limitations. Video Abstract.
