38841796|t|Exploring the impact of N4-acetylcytidine modification in RNA on non-neoplastic disease: unveiling its role in pathogenesis and therapeutic opportunities.
38841796|a|RNA modifications include not only methylation modifications, such as m6A, but also acetylation modifications, which constitute a complex interaction involving "writers," "readers," and "erasers" that play crucial roles in growth, genetics, and disease. N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) is an ancient and highly conserved RNA modification that plays a profound role in the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases. This review provides insights into the functional impact of ac4C modifications in disease and introduces new perspectives for disease treatment. These studies provide important insights into the biological functions of post-transcriptional RNA modifications and their potential roles in disease mechanisms, offering new perspectives and strategies for disease treatment.
