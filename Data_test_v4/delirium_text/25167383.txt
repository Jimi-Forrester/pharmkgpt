25167383|a|Glioblastoma continues to be an invariably fatal malignancy. The established approach for understanding the biology of these aggressive tumors in an effort to identify novel molecular targets has largely been genotype-based. Unfortunately, clinical gains offered by this level of understanding have been limited, largely based on the complex nature of signaling networks associated with tumorigenesis and the inability to delineate the key "functional" signaling pathways actually driving growth in an individual tumor. Metabolomics is the global quantitative assessment of endogenous metabolites within a biological system, taking into account genetic regulation, altered kinetic activity of enzymes, and changes in metabolic reactions. Thus, compared to genomics and proteomics, metabolomics reflects changes in phenotype and therefore function. In this review, we highlight some of the key advancements that have been made in applying metabolomics to understand the aggressive phenotype of glioblastoma. Collectively, these studies have provided a previously unrecognized window into the underlying biology of these tumors. Current and future efforts are designed to determine how this technology may be applied to improve diagnosis and predict the aggressiveness of glioblastoma, and more importantly, identify novel, therapeutic strategies designed to improve clinical outcomes.
