37926051|a|OBJECTIVE: Alcohol remains the fourth-leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. The objective of this study was to compare the incidence of phenobarbital (PHB)-resistant withdrawal and determine risk factors for PHB-resistant alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adults admitted to an academic center with AWS who received PHB as part of an institution-specific treatment protocol. The primary outcome was incidence of AWS resistant to initial protocolized PHB load across two cohorts (standard-dose, 10 mg/kg vs. low-dose, 6 mg/kg). RESULTS: Among 176 included patients, there was no difference in the incidence of PHB-resistant AWS based on initial PHB load [low-dose load, 21 (18.3%) vs. standard-dose load, 12 (19.7%), p = 0.82]. There were also no differences in observed PHB-related ADEs between the groups. Total benzodiazepine dose received (mg) in the 24 h prior to initial PHB load was the only risk factor significantly associated with AWS resistant to initial protocolized PHB load [adjusted OR 1.79 (95% CI 1.24, 2.60)]. PHB-resistant withdrawal occurred in 33 (18.8%) patients with a median cumulative PHB dose of approximately 20 mg/kg during hospitalization. CONCLUSION(S): There were no differences in the incidence of PHB-resistant AWS or PHB-related ADEs based on initial PHB loading dose.
