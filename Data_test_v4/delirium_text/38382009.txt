38382009|t|Association of PM2.5 Exposure and Alzheimer Disease Pathology in Brain Bank Donors-Effect Modification by APOE Genotype.
38382009|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure has been found to be associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) and is hypothesized to cause inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain, contributing to neuropathology. The APOE gene, a major genetic risk factor of AD, has been hypothesized to modify the association between PM2.5 and AD. However, little prior research exists to support these hypotheses. This study investigates the association between traffic-related PM2.5 and AD hallmark pathology, including effect modification by APOE genotype, in an autopsy cohort. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using brain tissue donors enrolled in the Emory Goizueta AD Research Center who died before 2020 (n = 224). Donors were assessed for AD pathology including the Braak stage, Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD (CERAD) score, and combined AD neuropathologic change (ABC) score. Traffic-related PM2.5 concentrations were modeled for the metro-Atlanta area during 2002-2019 with a spatial resolution of 200-250 m. One-year, 3-year, and 5-year average PM2.5 concentrations before death were matched to participants' home address. We assessed the association between traffic-related PM2.5 and AD hallmark pathology and effect modification by APOE genotype, using adjusted ordinal logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among the 224 participants, the mean age of death was 76 years, and 57% had at least 1 APOE epsilon4 copy. Traffic-related PM2.5 was significantly associated with the CERAD score for the 1-year exposure window (odds ratio [OR] 1.92; 95% CI 1.12-3.30) and the 3-year exposure window (OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.01-3.17). PM2.5 was also associated with higher Braak stage and ABC score albeit nonsignificantly. The strongest associations between PM2.5 and neuropathology markers were among those without APOE epsilon4 alleles (e.g., for the CERAD score and 1-year exposure window, OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.36-3.94), though interaction between PM2.5 and APOE genotype was not statistically significant. DISCUSSION: Our study found traffic-related PM2.5 exposure was associated with the CERAD score in an autopsy cohort, contributing to epidemiologic evidence that PM2.5 affects beta-amyloid deposition in the brain. This association was particularly strong among donors without APOE epsilon4 alleles. Future studies should further investigate the biological mechanisms behind this association.
