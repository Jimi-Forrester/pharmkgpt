22726959|a|AIM: To measure functional recovery and determine risk factors for failure to return to the prefracture level of mobility of hip fracture patients 1 year postoperatively. METHODS: A prospective cohort follow-up study of 390 hip fracture patients aged 65 years and older was carried out. Patients were stratified in categories based on prefracture mobility: mobile without aid, with aid in- and outdoors, or only mobile indoors. Immobile patients were excluded. Risk factors for not regaining prefracture mobility were identified. RESULTS: Nearly half of all patients regained their prefracture level of mobility after 1 year. Mobile patients without an aid were less likely to return to their prefracture mobility level compared with patients who were mobile with aid or mobile indoors. After 1 year, 18.7% of all patients had become immobile. Most important independent risk factors for failure to return to the prefracture level of mobility were a limited prefracture level of activities of daily living and a delirium during admission. CONCLUSIONS: The risk not to regain prefracture mobility is highest in mobile patients without an aid. The risk of becoming immobile is higher in those having a lower prefracture mobility. Activities of daily living dependence and delirium were the main risk factors for not regaining mobility.
