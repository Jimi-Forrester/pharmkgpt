38329486|a|Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown promising results in patients with hematological malignancies. However, many patients still have poor prognoses or even fatal outcomes due to the life-threatening toxicities associated with the therapy. Moreover, even after improving the known influencing factors (such as number or type of CAR-T infusion) related to CAR-T cell infusion, the results remain unsatisfactory. In recent years, it has been found that endothelial cells (ECs), which are key components of the organization, play a crucial role in various aspects of immune system activation and inflammatory response. The levels of typical markers of endothelial activation positively correlated with the severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxic syndrome (ICANS), suggesting that ECs are important targets for intervention and toxicity prevention. This review focuses on the critical role of ECs in CRS and ICANS and the intervention strategies adopted.
