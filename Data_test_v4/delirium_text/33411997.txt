33411997|a|Background: There is a growing trend to implement intermediate care units to avoid unnecessary costs associated with intensive care unit (ICU) admission and associated resources. We sought to evaluate the safety of transitioning from a routine to a selective policy of postoperative transfer to the ICU for elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Methods: This retrospective study included consecutive open elective AAA repair procedures performed at a single centre from Aug. 8, 2010, to Dec. 1, 2014. Patients were identified through a prospectively maintained database, and electronic charts were reviewed. Patients with interventions before Mar. 13, 2012, were routinely sent to the ICU after operation (group A). Patients treated after this date were sent directly to an intermediate care unit (group B) unless preoperative or intraoperative factors deemed them suitable for ICU admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital death; secondary outcomes were perioperative complications and length of stay. We used logistic and linear regression to determine the association between the use of an intermediate care unit and the primary and secondary outcomes after adjusting for confounders and clinically relevant covariates. Results: The cohort comprised 310 patients (266 men, 44 women) with a mean age of 69.7 (standard deviation 10.1) years and a mean AAA diameter of 61.2 mm (SD 9.6 mm). Groups A and B included 118 and 192 patients, respectively. Admission to the ICU was spared in 149 patients (77.6%) in group B. Only 2 patients (1.3%) in group B were subsequently admitted to the ICU. There was no statistically significant difference in in-hospital mortality or perioperative complications between the 2 groups on multivariable logistic regression. There was a nonsignificant trend toward slightly shorter length of stay in group B. Conclusion: In this single-centre experience with the majority of patients sent directly to an intermediate care unit, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality or morbidity between routine and selective ICU admission. Our results confirm the safety of a selective ICU admission pathway.
