20472058|a|Manipulation of diet such as increasing the level of fat or inducing insulin resistance has been shown to exacerbate the pathology in several animal models of neurological disease. Caloric restriction, however, has been demonstrated to extend the life span of many organisms. Reduced calorie consumption appears to increase the resistance of neurons to intracellular and extracellular stress and consequently improves the behavioural phenotype in animal models of neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. We review the evidence from a variety of mouse models that diet is a risk factor that can significantly contribute to the development of neurological diseases.
