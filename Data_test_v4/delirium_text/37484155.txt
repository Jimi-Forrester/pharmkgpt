37484155|t|Changes in Oxidative Stress Parameters in Terms of Simultaneous Exposure to Physical and Chemical Factors: A Systematic Review.
37484155|a|Background: Physical and chemical factors of workplace, either alone or in combination, contribute to oxidative stress that is harmful to the body. The combined impact of physical and chemical components of the work environment on oxidative stress was examined in this research. Methods: Research articles published from 2000 to 2021 on this topic in reliable national and international databases were collected and analyzed. Based on the preliminary screening, 120 articles were selected for the first stage. The relevance and quality of 85 suitable papers were found appropriate and evaluated by examining the purpose of the study in the next phase. Results: The data collected and presented from the articles cover simultaneous exposure to physical risk factors such as noise, radiation, and chemicals such as metal solvents, as well as different types of oxidative stress parameters like MDA, GHS, LOP, 8-OHdG, SOD, CAT, ROS, and other parameters such as research site, co-exposure effects, and target organ. Investigating the combined effect of physical and chemical variables on oxidative stress in the target organs, as well as the interaction of multiple effects on each other, was one of the key goals of the articles (synergistic, reinforcing, additive or antagonistic). Conclusion: Most of the findings of theses researches generally highlight the synergistic impact of concurrent exposure to chemical and physical risk factors on oxidative stress.
