37833408|a|BACKGROUND: Neurological manifestations of severe coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, are wide-ranging and may persist following virus clearance. Detailed understanding of the underlying changes in brain function may facilitate the identification of therapeutic targets. We directly tested how neocortical function is impacted by the specific panel of cytokines that occur in coronavirus brain infection. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, we determined how the five cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12p40 and IL-15 for 22-28-h) at concentrations matched to those elicited by MHV-A59 coronavirus brain infection, affected neuronal function in cultured primary mouse neocortical neurons. RESULTS: We evaluated how acute cytokine exposure affected neuronal excitability (propensity to fire action potentials), membrane properties, and action potential characteristics, as well as sensitivity to changes in extracellular calcium and magnesium (divalent) concentration. Neurovirulent cytokines increased spontaneous excitability and response to low divalent concentration by depolarizing the resting membrane potential and hyperpolarizing the action potential threshold. Evoked excitability was also enhanced by neurovirulent cytokines at physiological divalent concentrations. At low divalent concentrations, the change in evoked excitability was attenuated. One hour after cytokine removal, spontaneous excitability and hyperpolarization of the action potential threshold normalized but membrane depolarization and attenuated divalent-dependent excitability persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus-associated cytokine exposure increases spontaneous excitability in neocortical neurons, and some of the changes persist after cytokine removal.
