30897451|a|BACKGROUND: A close relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been described in recent years. OSA is a risk factor for AD, but the diagnosis and clinical characteristics of OSA in patients with AD is not well understood. This study evaluated the clinical utility of two screening questionnaires, the STOP-Bang questionnaire (SBQ) and the Berlin questionnaire (BQ), to identify which patients with mild AD are at higher risk of having OSA and to determine the clinical predictors of OSA in this population. METHODS: In this study, 91 consecutive outpatients with mild AD were prospectively evaluated with the SBQ and the BQ. All patients underwent level 1 in-laboratory polysomnography. The predictive performance of the questionnaires were calculated for different apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) cut-offs. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 76.0 (73.0; 80.0) years, and 58 (63.7%) were female. Of those, 81 patients (89.02%) were found to have OSA defined by an AHI > 5 events/h. Comparing the predictive performances of the SBQ and the BQ, the SBQ was found to have a higher diagnostic sensitivity (85% vs 4%), a lower specificity (35% vs. 96%), a higher positive predictive value (PPV) (44% vs 33%) and negative predictive value (NPV) (80% vs 65%) for detecting severe OSA at an AHI cut-off of 30 events/h. None of the items alone in the two questionnaires predicted the risk of OSA. A modified version of the SBQ, with new cut-off points for several variables according to the characteristics of AD patients, showed a slightly greater AUC than the standard SBQ (AUC 0.61 vs 0.72). CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of OSA among patients with mild AD. The SBQ and the BQ are not good screening tools for detecting OSA in patients with AD. A modified version of SBQ could increase the detection of these patients.
