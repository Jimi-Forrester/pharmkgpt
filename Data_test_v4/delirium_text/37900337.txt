37900337|t|Retrospective Evaluation of the Results of Low-Dose Intravenous Thrombolytic Therapy in Acute Ischemic Stroke.
37900337|a|Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the clinical data of patients with acute ischemic stroke who received low-dose intravenous (IV) thrombolytic therapy (0.9 mg/kg; maximum 50 mg) for various reasons, compare the obtained results with those of patients who received standard-dose thrombolytic therapy, and discuss them in light of the literature. Methods: Patients who received IV thrombolytic therapy within 4.5 h of symptom onset between January 2015 and June 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into the low-dose group (0.9 mg/kg; max. 50 mg) and the standard-dose group (0.9 mg/kg; max 90 mg) according to the thrombolytic therapy dose, after which demographic data and clinical results were analyzed. Results: A total of 109 patients receiving thrombolytic therapy (19 patients in the low-dose group and 90 patients in the standard-dose group) were included in the study. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of good outcome rates (47.4% vs. 52.2%). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of symptomatic and asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage rates. Conclusion: Our study showed similar efficacy and safety for low-dose IV thrombolytic therapy compared with standard-dose IV thrombolytic therapy administered within 4.5 h of symptom onset in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
