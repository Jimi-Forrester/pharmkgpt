22142544|a|As a part of our research program on developing novel anti-Alzheimer's disease medicines, several dihydrofuran-fused perhydrophenanthrenes (DFs) possessing a phenolic hydroxyl group were found to exhibit potent dendritic and axonal regeneration activities. Introduction of a methoxy group into the perhydrophenanthrene skeleton was successfully achieved via a PhI(OAc)(2)-mediated phenolic oxidation of a benzocyclobutene nucleus and subsequent tandem intramolecular electrocyclic reactions based on o-quinodimethane chemistry. We could reveal that a new methoxy derivative having a phenolic hydroxyl group exerted the most significant effects on the dendritic and axonal extensions in the damaged neurons, among DFs examined in this study.
