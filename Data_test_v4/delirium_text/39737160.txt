39737160|a|Background: With the global aging population, community-acquired pneumonia and delirium are increasingly critical health issues among the elderly. The Laboratory Frailty Index provides an objective measure of frailty. This study explores its capacity in predicting delirium and examines the interplay between frailty and nutritional status in elderly patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Methods and materials: This retrospective study included 481 elderly patients aged 75 and above diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. The Laboratory Frailty Index was calculated by dividing the sum of abnormal indicator scores by the total number of test indicators, resulting in a score ranging from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater frailty. Results: Higher Laboratory Frailty Index scores were associated with an increased risk of delirium. The index's predictive accuracy improved when combined with nutritional assessments. Patients experiencing malnutrition alongside higher frailty scores exhibited a higher risk of adverse outcomes. Nutritional status mediated the relationship between frailty and delirium, underlining the significance of addressing both variables. Conclusion: The Laboratory Frailty Index is a robust predictor of delirium in elderly patients with community-acquired pneumonia. These findings provide valuable insights for the early identification and intervention of delirium in clinical settings.
