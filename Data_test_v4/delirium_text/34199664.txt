34199664|t|Foveal Avascular Zone and Choroidal Thickness Are Decreased in Subjects with Hard Drusen and without High Genetic Risk of Developing Alzheimer's Disease.
34199664|a|A family history (FH+) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and e4 allele of the ApoE gene are the main genetic risk factors for developing AD, whereas e4 allele plays a protective role in age-related macular degeneration. Ocular vascular changes have been reported in both pathologies. We analyzed the choroidal thickness using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) using OCT-angiography and compared the results with ApoE gene expression, AD FH+, and the presence or absence of hard drusen (HD) in 184 cognitively healthy subjects. Choroidal thickness was statistically significantly different in the (FH-, e4-, HD+) group compared with (i) both the (FH-, e4-, HD-) and the (FH+, e4+, HD+) groups in the superior and inferior points at 1500 mum, and (ii) the (FH+, e4-, HD+) group in the superior point at 1500 mum. There were statistically significant differences in the superficial FAZ between the (FH+, e4-, HD+) group and (i) the (FH+, e4-, HD-) group and (ii) the (FH+, e4+, HD-) group. In conclusion, ocular vascular changes are not yet evident in participants with a genetic risk of developing AD.
