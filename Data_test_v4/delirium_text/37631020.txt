37631020|t|Depressive and Other Adverse CNS Effects of Fluoroquinolones.
37631020|a|Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are widely used drugs around the world. This is a result of their broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, high bioavailability, and known efficacy. Since they appeared on the market, their prescribing frequency has gradually increased. In 2011, FQs became the third most prescribed class of antibiotics in the US. Widespread use of these drugs resulted in an increasing number of reported side effects. In 2016, the FDA warned about significant side effects, including mental disorders in the form of anxiety, psychotic symptoms, insomnia, and depression. Psychiatric adverse reactions to FQs occur with a frequency of 1 to 4.4% and the mechanism of their formation is not entirely clear. It is believed that the antagonistic effect of FQs on the GABA receptor or interaction with the main receptor for the glutamatergic system-NMDA-is responsible for this. The paper is a structured review of 68 selected publications and the latest summary of CNS adverse effects that occur during FQ use. Prescribers should be aware of the risk factors for FQ toxicity, including elderly patients with underlying medical conditions or receiving concomitant medication; however, these adverse events may also occur in other groups of patients.
