32370194|t|Inflammatory and Infectious Processes Serve as Links between Atrial Fibrillation and Alzheimer's Disease.
32370194|a|Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most prevalent forms of arrhythmia that carries an increased risk of stroke which, in turn, is strongly associated with cognitive decline. The majority of dementia cases are caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) with obscure pathogenesis. While the exact mechanisms are unknown, the role of inflammatory processes and infectious agents have recently been implicated in both AD and AF, suggesting a common link between these maladies. Here, we present the main shared pathways underlying arrhythmia and memory loss. The overlapping predictive biomarkers and emerging joint pharmacological approaches are also discussed.
