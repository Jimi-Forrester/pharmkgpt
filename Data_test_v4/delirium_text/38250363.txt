38250363|a|Conducting in vivo brain imaging can be a challenging task due to the complexity of brain tissue and the strict requirements for safe and effective imaging agents. However, a new fluorescent dye called Cy5-PEG2 has been developed that selectively accumulates in mitochondria, enabling the visualization of these essential organelles in various cell lines. This dye is versatile and can be used for the real-time monitoring of mitochondrial dynamics in living cells. Moreover, it can cross the blood-brain barrier, making it a promising tool for noninvasive in vivo brain imaging. Based on the assessment of glial cell responses in the hippocampus and neocortex regions using GFAP and Iba1 biomarkers, Cy5-PEG2 seems to have minimal adverse effects on brain immune response or neuronal health. Therefore, this mitochondria-targeting fluorescent dye has the potential to advance our understanding of mitochondrial dynamics and function within the broader context of whole-brain physiology and disease progression. However, further research is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cy5-PEG2.
