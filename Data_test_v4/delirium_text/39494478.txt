39494478|t|Periodontal disease: A systemic condition.
39494478|a|For decades, periodontitis has been considered to be a local inflammatory disease of the periodontal tissues in the oral cavity. Initially, associations of periodontitis with a multitude of noncommunicable diseases were each studied separately, and relationships were shown. The associations of periodontitis with morbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, respiratory diseases, have been demonstrated. As most such studies were cross-sectional in nature, questions about causality cannot be univocally answered. And periodontitis as an independent risk factor for one systemic disease, becomes even more difficult to assess since recently periodontitis has also been associated with multimorbidity. Periodontitis and many systemic diseases share environmental, lifestyle and genetic risk factors, and share immunopathology. Moreover, suffering from one common noncommunicable disease may increase the susceptibility for another such chronic disease; the systemic effects of one condition may be one of various risk factors for another such disease. The overarching effect of any systemic disease is it causing a pro-inflammatory state in the individual; this has also been shown for periodontitis. Moreover, in periodontitis a prothrombotic state and elevated immunological activity have been shown. As such, when we consider periodontal disease as another systemic disease, it can affect the susceptibility and progression of other systemic diseases, and importantly, vice versa. And with this, it is not surprising that periodontitis is associated with a variety of other noncommunicable diseases. The medical definition of a systemic disease includes diseases that affect different organs and systems. Thus, the aim of this opinion paper is to propose that periodontitis should be considered a systemic disease in its own right and that it affects the individual's systemic condition and wellbeing. The dental and medical profession and researchers alike, should adapt this paradigm shift, advancing periodontal disease out of its isolated anatomical location into the total of chronic noncommunicable diseases, being for some conditions a comorbid disease and, vice versa, comorbidities can affect initiation and progression of periodontal disease.
