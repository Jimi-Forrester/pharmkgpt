38710372|a|The recent development of the first disease-modifying drug for Alzheimer's disease represents a major advancement in dementia treatment. Behind this breakthrough is a quarter century of research efforts to understand the disease not by a particular symptom at a given moment, but by long-term sequential changes in multiple biomarkers. Disease progression modeling with temporal realignment (DPM-TR) is an emerging computational approach proposed with this biomarker-based disease concept. By integrating short-term clinical observations of multiple disease biomarkers in a data-driven manner, DPM-TR provides a way to understand the progression of chronic diseases over decades and predict individual disease stages more accurately. DPM-TR has been developed primarily in the area of neurodegenerative diseases but has recently been extended to non-neurodegenerative diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary, autoimmune, and ophthalmologic diseases. This review focuses on opportunities for DPM-TR in clinical practice and drug development and discusses its current status and challenges.
