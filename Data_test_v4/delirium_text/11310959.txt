11310959|a|Below the melting point temperature of lipids, artificial lipid membranes usually exist in the ordered gel phase. Above these temperatures lipid acyl chains become fluid and disordered (liquid-crystalline phase). Depending on the chemical composition of artificial membranes, phase separation may occur, leading to the formation of transient or stable membrane domains. A similar phase separation of lipids into ordered and disordered domains has been observed in natural membranes at physiological temperature range. Moreover, it has been reported that certain proteins prefer certain organization of lipids, as for example glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins or Src family of tyrosine kinases. The aim of present review is to discuss the possibility that some lipid microdomains are induced or stabilized by lipid-binding proteins that under certain conditions, for example due to a rise of cytosolic Ca2+ or pH changes, may attach to the membrane surface, inducing clustering of lipid molecules and creation of ordered lipid microdomains. These domains may than attract other cytosolic proteins, either enzymes or regulatory proteins. It is, therefore, postulated that lipid microdomains play important roles within a cell, in signal transduction and enzymatic catalysis, and also in various pathological states, as Alzheimer's disease, anti-phosphatidylserine syndrome, or development of multidrug resistance of cancer cells.
