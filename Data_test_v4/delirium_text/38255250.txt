38255250|t|Unraveling the Role of miR-200b-3p in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Its Therapeutic Potential in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR).
38255250|a|Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in children with unknown etiology. Impaired learning ability was commonly reported in ADHD patients and has been associated with dopamine uptake in the striatum of an animal model. Another evidence also indicated that micro-RNA (miR)-200b-3p is associated with learning ability in various animal models. However, the association between miR-200b-3p and ADHD-related symptoms remains unclear. Therefore, the current study investigated the role of miR-200b-3p in ADHD-related symptoms such as inattention and striatal inflammatory cytokines. To verify the influence of miR-200b-3p in ADHD-related symptoms, striatal stereotaxic injection of miR-200b-3p antagomir (AT) was performed on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The antioxidant activity and expressions of miR-200b-3p, slit guidance ligand 2 (Slit2), and inflammatory cytokines in the striatum of SHR were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunoblotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The spontaneous alternation of SHR was tested using a three-arm Y-shaped maze. The administration of miR-200b-3p AT or taurine significantly decreased striatal tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6 in SHR, along with increased super-oxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities and significantly higher spontaneous alternation. In this paper, we show that miR-200b-3p AT and taurine alleviates ADHD-related symptoms in SHR. These findings provide insights into ADHD's molecular basis and suggest miR-200b-3p as a potential therapeutic target. Concurrently, this study also suggests broad implications for treating neurodevelopmental disorders affecting learning activity such as ADHD.
