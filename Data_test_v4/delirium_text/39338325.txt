39338325|t|Development and Validation of a Simple UV-HPLC Method to Quantify the Memantine Drug Used in Alzheimer's Treatment.
39338325|a|Memantine, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, is used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, loading memantine in nanoparticles (NPs) could be an essential tool to improve the treatment effectiveness while reducing drug toxicity. Even though some approaches have been described to quantify memantine, none reported optimized methods using high-performance liquid chromatography resorting to ultraviolet detection (UV-HPLC) to determine encapsulation in NPs. The present research developed a HPLC method using pre-column derivatization for quantitatively analyzing memantine hydrochloride in NPs. Memantine was derivatized using 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC). The developed method was fully validated regarding suitability, specificity, linearity, sensitivity, precision, accuracy, and robustness according to the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines. The retention time of memantine was 11.393 +- 0.003 min, with a mean recovery of 92.9 +- 3.7%. The new chromatographic method was validated and found to respond linearly over 5-140 mug/mL, with a high coefficient of determination. Intraday precision lay between 3.6% and 4.6%, and interday precision between 4.2% and 9.3%. The stability of memantine was also tested at 4  C and -20  C, and no signs of decay were found for up to 6 months. The new method was properly validated and proved simple, sensitive, specific, accurate, and precise for determining memantine encapsulation efficiency in lipid NPs. Greenness was evaluated, presenting a final score of 0.45. In the future, this methodology could also be applied to quantify memantine in different nanoformulations.
