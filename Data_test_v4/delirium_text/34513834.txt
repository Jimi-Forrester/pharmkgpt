34513834|a|The external and internal factors of the cell are critical to glioma initiation. Several factors and molecules have been reported to be implicated in the initiation and progression of brain cancer. However, the exact sequence of events responsible for glioma initiation is still unknown. Existing reports indicate that glioma stem cells are the cell of glioma origin. During cell division, chromosome breakage, DNA alteration increases the chance of cell genome modifications and oncogene overexpression. Although there is a high risk of gene alteration and oncogene overexpression, not everyone develops cancer. During embryogenesis, the same oncogenes that promote cancers have also been reported to be highly expressed, but this high expression which does not lead to carcinogenesis raises questions about the role of oncogenes in carcinogenesis. The resistance of cancer cells to drugs, apoptosis, and immune cells does not rely solely on oncogene overexpression but also on the defect in cell organelle machinery (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytoskeleton). This review discusses factors contributing to cancer; we report the dysfunction of the cell organelles and their contribution to carcinogenesis, while oncogene overexpression promotes tumorigenesis, maintenance, and progression through cell adhesion. All these factors together represent a fundamental requirement for cancer and its development.
