9488178|t|Alzheimer's disease risk factors as related to cerebral blood flow: additional evidence.
9488178|a|In a previous report, Alzheimer's disease risk factors, including alcohol abuse, depression, Down's syndrome, cerebral glucose metabolism defect, head trauma, old age, Parkinson's disease, sleep disturbance, and underactivity, were shown to have an association with reduced cerebral blood flow. In this report an attempt is made to strengthen a hypothesis that reduced cerebral blood flow may be a required cofactor in the cause of Alzheimer's disease with examples of additional putative risks, including aluminum, ApoE 4 alleles, estrogen deficiency, family history of dementia, low education-attainment, olfactory deficit, and underactivity coupled with gender, considered to have a relationship or potential relationship with reduced cerebral blood flow. Factors, believed to ameliorate Alzheimer's disease, associated with improved or stabilized cerebral blood flow are tabulated. A tentative cerebral blood flow nomogram is shown as a potential model to possibly help predict Alzheimer's disease susceptibility.
