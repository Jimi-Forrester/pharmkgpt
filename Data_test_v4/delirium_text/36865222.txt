36865222|t|The Role of Neuroimaging in Evolving TBI Research and Clinical Practice.
36865222|a|Neuroimaging technologies such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been widely adopted in the clinical diagnosis and management of traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly at the more acute and severe levels of injury. Additionally, a number of advanced applications of MRI have been employed in TBI-related clinical research with great promise, and researchers have used these techniques to better understand underlying mechanisms, progression of secondary injury and tissue perturbation over time, and relation of focal and diffuse injury to later outcome. However, the acquisition and analysis time, the cost of these and other imaging modalities, and the need for specialized expertise have represented historical barriers in extending these tools in clinical practice. While group studies are important in detecting patterns, heterogeneity among patient presentation and limited sample sizes from which to compare individual level data to well-developed normative data have also played a role in the limited translatability of imaging to wider clinical application. Fortunately, the field of TBI has benefitted from increased public and scientific awareness of the prevalence and impact of TBI, particularly in head injury related to recent military conflicts and sport-related concussion. This awareness parallels an increase in federal funding in the United States and other countries allocated to investigation in these areas. In this article we summarize funding and publication trends since the mainstream adoption of imaging in TBI to elucidate evolving trends and priorities in the application of different techniques and patient populations. We also review recent and ongoing efforts to advance the field through promoting reproducibility, data sharing, big data analytic methods, and team science. Finally, we discuss international collaborative efforts to combine and harmonize neuroimaging, cognitive, and clinical data, both prospectively and retrospectively. Each of these represent unique, but related, efforts that facilitate closing gaps between the use of advanced imaging solely as a research tool and the use of it in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning and monitoring.
