36735430|t|Frailty and Acute Postoperative Urinary Retention in Older Women Undergoing Pelvic Organ Prolapse Surgery.
36735430|a|IMPORTANCE: Acute postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is common after pelvic reconstructive surgery, occurring in 15-45% of women. There is a paucity of data on the relationship between frailty and POUR after prolapse surgery. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the association between frailty and POUR in older women who underwent pelvic organ prolapse surgery. STUDY DESIGN: This secondary analysis of a prospective study of postoperative delirium enrolled women 60 years and older undergoing prolapse surgery. The Fried Frailty Index was used to assess frailty before surgery. Acute POUR was defined as failure to pass a retrograde voiding trial at hospital discharge with postvoid residual volume of greater than 100 mL. RESULTS: Analyses included 165 women, with a mean +- SD age of 72.5 +- 6.1 years and a body mass index of 28.0 +- 4.4 kg/m2. There were 49 laparoscopic/robotic apical suspension procedures (29.7%), 60 vaginal obliterative procedures (36.4%), 47 vaginal apical suspension procedures (28.5%), and 9 isolated anterior and/or posterior colporrhaphies (5.5%), of which 9 had a concomitant incontinence procedure. Seventy-eight women (47.3%) experienced acute POUR. Thirty-one (18.8%) met the criteria for "not frail," 115 (88.5%) were "prefrail," and 19 (11.5%) were "frail." Neither frailty status nor score was associated with POUR. In an analysis of individual Fried Frailty Index components, self-reported unintentional weight loss was significantly associated with POUR (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-17.15). This remained significant on multivariable logistic regression (adjusted odds ratio, 4.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-16.39). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was not associated with POUR in older women undergoing prolapse surgery. The observed association between POUR and unintended weight loss before surgery warrants further investigation.
