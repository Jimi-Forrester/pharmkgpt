32606523|t|Acute Flaccid Quadriplegic Myopathy and Encephalopathy with Extensive Muscle Magnetic Resonance Imaging Changes in Thyroid Storm.
32606523|a|Thyroid storm (TS) is a rare hyperthyroidism associated multisystem decompensation and can mimic a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. It is diagnosed in the presence of fever with cardiovascular, central nervous system, and gastrointestinal complications. Only a few reports of acute flaccid quadriplegic thyrotoxic myopathy (TM) with TS have been reported. However, muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in TM have not been yet been reported. Our patient underwent muscle MRI and showed some unusual features. These are discussed in this article.
