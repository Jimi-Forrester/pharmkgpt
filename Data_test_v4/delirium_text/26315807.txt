26315807|a|Non-invasive determination of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposition with radioligands serves for the early diagnosis and clarification of pathogenetic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The polymorphic binding site on multimeric Abeta for current radioligands, however, is little understood. In this study, we investigated the binding of several radioligands including (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound B ((11)C-PiB), (3)H-AZD2184, and two recently developed compounds, (125)I-DRM106 and (125)I-DRK092, with unique presubicular Abeta deposits lacking interaction with the commonly used amyloid dyes FSB. (11)C-PiB, (3)H-AZD2184, and (125)I-DRK092 showed overt binding to presubicular Abeta deposits, while (125)I-DRM106 barely bound to these aggregates despite its strong binding in the hippocampal CA1 sector. Unlike neuritic plaques in the CA1, Abeta lesions in the presubiculum were not accompanied by inflammatory gliosis enriched with 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO). Thus, there are at least two different components in Abeta aggregates providing distinct binding sites for the current amyloid radioligands, and one of these binding components is distinctly present in the presubicular Abeta deposits. Amyloid radioligands lacking affinity for this component, such as (125)I-DRM106, may selectively capture Abeta deposits tightly associated with TSPO neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration as exemplified by CA1 neuritic plaques. Hence, comparative autoradiographic assessments of radioligand binding in CA1 and presubiculum could serve for the development of an amyloid PET imaging agent visualizing neurotoxicity-related Abeta pathologies. Non-invasive determination of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) serves for the early diagnosis and clarification of pathogenetic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that there are at least two different amyloid components in hippocampal CA1 and presubiculum providing distinct binding sites for the current amyloid radioligands. Comparative analysis for radioligand binding in these two regions could serve for developing novel imaging agents selectively visualizing neurotoxicity-related Abeta pathologies.
