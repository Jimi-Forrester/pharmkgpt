35925856|t|Cognitive Decline Detection for Alzheimer's Disease Patients Through an Activity of Daily Living (ADL).
35925856|a|There are conventional screening instruments for the detection of cognitive impairment, but they have a reduced ecological validity and the information they present could be biased. This study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness and usefulness of a task based on an activity of daily living (ADL) for the detection of cognitive impairment for an Alzheimer's disease (AD) population. Twenty-four participants were included in the study. The AD group (ADG) included twelve older adults (12 female) with AD (81.75+-7.8 years). The Healthy group (HG) included twelve older adults (5 males, 77.7 +- 6.4 years). Both groups received a ADL-based intervention at two time frames separated 3 weeks. Cognitive functions were assessed before the interventions by using the MEC-35. The test-retest method was used to evaluate the reliability of the task, as well as the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). The analysis of the test-retest reliability of the scores in the task indicated an excellent clinical relevance for both groups. The hypothesis of equality of the means of the scores in the two applications of the task was accepted for both the ADG and HG, respectively. The task also showed a significant high degree of association with the MEC-35 test (rho = 0.710, p = 0.010) for the ADG. Our results showed that it is possible to use an ADL-based task to assess everyday memory intended for cognitive impairments detection. In the same way, the task could be used to promote cognitive function and prevent dementia.
