9545313|a|Intraneuronal accumulation of paired helical filaments (PHF) is considered to be closely related to the neuronal loss observed in brains of patients affected with Alzheimer's disease. The central issue is whether PHF formation itself causes or accelerates the neuronal perikaryal and neuritic degeneration or whether they are simply the consequence of preceding degeneration. We sought to address the issue in part by characterizing the PHF-associated molecules and thus raised a number of monoclonal antibodies to neurofibrillary tangles. One monoclonal antibody, 3F4, strongly reacted with neurofibrillary tangles and some plaque neurites but few neuropil threads. This monoclonal antibody labeled a 65-kDa protein, but not tau or ubiquitin, on a Western blot of human brain extract and immunoprecipitated the same protein. The peptides released from the purified 65-kDa protein had the same sequences as those of a newly identified protein, human collapsin response mediator protein-2. Incorporation into neurofibrillary tangles may deplete soluble, cytosolic human collapsin response mediator protein-2 and lead to abnormal neuritic and/or axonal outgrowth of the tangle-bearing neuron, thus accelerating the neuritic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
