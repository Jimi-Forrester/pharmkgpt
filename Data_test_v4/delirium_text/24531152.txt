24531152|t|Paradoxical effect of TrkA inhibition in Alzheimer's disease models.
24531152|a|An unbiased screen for compounds that block amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) caspase cleavage identified ADDN-1351, which reduced AbetaPP-C31 by 90%. Target identification studies showed that ADDN-1351 is a TrkA inhibitor, and, in complementary studies, TrkA overexpression increased AbetaPP-C31 and cell death. TrkA was shown to interact with AbetaPP and suppress AbetaPP-mediated transcriptional activation. Moreover, treatment of PDAPP transgenic mice with the known TrkA inhibitor GW441756 increased sAbetaPPalpha and the sAbetaPPalpha to Abeta ratio. These results suggest TrkA inhibition-rather than NGF activation-as a novel therapeutic approach, and raise the possibility that such an approach may counteract the hyperactive signaling resulting from the accumulation of active NGF-TrkA complexes due to reduced retrograde transport. The results also suggest that one component of an optimal therapy for Alzheimer's disease may be a TrkA inhibitor.
