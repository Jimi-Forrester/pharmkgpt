28356047|a|BACKGROUND: The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a neuroprotective cytokine that promotes neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the brain. In animal models, it has been shown that environmental enrichment and exercise, two non-pharmacological interventions that are beneficial decreasing the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD) and depressive-like behavior, enhance hippocampal VEGF expression and neurogenesis. Furthermore, the stimulation of VEGF expression promotes neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity processes such as neurogenesis. It is thought that these VEGF actions in the brain, may underly its beneficial therapeutic effects against psychiatric and other neurological conditions. CONCLUSION: In this review, evidence linking VEGF deficit with the development of AD as well as the potential role of VEGF signaling as a therapeutic target for cotinine and other interventions in neurodegenerative conditions are discussed.
