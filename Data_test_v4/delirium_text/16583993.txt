16583993|a|The evidence implicating aluminum as a neurotoxin is mounting. Research with animals and humans has linked aluminum with neuro-cognitive dysfunction and, in some cases, death. Although the relationship between aluminum intake and Alzheimer's disease is still unclear, some experts have recently issued a strong warning that human exposure to aluminum should be limited. The results indicate that the amount of aluminum decreased in the urine in mice that were administered glycine or glutamic acid together with aluminum ion. In the mice in which the amounts of aluminum decreased in the urine, the amount of calcium conversely increased.
