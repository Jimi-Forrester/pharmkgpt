37752547|a|BACKGROUND: Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is becoming a prevalent global health problem. 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) serves as a common marker of oxidative stress. This study aims to study the potential role of 4-HNE in the progression of steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SIONFH). METHOD: Between April 2021 and December 2021, 64 subjects were enrolled in this cross-sectional case-control study. Thirty-six patients were grouped based on the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification, and 28 healthy volunteers without hip pain or any lesions shown in anteroposterior and frog-leg lateral pelvic radiographs served as the normal control group. Bone hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, microcomputed tomography (micro-CT), immunohistochemistry, and levels of plasma 4-HNE were evaluated. RESULTS: The 4-HNE level was higher in the SIONFH group than in the normal control group (P < 0.001), and 4-HNE levels were significantly higher in SIONFH patients in the early stage of disease (stage II). The 4-HNE level was negatively correlated with ARCO stage (r = - 0.6875, P < 0.001). Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of 4-HNE in the trabecular bone, osteocytes, and bone marrow. CONCLUSION: The 4-HNE level is negatively associated with ARCO stages. Lower levels of 4-HNE may serve as a critical biomarker for the progression of SIONFH.
