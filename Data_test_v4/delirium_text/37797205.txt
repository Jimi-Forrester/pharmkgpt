37797205|t|Brain Health Registry Study Partner Portal: Novel infrastructure for digital, dyadic data collection.
37797205|a|BACKGROUND: In Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, subjective reports of cognitive and functional decline from participant-study partner dyads is an efficient method of assessing cognitive impairment and clinical progression. METHODS: Demographics and subjective cognitive/functional decline (Everyday Cognition Scale [ECog]) scores from dyads enrolled in the Brain Health Registry (BHR) Study Partner Portal were analyzed. Associations between dyad characteristics and both ECog scores and study engagement were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 10,494 BHR participants (mean age = 66.9 +- 12.16 standard deviations, 67.4% female) have enrolled study partners (mean age = 64.3 +- 14.3 standard deviations, 49.3% female), including 8987 dyads with a participant 55 years of age or older. Older and more educated study partners were more likely to complete tasks and return for follow-up. Twenty-five percent to 27% of older adult participants had self and study partner-report ECog scores indicating a possible cognitive impairment. DISCUSSION: The BHR Study Partner Portal is a unique digital tool for capturing dyadic data, with high impact applications in the clinical neuroscience and AD fields. Highlights The Brain Health Registry (BHR) Study Partner Portal is a novel, digital platform of >10,000 dyads. Collection of dyadic online subjective cognitive and functional data is feasible. The portal has good usability as evidenced by positive study partner feedback. The portal is a potential scalable strategy for cognitive impairment screening in older adults.
