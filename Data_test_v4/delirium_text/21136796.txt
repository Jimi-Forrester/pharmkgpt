21136796|t|Proteomic identification of proteins in the human brain: Towards a more comprehensive understanding of neurodegenerative disease.
21136796|a|Proteomics has revealed itself as a powerful tool in the identification and determination of proteins and their biological significance. More recently, several groups have taken advantage of the high-throughput nature of proteomics in order to gain a more in-depth understanding of the human brain. In turn, this information has provided researchers with invaluable insight into the potential pathways and mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, e.g., Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. Furthermore, these findings likely will improve methods to diagnose disease and monitor disease progression as well as generate novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Despite these advances, comprehensive understanding of the human brain proteome remains challenging, and requires development of improved sample enrichment, better instrumentation, and innovative analytic techniques. In this review, we will focus on the most recent progress related to identification of proteins in the human brain under normal as well as pathological conditions, mainly Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, their potential application in biomarker discovery, and discuss current advances in protein identification aimed at providing a more comprehensive understanding of the brain.
