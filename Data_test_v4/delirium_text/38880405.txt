38880405|t|Increased Risk of Postoperative Complications in Patients Who Have Obstructive Sleep Apnea Undergoing Total Joint Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
38880405|a|BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been linked to multiple adverse health outcomes and postoperative complications. Despite the high prevalence of OSA in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA), few studies have evaluated the postoperative course of OSA patients after joint arthroplasty surgery. METHODS: PubMed (MEDLINE) and Scopus (EMBASE, MEDLINE, and COMPENDEX) were used to conduct a systematic review of articles from inception to July 2023. Primary studies comparing postoperative outcomes following TJA between patients who had and did not have OSA were included. Postoperative medical complications, utilization of critical care, hospital stay, and mortality data were extracted. Descriptive statistics and random-effects meta-analysis models were used to analyze the available data. Included studies were evaluated for methodological risks of bias using the risk of bias in non-randomized studies of interventions. This review was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (ID: CRD42023447610). RESULTS: There were 7 studies with a total of 20,977 patients (9,425 hip; 11,137 knee; 415 hip or knee) that were included. Pulmonary complications were most frequently studied, followed by thromboembolic events. Cardiac, gastrointestinal, hematologic, genitourinary, and delirium events were also reported across studies. Meta-analysis revealed that OSA patients had 4-fold increased odds of overall medical complications (OR [odds ratio], 4.23; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.97 to 6.04; P < .001; I2 = 0%), 4-fold increased odds of pulmonary complications (OR, 4.31; 95% CI, 2.82 to 6.60; P < .001; I2 = 0%), 2-fold increased odds of thromboembolic complications (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.22 to 3.03; P = .005; I2 = 9%), and 4-fold increased odds of delirium (OR, 3.94; 95% CI, 1.72 to 9.04; P = .001; I2 = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: A significant association was found between OSA and overall medical, pulmonary, and thromboembolic complications. These patients also had a higher incidence of postoperative delirium. The present findings underscore the need for comprehensive perioperative strategies to mitigate these risks in OSA patients who elect to undergo TJA.
