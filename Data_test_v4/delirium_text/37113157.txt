37113157|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common cause of lobar intracerebral hemorrhage in the elderly. It is also associated pathologically with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both CAA and AD share similar pathology of deposition amyloid beta fibrils (Abeta). Abeta is deposited mainly in the neurites in AD and vascular walls in CAA. Abeta is formed inside the brain parenchyma from the amyloid precursor protein. It is easier to understand how Abeta is deposited in the cerebral neurites in AD. However, the pathogenesis of CAA is still largely unknown. It is difficult to understand or visualize how Abeta fibrils formed inside the brain can be deposited against the cerebral perfusion pressure to be deposited in the cerebral and meningeal arterial walls. We encountered an unusual clinical case of acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage which was followed after a few years with localized CAA involving mainly the sites of the subarachnoid hemorrhage. We reviewed the formation of Abeta and postulated how the Abeta fibrils are transported retrogradely toward the cerebral arteries and deposited in the arterial walls resulting in the final pathology of CAA. There is a clear disturbance of the glymphatic system, the aquaporin-4 channel, and the parenchymal border macrophages.
