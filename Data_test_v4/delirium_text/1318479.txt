1318479|a|The characteristics of B cell lines isolated from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-matched controls were investigated after having been transformed by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). After isolation of mononuclear blood cells and in vivo or in vitro EBV infection, 35 and 21 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were generated from 19 patients with AD (mean age 79.4 years) and 21 age-matched controls (mean age 80.0 years), respectively. B lymphocytes from AD patients were immortalised more easily than those from controls; the percentage of in vitro EBV infected LCLs (B95-LCLs) obtained in the AD group was significantly higher (76.2% versus 33.3% in the control group) and the mean time required for establishment was significantly lower (20.2 and 21.9 days versus 26.7 and 60.9 days in the control group). The EBV receptor and surface immunoglobulin (Ig) analyses showed no difference between the two groups. The expression of Epstein-Barr early antigens (EA) and viral capsid antigens (VCAs) revealed a tendency to higher viral replication in LCLs from AD patients; however, VCA expression remained limited to a small number of cells and did not affect overall cell growth. Finally, qualitative and quantitative differences were observed in the pattern of Ig production. Whereas spontaneously established LCLs from AD patients were generally monoclonal (80% of LCLs versus 33% in the control group), B95-LCLs were all polyclonal and secreted more IgM and IgA than those from controls; the mean IgM level was significantly higher in B95-LCLs from the AD group. These results suggest that B cells derived from AD patients seemed to be less differentiated than cells from age-matched controls.
