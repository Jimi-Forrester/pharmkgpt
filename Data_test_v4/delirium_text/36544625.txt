36544625|a|Propranolol is a beta-adrenergic antagonist used in the management of hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, and angina pectoris. There is some evidence that propranolol may benefit individuals with behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). A total of three case series, one randomized controlled trial and one case report were identified (from a literature search of three major databases: PubMed, Ovid, and Cochrane collaboration) that assessed the use of propranolol for the management of BPSD. From these studies, it appears that propranolol improves BPSD, including agitation and aggression. Propranolol is also well tolerated with no significant bradycardia or hypotension noted in these studies. Current data on the use of propranolol for the management of BPSD are limited in comparison to other pharmacological agents (atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, and cannabinoids) and treatment modalities (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy). The efficacy and safety of these treatments among individuals with BPSD has been evaluated in multiple controlled studies. In clinical practice, the routine use of propranolol among people with BPSD cannot be recommended at this time given the limited data. However, propranolol can be trialled among individuals with BPSD when symptoms have not responded adequately to other medications. Propranolol may also be used prior to embarking on trials of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy among people with BPSD given the greater acceptance of this medication in the general population.
