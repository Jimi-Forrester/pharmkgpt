However, new computational tools which assist to automate this diagnosis have the potential to significantly improve the speed and accuracy of this process. This work presents a model to aid in the task of classification of structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans. The classification is performed using a Support Vector Machine, whilst the features to analyze belong to a dictionary space. Such space was mainly built from a dictionary learning perspective, although a predefined one was also assessed. The results indicate that features learnt from the data of interest lead to improved classification performance. The proposed framework was tested on the ADNI dataset stage I.
