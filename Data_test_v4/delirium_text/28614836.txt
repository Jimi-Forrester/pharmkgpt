28614836|t|Visual Evaluation of Medial Temporal Lobe Atrophy as a Clinical Marker of Conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Dementia and for Predicting Progression in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild Alzheimer's Disease.
28614836|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: To evaluate whether visual assessment of medial temporal lobe atrophy (vaMTA) can predict 2-year conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia and progression of MCI and Alzheimer's disease dementia as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes score (CDR-SB). METHODS: vaMTA was performed in 94 patients with MCI according to the Winblad criteria and in 124 patients with AD according to ICD-10 and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. Demographic data, the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease 10-word delayed recall, APOE e4 status, Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia, and comorbid hypertension were used as covariates. RESULTS: vaMTA was associated with MCI conversion in an unadjusted model but not in an adjusted model (p = 0.075), where delayed recall and APOE e4 status were significant predictors. With CDR-SB change as the outcome, an interaction between vaMTA and diagnosis was found, but in the adjusted model only delayed recall and age were significant predictors. For vaMTA below 2, the association between vaMTA and CDR-SB change differed between diagnostic groups. Similar results were found based on a trajectory analysis. CONCLUSION: In adjusted models, memory function, APOE e4 status and age were significant predictors of disease progression, not vaMTA. The association between vaMTA and CDR-SB change was different in patients with MCI and Alzheimer's disease dementia.
