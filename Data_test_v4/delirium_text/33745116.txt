33745116|t|Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes: a New Strategy of Neurodegenerative Disease Treatment.
33745116|a|Short-term symptomatic treatment and dose-dependent side effects of pharmacological treatment for neurodegenerative diseases have forced the medical community to seek an effective treatment for this serious global health threat. Therapeutic potential of stem cell for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders was identified in 1980 when fetal nerve tissue was used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). Then, extensive studies have been conducted to develop this treatment strategy for neurological disease therapy. Today, stem cells and their secretion are well-known as a therapeutic environment for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. This new paradigm has demonstrated special characteristics related to this treatment, including neuroprotective and neurodegeneration, remyelination, reduction of neural inflammation, and recovery of function after induced injury. However, the exact mechanism of stem cells in repairing nerve damage is not yet clear; exosomes derived from them, an important part of their secretion, are introduced as responsible for an important part of such effects. Numerous studies over the past few decades have evaluated the therapeutic potential of exosomes in the treatment of various neurological diseases. In this review, after recalling the features and therapeutic history, we will discuss the latest stem cell-derived exosome-based therapies for these diseases.
