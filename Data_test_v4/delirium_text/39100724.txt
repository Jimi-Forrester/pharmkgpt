39100724|a|Objective: By evaluating the level of serum procalcitonin (PCT), thromboelastography (TEG) and platelet count (PLT) of patients with septic shock in intensive care unit (ICU), the predictive value of the combination of the three indicators on the short-term progression was discussed, which provided a new basis for early clinical diagnosis and disease evaluation. Methods: The clinical data of 130 patients with septic shock admitted to the IUC of our hospital from December 2021 to December 2023 were analyzed retrospectively. These subjects were divided into good prognosis group (n=78) and poor prognosis group (n=52) according to the 28 d deaths. The influencing factors were explored using the Multivariate logistic regression analysis. The value of single or combined PCT, PLT and TEG in predicting poor short-term prognosis was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: The patients in poor prognosis group had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, serum PCT level, coagulation reaction time (R value) and coagulation formation time (K value), but lower PLT levels, final strength of coagulation (MA value) and coagulation formation rate (alpha angle) than those in good prognosis group (P<0.001). PCT, R value and K value were risk factors (P<0.001), while PLT, MA value and alpha angle were protective factors (P<0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) of PCT, PLT and TEG predicting poor short-term progression was 0.813, 0.658 and 0.752, respectively. The AUC of combined three indicators was 0.905, which had the highest predictive value. Conclusion: Serum levels of PCT, PLT and TEG had certain value in predicting poor short-term progression of septic shock patients, and their combined diagnostic value was higher. Therefore, regular monitoring of these three indicators could provide certain guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of poor short-term prognosis in patients with septic shock.
