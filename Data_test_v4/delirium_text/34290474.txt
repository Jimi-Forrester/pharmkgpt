34290474|t|The toxicologic pathology aspects of selected natural herbal products and related compounds.
34290474|a|Herbal products have been in use for many years, but they are becoming more and more popular in recent years, and they are currently in widespread use throughout the world. In this review article we describe the histopathologic findings found after exposure to 12 dietary herbals in studies conducted in rodent model systems. Clear or some evidence for carcinogenic activity was seen with 6 herbals, with the liver being the most common organ affected. The intestine was affected by two herbals (aloe vera nondecolorized extract and senna), three had no clear evidence for carcinogenic activity and one was cardiotoxic (Ephedrine and Ephedra in combination with caffeine). Information from these studies can help to better understand potential target organs for further evaluation from exposure to various herbal products.
