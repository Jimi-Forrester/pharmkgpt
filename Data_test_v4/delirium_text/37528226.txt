37528226|t|Activation of cell-free mtDNA-TLR9 signaling mediates chronic stress-induced social behavior deficits.
37528226|a|Inflammation and social behavior deficits are associated with a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. Chronic stress, a major risk factor for depression and other mental health conditions is known to increase inflammatory responses and social behavior impairments. Disturbances in mitochondria function have been found in chronic stress conditions, however the mechanisms that link mitochondrial dysfunction to stress-induced social behavior deficits are not well understood. In this study, we found that chronic restraint stress (RS) induces significant increases in serum cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA) levels in mice, and systemic Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) treatment attenuated RS-induced social behavioral deficits. Our findings revealed potential roles of mitophagy and Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) in mediating chronic stress-induced changes in cf-mtDNA levels and social behavior. Furthermore, we showed that inhibition of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) attenuates mtDNA-induced social behavior deficits. Together, these findings show that cf-mtDNA-TLR9 signaling is critical in mediating stress-induced social behavior deficits.
