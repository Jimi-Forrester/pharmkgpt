35287845|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and cognitive impairments. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and neurotoxicity play important roles in AD. It has been widely reported that heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans play a nonnegligible role in the release, uptake and misfolding of Abeta, resulting in the discovery of HS as a therapeutic drug for AD. In this manuscript, HS from porcine mucosa could promote Abeta fibrosis and improve the cognitive defects of APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice. Furthermore, HS enhanced the phagocytosis of neutrophils to clear Abeta1-42 from peripheral circulation, reduced peripheral Abeta1-42 flow to the brain and increased Abeta efflux from the brain. Therefore, the deposition of Abeta plaques in the brain was decreased. In addition, HS alleviated neutrophil infiltration and reduced neuroinflammation. Conclusively, HS is a promising neuroprotective candidate for AD treatment.
