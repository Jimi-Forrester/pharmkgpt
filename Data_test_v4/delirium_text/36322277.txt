36322277|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of senile dementia, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive dysfunction and behavioral disability. The two histopathological hallmarks in this disease are the extraneuronal accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and the intraneuronal deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Despite this, central and peripheral metabolic dysfunction, such as abnormal brain signaling, insulin resistance, inflammation, and impaired glucose utilization, have been indicated to be correlated with AD. There is solid evidence that the age-associated thermoregulatory deficit induces diverse metabolic changes associated with AD development. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been known as a thermoregulatory organ particularly vital during infancy. However, in recent years, BAT has been accepted as an endocrine organ, being involved in various functions that prevent AD, such as regulating energy metabolism, secreting hormones, improving insulin sensitivity, and increasing glucose utilization in adult humans. This review focuses on the mechanisms of BAT activation and the effect of aging on BAT production and signaling. Specifically, the evidence demonstrating the effect of BAT on pathological mechanisms influencing the development of AD, including insulin pathway, thermoregulation, and other hormonal pathways, are reviewed in this article.
