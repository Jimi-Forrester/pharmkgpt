35053877|t|RP-HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS Qualitative Profiling, Antioxidant, Anti-Enzymatic, Anti-Inflammatory, and Non-Cytotoxic Properties of Ephedra alata Monjauzeana.
35053877|a|An investigation was conducted to study the beneficial effects of Ephedra alata monjauzeana crude extract (EamCE). The chemical profile was determined using RP-HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis, revealing the presence of twenty-one flavonoids and phenolic acids. A series of antioxidant assays was carried out using ten different methods. The EamCE has demonstrated a significant antioxidant potential, with interesting IC50 values not exceeding 40 microg/mL in almost activities. Likewise, a significant inhibition of key enzymes, involved in some health issues, such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, hyperpigmentation, dermatological disorders, gastric/urinary bacterial infections, and obesity, was observed for the first time. The IC50 values ranged from 22.46 to 54.93. The anti-inflammatory and non-cytotoxic activities were assessed by heat-induced hemolysis and cell culture methods, respectively; the EamCE has shown a prominent effect in both tests, notably for the anti-inflammatory effect that was superior to the reference compound "diclofenac" (IC50: 71.03 +- 1.38 > 70.23 +- 0.99 (microg/mL)). According to these results, this plant could be used in a large spectrum as a food supplement, as a natural remedy for various physiological disorders and pathologies; and it might serve as a preventive and health care agent.
