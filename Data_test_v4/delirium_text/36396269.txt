36396269|t|COVID-19: Brain Effects.
36396269|a|Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), affects the brain. Neurologic and neuropsychiatric symptoms may manifest in the acute and post-acute phases of illness. The vulnerability of the brain with aging further increases the burden of disease in the elderly, who are at the highest risk of complications and death from COVID-19. The mechanisms underlying the effects of COVID-19 on the brain are not fully known. Emerging evidence vis-a-vis pathogenesis and etiologies of COVID-19 brain effects is promising and may pave the way for future research and development of interventions.
