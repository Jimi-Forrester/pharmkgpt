39246973|a|BACKGROUND: The effect of intraoperative anesthesia depth monitoring on delirium occurrence and improvement of nursing quality in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) remains unclear. We aimed to explore the effect of intraoperative anesthesia bispectral index (BIS) monitoring on delirium occurrence and improvement of nursing quality in the PACU for patients recovering from general anesthesia. METHODS:  This randomized controlled trial included 120 patients, aged 20-80 years, classified as grades I-III according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists. The BIS-guided group (group B) underwent intraoperative monitoring of BIS anesthesia depth (maintained within the anesthetic range (40-60)). The depth of anesthesia was not monitored in the non-BIS-guided group (group C). The patient's vital signs were recorded at the beginning of the operation (T0), upon entering the PACU (T1), 15 min after extubation (T2), and after leaving the PACU (T3). Delirium score, emergence period (extubation and PACU observation times), and adverse events in the PACU were monitored. The nursing activity score (NAS) was used to evaluate the quality of care. RESULTS: Group B exhibited significantly lower heart rate and mean arterial pressure at T1 and T2, shorter time to extubation and PACU observation time, and a significantly lower incidence of adverse events than group C. Group B had significantly lower Ricker sedation-agitation scores and a lower incidence of delirium than group C. The NAS was significantly lower for group B than for group C. Patients aged 60-80 years in group C experienced agitation, requiring 30% more frequent assistance from one or two nurses than those in group B. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative BIS monitoring can reduce the incidence of adverse events in the PACU, diminish the incidence of delirium during the recovery period in elderly patients, lessen the nursing workload, improve nursing quality, and promote patient rehabilitation, thus meriting clinical application.
