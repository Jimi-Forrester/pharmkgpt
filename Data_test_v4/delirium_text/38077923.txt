38077923|a|COVID-19 is primarily classified as a respiratory disorder; however, various neurological symptoms have been reported in COVID-19 patients. Neurological manifestations may be the initial signs of COVID-19 and can develop in patients of different age groups and with or without underlying disease. COVID-19 causes a broad range of complications in the central nervous system. These include headaches, altered mental status, dizziness, seizures, cerebrovascular events, encephalitis, and other encephalopathies. Moreover, a broad spectrum of peripheral nervous system symptoms such as olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, neuropathy, visual impairments, neuralgia, cranial nerves palsy, and muscle involvement could manifest as symptoms. Despite various efforts, the exact pathogenesis of the COVID-19 neurological complications has not been clarified yet. Moreover, the reason for the development of neurological manifestation in only some COVID-19 patients has not been determined. This review focuses on the different neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19 and the possible pathological mechanisms hoping to provide new insights for diagnosis, therapies, or other forms of intervention.
