18846579|t|Apolipoprotein E genotype is related to nitric oxide production in platelets.
18846579|a|The presence of the epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is considered a risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our recent data demonstrated that the systemic modulation of oxidative stress in platelets and erythrocytes is disrupted in aging and AD. In this study, the relationship between APOE genotype and oxidative stress markers, both in AD patients and controls, was evaluated. The AD group showed an increase in the content of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and in the activities of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and Na, K-ATPase, when compared to controls. Both groups had a similar cGMP content and superoxide dismutase activity. APOE epsilon4 allele carriers showed higher NOS activity than non-carriers. These results suggest a possible influence of APOE genotype on nitric oxide (NO) production that might enhance the effects of age-related specific factor(s) associated with neurodegenerative disorders.
