39075460|a|BACKGROUND: The Target Product Profile (TPP) is a tool used in industry to guide development strategies by addressing user needs and fostering effective communication among stakeholders. However, they are not frequently used in academic research, where they may be equally useful. This systematic review aims to extract the features of accessible TPPs, to identify commonalities and facilitate their integration in academic research methodology. METHODS: We searched peer-reviewed papers published in English developing TPPs for different products and health conditions in four biomedical databases. Interrater agreement, computed on random abstract and paper sets (Cohen's Kappa; percentage agreement with zero tolerance) was > 0.91. We interviewed experts from industry contexts to gain insight on the process of TPP development, and extracted general and specific features on TPP use and structure. RESULTS: 138 papers were eligible for data extraction. Of them, 92% (n = 128) developed a new TPP, with 41.3% (n = 57) focusing on therapeutics. The addressed disease categories were diverse; the largest (47.1%, n = 65) was infectious diseases. Only one TPP was identified for several fields, including global priorities like dementia. Our analyses found that 56.5% of papers (n = 78) was authored by academics, and 57.8% of TPPs (n = 80) featured one threshold level of product performance. The number of TPP features varied widely across and within product types (n = 3-44). Common features included purpose/context of use, shelf life for drug stability and validation aspects. Most papers did not describe the methods used to develop the TPP. We identified aspects to be taken into account to build and report TPPs, as a starting point for more focused initiatives guiding use by academics. DISCUSSION: TPPs are used in academic research mostly for infectious diseases and have heterogeneous features. Our extraction of key features and common structures helps to understand the tool and widen its use in academia. This is of particular relevance for areas of notable unmet needs, like dementia. Collaboration between stakeholders is key for innovation. Tools to streamline communication such as TPPs would support the development of products and services in academia as well as industry.
