23225543|a|OBJECTIVE: Although amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide deposition into insoluble plaques is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease; soluble oligomeric Abeta has been hypothesized to more directly underlie impaired learning and memory in dementia of the Alzheimer type. However, the lack of a sensitive, specific, and quantitative assay for Abeta oligomers has hampered rigorous tests of this hypothesis. METHODS: We developed a plate-based single molecule counting fluorescence immunoassay for oligomeric Abeta sensitive to low pg/ml concentrations of synthetic Abeta dimers using the same Abeta-specific monoclonal antibody to both capture and detect Abeta. The Abeta oligomer assay does not recognize monomeric Abeta, amyloid precursor protein, or other non-Abeta peptide oligomers. RESULTS: Abeta oligomers were detected in aqueous cortical lysates from patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type and nondemented patients with Abeta plaque pathology. However, Abeta oligomer concentrations in demented patients' lysates were tightly correlated with Abeta plaque coverage (r = 0.88), but this relationship was weaker in those from nondemented patients (r = 0.30) despite equivalent Abeta plaque pathology. The ratio of Abeta oligomer levels to plaque density fully distinguished demented from nondemented patients, with no overlap between groups in this derived variable. Other Abeta and plaque measures did not distinguish demented from nondemented patients. Abeta oligomers were not detected in cerebrospinal fluid with this assay. INTERPRETATION: The results raise the intriguing hypothesis that the linkage between plaques and oligomers may be a key pathophysiological event underlying dementia of the Alzheimer type. This Abeta oligomer assay may be useful for many tests of the oligomer hypothesis.
