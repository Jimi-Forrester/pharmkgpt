39064039|t|The Impact of Race/Ethnicity on Disparities in Utilization and Outcomes of Neuraxial Anesthesia for Hip and Femoral Shaft Fractures.
39064039|a|Background/Objectives: The use of neuraxial anesthesia versus general anesthesia for hip fracture surgery remains an active area of research, with recent studies demonstrating mixed findings supporting neuraxial over general anesthesia. The benefits of neuraxial anesthesia have been documented in associated surgeries, including total joint arthroplasty. However, racial disparities in the administration of neuraxial anesthesia have been identified in numerous procedures. We aimed to examine the association of race/ethnicity with neuraxial anesthesia use and the effect of neuraxial anesthesia on length of stay, non-home discharge, 30-day severe adverse events, and rates of readmission among patients undergoing isolated hip and femoral shaft fracture operations. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement Program database was queried for isolated hip or femoral shaft fractures from 2015 to 2019. Stepwise logistic regression was performed to assess the relationship between race/ethnicity and neuraxial anesthesia use. Within each sex-race stratum, neuraxial anesthesia recipients were propensity-matched to general anesthesia recipients in a 1:2 ratio. Logistic regression and negative binomial regression were performed on the propensity-matched cohort. Results: A total of 12,004 neuraxial and 64,250 general anesthesia hip and femoral shaft fracture patients were identified. Compared to White patients, Black and Hispanic patients were between 0.64 and 0.61 times less likely to receive neuraxial anesthesia over general anesthesia, respectively (p < 0.05). 11,993 patients who received neuraxial anesthesia were propensity matched to 23,946 patients who received general anesthesia. Propensity-matched logistic regressions found that neuraxial anesthesia was associated with decreased length of stay, 30-day severe adverse events, and acute rehab/skilled nursing facility discharge for White patients (p < 0.05 for all), but only decreased length of stay in Black and Hispanic patients (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively). Conclusions: Notable disparities exist in the administration of neuraxial anesthesia for isolated hip and femoral shaft fracture patients. Hispanic and Black race/ethnicity in particular influences provision of neuraxial anesthesia. Further research is required to understand the degree of effect modification and root causes of regional anesthesia access and benefits for this high-volume patient population.
