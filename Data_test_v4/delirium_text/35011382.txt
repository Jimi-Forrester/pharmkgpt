35011382|t|Recent Advances in Aggregation-Induced Emission Active Materials for Sensing of Biologically Important Molecules and Drug Delivery System.
35011382|a|The emergence and development of aggregation induced emission (AIE) have attracted worldwide attention due to its unique photophysical phenomenon and for removing the obstacle of aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) which is the most detrimental process thereby making AIE an important and promising aspect in various fields of fluorescent material, sensing, bioimaging, optoelectronics, drug delivery system, and theranostics. In this review, we have discussed insights and explored recent advances that are being made in AIE active materials and their application in sensing, biological cell imaging, and drug delivery systems, and, furthermore, we explored AIE active fluorescent material as a building block in supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we focus on various AIE active molecules such as tetraphenylethylene, AIE-active polymer, quantum dots, AIE active metal-organic framework and triphenylamine, not only in terms of their synthetic routes but also we outline their applications. Finally, we summarize our view of the construction and application of AIE-active molecules, which thus inspiring young researchers to explore new ideas, innovations, and develop the field of supramolecular chemistry in years to come.
