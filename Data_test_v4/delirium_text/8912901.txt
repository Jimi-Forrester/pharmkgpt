8912901|a|The amyloid burden and relationship between amyloid deposits and neural elements were investigated in sections of prefrontal neocortex from eight Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and four age-matched nondemented controls with high amyloid plaque density (HPND). Computer-based image analysis revealed that the total area occupied by betaA4 immunoreactivity was significantly greater (P < 0.031) in AD (27.1%) than in HPND (14.5%) sections. The total betaA4-positive area occupied by nondiffuse plaques was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in AD (13.6%) than in HPND (5.2%) sections. The percentage of diffuse (DPs) and nondiffuse plaques (NDPs) which contained neurons, astrocytes, microglia, dystrophic neurites, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) was also determined. The frequency of association between betaA4 and these neural elements was similar between AD and HPND cases in both diffuse and nondiffuse plaques. Forty percent of DPs in AD and HPND sections contained neuronal perikarya. Microglia, dystrophic neurites, and APP were detected in most nondiffuse plaques in both AD and HPND sections. While astrocyte cell bodies were not present in either diffuse or nondiffuse plaques, their processes were detected in most. These findings indicate that amyloid deposition and nondiffuse plaques are greater in AD than in HPND sections. The association between microglia and nondiffuse plaques supports the hypothesis that these resident immune cells participate in aggregation and redistribution of amyloid deposits and possibly formation of dystrophic neurites.
