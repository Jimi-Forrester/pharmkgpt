29561754|a|The susceptibility of guided bone regeneration (GBR) material to infection by pathogens at wound sites during bone healing has often been overlooked. The objective of this study was the synthesis and characterization of a potential material for antibacterial GBR application. In the current study, the mechanical strength and biocompatibility of a composite restoration material-made of oxidized hyaluronic acid (HA)/type I collagen hydrogel integrated with tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) using a natural crosslinking agent, oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs)-were evaluated. The suitability of the material as a carrier matrix for antibacterial applications was evaluated by following the drug-release profile of tetracycline loaded within the composite. Results indicated that this composite material had a high swelling ratio of 420% and mechanical strength of 25 kPa while remaining at more than 60% of the weight after 30 days of an in vitro degradation test with good biocompatibility in promoting the proliferation of MG-63 cells. Drug release studies further showed that 93% of the tetracycline was released after 5 days, which supports this GBR material's capability to release antibacterial drugs while keeping other required GBR material design functions.
