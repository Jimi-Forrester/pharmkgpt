34285057|t|Association between preoperative frailty and outcomes among adults undergoing cardiac surgery: a prospective cohort study.
34285057|a|BACKGROUND: The identification of frailty before complex and invasive procedures may have relevance for prognostic and recovery purposes, to optimally inform patients, caregivers and clinicians about perioperative risk and postoperative care needs. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of frailty and describe the associated clinical course and outcomes of patients referred for nonemergent cardiac surgery. METHODS: A prospective cohort of patients aged 50 years and older referred for nonemergent cardiac surgery in Alberta, Canada, from November 2011 to March 2014 were screened preoperatively for frailty, defined as a Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score of 5 or greater. Postoperatively, patients were followed by telephone to assess CFS score, health services use and vital status. The primary outcome was all-cause hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included health services use, hospital discharge disposition, 1-year health-related quality of life and all-cause 5-year mortality. RESULTS: The cohort (n = 529) had a mean age of 67 (standard deviation [SD] 9) years; 25.9% were female, and the prevalence of frailty was 9.6% (n = 51; 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.3%-12.5%). Frail patients were older (median age 75, interquartile range [IQR] 65-80 v. 67, IQR 60-73, yr; p < 0.001), were more likely to be female (51.0% v. 23.2%; p < 0.001), had a higher mean EuroSCORE II (8, SD 3 v. 5, SD 3; p < 0.001) and received combined coronary artery bypass grafting and valve procedures more frequently (29.4% v. 15.9%; p = 0.02) than nonfrail patients. Postoperatively, frail patients had a longer median duration of stay in the cardiovascular intensive care unit (median difference 2.2, 95% CI 1.60-2.79) and hospital (median difference 9.3, 95% CI 8.2-10.3). Hospital mortality was 9.8% among frail patients and 1.0% among nonfrail patients (adjusted hazard ratio 3.84, 95% CI 0.90-16.34). INTERPRETATION: Preoperative frailty was present in 10% of patients and was associated with a higher risk of morbidity and greater health services use. Preoperative frailty has important implications for the postoperative clinical course and resource utilization of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
