36901315|t|Association of Religious Service Attendance and Neuropsychiatric Symptoms, Cognitive Function, and Sleep Disturbances in All-Cause Dementia.
36901315|a|Commonly reported in dementia, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), cognitive decline, and sleep disturbances indicate dementia progression. With the growing dementia burden, identifying protective factors that may slow dementia progression is increasingly essential. Religion and spirituality are associated with better mental and physical health, yet few studies have been reported in older adults with dementia. This study examines associations between religious service attendance and symptoms of dementia progression. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study in 2000, 2006, and 2008 and the sub-study, Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study in 2001-2003, 2006-2007, and 2008-2009, we examined the association of religious attendance with neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive function, and sleep disturbances among U.S. older adults aged 70 years and older with all-cause dementia (N = 72) using Spearman's partial Rho correlation controlling for social interaction. Significant associations were identified for religious attendance and NPS (rs (97) = -0.124, 95% CI [-0.129, -0.119], p < 0.0005); cognitive function, rs (97) = -0.018, 95% CI [-0.023, -0.013], p < 0.001); and sleep disturbances, rs (97) = -0.275, 95% CI [-0.280, -0.271], p < 0.0005). Beyond adjusting for social interaction, increased religious attendance was associated with lower NPS, better cognitive function, and fewer sleep disturbances. Clinical trials and longitudinal studies with a larger sample size examining religion and spirituality factors with dementia progression are warranted.
