39493395|a|This study aimed to explore the protective effects of Euonymus alatus (EA) leaves and its compounds on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced neuronal cell death. EA effectively reversed the H2O2-induced decrease in HT22 cell viability. Anti-apoptotic marker poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase significantly increased with EA treatment, whereas BAX/BCL2 and cleaved caspase-3/procaspase-3 ratios, which represent apoptotic markers, were dose-dependently decreased by EA treatment. Additionally, EA effectively decreased beta-secretase production, acetylcholine esterase activity, and Tau phosphorylation, pathological features observed in Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, EA significantly increased the protein levels of NRF2 and HO-1, as well as the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes, including catalase, superoxide dismutase 1, and glutathione peroxidase. LC-MS/MS and HPLC analyses revealed the presence of chlorogenic acid and leucosides in EA. Both chlorogenic acid and leucosides showed protective effects against H2O2-induced neuronal cell death. This study highlights the potential of EA and its compounds as functional edible agents for neuroprotection against oxidative stress.
