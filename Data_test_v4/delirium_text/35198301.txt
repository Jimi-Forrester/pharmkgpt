35198301|t|Procedural Sedation Using Two Different Proportions of Ketamine-Propofol Combination in Short Gynecological Procedures: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
35198301|a|BACKGROUND: Procedural sedation with a combination of propofol and ketamine for short-duration surgeries is a convenient technique of anesthesia as it has a faster recovery avoiding the side effects of general anesthesia. The aim of this study was to compare the sedative and analgesic effects of two different proportions of ketamine and propofol combination in patients undergoing short gynecological procedures. METHODS: A randomized double-blind study was conducted in 140 patients posted for elective gynecological procedures with a duration equal to or less than 30 minutes. After premedication of all participants, sedation was induced with bolus administration (0.1 mL/kg) of the study drugs to achieve desired Ramsay sedation score (RSS) of 6, followed by infusion at 0.3 mL/kg/h (Group A, ketamine:propofol in the ratio of 1:4 and Group B, ketamine:propofol in the ratio of 1:2). The adequacy of sedation, volume of drug to induce the patient, time to achieve desired RSS, time for first bolus dose, the total volume of the drugs, hemodynamic variables, awakening time, and side effects were observed. RESULTS: The incidence of movement of lower extremities was found to be significantly lower in the higher concentration ketamine group (Group B, P - 0.028). The volume of a drug for induction and the duration to reach RSS of 6 were significantly lower in Group B with P-values of 0.002 and <0.001, respectively. Hemodynamic variables, awakening time, and side effects were not statistically significant between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Ketamine-propofol combination in the ratio 1:2 provides better sedation and analgesia with no increased side-effects compared to ketamine-propofol in the ratio 1:4 for short outpatient gynecological procedures.
