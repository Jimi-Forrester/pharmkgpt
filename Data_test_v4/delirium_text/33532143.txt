33532143|t|Pharmacological Treatment of Vascular Dementia: A Molecular Mechanism Perspective.
33532143|a|Vascular dementia (VaD) is a neurodegenerative disease, with cognitive dysfunction attributable to cerebrovascular factors. At present, it is the second most frequently occurring type of dementia in older adults (after Alzheimer's disease). The underlying etiology of VaD has not been completely elucidated, which limits its management. Currently, there are no approved standard treatments for VaD. The drugs used in VaD are only suitable for symptomatic treatment and cannot prevent or reduce the occurrence and progression of VaD. This review summarizes the current status of pharmacological treatment for VaD, from the perspective of the molecular mechanisms specified in various pathogenic hypotheses, including oxidative stress, the central cholinergic system, neuroinflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and synaptic plasticity. As VaD is a chronic cerebrovascular disease with multifactorial etiology, combined therapy, targeting multiple pathophysiological factors, may be the future trend in VaD.
