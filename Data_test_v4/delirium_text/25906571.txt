METHODS: The genotyping of amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1(APP/PS1I) double-transgenic AD mice were detected by PCR method. Seventeen 1.5-month female transgenic (Tg 6799) mice were randomly divided into a model group (9 cases) and a treatment group (8 cases). Nine female C57BL/6J wild-type mice with identical age and background were selected into a normal group. The treatment group was treated with grain-sized moxibustion at bilateral "Xinshu" (BI. 15) and "Shenshu" (BL 23), once a day, ten treatments were considered as one course, and total 9 courses were given. The model group and normal group were treated with stimulus such as grabbing, immobilization and non-ignited moxa cone. Morris water maze (escape latency, crossing times and dwell time in the target quadrant) was applied to evaluate the learning and memory ability. Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining was used to observe morphology changes in the brains of AD mice. beta-amyloid protein 1-42 (Abeta(1-42)) in the area of prefrontal cortex and hippocampus was detected by immunohistochemical method. RESULTS: After the treatment of grain-sized moxibustion, learning and memory ability in the treatment group was increased; compared with the model group, the escape latency was shorten, crossing times was increased, and dwell time in the target quadrant was prolonged (all P<0. 05). The crossing times and dwell time in the target quadrant in the treatment group were not significantly different from those in the normal group (both P>0.05). Compared with the normal group, the positive area and integral optical density of Abeta(1-42) in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in the model group were increased (all P<0.01). Compared with the model group, the positive area and integral optical density of Abeta(1-42) in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in the treatment group were reduced (P<0.01, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The grain-sized moxibustion at "Xinshu" (BL 15) and "Shenshu" (BL 23) could significantly improve the learning and memory ability in APP/PS1 double- transgenic AD mice, and inhibit the over expression and accumulation of Abeta(1-42).
