15652444|a|A significant number of patients with terminal cancer experience terminal restlessness or an agitated delirium in the final days of life. Multifactorial etiologies may contribute to agitation and restlessness for any one patient; alcohol withdrawal may be underrated as a contributing factor. The symptoms and signs of alcohol withdrawal--autonomic dysfunction, tremor, anxiety, sleep disturbances, insomnia, and abnormal vital signs--may continue for 6 to 12 months after the cessation of alcohol. We report four patients with terminal restlessness in whom we believe alcohol withdrawal to be a significant causal factor and a fifth patient who subsequently benefited from our team's increased awareness of this clinical problem. Formal assessment of alcohol withdrawal may be of more value in the palliative setting than using the currently accepted assessment instruments. Many of the medications utilized for the treatment of agitated delirium and terminal restlessness in the palliative care setting are effective therapies for alcohol withdrawal.
