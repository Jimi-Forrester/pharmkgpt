37924842|t|Association of neurocognitive disorders with morbidity and mortality in older adults undergoing major surgery in the USA: a retrospective, population-based, cohort study.
37924842|a|BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive disorders become increasingly common as patients age, and increasing numbers of surgical interventions are done on older patients. The aim of this study was to understand the clinical characteristics and outcomes of surgical patients with neurocognitive disorders in the USA in order to guide future targeted interventions for better care. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used claims data for US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with a record of inpatient admission for a major diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedure between Jan 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 2018. Data were retrieved through a data use agreement between Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center and US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services via the Research Data Assistance Center. The exposure of interest was the presence of a pre-existing neurocognitive disorder as defined by diagnostic code within 3 years of index hospital admission. The primary outcome was mortality at 30 days, 90 days, and 365 days from date of surgery among all patients with available data. FINDINGS: Among 5 263 264 Medicare patients who underwent a major surgical procedure, 767 830 (14 59%) had a pre-existing neurocognitive disorder and 4 495 434 (85 41%) had no pre-existing neurocognitive disorder. Adjusting for demographic factors and comorbidities, patients with a neurocognitive disorder had higher 30-day (hazard ratio 1 24 [95% CI 1 23-1 25]; p<0 0001), 90-day (1 25 [1 24-1 26]; p<0 0001), and 365-day mortality (1 25 [1 25-1 26]; p<0 0001) compared with patients without a neurocognitive disorder. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that the presence of a neurocognitive disorder is independently associated with an increased risk of mortality. Identification of a neurocognitive disorder before surgery can help clinicians to better disclose risks and plan for patient care after hospital discharge.
