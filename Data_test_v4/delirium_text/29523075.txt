29523075|a|BACKGROUND: Self-efficacy has been shown to be positively correlated with self-care behaviour and glycaemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, such evidence is lacking in the Malaysian primary care setting. The objectives of this study were to i) determine the levels of self-efficacy, self-care behaviour and glycaemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Malaysian primary care setting ii) determine the relationship between self-efficacy, self-care behaviour and glycaemic control iii) determine the factors associated with glycaemic control. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus from two public primary care clinics in Malaysia. Self-efficacy and self-care behaviour levels were measured using previously translated and validated DMSES and SDSCA questionnaires in Malay versions, respectively. Glycaemic control was measured using HbA1c. RESULTS: A total of 340 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited. The total mean (+-SD) of self-efficacy and self-care behaviour scores were 7.33 (+-2.25) and 3.76 (+-1.87), respectively. A positive relationship was found between self-efficacy and self-care behaviour (r 0.538, P < 0.001). Higher self-efficacy score was shown to be correlated with lower HbA1c (r - 0.41, P < 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that higher self-efficacy scores (b - 0.398; 95% CI: -0.024, - 0.014; P < 0.001), shorter duration of diabetes (b 0.177; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.007; P < 0.001) and smaller waist circumference (b 0.135; 95% CI: 0.006, 0.035; P = 0.006), were significantly associated with good glycaemic control. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that higher self-efficacy was correlated with improved self-care behaviour and better glycaemic control. Findings of this study suggest the importance of including routine use of self-efficacy measures in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in primary care.
