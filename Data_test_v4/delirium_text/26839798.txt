26839798|t|Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of New 2-Phenyl-4H-chromen-4-one Derivatives as Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors.
26839798|a|In order to develop new selective COX-2 inhibitors, a new series of 2-phenyl-4H-chromen-4-one derivatives possessing a methylsulfonyl pharmacophore group at the para position of the C-4 phenyl ring were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitory activity. In vitro COX-1/COX-2 isozyme inhibition structure-activity studies identified 3-(benzyloxy)-2-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-4H-chromen-4-one (5d) as a potent COX-2 inhibitor (IC50 = 0.07 muM) with a high COX-2 selectivity index (SI = 287.1) comparable to the reference drug celecoxib (COX-2 IC50 = 0.06 muM; COX-2 SI = 405). A molecular modeling study where 3-(benzyloxy)-2-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-4H-chromen-4-one (5d) was docked into the active site of COX-2 showed that the p-MeSO2 substituent on the C-4 phenyl ring was well-oriented in the vicinity of the COX-2 secondary pocket (Arg(513), Val(523), and His(90)) and the carbonyl group of the chromene ring could interact with Ser(530). The structure-activity data acquired indicated that the nature and size of the substituent on the C-3 chromene scaffold are important for COX-2 inhibitory activity. Our results also indicated that the chromene moiety constitutes a suitable template to design new COX-2 inhibitors.
