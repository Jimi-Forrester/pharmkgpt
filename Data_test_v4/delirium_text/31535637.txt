31535637|t|delta-Opioid receptor as a potential therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.
31535637|a|Ischemic stroke is a global epidemic condition due to an inadequate supply of blood and oxygen to a specific area of brain either by arterial blockage or by narrowing of blood vessels. Despite having advancement in the use of thrombolytic and clot removal medicine, significant numbers of stroke patients are still left out without option for treatment. In this review, we summarize recent research work on the activation of delta-opioid receptor as a strategy for treating ischemic stroke-caused neuronal injury. Moreover, as activation of delta-opioid receptor by a non-peptidic delta-opioid receptor agonist also modulates the expression, maturation and processing of amyloid precursor protein and beta-secretase activity, the potential role of these effects on ischemic stroke caused dementia or Alzheimer's disease are also discussed.
