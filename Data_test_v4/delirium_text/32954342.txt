32954342|t|Cholinergic muscarinic M1/M4 receptor networks in dementia with Lewy bodies.
32954342|a|Cholinergic dysfunction is central in dementia with Lewy bodies, possibly contributing to the cognitive and psychiatric phenotypes of this condition. We investigated baseline muscarinic M1/M4 receptor spatial covariance patterns in dementia with Lewy bodies and their association with changes in cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment with the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil. Thirty-eight participants (14 cholinesterase inhibitor naive patients, 24 healthy older individuals) underwent 123I-iodo-quinuclidinyl-benzilate (M1/M4 receptor assessment) and 99mTc-exametazime (perfusion) single-photon emission computed tomography scanning. We implemented voxel principal components analysis, producing a series of images representing patterns of inter-correlated voxels across individuals. Linear regression analyses derived specific M1/M4 and perfusion spatial covariance patterns associated with patients. A discreet M1/M4 pattern that distinguished patients from controls (W1,19.7 = 16.7, P = 0.001), showed relative decreased binding in right lateral temporal and insula, as well as relative preserved/increased binding in frontal, precuneus, lingual and cuneal regions, implicating nodes within attention and dorsal visual networks. We then derived from patients an M1/M4 pattern that correlated with a positive change in mini-mental state examination (r = 0.52, P = 0.05), showing relative preserved/increased uptake in prefrontal, temporal pole and anterior cingulate, elements of attention-related networks. We also generated from patients an M1/M4 pattern that correlated with a positive change in neuropsychiatric inventory score (r = 0.77, P = 0.002), revealing relative preserved/increased uptake within a bilateral temporal-precuneal-striatal system. Although in a small sample and therefore tentative, we posit that optimal response of donepezil on cognitive and neuropsychiatric signs in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies were associated with a maintenance of muscarinic M1/M4 receptor expression within attentional/executive and ventral visual network hubs, respectively.
