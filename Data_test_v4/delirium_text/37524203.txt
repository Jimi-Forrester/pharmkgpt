37524203|t|Towards experimental models of delirium utilizing zebrafish.
37524203|a|Delirium is an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by impaired behavior and cognition. Although the syndrome has been known for millennia, its CNS mechanisms and risk factors remain poorly understood. Experimental animal models, especially rodent-based, are commonly used to probe various pathogenetic aspects of delirium. Complementing rodents, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) emerges as a promising novel model organism to study delirium. Zebrafish demonstrate high genetic and physiological homology to mammals, easy maintenance, robust behaviors in various sensitive behavioral tests, and the potential to screen for pharmacological agents relevant to delirium. Here, we critically discuss recent developments in the field, and emphasize the developing utility of zebrafish models for translational studies of delirium and deliriant drugs. Overall, the zebrafish represents a valuable and promising aquatic model species whose use may help understand delirium etiology, as well as develop novel therapies for this severely debilitating disorder.
