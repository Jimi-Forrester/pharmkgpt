30322069|t|Biosynthesis of Copper Oxide (CuO) Nanowires and Their Use for the Electrochemical Sensing of Dopamine.
30322069|a|A facile one-step, eco-friendly, and cost-effective approach for the formation of copper oxide (CuO) nanowires by a green method using saponin-rich Sapindus mukorossi fruit extract (SMFE). The physio-chemical characteristics of the synthesized CuO nanowires have been characterized by X-ray Diffractometry (XRD), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, FE-SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM). Further, the electrocatalytic activity of the CuO nanowires synthesized with SMFE has been investigated, and they have been used as dopamine (DA) sensors. Because of their unique properties, the CuO nanowires/GCE exhibited remarkable electrochemical response for the detection of DA with enhanced current response. The anodic current demonstrated that the CuO nanowires/GCE linearly detects the concentration of DA over the range of 0.1 microM to 0.105 mM of DA with a regression co-efficient of 0.9960. The obtained results illustrated that the synthesized CuO nanowires can easily stimulate the electron transfer reaction between DA and the nanowires modified electrode with the improvement of the conductivity and stability of the electrode. This remarkable electrocatalytic property of CuO nanowires makes it a unique electrochemical sensor for the detection of DA. Furthermore, the sensor is free from the interference of ascorbic acid, uric acid, and other interfering species. Moreover, the anti-interference performance also showed that the CuO nanowires/GCE could be employed for the determination of DA in real samples with good selectivity and sensitivity.
