37328855|a|BACKGROUND: Focused ultrasound (FUS)-mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening is under investigation as a therapeutic modality for neurodegeneration, yet its effects in humans are incompletely understood. Here, we assessed physiologic responses to FUS administered in multifocal brain sites of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: At a tertiary neuroscience institute, eight participants with AD (mean age 65, 38% F) enrolled in a phase 2 clinical trial underwent three successive targeted BBB opening procedures at 2 week intervals using a 220 kHz FUS transducer in combination with systemically administered microbubbles. In all, 77 treatment sites were evaluated and encompassed hippocampal, frontal, and parietal brain regions. Post-FUS imaging changes, including susceptibility effects and spatiotemporal gadolinium-based contrast agent enhancement patterns, were analyzed using serial 3.0-Tesla MRI. RESULTS: Post-FUS MRI revealed expected intraparenchymal contrast extravasation due to BBB opening at all targeted brain sites. Immediately upon BBB opening, hyperconcentration of intravenously-administered contrast tracer was consistently observed around intracerebral veins. Following BBB closure, within 24-48 h of FUS intervention, permeabilization of intraparenchymal veins was observed and persisted for up to one week. Notably, extraparenchymal meningeal venous permeabilization and associated CSF effusions were also elicited and persisted up to 11 days post FUS treatment, prior to complete spontaneous resolution in all participants. Mild susceptibility effects were detected, however no overt intracranial hemorrhage or other serious adverse effects occurred in any participant. CONCLUSIONS: FUS-mediated BBB opening is safely and reproducibly achieved in multifocal brain regions of persons with AD. Post-FUS tracer enhancement phenomena suggest the existence of a brain-wide perivenous fluid efflux pathway in humans and demonstrate reactive physiological changes involving these conduit spaces in the delayed, subacute phase following BBB disruption. The delayed reactive venous and perivenous changes are consistent with a dynamic, zonal exudative response to upstream capillary manipulation. Further preclinical and clinical investigations of these FUS-related imaging phenomena and of intracerebral perivenous compartment changes are needed to elucidate physiology of this pathway as well as biological effects of FUS administered with and without adjuvant neurotherapeutics.
