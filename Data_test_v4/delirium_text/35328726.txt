35328726|a|Tricyclodecan-9-yl xanthogenate (D609) is a synthetic tricyclic compound possessing a xanthate group. This xanthogenate compound is known for its diverse pharmacological properties. Over the last three decades, many studies have reported the biological activities of D609, including antioxidant, antiapoptotic, anticholinergic, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-proliferative, and neuroprotective activities. Its mechanism of action is extensively attributed to its ability to cause the competitive inhibition of phosphatidylcholine (PC)-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) and sphingomyelin synthase (SMS). The inhibition of PCPLC or SMS affects secondary messengers with a lipidic nature, i.e., 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramide. Various in vitro/in vivo studies suggest that PCPLC and SMS inhibition regulate the cell cycle, block cellular proliferation, and induce differentiation. D609 acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine antagonist and diminishes Abeta-stimulated toxicity. PCPLC enzymatic activity essentially requires Zn2+, and D609 might act as a potential chelator of Zn2+, thereby blocking PCPLC enzymatic activity. D609 also demonstrates promising results in reducing atherosclerotic plaque formation, post-stroke cerebral infarction, and cancer progression. The present compilation provides a comprehensive mechanistic insight into D609, including its chemistry, mechanism of action, and regulation of various pharmacological activities.
