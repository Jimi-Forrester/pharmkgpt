35175616|t|Graphene: A Promising Theranostic Agent.
35175616|a|Graphene has drawn tremendous interest in the field of nanoscience as a superior theranostic agent owing to its high photostability, aqueous solubility, and low toxicity. This monoatomic thick building block of a carbon allotrope exhibits zero to two-dimensional characteristics with a unique size range within the nanoscale. Their high biocompatibility, quantum yield, and photoluminescent properties make them more demandable in biomedical research. Its application in biomedical sciences has been limited due to its small-scale production. Large-scale production with an easy synthesis process is urgently required to overcome the problem associated with its translational application. Despite all possible drawbacks, the graphene-based drug/gene delivery system is gaining popularity day by day. To date, various studies suggested its application as a theranostic agent for target-specific delivery of chemotherapeutics or antibiotics against various diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's diseases, multidrug resistance diseases, and more. Also, studying the toxicological profile of graphene derivatives is very important before starting its practical use in clinical applications. This chapter has tried to abbreviate several methods and their possible incoming perspective as claimed by researchers for mass production and amplifying graphene-based treatment approaches.
