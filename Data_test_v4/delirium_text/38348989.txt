38348989|t|Neurological complications in patients undergoing general surgery: A literature review.
38348989|a|Surgical procedures are extremely burdensome for patients, as in addition to complications directly related to the intervention, they expose the patient to further complications resulting from the disturbance of key functions of homeostasis in the body's systems, particularly the circulatory, respiratory, and nervous systems. Furthermore, they may contribute to the exacerbation of symptoms of underlying chronic diseases. This paper focuses on the most common possible neurological complications that may occur after surgical procedures and includes topics such as stroke, chronic pain, neuropathy, and delirium. The risk factors for neurological deficits, their known or possible etiology, the most characteristic symptoms, and potential preventive actions are discussed. The paper analyzes articles from the PubMed, ResearchGate, and Scopus databases. A surge0on's knowledge of possible complications that may occur in the perioperative period enables early recognition and effective reduction of their negative impact on the patient's functioning and quality of life after surgery, contributing to better overall treatment outcomes.
