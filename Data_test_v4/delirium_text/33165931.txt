33165931|a|BACKGROUND: Sorting tests detect cognitive decline in older adults who have a neurodegenerative disorder, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Although equally effective at detecting impairment as other cognitive screens (e.g. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)), sorting tests are not commonly used in this context. This study examines the QuickSort, which is a new brief sorting test that is designed to screen older adults for cognitive impairment. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: General community and inpatients, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Older (>=60 years) community-dwelling adults (n = 187) and inpatients referred for neuropsychological assessment (n = 78). A normative subsample (n = 115), screened for cognitive and psychological disorders, was formed from the community sample. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were administered the QuickSort, MMSE, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21. The QuickSort requires people to sort nine stimuli by color, shape, and number, and to explain the basis for their correct sorts. Sorting (range = 0-12), Explanation (range = 0-6), and Total (range = 0-18) scores were calculated for the QuickSort. RESULTS: The Cognitively Healthy subsample completed the QuickSort within 2 minutes, 50% had errorless performance, and 95% had Total scores of 10 or greater. The likelihood of community-dwelling older adults and inpatients (n = 260) being impaired on either the MMSE or FAB, or both, increased by a factor of 3.75 for QuickSort Total scores of less than 10 and reduced by a factor of 0.23 for scores of 10 or greater. CONCLUSION: The QuickSort provides a quick, reliable, and valid alternative to lengthier cognitive screens (e.g., MMSE and FAB) when screening older adults for cognitive impairment. The QuickSort performance of an older adult can be compared with a cognitively healthy normative sample and used to estimate the likelihood they will be impaired on either the MMSE or FAB, or both. Clinicians can also use evidence-based modeling to customize the QuickSort for their setting.
