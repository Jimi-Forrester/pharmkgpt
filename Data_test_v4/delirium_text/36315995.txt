36315995|a|This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and associated factors of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in people living with HIV (PLWH) aged >= 60 years who are currently treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy. A cross-sectional study was conducted on adult (age >= 60 years) PLWH at the infectious clinic, Vajira Hospital, Navamindradhiraj University, Thailand, between August 2019 and March 2021. We collected the patients' characteristics and performed Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living test to determine whether they have HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), which we further classified into asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), and HAD. Finally, we evaluated the prevalence, associated factors, and characteristics of cognitive domain abnormalities in these patients. We enrolled 84 elderly PLWH patients consisting of 43 (51.2%) males. The mean patient age was 63 years (SD +- 3.9), and the median duration of HIV infection was 13 (SD +- 5.7) years. All the patients had undetectable HIV viral load. Among them, seven (8.3%) had no neurocognitive impairment, 61 (72.6%) had ANI, three (3.6%) had MND, and 13 (15.5%) had HAD. After confounder adjustment, the patient age of >= 65 years was found to be significantly associated with dementia (odds ratio = 5.97, 95% CI: 1.51-23.57). Significant difference in the mean score of all cognitive domains was observed between the patients with HAD and those with normal cognitive status. HAND is common in PLWH. Age older than >= 65 years is a risk factor of HAD.
