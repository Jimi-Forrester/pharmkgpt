36084891|t|The effect of minocycline on beta-amyloid-induced memory and learning deficit in male rats: A behavioral, biochemical, and histological study.
36084891|a|OBJECTIVES: Minocycline hydrochloride is a semi-synthetic, second-generation tetracycline with neuroprotective, neurorestorative, anti-amyloidogenic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. The present study was designed to investigate the potential protective effects of minocycline against beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD), recognition memory decline, and the possible involved anti-apoptotic mechanisms. METHODS: The rats were treated with minocycline (50 and 100 mg/kg/day; P.O.) after AD induction for 30 days. Behavioral functions were assessed by employing standard behavioral tests, including novel object recognition (NOR) and passive avoidance learning (PAL) tasks. Then, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidant status (TOS) were measured in blood serum using ELISA kits. Apoptosis and the number of Abeta plaques were examined by the TUNEL and Congo red staining, respectively. RESULTS: Treatment of Abeta rats with minocycline improved memory deficit in the PAL task and a decline in recognition memory in the NOR test. Minocycline at 50 and 100 mg/kg significantly reduced the TOS levels and increased the TAC levels (P < 0.0001). Also, minocycline at 50 and 100 mg/kg reduced the apoptotic index in the hippocampus of Abeta rats. After Congo red staining, the minocycline group showed improved cell morphology and markedly fewer Abeta plaques. CONCLUSIONS: Minocycline reduced memory and learning deficit in behavioral experiments after Abeta injection, which may be due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects.
