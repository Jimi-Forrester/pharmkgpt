34202120|t|Lifestyle Factors and Genetic Variants Associated to Health Disparities in the Hispanic Population.
34202120|a|Non-communicable diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, hepatic steatosis, and cancer are more prevalent in minority groups including Hispanics when compared to Non-Hispanic Whites, leading to the well-recognized terminology of health disparities. Although lifestyle factors including inadequate dietary habits, decreased physical activity, and more prominently, an unhealthy body weight, may be partly responsible for this disproportion in chronic diseases, genetic variations also make a substantial contribution to this problem. In this review, the well-recognized obesity problem in Hispanics that has been associated with chronic disease is examined as well as the influence of diet on promoting an inflammatory environment leading to increased cardiometabolic risk, insulin resistance, fatty liver disease, and cancer. In addition, some of the more studied genetic variations in Hispanics and their association with chronic disease is reviewed.
