37246366|a|Introduction Neurological manifestations are frequent after acquiring COVID-19 and may persist long-term as part of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Cognitive impairment, chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances, and headache complaints are the most reported neurological features. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers were particularly vulnerable due to the high workload and levels of stress associated with this period, but acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may also contribute. The authors aimed to evaluate the neurological involvement of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in a population of hospital health care workers and its impact on their personal and professional lives. Methods A sample of health care workers who did and did not acquire SARS-CoV-2 matched by age and sociodemographic variables was studied. Through an online questionnaire, data were collected regarding the symptoms in the acute phase of the disease (for those who acquired it) and for all in the last 6 months of the study period. Proportion of neurological complaints were compared between groups, adjusting for age, sex, and professional class (using a rate ratio (RR)). Results This study included 326 participants (174 cases and 152 controls). The mean age (standard deviation) was 39.7 (10.2) years, and the female:male ratio was 3:1. Headache and cognitive complaints were the most prevalent neurological complaints in the last 6 months of the study period. The health care workers who acquired SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to report headache and cognitive complaints than the control group (RR = 1.51, 95% confidence interval = 1.17-1.9 and RR = 2.02, 95% confidence interval = 1.53-2.65, respectively). Conclusion In a population of health care workers, those who acquired SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to have long-term cognitive complaints and persistent headaches.
