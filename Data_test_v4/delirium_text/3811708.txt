3811708|t|[Prognosis of the onset of latent pseudopsychopathic and pseudoneurotic schizophrenia in male adolescents (data of a long-term follow-up)].
3811708|a|The authors followed up (for 5-15 years) 256 male patients in whom disease first manifested in adolescence. They identified prognostic signs in the period of manifestations. Stable (over 4 years) remission correlated with an onset characterized by a depressive background, a syndrome of metaphysical intoxication and a correlation between the type of accentuation of the character as determined with help of the Pathocharacterological Diagnostic Questionnaire for adolescents and the clinically-determined premorbid type. Unfavourable prognostic signs included an early onset (at the age of 10-13 years), hereditary aggravation by endogenic psychoses through only the maternal line, untidiness, shamelessness, purposeful malice and sadism directed against the mother, and also characteristic delirious behaviour without formed delirium.
