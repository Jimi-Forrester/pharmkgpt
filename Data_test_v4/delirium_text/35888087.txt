35888087|t|Metformin-Treatment Option for Social Impairment? An Open Clinical Trial to Elucidate the Effects of Metformin Treatment on Steroid Hormones and Social Behavior.
35888087|a|BACKGROUND: Social behavior is mediated by steroid hormones, whereby various lines of evidence indicate that metformin might improve the symptoms of social withdrawal. This directly yields to the aim of the study to correlate the impact of metformin treatment on the potential alterations in steroid hormone homeostasis, which is ultimately impacting social behavior. Therefore, urinary samples of patients before and after treatment with metformin will be correlated to social behavior to elucidate potential changes in steroid hormone profiles and social behavior. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An observational study in healthy adults with a new indication for metformin. Steroid hormone analysis, including the most prominent androgen, estrogen, progesterone, aldosterone, corticosterone, cortisone and cortisol metabolites analyzed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and a questionnaire on social behavior (Autism Spectrum Questionnaire (AQ)) will be administered prior to and after around a 12-week phase of metformin treatment. DISCUSSION: It is likely that due to different pathophysiological mechanisms such as an effect on the respiratory chain in mitochondria or via AMP-activated protein kinase, a general alteration of steroid hormone levels can be detected prior to post treatment. The encompassing measurement of steroid hormones shall give hints concerning the involvement of specific cascades yielding potential pharmacological targets for future research.
