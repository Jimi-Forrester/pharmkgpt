29704689|t|Postictal Delirium and Violent Behavior in Patients with Post-Neurosurgical Epilepsy.
29704689|a|BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical brain interventions may result in lesions that can cause epilepsy. Diagnosis may be delayed in some situations. Meanwhile, violent behavior can occur during postictal delirium states. Although benign behavioral manifestations are well documented in literature, violent offenses in post-neurosurgical epilepsy have been rarely reported. Here we describe 2 such cases, focusing on management and emphasizing the need for prevention. CASE DESCRIPTION: Both patients were suffering from post-neurosurgical epilepsy and offended during postictal delirium states. The first patient had generalized epilepsy and committed an attempted rape. The second patient had temporal lobe epilepsy and committed an attempted homicide. Both patients were well managed using anticonvulsant medication after the offenses. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and regular follow-up are measures to take into consideration to prevent violent behavior in patients with post-neurosurgical epilepsy.
