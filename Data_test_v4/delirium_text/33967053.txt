OBJECTIVE: To reveal the longitudinal CBF changes in normal control (NC) and the AD continuum using arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (ASL MRI). METHODS: CBF was calculated from two longitudinal ASL scans acquired 2.22+-1.43 years apart from 140 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). At the baseline scan, the cohort contained 41 NC, 74 mild cognitive impairment patients (MCI), and 25 AD patients. 21 NC converted into MCI and 17 MCI converted into AD at the follow-up. Longitudinal CBF changes were assessed using paired-t test for non-converters and converters separately at each voxel and in the meta-ROI. Age and sex were used as covariates. RESULTS: CBF reductions were observed in all subjects. Stable NC (n = 20) showed CBF reduction in the hippocampus and precuneus. Stable MCI patients (n = 57) showed spatially more extended CBF reduction patterns in hippocampus, middle temporal lobe, ventral striatum, prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum. NC-MCI converters showed CBF reduction in hippocampus and cerebellum and CBF increase in caudate. MCI-AD converters showed CBF reduction in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. CBF changes were not related with longitudinal neurocognitive changes. CONCLUSION: Normal aging and AD continuum showed common longitudinal CBF reductions in hippocampus independent of disease and its conversion. Disease conversion independent longitudinal CBF reductions escalated in MCI subjects.
