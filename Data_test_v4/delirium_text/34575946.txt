34575946|t|Drugs Interfering with Insulin Resistance and Their Influence on the Associated Hypermetabolic State in Severe Burns: A Narrative Review.
34575946|a|It has become widely accepted that insulin resistance and glucose hypermetabolism can be linked to acute pathologies, such as burn injury, severe trauma, or sepsis. Severe burns can determine a significant increase in catabolism, having an important effect on glucose metabolism and on muscle protein metabolism. It is imperative to acknowledge that these alterations can lead to increased mortality through organ failure, even when the patients survive the initial trauma caused by the burn. By limiting the peripheral use of glucose with consequent hyperglycemia, insulin resistance determines compensatory increased levels of insulin in plasma. However, the significant alterations in cellular metabolism lead to a lack of response to insulin's anabolic functions, as well as to a decrease in its cytoprotective role. In the end, via pathological insulin signaling associated with increased liver gluconeogenesis, elevated levels of glucose are detected in the blood. Several cellular mechanisms have been incriminated in the development of insulin resistance in burns. In this context, the main aim of this review article is to summarize some of the drugs that might interfere with insulin resistance in burns, taking into consideration that such an approach can significantly improve the prognosis of the burned patient.
