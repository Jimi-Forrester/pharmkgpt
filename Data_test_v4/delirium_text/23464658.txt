23464658|a|BACKGROUND: Emergence delirium (ED) refers to a variety of behavioral disturbances commonly seen in children following emergence from anesthesia. Vapor-based anesthesia with sevoflurane, the most common pediatric anesthetic technique, is associated with the highest incidence of ED. Propofol has been shown to reduce ED, but these studies have been methodologically limited. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a randomized-controlled trial comparing the incidence of ED in children following sevoflurane (SEVO) anesthesia and propofol-remifentanil total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). METHODS: One hundred and twelve children, ASA I-II, aged >= 2 and <= 6 years, undergoing strabismus repair, were assigned to receive TIVA (intravenous induction and maintenance of anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil) or SEVO (inhalational induction and maintenance of anesthesia with sevoflurane). Parent-child induction behavior was scored using the Perioperative Adult Child Behavior Interaction Scale (PACBIS). Postoperatively, ED was assessed by a masked investigator using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) Scale and pain using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) Scale every 5 min. RESULTS: Data are reported for 94 subjects. Incidence of ED was higher with SEVO (38.3% vs 14.9%, P = 0.018). There was no difference in the median PACBIS score. A higher FLACC score was seen with SEVO (median 3 vs 1, P = 0.033). Subjects experiencing ED had higher FLACC scores vs those unaffected by ED (median 7 vs 1, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: There was a lower incidence of ED after TIVA. Both intravenous and inhalational inductions were similarly well-tolerated. The use of TIVA was associated with reduced postoperative pain as measured using FLACC scores.
