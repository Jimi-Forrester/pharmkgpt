34865063|a|gamma-Secretase cleaves type I transmembrane proteins in a hydrophobic membrane environment following ectodomain shedding. Mutations in PSEN genes, encoding the catalytic subunits of gamma-secretase, presenilins, are the most common cause of familial Alzheimer's disease (ad). Pathogenic mutations in PSEN genes increase production of longer and neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) by intramembrane cleavage of membrane-associated amyloid-beta protein precursor (APP) carboxyl-terminal fragment beta, which is generated via primary cleavage of APP by beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1. The longer Abeta is prone to aggregate and accumulate in the brain; however, the accumulation of Abeta in brain is also a pathological feature of sporadic ad. Increased pathogenic Abeta generation, even in the absence of pathogenic PSEN gene mutations, is one of proposed mechanisms for sporadic ad pathogenesis. gamma-Secretase digests substrates in the transmembrane region, generating Abeta peptide intermediates of various lengths. The end products, shorter Abeta40 and Abeta38 peptides, are less neurotoxic, whereas PSEN gene mutations increase the production ratio of longer, neurotoxic Abeta species such as Abeta42, an intermediate in Abeta38 production. gamma-Secretase activity or structures is altered because of its aberrant membrane localization or changes in the ambient environment such as luminal acidification. Interestingly, gamma-secretase has a pH sensor in presenilins.
