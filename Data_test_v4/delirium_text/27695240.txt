27695240|t|Morvan's syndrome with anti contactin associated protein like 2 - voltage gated potassium channel antibody presenting with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.
27695240|a|Morvan's syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by triad of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability, autonomic dysfunction, and central nervous system symptoms. Antibodies against contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2), a subtype of voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) complex, are found in a significant proportion of patients with Morvan's syndrome and are thought to play a key role in peripheral as well as central clinical manifestations. We report a patient of Morvan's syndrome with positive CASPR2-anti-VGKC antibody having syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone as a cause of persistent hyponatremia.
