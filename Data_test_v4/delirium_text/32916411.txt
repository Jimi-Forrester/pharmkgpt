32916411|a|PURPOSE: Post-mortem and in-vivo MRI data suggest an accumulation of iron in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The majority of studies in clinically diagnosed AD patients found an increase of iron-sensitive MRI signals in the putamen. As the clinical diagnosis shows only a moderate sensitivity, Abeta-PET was used to further stratify patients with the clinical diagnosis of AD. Aim of this exploratory study was to examine whether Abeta-positive (AD) and Abeta-negative (non-AD) patients differ in their regional magnetic susceptibility compared to healthy controls (HCs) and whether regional susceptibility values correlate with mini mental state examination (MMSE) scores or global Abeta-load. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed [11C]PiB PET/MRI data of 11 HCs, 16 AD and 10 non-AD patients. We used quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) as iron-sensitive MRI signal measured at the 3 T PET/MR scanner. Global cerebral Abeta-load was determined by composite [11C]PiB SUV ratios. RESULTS: Compared to HCs, AD patients showed higher QSM values in putamen (0.049 +- 0.033 vs. 0.002 +- 0.031; p = 0.006), while non-AD patients showed lower QSM values in caudate nucleus (0.003 +- 0.027 vs. 0.051 +- 0.039; p = 0.006). There was a trend towards a significant correlation between putaminal QSM and MMSE values (rho=-0.340, p = 0.053). In AD patients, global Abeta-load and putaminal QSM values were significantly correlated (rho=-0.574, p = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that AD and non-AD patients may show different cerebral iron pathologies which might be detectable by QSM MRI, and might be linked to neurodegeneration. Overall, the data encourage further investigations in well-defined patient cohorts to clarify the value of QSM/magnetic susceptibility in the course of neurodegenerative diseases and its potential as diagnostic biomarker.
