38523307|a|Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are a class of drugs that enhance the incretin-insulin pathway and offer effective glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, these drugs may be associated with various dermatological side effects, ranging from mild to severe. This review article summarizes the current literature on the dermatological side effects of DPP-4 inhibitors, including bullous pemphigoid, severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions, fixed drug eruptions, and other mucocutaneous reactions. The review also discusses the possible mechanisms, risk factors, diagnosis, and management of these side effects. This review aims to increase the awareness and vigilance of healthcare providers in recognizing and managing the dermatological side effects of DPP-4 inhibitors and to emphasize the need for further research and surveillance to optimize diabetes care and patient safety.
