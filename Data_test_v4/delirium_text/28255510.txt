28255510|t|Risk Factors for Urinary Retention Following Surgical Repair of Hip Fracture in Female Patients.
28255510|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is a common event following surgical procedures. An increase in the number of elderly individuals who undergo hip fracture repair procedures is inevitable due to the aging of population. Postoperative urinary retention is associated with both early (infections, delirium) and late complications (urinary incontinence) of surgery. The objective of the current study is to direct attention to the less studied population of patients admitted to a geriatric rehabilitation ward following hip fracture repair who are at risk of POUR. DESIGN: Prospective single-center cohort study. SETTING: Academic tertiary hospital. MEASUREMENT: Postvoid bladder volume by ultrasonography (US). RESULTS: Postvoid bladder volume was measured by US in 88 consecutive female patients on the morning following their admission to the geriatric rehabilitation department. The mean age of the patients was 82.5 +- 6.5 years, and the frequency of POUR (defined as postvoid bladder volume >=200 mL) was 37.5%. The POUR (n = 33) and non-POUR (n = 55) groups were similar with respect to most demographic and disease states. Multivariable stepwise logistic regression revealed a significant effect for opioid use (relative risk [RR] = 8.0, P < .001) and for treatment with anticholinergic medication (RR = 1.3, P = .046). There was an unexpectedly high proportion of patients with asymptomatic urinary retention (29 of the 33 patients, 88%). CONCLUSION: The high incidence of asymptomatic POUR in elderly patients calls for the need for improved screening tools for early identification and treatment.
