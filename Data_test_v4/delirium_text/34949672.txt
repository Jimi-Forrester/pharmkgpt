34949672|t|Prostaglandin Pathways: Opportunities for Cancer Prevention and Therapy.
34949672|a|Because of profound effects observed in carcinogenesis, prostaglandins (PG), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthases, and PG receptors are implicated in cancer development and progression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of PG actions has potential clinical relevance for cancer prevention and therapy. This review focuses on the current status of PG signaling pathways in modulating cancer progression and aims to provide insights into the mechanistic actions of PGs and their receptors in influencing tumor progression. We also examine several small molecules identified as having anticancer activity that target prostaglandin receptors. The literature suggests that targeting PG pathways could provide opportunities for cancer prevention and therapy.
