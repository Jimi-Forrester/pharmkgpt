35661279|a|Post-stroke dysphagia (PSD) is a common and costly complication of stroke and is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and hospitalization. Although most patients can spontaneously resume swallowing, there are still many patients who do not recover and even die. Despite multiple advances in the acute treatment and secondary prevention of stroke, the effective treatment of PSD remains a neglected area. Studies have shown that repair mechanisms of neurostimulation techniques and increased cortical activity play an important role in the treatment of PSD. In addition, nutritional interventions are also crucial for the treatment of malnutrition in PSD patients. Therefore, this article reviews the effects of the current main clinical treatment methods and nutritional interventions on the treatment and rehabilitation of PSD patients. It also emphasized the necessity of developing an individualized care plan for PSD patients, which is of great significance to promote the clinical treatment, nutritional status, prognosis, and quality of life of PSD patients.
