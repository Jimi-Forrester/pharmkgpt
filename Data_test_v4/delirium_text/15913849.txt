15913849|a|PURPOSE: Neuropsychology provides essential information to all participants (physicians, psychologists, occupational therapists) involved in the treatment of the elderly. When treating depressed elderly patients, a comprehensive neuropsychological examination is required for diagnosis, prognosis and to control the effectiveness of antidepressant treatment. KEY MESSAGE AND RECENT FACTS: Depression in elderly people is frequent and difficult to diagnose. Some forms of depression usher in or are associated with a neurodegenerative disease. In the case of diagnosis, the neuropsychological examination should furnish useful information to guide the clinician. The qualitative analysis of results (strategies used and type of errors) and the weakening of cognitive processes efficiency provides supplementary information and increases the reliability of the diagnosis. It also gives information about the long term evolution of cognitive deficits. It should reveal the presence of characteristics which help to distinguish patients who are developing dementia (predictive power of certain tests). Finally, it enables the clinician to evaluate the outcome of antidepressant treatment, to adjust the prescription according to the performance and to adapt an holistic treatment. PERSPECTIVE AND PROJECTS: A neuropsychological examination may provide new perspectives, such as the possibility of predicting the outcome of dementia which are accompanied by affective disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia. Neuropsychology may thus improve the treatment of these patients by providing information to a better understanding of their deficits and their impact on daily living abilities.
