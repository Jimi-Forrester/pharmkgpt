15331147|a|A sample of 243 Italian patients affected by the sporadic late-onset form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was studied for the HindIII intronic polymorphism of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene and compared with a sample of 148 healthy subjects. Since this polymorphism has been reported to be associated with CAD and because the two pathologies share common aspects, we decided to study it in AD too. We found a difference in the allele distribution, in that the H+ allele was more frequent in patients (0.782) than in controls (0.720); this difference was not quite significant (P = 0.059). The odds ratio from the logistic regression analysis for the H+ carrying genotypes was 2.7 (95% CI = 1.01-7.21; P = 0.048). When the separate genotypes H+H+ and H+H- were entered into the analysis, only H+H+ was found to significantly increase the risk with respect to H-H- (P = 0.029). This means that carrying this allele significantly increases the risk of developing AD, and the risk is mostly associated with the H+H+ genotype.
