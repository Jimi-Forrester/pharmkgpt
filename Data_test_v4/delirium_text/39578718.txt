39578718|t|Experience of carers for older people with delirium: a qualitative study.
39578718|a|OBJECTIVES: There is a gap in our understanding of the experiences and needs of carers for patients with delirium and a scarcity of research on the topic in the UK. This study aims to explore the needs and experiences of carers for person with delirium and offer suggestions to support them. METHOD: A qualitative interview study with carers of patients with delirium. Data were analysed using an abductive analysis approach. RESULTS: Fourteen carers were interviewed. We identified four themes; carers' involvement in providing care for the person with delirium, carers' perspectives of caregiving, support for carers and impact for caregiving on carers. Carers felt a responsibility to support the patient and to obtain information on delirium and its management on their own. Caregiving for a person with delirium had an emotional impact on the carer and they needed to change their lifestyle to maintain their caregiving responsibilities, as a result of the limited support they had. CONCLUSION: More support for the carer in care plans with focus on emotional support, support groups for carers of people with delirium and assigning a case worker should be taken into consideration when developing interventions for people with delirium at home. These solutions may mitigate the impact of caregiving role on the mental and physical wellbeing of the carer for older person with delirium.
