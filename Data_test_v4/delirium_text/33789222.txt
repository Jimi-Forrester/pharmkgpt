33789222|a|Cell-based immunotherapies have been selected for the front-line cancer treatment approaches. Among them, CAR-T cells have shown extraordinary effects in hematologic diseases including chemotherapy-resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In this approach, autologous T cells isolated from the patient's body genetically engineered to express a tumor specific synthetic receptor against a tumor antigen, then these cells expanded ex vivo and re-infusion back to the patient body. Recently, significant clinical response and high rates of complete remission of CAR T cell therapy in B-cell malignancies led to the approval of Kymriah and Yescarta (CD19-directed CAR-T cells) were by FDA for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Despite promising therapeutic outcomes, CAR T cells also can elicit the immune-pathologic effects, such as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), and on-target off-tumor toxicity, that hampered its application. Ineffective control of these highly potent synthetic cells causes discussed potentially life-threatening toxicities, so researchers have developed several mechanisms to remote control CAR T cells. In this paper, we briefly review the introduced toxicities of CAR-T cells, then describe currently existing control approaches and review their procedure, pros, and cons.
