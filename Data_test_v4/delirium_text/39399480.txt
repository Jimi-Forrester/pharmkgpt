39399480|t|G protein coupled receptor in apoptosis and apoptotic cell clearance.
39399480|a|Apoptosis is a genetically programmed form of cell death that is substantially conserved across the evolutionary tree. Apoptotic cell elimination includes recognition, phagocytosis, and degradation. Failure to clear apoptotic cells can ultimately cause a series of human diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Consequently, the timely and effective removal of apoptotic cells is crucial to maintaining the body's homeostasis. GPCRs belong to the largest membrane receptor family. Its intracellular domain exerts an effect on the trimer G protein. By combining with a variety of ligands, the extracellular domain of G protein initiates the dissociation of G protein trimers and progressively transmits signals downstream. Presently, numerous G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been identified as participants in the apoptosis signal transduction pathway and the apoptotic cell clearance pathway. Therefore, studies on the mechanism of GPCRs in the clearance of apoptotic cells is important for the development of GPCRs therapeutics.
