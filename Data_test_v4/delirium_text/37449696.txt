37449696|a|It is crucial to prevent and manage intensive care unit (ICU) distress caused by a pentad of pain, agitation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disturbance (PADIS) to optimize immediate and longterm recovery and outcomes of critically ill patients. This clinical practice guideline provides an update on the prevention, management, and liberation of PADIS in adult ICU patients using an integrated, evidence-based, multidisciplinary ICU protocol: the ABCDEF bundle. ABCDEF bundle incorporates assessment, prevention, and management of pain; both spontaneous awakening trial (SAT) and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT); choice of sedation and analgesia; delirium: assessment, prevention and management, and early mobility and exercise; family involvement and empowerment (ABCDEF) together as a PADIS care bundle. This is a multidimensional ICU liberation bundle which is a patient-oriented, holistic team approach to the management of critically ill patients aimed at reducing ICU distress and immediate and long-lasting consequences of PADIS.
