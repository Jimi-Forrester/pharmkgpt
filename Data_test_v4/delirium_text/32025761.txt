32025761|t|Mechanistic Insights into Protein Stability and Self-aggregation in GLUT1 Genetic Variants Causing GLUT1-Deficiency Syndrome.
32025761|a|Human sodium-independent glucose cotransporter 1 (hGLUT1) has been studied for its tetramerization and multimerization at the cell surface. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in hGLUT1 elicit GLUT1-deficiency syndrome (GLUT1-DS), a metabolic disorder, which results in impaired glucose transport into the brain. The reduced cell surface expression or loss of function have been shown for some GLUT1 mutants. However, the mechanism by which deleterious mutations affect protein structure, conformational stability and GLUT1 oligomerization is not known and require investigation. In this review, we combined previous knowledge of GLUT1 mutations with hGLUT1 crystal structure to analyze native interactions and several natural single-point mutations. The modeling of native hGLUT1 structure confirmed the roles of native residues in forming a range of side-chain interactions. Interestingly, the modeled mutants pointed to the formation of a variety of non-native novel interactions, altering interaction networks and potentially eliciting protein misfolding. Self-aggregation of the last part of hGLUT1 was predicted using protein aggregation prediction tool. Furthermore, an increase in aggregation potential in the aggregation-prone regions was estimated for several mutants suggesting increased aggregation of misfolded protein. Protein stability change analysis predicted that GLUT1 mutant proteins are unstable. Combining GLUT1 oligomerization behavior with our modeling, aggregation prediction, and protein stability analyses, this work provides state-of-the-art view of GLUT1 genetic mutations that could destabilize native interactions, generate novel interactions, trigger protein misfolding, and enhance protein aggregation in a disease state.
