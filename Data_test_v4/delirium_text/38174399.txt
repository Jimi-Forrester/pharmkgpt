38174399|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is associated with neurophysiological changes that can be identified with quantitative EEG analysis techniques (qEEG). AIM: To provide an overview of studies on neurophysiological changes in delirium using various qEEG analysis techniques. METHOD: Literature review. RESULTS: In delirium, there is an increase in delta and theta activity but a decrease in activity in the alpha frequency band. Additionally, there is a decrease in functional connectivity and efficiency of the brain network in the alpha frequency band. CONCLUSION: Delirium is characterized by diffuse slowing of the EEG, reduced functional connectivity, and decreased efficiency of the brain network. Improved functional connectivity could be a new approach to treat delirium.
