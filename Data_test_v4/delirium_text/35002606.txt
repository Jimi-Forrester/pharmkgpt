35002606|t|Proteinopathies as Hallmarks of Impaired Gene Expression, Proteostasis and Mitochondrial Function in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
35002606|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. As with the majority of neurodegenerative diseases, the pathological hallmarks of ALS involve proteinopathies which lead to the formation of various polyubiquitylated protein aggregates in neurons and glia. ALS is a highly heterogeneous disease, with both familial and sporadic forms arising from the convergence of multiple disease mechanisms, many of which remain elusive. There has been considerable research effort invested into exploring these disease mechanisms and in recent years dysregulation of RNA metabolism and mitochondrial function have emerged as of crucial importance to the onset and development of ALS proteinopathies. Widespread alterations of the RNA metabolism and post-translational processing of proteins lead to the disruption of multiple biological pathways. Abnormal mitochondrial structure, impaired ATP production, dysregulation of energy metabolism and calcium homeostasis as well as apoptosis have been implicated in the neurodegenerative process. Dysfunctional mitochondria further accumulate in ALS motor neurons and reflect a wider failure of cellular quality control systems, including mitophagy and other autophagic processes. Here, we review the evidence for RNA and mitochondrial dysfunction as some of the earliest critical pathophysiological events leading to the development of ALS proteinopathies, explore their relative pathological contributions and their points of convergence with other key disease mechanisms. This review will focus primarily on mutations in genes causing four major types of ALS (C9ORF72, SOD1, TARDBP/TDP-43, and FUS) and in protein homeostasis genes (SQSTM1, OPTN, VCP, and UBQLN2) as well as sporadic forms of the disease. Finally, we will look to the future of ALS research and how an improved understanding of central mechanisms underpinning proteinopathies might inform research directions and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.
