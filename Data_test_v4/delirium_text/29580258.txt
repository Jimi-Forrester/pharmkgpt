29580258|a|Evidence has recently been reported of prion seeding activity in skin tissue from patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). This is relevant information for infection control measures during surgery. The work uses very sensitive prion assays now available for medical research, and may soon be adapted to related neurodegenerative disorders.
