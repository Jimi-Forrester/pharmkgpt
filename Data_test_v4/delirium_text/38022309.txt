38022309|t|The Five-Factor Modified Frailty Index as a Predictor of Outcomes in Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery for Parkinson's Disease.
38022309|a|Introduction Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. Though there are many pharmacological therapeutics approved today for PD, surgical interventions such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) have shown convincing symptom mitigation and minimal complication rates in aggregate. Recently, the concept of frailty - defined as reduced physiologic reserve and function affecting multiple systems throughout the patient - has gained traction as a predictor of short-term postoperative morbidity and mortality. As such, the Modified Frailty Index-5 (mFI-5) is a postoperative morbidity predictor based on five factors and has been used in neurosurgical subspecialties such as tumor, vascular, and spine. Yet, there is minimal literature assessing frailty in the field of functional neurosurgery. With the prevalence of DBS in PD, this study evaluated the mFI-5 as a predictor of postoperative complications in a selected patient population. Methods The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 2010-2019 Database was queried for Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, as well as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 codes pertaining to DBS procedures in PD patients. Each patient was scored by the mFI-5 protocol and stratified into groups of No Frailty (mFI-5=0), Moderate Frailty (mFI-5=1), and Significant Frailty (mFI-5>=2). The No Frailty group was used as a reference in multivariate and univariate analyses of the groups. Results A total of 1,645 subjects were included in the study and were subcategorized into groups of No Frailty (N=877), Moderate Frailty (N=561), and Significant Frailty (N=207) based on their frailty scores. The subjects' mean age was 65.8+-9.4 years. Overall, 1,161 (70.6%) were male, while 484 (29.4%) were female. With reference to the No Frailty group in multivariate analysis, patients with moderate frailty experienced greater unplanned readmission (OR 2.613, 95% CI 1.143-5.973, p=0.023), while those with significant frailty experienced greater unplanned readmission (OR 3.723, 95% CI 1.376-10.073, p=0.010), any readmission (OR 2.396, 95% CI 1.098-5.230, p=0.028), non-home discharge (OR 4.317, 95% CI 1.765-10.562, p<0.001), and complications in aggregate (OR 2.211, 95% CI 1.285-3.806, p=0.004). Conclusions Until now, the available clinical tools were limited in providing accurate predictions with minimal information for postoperative outcomes in DBS for PD patients. Our data give clinicians insight into the relationship between frailty and surgical outcomes and will assist physicians in preparing for postoperative care by predicting outcomes of significantly frail PD patients receiving DBS therapy.
