38488691|t|Aging and brain free cholesterol concentration on amyloid-beta peptide accumulation in guinea pigs.
38488691|a|Alzheimer's disease is a complex multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder wherein age is a major risk factor. The appropriateness of the Hartley guinea pig (GP), which displays high sequence homologies of its amyloid-beta (Abeta40 and Abeta42 ) peptides, Mdr1 and APP (amyloid precursor protein) and similarity in lipid handling to humans, was appraised among 9-40 weeks old guinea pigs. Protein expression levels of P-gp (Abcb1) and Cyp46a1 (24(S)-hydroxylase) for Abeta40 , and Abeta42 efflux and cholesterol metabolism, respectively, were decreased with age, whereas those for Lrp1 (low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1), Rage (receptor for advanced glycation endproducts) for Abeta efflux and influx, respectively, and Abca1 (the ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1) for cholesterol efflux, were unchanged among the ages examined. There was a strong, negative correlation of the brain Abeta peptide concentrations and Abca1 protein expression levels with free cholesterol. The correlation of Abeta peptide concentrations with Cyp46a1 was, however, not significant, and concentrations of the 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol metabolite revealed a decreasing trend from 20 weeks old toward 40 weeks old guinea pigs. The composite data suggest a role for free cholesterol on brain Abeta accumulation. The decreases in P-gp and Lrp1 protein levels should further exacerbate the accumulation of Abeta peptides in guinea pig brain.
