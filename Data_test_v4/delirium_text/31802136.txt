31802136|t|Predictors of 30-day mortality in orthogeriatric fracture patients aged 85 years or above admitted from the emergency department.
31802136|a|PURPOSE: Orthogeriatric trauma patients are at risk for functional decline and mortality. It is important to identify high-risk patients in an early stage, to improve outcomes and make better informed treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to identify independent risk factors for 30-day mortality in patients aged 85 years or above admitted from the emergency department with a fracture. METHODS: All orthopaedic trauma patients 85 years or above admitted from the emergency department were included. After a 30-day follow-up, mortality was determined by consulting the patient records. Multivariable logistics regression analysis generated odd ratios for mortality risk factors. A subgroup analysis was performed for patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality in geriatric fracture patients admitted to the hospital was 12%. Risk factors for 30-day mortality were: increased age, male sex, decreased hemoglobin levels, living in an institutional care facility and a decreased BMI. For geriatric patients undergoing hip fracture surgery 30-day mortality was 11%. Independent risk factors for this group were: increased age, male sex, and a decreased BMI. CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic trauma patients aged 85 years or above who are admitted to the hospital with a fracture are at high risk for mortality. This study identified older age, male sex, and decreased BMI as predictors of 30-day mortality in admitted geriatric fracture patients and in geriatric hip fracture patients undergoing surgery.
