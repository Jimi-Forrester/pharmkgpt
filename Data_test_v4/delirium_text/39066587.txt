39066587|a|BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized cancer treatment but can trigger immune-related encephalitis. We report one of the largest case series of patients with immune-related encephalitis and review of the literature. METHODS: Retrospective series of patients with immune-related encephalitis and literature review. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with cancer treated with ICI (50% combination therapy) developed immune-related encephalitis. Diagnostic testing revealed cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytic pleocytosis (85%) and elevated protein (69%), abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) (33%) or brain FDG-PET (25%), electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities (30%), and autoantibodies (31%). Encephalitis treatment included: corticosteroids (86%), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (36%), plasmapheresis (7%), and rituximab (29%). There were no deaths and 12 patients had significant recovery, although long-term complications were observed. All patients discontinued ICI. Longitudinal follow-up demonstrated anti-cancer response to ICI at 3 months (85%) and 6 months post-ICI initiation (77%). A literature review identified 132 patients with immune-related encephalitis. Most were treated with PD-1 inhibitors (18% combination). Common abnormalities included elevated CSF protein (84%) or pleocytosis (77%), abnormal brain MRI (65%), or autoantibodies (47%). Nearly all were treated with corticosteroids, many required additional therapy with IVIg (26%) or rituximab (12%). Most patients had clinical improvement (81%) but a minority (10%) had a clinical relapse after completing corticosteroid taper. ICIs were resumed in 7 patients (5%), with relapse in 3. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Immune-related encephalitis is treatable and improves with corticosteroids in most cases but may require additional immunosuppression. Re-emergence of encephalitis is rare and does not typically result in adverse outcomes, and this should be considered in neurological immune-related adverse event management guidelines.
