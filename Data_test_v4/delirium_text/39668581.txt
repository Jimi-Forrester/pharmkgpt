39668581|t|Detection of Amyloid-beta Peptides in Gingival Crevicular Fluid and Its Effect on Oral Pathogens.
39668581|a|Periodontitis is the most common oral inflammatory disease, contributing to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, a full investigation has not been performed on the expression level of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and its effects on oral pathogens. This study aimed to analyze the expression level of Abeta peptides in GCF of patients with periodontitis and the effects of Abeta peptides against common oral pathogens. GCF samples were collected from patients with periodontitis (n = 15) and periodontally healthy people (n = 10). The antimicrobial effects of Abeta peptides were evaluated on four common oral pathogenic strains using an MTT assay, crystal violet staining, fluorescence microscope, and transmission electron microscope. The protein levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 were upregulated in the GCF of periodontitis group compared with the healthy group. Both Abeta40 and Abeta42 exhibited antimicrobial effects on Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Lactobacillus acidophilus in both planktonic and biofilm conditions. Further, only Abeta40 showed an antimicrobial effect on the Fusobacterium nucleatum. The results of this study demonstrate that Abeta peptides in GCF may be a relevant indicator of periodontitis status. Besides, the antimicrobial peptides derived from Abeta peptides have great potential in periodontal therapy.
