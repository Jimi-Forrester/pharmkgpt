1978375|t|Preclinical and clinical studies with somatostatin related to the central nervous system.
1978375|a|1. The tetradecapeptide somatostatin (SS) has a widespread, uneven distribution within several organs including the central nervous system (CNS), with particularly high concentration in the hypothalamus. 2. The SS-related peptides (SS28, SS28(1-12), SS28(15-28)) are originated from the precursor pre-prosomatostatin. 3. SS is suggested to be involved in a large number of CNS functions, locomotion, sedation, excitation, catatonia, body temperature, feeding, nociception, paradoxical sleep, self-stimulation, seizure, learning and memory. 4. SS influences central neurochemical processes. 5. It is possible that SS is related to various neurological and psychiatric illnesses, like Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, eating disorders, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and major depressive illness.
