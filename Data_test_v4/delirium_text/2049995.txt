2049995|a|In the past decades, the recognition of polymorbidity as an important characteristic of geriatric medicine lead to important improvements in the multidisciplinary approach of the elderly. Coexistence of somatic and psychiatric diseases with various forms of etiopathogenic relations has been described early in this century. Dementia may be caused, aggravated, revealed or randomly accompanied by somatic diseases and inversely. However, very few attempts have been made in order to analyze the significance of these associations. This study is meant to give a better epidemiological knowledge of the relation between cardiovascular diseases and cerebral aging. This could lead to a better diagnostic approach and to a more complete physiopathological conception of dementia. 904 autopsy reports (patients who died between 1972 and 1986 in the Hopital de Geriatrie of Genova) have been reviewed and classified in three groups according to neuropathological findings: 335 subjects with vascular encephalopathy of various types, 382 patients with degenerative diseases of Alzheimer type and 187 patients with normal brain. The subjects of these three groups had not all been considered demented. For each patient, age, sex, cause of death and 14 cardiovascular items have been appointed. The patients of the Alzheimer group died older and were more often women than those of the two other groups. The subjects of the vascular group died older than those of the normal group and were more often men than those of the two other groups. Stoke was considered to be the cause of death in 3% of the vascular patients whereas, by definition, it was absent from the two other groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
