38219079|a|PURPOSE: This study reviewed existing literature on parental presence in cases of pediatric patients after general anesthesia and explored its effect on emergence delirium (ED) in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: After protocol registration, we searched the PubMed, EMBASE, CINHAL, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and CENTRAL databases. Two authors independently searched and selected the relevant studies, assessed their risk of bias, and abstracted the data. The primary outcome was ED, and the additional outcome was pain. We provided the narrative synthesis and meta-analysis results. FINDINGS: Of the 296 articles retrieved, 6 were included in the narrative synthesis, and 5 were used for the meta-analysis. Four studies were randomized controlled trials, and two studies were nonrandomized controlled trials. There were 348 pediatric patients in the parental presence group and 314 pediatric patients in the usual care group. Parental presence effectively reduced the ED score (mean difference, -0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.84 to -0.31; P < .001). The ED incidence rate (log odds ratio, -0.58; 95% CI, -1.24 to 0.09; P = .090) and pain score (standardized mean difference, -0.24; 95% CI, -0.57 to 0.10; P = .163) were lower in the parental presence group than in the usual care group. However, the differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of parents in the PACU can reduce ED in pediatric patients. Therefore, parental presence may be a useful intervention in the PACU.
