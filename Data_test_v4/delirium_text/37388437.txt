37388437|t|Leon (Spain) Health professionals' knowledge and clinical practice towards the relationship between cardiovascular diseases and periodontal disease.
37388437|a|Background: Cardiovascular pathologies have a high prevalence in the geriatric population, with acute myocardial infarction being one of the main causes of death in Spain. These pathologies have a systemic inflammatory component that is of vital importance. We also know in dentistry that the main gingival pathogens are capable of generating a systemic inflammatory response, being indirectly involved in the development of the atherosclerotic lesion, assuming, therefore, that periodontal disease is a cardiovascular risk factor. The objective of this study is to determine the knowledge of health professionals who treat cardiovascular diseases about periodontal disease and its relationship with heart disease. Material and Methods: A health survey was carried out on 100 Cardiologists, Internists and General Practitioners in the province of Leon. Points of interest in this survey: the professional's own oral health, knowledge of the relationship between periodontal and heart disease and, lastly, the training received in medicine on oral health. Results: 60% of professionals reviewed their oral health annually and 20% randomly. 48% of health professionals were unaware of periodontal diseases, 77% claimed to have not received university training in this regard, only 13% of those surveyed acknowledged having received more than 10 hours of training on oral health in their experience and finally, 90% thought that training in both Medicine and Dentistry should be collaborative. Conclusions: The degree of knowledge of health professionals regarding oral health is poor (77%), therefore the number of collaborative consultations with dental professionals is low (<63%). Training projects targeting a correct preventive medicine are shown to be necessary. Key words:Cardiovascular disease, oral-systemic health, periodontitis, knowledge, physicians.
