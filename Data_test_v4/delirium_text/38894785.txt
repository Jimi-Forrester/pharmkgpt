38894785|t|A Comprehensive Review on the Role of Melatonin's Anesthetic Applications in Pediatric Care.
38894785|a|Anesthesia is critical to pediatric care, ensuring the safety and comfort of children undergoing medical procedures. With a growing interest in alternative anesthetic agents, melatonin has emerged as a promising candidate due to its sedative, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. This comprehensive review explores the potential applications of melatonin in pediatric anesthesia. We delve into the pharmacological characteristics of melatonin, its anesthetic properties, and its clinical applications in pediatric care, including preoperative sedation, adjunct to general anesthesia, postoperative pain management, and prevention of emergence delirium. Additionally, we discuss the safety profile of melatonin, potential adverse effects, and comparative analysis with traditional anesthetics. Finally, we highlight future research directions to provide insights into melatonin's role in pediatric anesthesia and its implications for clinical practice.
