39470585|t|Causal association of circulating inflammatory proteins on neurodegenerative diseases: Insights from a mendelian randomization study.
39470585|a|Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized as a pivotal factor in the development and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. While correlations between inflammatory cytokines and these diseases are documented, the definitive causal dynamics remain to be elucidated. We explored the causal association between 91 circulating inflammatory cytokines and Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) through Mendelian randomization analysis. Leveraging genetic variants from the most comprehensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS) available for these cytokines, AD, ALS, MS and PD, we sought to uncover the causality. Our study validated a causal influence of genetically determined cytokine levels on the susceptibility to AD, with notable cytokines including C-X-C motif chemokine 1 (OR = 0.9993, p = 0.0424), Interleukin-18 (OR = 0.9994, p = 0.0186), Leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (OR = 0.9993, p = 0.0122) and Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (OR = 0.9992, p = 0.0026) in risk attenuation. Additionally, a positive causal relationship was identified between two cytokines-C-C motif chemokine 19 (OR = 1.0005, p = 0.0478) and Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (OR = 1.0005, p = 0.0210)-and AD incidence. Conversely, transforming growth factor-alpha (OR = 0.8630, p = 0.0298), CD40L receptor (OR = 0.7737, p = 1.1265E-09) and Interleukin-12 subunit beta (OR = 0.8987, p = 0.0333) showed inverse associations with ALS, MS and PD, respectively. The consistency observed in various MR analyses, alongside sensitivity analysis, underscored the absence of horizontal pleiotropy, thus supporting our causal findings. This study reveals, for the first time, a genetically anchored causal nexus between levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines and the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.
