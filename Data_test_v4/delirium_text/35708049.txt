35708049|a|Age-related diseases are associated with increased morbidity in the past few decades and the cost associated with the treatment of these age-related diseases exerts a substantial impact on social and health care expenditure. Anti-aging strategies aim to mitigate, delay and reverse aging-associated diseases, thereby improving quality of life and reducing the burden of age-related pathologies. The natural dietary antioxidant supplementation offers substantial pharmacological and therapeutic effects against various disease conditions. Astaxanthin is one such natural carotenoid with superior antioxidant activity than other carotenoids, as well as well as vitamins C and E, and additionally, it is known to exhibit a plethora of pharmacological effects. The present review summarizes the protective molecular mechanisms of actions of astaxanthin on age-related diseases of multiple organs such as Neurodegenerative diseases [Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Stroke, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Status Epilepticus (SE)], Bone Related Diseases [Osteoarthritis (OA) and Osteoporosis], Cancers [Colon cancer, Prostate cancer, Breast cancer, and Lung Cancer], Cardiovascular disorders [Hypertension, Atherosclerosis and Myocardial infarction (MI)], Diabetes associated complications [Diabetic nephropathy (DN), Diabetic neuropathy, and Diabetic retinopathy (DR)], Eye disorders [Age related macular degeneration (AMD), Dry eye disease (DED), Cataract and Uveitis], Gastric Disorders [Gastritis, Colitis, and Functional dyspepsia], Kidney Disorders [Nephrolithiasis, Renal fibrosis, Renal Ischemia reperfusion (RIR), Acute kidney injury (AKI), and hyperuricemia], Liver Diseases [Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), Alcoholic Liver Disease (AFLD), Liver fibrosis, and Hepatic Ischemia-Reperfusion (IR) Injury], Pulmonary Disorders [Pulmonary Fibrosis, Acute Lung injury (ALI), and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)], Muscle disorders (skeletal muscle atrophy), Skin diseases [Atopic dermatitis (ATD), Skin Photoaging, and Wound healing]. We have also briefly discussed astaxanthin's protective effects on reproductive health.
