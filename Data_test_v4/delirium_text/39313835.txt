39313835|a|ABSTRACT: Older adults admitted to post-acute care often are frail with multiple comorbidities, making them particularly vulnerable to developing delirium. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to create, implement, and evaluate an NP-led, evidence-based delirium prevention protocol in a skilled nursing facility (SNF). The incidence of new-onset delirium was assessed pre- and postimplementation; following implementation, no patients were diagnosed with new-onset delirium, and nurses and certified nursing assistants reported changes to their practice. Based on project design, the approximately 42,000 NPs in the US with nursing home or long-term-care facility privileges are optimally positioned to lead SNFs in the prevention of new-onset delirium.
