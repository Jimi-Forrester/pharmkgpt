32508955|t|A Systematic Review of Essential Oils and the Endocannabinoid System: A Connection Worthy of Further Exploration.
32508955|a|Aromatic compounds have a long history of use as medicines in most recorded cultures. An increasing interest in these therapeutic volatile molecules in both scientific and lay communities has led to the advancement of essential oils as phytomedicines. Recent discoveries suggest essential oils augment the endocannabinoid system in a positive manner to mitigate various pathologies. However, the exact mechanisms whereby essential oils influence endocannabinoid system activity are not fully known, these studies provide a glimpse into their involvement and warrant further evaluation. Additional study of the interaction between essential oils and the endocannabinoid system may lead to promising phytomedicines for the treatment of diseases and conditions involving dysregulation or activation of the endocannabinoid system.
