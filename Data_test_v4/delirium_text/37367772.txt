37367772|t|The Alternating Access Mechanism in Mammalian Multidrug Resistance Transporters and Their Bacterial Homologs.
37367772|a|Multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins belonging to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter group play a crucial role in the export of cytotoxic drugs across cell membranes. These proteins are particularly fascinating due to their ability to confer drug resistance, which subsequently leads to the failure of therapeutic interventions and hinders successful treatments. One key mechanism by which multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins carry out their transport function is through alternating access. This mechanism involves intricate conformational changes that enable the binding and transport of substrates across cellular membranes. In this extensive review, we provide an overview of ABC transporters, including their classifications and structural similarities. We focus specifically on well-known mammalian multidrug resistance proteins such as MRP1 and Pgp (MDR1), as well as bacterial counterparts such as Sav1866 and lipid flippase MsbA. By exploring the structural and functional features of these MDR proteins, we shed light on the roles of their nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and transmembrane domains (TMDs) in the transport process. Notably, while the structures of NBDs in prokaryotic ABC proteins, such as Sav1866, MsbA, and mammalian Pgp, are identical, MRP1 exhibits distinct characteristics in its NBDs. Our review also emphasizes the importance of two ATP molecules for the formation of an interface between the two binding sites of NBD domains across all these transporters. ATP hydrolysis occurs following substrate transport and is vital for recycling the transporters in subsequent cycles of substrate transportation. Specifically, among the studied transporters, only NBD2 in MRP1 possesses the ability to hydrolyze ATP, while both NBDs of Pgp, Sav1866, and MsbA are capable of carrying out this reaction. Furthermore, we highlight recent advancements in the study of MDR proteins and the alternating access mechanism. We discuss the experimental and computational approaches utilized to investigate the structure and dynamics of MDR proteins, providing valuable insights into their conformational changes and substrate transport. This review not only contributes to an enhanced understanding of multidrug resistance proteins but also holds immense potential for guiding future research and facilitating the development of effective strategies to overcome multidrug resistance, thus improving therapeutic interventions.
