29466244|a|Neurological disorders have aroused a significant concern among the health scientists globally, as diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and dementia lead to disability and people have to live with them throughout the life. Recent evidence suggests that a number of environmental chemicals such as pesticides (paraquat) and metals (lead and aluminum) are also the cause of these diseases and other neurological disorders. Biomarkers can help in detecting the disorder at the preclinical stage, progression of the disease and key metabolomic alterations permitting identification of potential targets for intervention. A number of biomarkers have been proposed for some neurological disorders based on laboratory and clinical studies. In silico approaches have also been used by some investigators. Yet the ideal biomarker, which can help in early detection and follow-up on treatment and identifying the susceptible populations, is not available. An attempt has therefore been made to review the recent advancements of in silico approaches for discovery of biomarkers and their validation. In silico techniques implemented with multi-omics approaches have potential to provide a fast and accurate approach to identify novel biomarkers.
