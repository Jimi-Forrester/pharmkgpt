39896355|t|Multimodal Alzheimer's disease classification through ensemble deep random vector functional link neural network.
39896355|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a condition with a complex pathogenesis, sometimes hereditary, characterized by the loss of neurons and synapses, along with the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Early detection, particularly among individuals at high risk, is critical for effective treatment or prevention, yet remains challenging due to data variability and incompleteness. Most current research relies on single data modalities, potentially limiting comprehensive staging of AD. This study addresses this gap by integrating multimodal data-including clinical and genetic information-using deep learning (DL) models, with a specific focus on random vector functional link (RVFL) networks, to enhance early detection of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Our findings demonstrate that ensemble deep RVFL (edRVFL) models, when combined with effective data imputation techniques such as Winsorized-mean (Wmean), achieve superior performance in detecting early stages of AD. Notably, the edRVFL model achieved an accuracy of 98.8%, precision of 98.3%, recall of 98.4%, and F1-score of 98.2%, outperforming traditional machine learning models like support vector machines, random forests, and decision trees. This underscores the importance of integrating advanced imputation strategies and deep learning techniques in AD diagnosis.
