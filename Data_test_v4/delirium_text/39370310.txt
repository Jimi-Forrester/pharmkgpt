39370310|t|Safe Landing: Feasibility and Safety of Operating Room Extubation in Minimally Invasive Cardiac Valve Surgery.
39370310|a|OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to explore key safety outcomes after operating room (OR) extubation in minimally invasive cardiac valve surgery. DESIGN: Single-center retrospective chart review. SETTING: Academic medical center in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Patients undergoing valvular surgery via thoracotomy (November 2017-October 2022) at a single institution. INTERVENTIONS: The OR extubation protocol was implemented on August 20, 2020. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Delirium rates, reintubation rates, and intubation duration were compared before and after OR extubation protocol implementation. Logistic regression identified patient perioperative characteristics associated with unsuccessful OR extubation. Among 312 patients, 254 were extubated in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 58 in the OR. Preoperative demographics were comparable except for the Charlson Comorbidity Index (median: 2.0 ICU extubation v 1.5 OR extubation). Interrupted time series analysis showed no change in postoperative delirium post-OR extubation implementation, with a trend toward decreasing delirium (risk ratio = 0.37, CI: 0.13-1.10, p = 0.07). The postimplementation era also had a lower median intubation duration (8 hours v 13 hours, p < 0.001) without increasing reintubation rates (1.7% v 7.9%, p = 0.159). Increased bypass length (odds ratio = 0.99, CI: 0.98-0.99, p < 0.001), intraoperative morphine milligram equivalents (odds ratio = 0.99, CI: 0.99-1.0, p = 0.009), and preoperative Charlson Comorbidity Index above 3 (odds ratio = 0.42, CI: 0.19-0.95, p = 0.037) were associated with decreased odds of OR extubation. CONCLUSIONS: OR extubation was not associated with increased postoperative delirium or reintubation rates but did decrease intubation duration. Successful OR extubation relies upon the consideration of various patient perioperative characteristics.
