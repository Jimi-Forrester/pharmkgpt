37963979|t|A randomized, blinded study of photobiomodulation in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease showed no preventive effect.
37963979|a|Photobiomodulation (PBM), the process of exposing tissue to red or near-infrared light, has become a topic of great interest as a therapy for diverse pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we aimed to evaluate the potential beneficial effect of PBM on Alzheimer's disease (AD) using behavioral and histological readouts from a well-established transgenic murine AD model (5xFAD mice) in a randomized and fully blinded long-term in-vivo study following GLP (Good Laboratory Practices) guidelines. The heads of the mice were illuminated with no (sham), low or high power 810 nm light, three times a week for 5 months from the first to the sixth month of life corresponding to the prodromal phase of the pathology. The results showed that there were no significant differences between the groups in behavioral tests, including the Morris water maze, novel object recognition, and Y-maze. Similarly, histological analyses showed no differences in amyloid load, neuronal loss or microglial response. In conclusion, under the conditions of our experiment, we were unable to demonstrate any therapeutic effect of PBM for AD. This study calls for further evidence and caution when considering PBM as an effective treatment for AD.
