38365838|t|From the regulatory mechanism of TFEB to its therapeutic implications.
38365838|a|Transcription factor EB (TFEB), known as a major transcriptional regulator of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, regulates target gene expression by binding to coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) elements. TFEB are regulated by multiple links, such as transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional regulation, translational-level regulation, post-translational modification (PTM), and nuclear competitive regulation. Targeted regulation of TFEB has been victoriously used as a treatment strategy in several disease models such as ischemic injury, lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), cancer, metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammation. In this review, we aimed to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of TFEB and its applications in several disease models by targeting the regulation of TFEB as a treatment strategy.
