37586159|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder with no effective cure. Targeting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway may offer a novel approach to ameliorate cognitive deficits in AD. Bushen-Yizhi formula (BSYZ), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription, has shown potential benefits for AD. To facilitate the development of new therapeutic agents for AD, it is important to identify the active components and the underlying mechanisms of BSYZ against AD. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to systematically screen the active components of BSYZ that could improve learning and memory impairment in AD by modulating ER stress pathway. METHODS: A drug-target (D-T) network was constructed to analyze the herbal components of BSYZ. Network proximity method was used to identify the potential anti-AD components that targeted ER stress and evaluate their synergistic effects. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties and the literature evidence were considered to select promising candidates for further validation. The selected components were tested in vitro using an AD cell model (APPswe-SH-SY5Y). In vivo anti-AD effects of the components were assessed in APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice. RESULTS: 58 potential anti-AD components targeting ER stress were detected by network proximity analysis, and 13 out of them were selected based on ADMET properties and literature evidence. In vitro experiments confirmed that 5 components, namely gomisin B, beta-Carotene, imperatorin, chrysophanol, and osthole (OST), exhibited anti-AD effects on the APPswe-SH-SY5Y model. Moreover, network proximity analysis suggested that OST and Gomisin B might have synergistic effects on modulating ER stress. In vivo experiments demonstrated that OST, Gomisin B, OST+Gomisin B, and BSYZ all improved learning and memory function in APP/PS1 mice. Gomisin B and OST also restored cellular morphology and tissue structure in APP/PS1 mice. Thioflavine-S (Th-S) staining revealed that they reduced amyloid plaque deposition in the brain tissue of AD model mice. The qPCR results indicated that BSYZ, OST, and Gomisin B differentially regulated IRE1alpha, PERK, EIF2alpha, DDIT3, and Caspase 12 expression levels, while the OST and Gomisin B co-administration group showed better efficacy. This trend was further confirmed by immunofluorescence experiments. CONCLUSION: This study identified the active components of BSYZ that could ameliorate learning and memory impairment in AD by targeting ER stress pathway. OST and Gomisin B exhibited synergistic effects on modulating ER stress and reducing amyloid plaque deposition in vivo. Overall, our study elucidated the molecular mechanisms of BSYZ and its active components in attenuating AD symptoms which suggested the therapeutic potential of TCM for AD.
