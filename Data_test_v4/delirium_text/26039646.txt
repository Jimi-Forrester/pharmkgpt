26039646|t|Stuck Inside a Cloud: Optimizing Sedation to Reduce ICU-Associated Delirium in Geriatric Patients.
26039646|a|Elderly population account for more than 50% of all intensive care admissions, and during their stay, up to 87% of them suffer from delirium. There is a large body of evidence demonstrating increased mortality and worse cognitive function for elderly patients who become delirious during their intensive care unit stay. Although the cause of delirium is multifactorial, inappropriate and outdated sedation methods are preventable causes. We review the current best evidences and provide what we believe are the best sedation strategies that are in line with the Society of Critical Care Medicine's Pain, Agitation and Delirium best practice guideline to reduce the incidence of intensive care unit-associated delirium.
