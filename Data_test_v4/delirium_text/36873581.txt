36873581|a|Objective: To evaluate risk factors for neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD) in recipients of CART therapy. Methods: Patients >= 18 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and aggressive B-cell lymphomas who received CART in 2018 were evaluated. Patients with and without NPD were compared. Results: NPD was diagnosed in 31.2% of patients. Compared to patients without NPD, patients with NPD were likely to be females (P = 0.035) and have ALL (P = 0.039). NPD was significantly associated with female gender (OR = 2.03) and diagnosis of ALL (OR = 2.76). No association between NPD and outcomes. Conclusions: Female gender and ALL were risk factors for NPD.
