36903771|t|The Effect of a Novel Mica Nanoparticle, STB-MP, on an Alzheimer's Disease Patient-Induced PSC-Derived Cortical Brain Organoid Model.
36903771|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most well-known neurodegenerative diseases, with a substantial amount of advancements in the field of neuroscience and AD. Despite such progress, there has been no significant improvement in AD treatments. To improve in developing a research platform for AD treatment, AD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) was employed to generate cortical brain organoids, expressing AD phenotypes, with the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau). We have investigated the use of a medical grade mica nanoparticle, STB-MP, as a treatment to decrease the expression of AD's major hallmarks. STB-MP treatment did not inhibit the expression of pTau; however, accumulated Abeta plaques were diminished in STB-MP treated AD organoids. STB-MP seemed to activate the autophagy pathway, by mTOR inhibition, and also decreased gamma-secretase activity by decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. To sum up, the development of AD brain organoids successfully mimics AD phenotype expressions, and thus it could be used as a screening platform for novel AD treatment assessments.
