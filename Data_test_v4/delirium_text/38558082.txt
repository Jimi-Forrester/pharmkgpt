38558082|a|Calls to leverage routinely collected data to inform health system improvements have been made. Misalignment between home care services and client needs can result in poor client, caregiver, and system outcomes. To inform development of an integrated model of community-based home care, grounded in a holistic definition of health, comprehensive clinical profiles were created using Ontario, Canada home care assessment data. Retrospective, cross-sectional analyses of 2017-2018 Resident Assessment Instrument Home Care (RAI-HC) assessments (n = 162,523) were completed to group home care clients by service needs and generate comprehensive profiles of each group's dominant medical, functional, cognitive, and psychosocial care needs. Six unique groups were identified, with care profiles representing home care clients living with Geriatric Syndromes, Medical Complexity, Cognitive Impairment and Behaviours, Caregiver Distress and Social Frailty. Depending on group membership, between 51% and 81% of clients had identified care needs spanning four or more Positive Health dimensions, demonstrating both the heterogeneity and complexity of clients served by home care. Comprehensive clinical profiles, developed from routinely collected assessment data, support a future-focused, evidence-informed, and community-engaged approach to research and practice in integrated home-based health and social care.
