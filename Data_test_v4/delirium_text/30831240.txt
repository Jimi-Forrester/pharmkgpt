30831240|t|Association of Persistent Intense Thirst With Delirium Among Critically Ill Patients: A Cross-sectional Study.
30831240|a|CONTEXT: Thirst is a prevalent distressing symptom often reported by patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Little is known about the association of thirst with delirium. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the relationship between thirst and delirium. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study enrolled 401 patients who were evaluated for thirst intensity in the ICU between March 2017 and October 2017. We assessed thirst intensity on a scale of 0-10 (with 10 being the worst) and defined intense thirst as a score >=8. If intense thirst persisted for more than 24 hours, we defined it as persistent intense thirst. Delirium was screened using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. Propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 401 patients, 66 (16.5%) had intense thirst sensation for more than 24 hours. After matching, patients with persistent intense thirst showed an increased risk for delirium compared with those without persistent intense thirst (odds ratio, 4.95; 95% confidence interval, 2.58-9.48; P < 0.001). Propensity score weighted logistic regression analysis also indicated that persistent intense thirst was significantly associated with delirium (odds ratio, 5.74; 95% confidence interval, 2.53-12.99; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Intense thirst persisting for more than 24 hours was associated with increased risk for delirium.
