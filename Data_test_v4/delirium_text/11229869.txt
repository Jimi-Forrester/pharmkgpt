11229869|t|Where do Alzheimer's plaques and tangles come from? Aging-induced protein degradation inefficiency.
11229869|a|Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are prominent lesions in the aging brain and they may be responsible for cell death in Alzheimer's disease. But a basic question has not been answered: why and how are plaques and tangles formed during aging? In this study, we approach this question by first examining what happens in the aging body. Plaques and tangles do not come alone, but together with many other aging markers in the body (cholesterol deposition, gallstones, hair graying, and bone loss, etc.). Because these aging markers occur to a certain extent in all elderly and at about the same time in life, it is reasonable to conceive that they originate from a common cause, that is, aging-induced metabolic inefficiency. If cholesterol and gallstone depositions are the results of inefficient degradation/clearance of lipids and minerals, then similarly plaque and tangle formation in most people would be the results of inefficient normal degradation of ?-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau, respectively. By this view, our studies should focus on the enzymes responsible for APP and tau normal degradation and their natural changes in aging, rather than on presumed pathological factors. Whatever precise mechanisms underlying their depositions, plaques and tangles are the natural products of aging, thus fundamentally different from pathological events such as cancer growth in concept.
