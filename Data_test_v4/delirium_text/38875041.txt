38875041|t|Approaches for Increasing Cerebral Efflux of Amyloid-beta in Experimental Systems.
38875041|a|Amyloid protein-beta (Abeta) concentrations are increased in the brain in both early onset and late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). In early onset AD, cerebral Abeta production is increased and its clearance is decreased, while increased Abeta burden in late onset AD is due to impaired clearance. Abeta has been the focus of AD therapeutics since development of the amyloid hypothesis, but efforts to slow AD progression by lowering brain Abeta failed until phase 3 trials with the monoclonal antibodies lecanemab and donanemab. In addition to promoting phagocytic clearance of Abeta, antibodies lower cerebral Abeta by efflux of Abeta-antibody complexes across the capillary endothelia, dissolving Abeta aggregates, and a "peripheral sink" mechanism. Although the blood-brain barrier is the main route by which soluble Abeta leaves the brain (facilitated by low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 and ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1), Abeta can also be removed via the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, glymphatic drainage, and intramural periarterial drainage. This review discusses experimental approaches to increase cerebral Abeta efflux via these mechanisms, clinical applications of these approaches, and findings in clinical trials with these approaches in patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment. Based on negative findings in clinical trials with previous approaches targeting monomeric Abeta, increasing the cerebral efflux of soluble Abeta is unlikely to slow AD progression if used as monotherapy. But if used as an adjunct to treatment with lecanemab or donanemab, this approach might allow greater slowing of AD progression than treatment with either antibody alone.
