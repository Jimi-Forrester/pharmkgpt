34844387|a|PURPOSE: Exercise is a representative noninvasive treatment that can be applied to various diseases. We studied the effect of resistance exercise on motor function and spatial learning ability in Parkinson disease (PD) mice. METHODS: The rotarod test and beam walking test were conducted to evaluate the effect of resistance exercise on motor function, and the Morris water maze test was conducted to examine the effect of resistance exercise on spatial learning ability. The effect of resistance exercise on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) expression and 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation was investigated by Western blot analysis. New cell generation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine. RESULTS: Resistance exercise improved coordination, balance, and spatial learning ability in PD mice. Resistance exercise enhanced new cell production, BDNF and TrkB expression, and AMPK phosphorylation in PD mice. The effect of such resistance exercise was similar to that of levodopa application. CONCLUSION: In PD-induced mice, resistance exercise enhanced AMPK phosphorylation to increase BDNF expression and new neuron generation, thereby improving spatial learning ability. Resistance exercise is believed to help improve symptoms of PD.
