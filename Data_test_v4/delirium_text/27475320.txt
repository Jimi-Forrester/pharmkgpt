27475320|t|Total intracranial and lateral ventricle volumes measurement in Alzheimer's disease: A methodological study.
27475320|a|Measuring of brain and its compartments' sizes from magnetic resonance (MR) images is an effective way to assess disease progression in neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). The objective of this study was to compare total intracranial volume (TIV) and lateral ventricle volume (LVV) in patients with Alzheimer's disease with those in elderly control subjects, and to compare an automated method (automatic lateral ventricle delineation [ALVIN]) and a manual method (ImageJ). MRI of the brain was performed on 20 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 18 control subjects. The TIV was calculated by a manual method and the LVV was calculated by using two methods: an automated and manual method. We found a significant increase in LVVs in Alzheimer's disease patients compared to control subjects, but no difference in TIV between the two groups. A perfect agreement, with 0.989 (0.973-0.996) intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and 0.978 (0.946-0.991) concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), was observed between the manual and automatic lateral ventricle measurements in Alzheimer patients. The results revealed that LVV measure has predictive performance in AD. We demonstrated that ALVIN and ImageJ are both effective in determining lateral ventricular volume, providing an objective tool for quantitative assessment of AD.
