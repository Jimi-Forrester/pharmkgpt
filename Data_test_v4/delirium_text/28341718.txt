28341718|t|Relationships among Cortical Glutathione Levels, Brain Amyloidosis, and Memory in Healthy Older Adults Investigated In Vivo with 1H-MRS and Pittsburgh Compound-B PET.
28341718|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Oxidative stress has been implicated as an important pathologic mechanism in the development of Alzheimer disease. The purpose of this study was to assess whether glutathione levels, detected noninvasively with proton MR spectroscopy, are associated with brain amyloidosis and memory in a community-dwelling cohort of healthy older adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen cognitively healthy subjects were prospectively enrolled in this study. All subjects underwent 1H-MR spectroscopy of glutathione, a positron-emission tomography scan with an amyloid tracer, and neuropsychological testing by using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Associations among glutathione levels, brain amyloidosis, and memory were assessed by using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: Lower glutathione levels were associated with greater brain amyloidosis in the temporal (P = .03) and parietal (P = .05) regions, adjusted for apolipoprotein E epsilon4 carrier status. There were no significant associations between glutathione levels and cognitive scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study found an association between cortical glutathione levels and brain amyloidosis in healthy older adults, suggesting a potential role for 1H-MR spectroscopy measures of glutathione as a noninvasive biomarker of early Alzheimer disease pathogenesis.
