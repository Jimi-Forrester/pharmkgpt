35633561|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is one of the most common postoperative complications in gastrointestinal surgery patients. POD has been reported to affect long-term activities of daily living, cognitive function decline, and mortality. Previous studies have indicated that preoperative physical activity (PA) predicted POD in patients with other diseases, but we have not found any reports in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. In this retrospective study, we investigated the relationship between preoperative PA and POD in gastrointestinal cancer patients. METHODS: POD was diagnosed based on the short confusion assessment method. We divided patients into active and inactive groups based on their preoperative PA assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (Japanese version). Multivariate logistic analysis was conducted to investigate the association between preoperative PA and POD. RESULTS: POD occurred in 25 of the 151 patients (16.6%). Preoperative low PA was associated with POD after adjusting for confounders, namely, diabetes mellitus, sedentary time, and usual gait speed (odds ratio, 2.83; 95% confidence interval: 1.06-7.58; p=0.03). CONCLUSION: Preoperative low PA was a predictor of POD independent of the confounding factors in patients with gastrointestinal cancer.
