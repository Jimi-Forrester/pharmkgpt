31284232|a|Apathy is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that is difficult to quantify and poorly understood. Some studies have used incentivized motor tasks to assess apathy, as the condition is often associated with a reduction in motivated behavior. Normally event-related desynchronization, a reduction of power in specific frequency bands, is observed in the motor cortex during the peri-movement period. Also, alpha (8-12 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) oscillations are sensitive to rewards that are closely related to motivational states however these oscillations have not been widely investigated in relation to apathy in PD. Using EEG recordings, we investigated the neural oscillatory characteristics of apathy in PD during an incentivized motor task with interleaved rest periods. Apathetic and non-apathetic PD subjects on dopaminergic medication and healthy control subjects were instructed to squeeze a hand grip device for a monetary reward proportional to the subject's grip force and the monetary value attributed to that trial. Apathetic PD subjects exhibited higher alpha and theta powers in the pre-trial baseline rest period compared to non-apathetic PD subjects and healthy subjects. Further, we found that both resting power and relative power in alpha and theta bands during incentivized movement predicted PD subjects' apathy scores. Our results suggest that apathetic PD patients may need to overcome greater baseline alpha and theta oscillatory activity in order to facilitate incentivized movement. Clinically, resting alpha and theta power as well as alpha and theta event-related desynchronization during movement may serve as potential neural markers for apathy severity in PD.
