32466754|a|BACKGROUND: The association between cytomegalovirus (CMV) and dementia remains controversial. Previous studies have suggested that CMV serostatus, as assessed by serum immunoglobulin G, plays a role in neurodegeneration with cognitive impairment. We aimed to evaluate the association between CMV tissue-invasive end-organ diseases and moderate-to-severe dementia. METHODS: The ICD 10th revision codes from the National Health Insurance Database covering the entire population of the Republic of Korea were used to classify patients into exposed (n = 687, age >= 40 years, with CMV disease) and unexposed (n = 3435, without CMV disease) groups, matched by age and sex at a 1:5 ratio of exposed: unexposed. All non-HIV-1-infected subjects selected during 2010-2014 with a washout period of the previous 4 years were followed up until December 2016 to identify newly diagnosed cases of moderate-to-severe dementia. RESULTS: Multivariate regression model (M3) adjusted for age, sex, low income, body mass index, transplantation status, malignant neoplasms, end-stage renal disease on dialysis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia showed a significantly higher incidence of dementia (odds ratio: 1.9; 95% confidence interval: 1.2-2.8) in the exposed group than that in the unexposed group. The risk of vascular dementia (2.9, 1.1-7.5) was higher than that of Alzheimer's disease (1.6, 1.0-2.6) in the exposed group in M3. In M3, patients aged 40-59 years with CMV diseases had a significantly higher risk of all kinds of dementia than those aged 60-79 and >= 80 years (11.7, 2.5-49.4 vs. 1.8, 1.1-3.2 vs. 1.3, 0.5-2.8; P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: CMV diseases may be associated with the risk of moderate-to-severe dementia.
