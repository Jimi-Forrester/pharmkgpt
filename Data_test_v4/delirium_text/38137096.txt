38137096|t|Neuroprotective Effects of Moderate Hypoxia: A Systematic Review.
38137096|a|Emerging evidence highlights moderate hypoxia as a candidate treatment for brain disorders. This systematic review examines findings and the methodological quality of studies investigating hypoxia (10-16% O2) for >=14 days in humans, as well as the neurobiological mechanisms triggered by hypoxia in animals, and suggests optimal treatment protocols to guide future studies. We followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) 2020. Searches were performed on PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, in May-September 2023. Two authors independently reviewed the human studies with the following tools: (1) revised Cochrane collaboration's risk of bias for randomized trials 2.0; (2) the risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions. We identified 58 eligible studies (k = 8 human studies with N = 274 individuals; k = 48 animal studies) reporting the effects of hypoxia on cognition, motor function, neuroimaging, neuronal/synaptic morphology, inflammation, oxidative stress, erythropoietin, neurotrophins, and Alzheimer's disease markers. A total of 75% of human studies indicated cognitive and/or neurological benefits, although all studies were evaluated ashigh risk of bias due to a lack of randomization and assessor blinding. Low-dose intermittent or continuous hypoxia repeated for 30-240 min sessions, preferably in combination with motor-cognitive training, produced beneficial effects, and high-dose hypoxia with longer (>=6 h) durations and chronic exposure produced more adverse effects. Larger and methodologically stronger translational studies are warranted.
