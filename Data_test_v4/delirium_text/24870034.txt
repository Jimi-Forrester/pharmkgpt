24870034|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta)-containing plaques are a major neuropathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The two major isoforms of Abeta peptide associated with AD are Abeta40 and Abeta42, of which the latter is highly prone to aggregation. Increased presence and aggregation of intracellular Abeta42 peptides is an early event in AD progression. Improved understanding of cellular processes affecting Abeta42 aggregation may have implications for development of therapeutic strategies. Abeta42 fused to green fluorescent protein (Abeta42-GFP) was expressed in ~4600 mutants of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome-wide deletion library to identify proteins and cellular processes affecting intracellular Abeta42 aggregation by assessing the fluorescence of Abeta42-GFP. This screening identified 110 mutants exhibiting intense Abeta42-GFP-associated fluorescence. Four major cellular processes were overrepresented in the data set, including phospholipid homeostasis. Disruption of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and/or phosphatidylethanolamine metabolism had a major effect on intracellular Abeta42 aggregation and localization. Confocal microscopy indicated that Abeta42-GFP localization in the phospholipid mutants was juxtaposed to the nucleus, most likely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/ER membrane. These data provide a genome-wide indication of cellular processes that affect intracellular Abeta42-GFP aggregation and may have important implications for understanding cellular mechanisms affecting intracellular Abeta42 aggregation and AD disease progression.
