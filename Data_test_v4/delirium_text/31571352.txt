31571352|t|Apolipoprotein E impairs amyloid-beta fibril elongation and maturation.
31571352|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is strongly linked to amyloid depositions of the Abeta peptide (Abeta). The lipid-binding protein apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has been found to interfere with Abeta amyloid formation and to exert a strong clinical impact to the pathology of AD. The APOE gene exists in three allelic isoforms represented by APOE epsilon2, APOE epsilon3, and APOE epsilon4. Carriers of the APOE epsilon4 variant display a gene dose-dependent increased risk of developing the disease. Abeta amyloids are formed via a nucleation-dependent mechanism where free monomers are added onto a nucleus in a template-dependent manner. Using a combination of surface plasmon resonance and thioflavin-T assays, we here show that ApoE can target the process of fibril elongation and that its interference effectively prevents amyloid maturation. We expose a complex equilibrium where the concentration of ApoE, Abeta monomers, and the amount of already formed Abeta fibrils will affect the relative proportion and formation rate of mature amyloids versus alternative assemblies. The result illustrates a mechanism which may affect both the clearance rate of Abeta assemblies in vivo and the population of cytotoxic Abeta assemblies.
