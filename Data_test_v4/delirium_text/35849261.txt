35849261|a|COVID-19 can cause detrimental effects on health. Vaccines have helped in reducing disease severity and transmission but their long-term effects on health and effectiveness against future viral variants remain unknown. COVID-19 pathogenesis involves alteration in iron homeostasis. Thus, a contextual understanding of iron-related parameters would be very valuable for disease prognosis and therapeutics.Accordingly, we reviewed the status of iron and iron-related proteins in COVID-19. Iron-associated alterations in COVID-19 reported hitherto include anemia of inflammation, low levels of serum iron (hypoferremia), transferrin and transferrin saturation, and high levels of serum ferritin (hyperferritinemia), hepcidin, lipocalin-2, catalytic iron, and soluble transferrin receptor (in ICU patients). Hemoglobin levels can be low or normal, and compromised hemoglobin function has been proposed. Membrane-bound transferrin receptor may facilitate viral entry, so it acts as a potential target for antiviral therapy. Lactoferrin can provide natural defense by preventing viral entry and/or inhibiting viral replication. Serum iron and ferritin levels can predict COVID-19-related hospitalization, severity, and mortality. Serum hepcidin and ferritin/transferrin ratio can predict COVID-19 severity. Here, serum levels of these iron-related parameters are provided, caveats of iron chelation for therapy are discussed and the interplay of these iron-related parameters in COVID-19 is explained.This synopsis is crucial as it clearly presents the iron picture of COVID-19. The information may assist in disease prognosis and/or in formulating iron-related adjunctive strategies that can help reduce infection/inflammation and better manage COVID-19 caused by future variants. Indeed, the current picture will augment as more is revealed about these iron-related parameters in COVID-19.
