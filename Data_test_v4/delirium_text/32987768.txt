32987768|t|Docosahexaenoic Acid-Loaded Polylactic Acid Core-Shell Nanofiber Membranes for Regenerative Medicine after Spinal Cord Injury: In Vitro and In Vivo Study.
32987768|a|Spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with disability and a drastic decrease in quality of life for affected individuals. Previous studies support the idea that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-based pharmacological approach is a promising therapeutic strategy for the management of acute SCI. We postulated that a nanostructured material for controlled delivery of DHA at the lesion site may be well suited for this purpose. Toward this end, we prepare drug-loaded fibrous mats made of core-shell nanofibers by electrospinning, which contained a polylactic acid (PLA) shell for encapsulation of DHA within the core, for delivery of DHA in situ. In vitro study confirmed sustained DHA release from PLA/DHA core-shell nanofiber membrane (CSNM) for up to 36 days, which could significantly increase neurite outgrowth from primary cortical neurons in 3 days. This is supported by the upregulation of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) neural marker genes from qRT-PCR analysis. Most importantly, the sustained release of DHA could significantly increase the neurite outgrowth length from cortical neuron cells in 7 days when co-cultured with PLA/DHA CSNM, compared with cells cultured with 3 muM DHA. From in vivo study with a SCI model created in rats, implantation of PLA/DHA CSNM could significantly improve neurological functions revealed by behavior assessment in comparison with the control (no treatment) and the PLA CSNM groups. According to histological analysis, PLA/DHA CSNM also effectively reduced neuron loss and increased serotonergic nerve sprouting. Taken together, the PLA/DHA CSNM may provide a nanostructured drug delivery system for DHA and contribute to neuroprotection and promoting neuroplasticity change following SCI.
