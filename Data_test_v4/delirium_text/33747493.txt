33747493|t|Indwelling catheters increase altered mental status and urinary tract infection risk: A retrospective Cohort Study.
33747493|a|BACKGROUND: Although indwelling urinary catheters (IUCs) are used intraoperatively and may cause complications (e.g., delirium), only few robust studies have investigated the association between intraoperative IUC use and complications. We hypothesized that IUC use might increase the postoperative incidence of altered mental status and/or urinary catheter infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective single-center cohort study, we analyzed the data of adult patients undergoing surgery at our facility between January 2013 and December 2018. The primary endpoint was altered mental status and/or incidence of urinary catheter infections. The patients were divided into IUC and control groups. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify the predictors of postoperative complications, and a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to analyze hospital discharge in unmatched and inverse propensity-weighted patients. RESULTS: Of the 14,284 patients that were reviewed, we analyzed 5112 patients (control group, 44.0%; IUC group, 56.0%). Almost all procedures comprised less invasive surgeries. The prevalence of postoperative altered mental status and postoperative urinary catheter infection were 3.56% and 0.04%, respectively. After inverse propensity weighting, all baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. However, patients with IUCs had a higher risk of postoperative complications (adjusted odds ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-2.59) and prolonged hospital stays (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.80-0.89). CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing less invasive surgery, IUCs may be associated with a relatively high risk of altered mental status or urinary catheter infection. These data may facilitate preoperative discussions regarding the perioperative use of IUCs.
