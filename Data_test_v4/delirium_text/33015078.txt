33015078|t|Cognitive Frailty Among Elderly Chinese Patients With Cerebral Small Vessel Disease: A Structural MRI Study.
33015078|a|Cognitive frailty (CF) is gaining an increasing amount of attention in geriatric research. CF refers to the co-occurrence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment in people without dementia. Neuroimaging of elderly people has revealed the presence of numerous white matter lesions, which is a typical biomarker of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) on magnetic resonance images. The aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of CF in elderly Chinese patients with SVD. One hundred and thirty elderly patients with SVD were recruited for this cross-sectional observational study. Participants who met three to five of the Fried criteria of the physical frailty (PF) phenotype (shrinking, weakness, slowness, self-reported exhaustion, or low physical activity) were classified as having PF. Then, individuals with PF were defined as having CF if mild cognitive impairment was discovered by the Mini-Mental State Examination. Lastly, a series of cognitive function tests and the dual-task walking paradigm were examined. Based on the CF diagnostic criteria, the frequency of CF was 23.08% among elderly Chinese patients with SVD. Furthermore, CF-positive patients had a more significant SVD burden, based on magnetic resonance imaging findings. Logistic regression analysis, which was adjusted for age, sex, education, and comorbidities, showed that CF was negatively correlated with the dual-task walking speed in elderly people with SVD. Thus, SVD burden might be an indicator of CF phenotype. In elderly patients with SVD, CF was associated with dual task walking performance.
