36110837|a|Background: Post-operative delirium is a common complication among adult patients in the intensive care unit. Current literature does not support the use of pharmacologic measures to manage this condition, and several studies explore the potential for the use of non-pharmacologic methods such as early mobility plans or environmental modifications. The aim of this systematic review is to examine and report on recently available literature evaluating the relationship between non-pharmacologic management strategies and the reduction of delirium in the intensive care unit. Methods: Six major research databases were systematically searched for articles analyzing the efficacy of non-pharmacologic delirium interventions in the past five years. Search results were restricted to adult human patients aged 18 years or older in the intensive care unit setting, excluding terminally ill subjects and withdrawal-related delirium. Following title, abstract, and full text review, 27 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and are included in this report. Results: The 27 reviewed articles consist of 12 interventions with a single-component investigational approach, and 15 with multi-component bundled protocols. Delirium incidence was the most commonly assessed outcome followed by duration. Family visitation was the most effective individual intervention while mobility interventions were the least effective. Two of the three family studies significantly reduced delirium incidence, while one in five mobility studies did the same. Multi-component bundle approaches were the most effective of all; of the reviewed studies, eight of 11 bundles significantly improved delirium incidence and seven of eight bundles decreased the duration of delirium. Conclusions: Multi-component, bundled interventions were more effective at managing intensive care unit delirium than those utilizing an approach with a single interventional element. Although better management of this condition suggests a decrease in resource burden and improvement in patient outcomes, comparative research should be performed to identify the importance of specific bundle elements.
