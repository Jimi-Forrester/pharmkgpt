34018278|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common contributor to mortality and hospital costs in stroke patients. Different observational studies have showed inconsistent results regarding the association between cognitive decline/dementia and delirium after acute stroke. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis with the aim of determining whether cognitive decline/dementia is related to the risk of delirium after acute stroke. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Web of Science for relevant studies from inception to September 2020. We calculated the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) by using fixed or random effects models based on heterogeneity measured by the I2 index. RESULTS: The association between cognitive decline/dementia and post-stroke delirium was examined in 13 studies with 3183 participants. After pooled analysis, we found that cognitive decline/dementia was significantly associated with susceptibility to delirium in post-stroke patients (OR = 3.70, 95%CI: 2.90-4.71, P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis suggested that cognitive decline/dementia was associated with an increased risk of delirium in Caucasians (OR = 3.73, 95%CI: 2.73-5.11, P < 0.001), non-Caucasians (OR = 3.65, 95%CI: 2.50-5.33, P < 0.001), samples with <200 subjects (OR = 3.70, 95%CI: 2.17-6.31, P < 0.001), samples with >=200 subjects (OR = 3.70, 95%CI: 2.82-4.85, P < 0.001), studies published in 1990-2009 (OR = 3.17, 95%CI: 1.48-6.77, P = 0.003), and studies published in 2010-2020 (OR = 3.76, 95%CI: 2.92-4.86, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We identified an association between cognitive decline/dementia and the risk of developing delirium. Cognitive decline/dementia may be a promising predictor for delirium in post-stroke patients.
