17454688|t|The ability to pun may be retained in Alzheimer disease.
17454688|a|Although the deficits and difficulties of the patient with Alzheimer disease (AD) are well documented and discussed, less attention is paid to describing some of the interesting and unusual abilities that these patients can possess. This case report describes an 81-year-old female with moderately severe Alzheimer disease who, in spite of some severe cognitive deficits, is able to express impressive humor through the extensive use of puns. Acknowledging and focusing on the remaining positive attributes of a person with AD can be helpful to both family members and professionals.
