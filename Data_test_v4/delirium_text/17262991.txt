17262991|a|Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a relevant marker of neuronal degeneration. However it plays an important role not only in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases but also in other critical disorders like heart diseases, carcinogenesis and others. Oxidative stress is also associated with normal aging. In this review we discuss a crucial question: to what extent oxidative stress may be a causative factor in pathogenesis of AD type of neurodegeneration. The results of several recent epidemiological studies appeared to be controversial at this point. It is believed that antioxidant therapies may have beneficial effects at least in delaying disease progression and appearance of AD specific clinical symptoms. Since there is no cure for AD recently, healthy life style and antioxidants enriched nutrition (or even antioxidant therapy) may provide an effective way of fighting against this deleterious disease (Ref. 102).
