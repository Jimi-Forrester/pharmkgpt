32731418|t|Molecular Imaging of Fluorinated Probes for Tau Protein and Amyloid-beta Detection.
32731418|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and results in progressive neurodegeneration. The incidence rate of AD is increasing, creating a major public health issue. AD is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and senile plaques composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta). Currently, a definitive diagnosis of AD is accomplished post-mortem. Thus, the use of molecular probes that are able to selectively bind to NFTs or Abeta can be valuable tools for the accurate and early diagnosis of AD. The aim of this review is to summarize and highlight fluorinated molecular probes that can be used for molecular imaging to detect either NFTs or Abeta. Specifically, fluorinated molecular probes used in conjunction with 19F MRI, PET, and fluorescence imaging will be explored.
