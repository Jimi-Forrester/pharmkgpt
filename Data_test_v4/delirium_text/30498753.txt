30498753|a|Neuroinflammation has been observed in association with neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, a positive correlation has been documented between neuroinflammatory cytokine release and the progression of the AD, which suggests these cytokines are involved in AD pathophysiology. A histological hallmark of the AD is the presence of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. Beta-amyloid is generated by the sequential cleavage of beta (beta) and gamma (gamma) sites in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretase enzymes and its accumulation can result from either a decreased Abeta clearance or increased metabolism of APP. Previous studies reported that neuroinflammatory cytokines reduce the efflux transport of Abeta, leading to elevated Abeta concentrations in the brain. However, less is known about the effects of neuroinflammatory mediators on APP expression and metabolism. In this article, we review the modulatory role of neuroinflammatory cytokines on APP expression and metabolism, including their effects on beta- and gamma-secretase enzymes.
