36684934|a|Objectives: Our previous study shows that serum ammonia in sepsis patients without hepatic failure is associated with a poor prognosis. The relationship between serum ammonia level and the prognosis of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) patients without hepatic failure remains unclear. We aimed to explore the relationship between serum ammonia levels and the prognosis of patients with SAE. Materials and methods: This study is a retrospective cohort study. We collected 465 patients with SAE admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) from 2008 to 2019. Patients with SAE were divided into a survival group (369 patients) and a non-survival group (96 patients). We used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the multivariate logistic regression analysis to analyze the relationship between serum ammonia levels and the prognosis of patients with SAE. R software was used to analyze the dataset. Results: The primary outcome was the relationship between serum ammonia level and hospital mortality of SAE. The secondary outcomes were the relationship between serum ammonia level and hospital stays, simplified acute physiology score (SAPS II), Charlson, Glasgow coma scale (GCS), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), and lactate level of SAE. The mortality of patients with SAE was 20.6%. The serum ammonia level was not significantly associated with hospital mortality, longer hospital stays, higher SAPS II and Charlson scores, and lower GCS of patients with SAE. The serum ammonia level was associated with higher SOFA scores and lactate levels in patients with SAE. The SAPS II and Charlson scores were independent risk factors for death in patients with SAE. Conclusion: Serum ammonia level was associated with higher SOFA scores and lactate levels in patients with SAE. In addition, the SAPS II and Charlson scores can be used to assess the prognosis of patients with SAE. Therefore, we should closely monitor serum ammonia, SAPS II, and Charlson levels in patients with SAE.
