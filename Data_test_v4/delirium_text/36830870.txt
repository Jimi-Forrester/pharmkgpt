36830870|t|Therapeutic Plasma Exchange in Certain Immune-Mediated Neurological Disorders: Focus on a Novel Nanomembrane-Based Technology.
36830870|a|Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is an efficient extracorporeal blood purification technique to remove circulating autoantibodies and other pathogenic substances. Its mechanism of action in immune-mediated neurological disorders includes immediate intravascular reduction of autoantibody concentration, pulsed induction of antibody redistribution, and subsequent immunomodulatory changes. Conventional TPE with 1 to 1.5 total plasma volume (TPV) exchange is a well-established treatment in Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy, Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder, Myasthenia Gravis and Multiple Sclerosis. There is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of so-called low volume plasma exchange (LVPE) (<1 TPV exchange) implemented either by the conventional or by a novel nanomembrane-based TPE in these neurological conditions, including their impact on conductivity and neuroregenerative recovery. In this narrative review, we focus on the role of nanomembrane-based technology as an alternative LVPE treatment option in these neurological conditions. Nanomembrane-based technology is a promising type of TPE, which seems to share the basic advantages of the conventional one, but probably with fewer adverse effects. It could play a valuable role in patient management by ameliorating neurological symptoms, improving disability, and reducing oxidative stress in a cost-effective way. Further research is needed to identify which patients benefit most from this novel TPE technology.
