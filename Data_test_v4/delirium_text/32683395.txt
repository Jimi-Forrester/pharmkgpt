32683395|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors that affect disability after inpatient rehabilitation (IPR) in persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI). METHODS: This retrospective study identified 140 patients aged >/=16 years who were admitted to the TBI rehabilitation unit at King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between 2015 and 2017. The collected data included demographic variables, TBI cause, coma duration, time from injury to IPR, LOS, and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores at IPR admission and discharge. RESULTS: Majority of the patients were young males. The TBI was caused by motor vehicle accidents (MVA) in 95% of patients. The mean coma duration, time from injury to IPR admission, and LOS were 47+/-38, 264+/-357, and 75+/-52 days, respectively. The factors that were found to have an association with FIM change were time from injury to IPR admission (p=0.003, r=-0.250), admission FIM score (p=0.003, r=-0.253), and discharge FIM score (p<0.001, r=0.390). Employed patients had high FIM scores at admission (p=0.029, r=0.184) and discharge (p=0.003, r=0.252). CONCLUSION: Reduction in disability at discharge was positively associated with the severity of disability at admission and negatively with the time duration from injury to IPR admission, indicating a need to reduce time before admittance to an IPR setup. The high incidence of MVA causing TBI in a young male population strongly points to a need for appropriate measures of prevention.
