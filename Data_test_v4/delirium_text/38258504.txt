38258504|t|Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and incident risk of dementia: The AMI cohort.
38258504|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic infectious diseases are increasingly being considered as potential contributors to dementia risk. Among those infections, Helicobacter pylori, the main cause of chronic gastritis worldwide, has been suggested. As the prevalence of H. pylori infection has decreased, the main objective of this work was to reconsider the association between H. pylori infection and the risk of incident dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Prospective cohort of 689 older (>=65 years) agricultural workers from Southwest France. Descriptive and comparative analyses were performed according to H. pylori status determined by serology at baseline. The risk of incident dementia according to H. pylori status over a 7-year follow-up was explored by survival analyses: Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Two-hundred (29.0%) participants were H. pylori-positive at baseline. Compared to H. pylori-negative participants, they showed worse cognitive performances at baseline. Eighty-five incident dementia cases were diagnosed during the follow-up period. After adjustment for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein epsilon4, and several cardiovascular risk factors, H. pylori remained associated with an increased risk of dementia (HR 1.70, 95% CI, 1.05-2.74). The risk was stronger for Alzheimer's disease (HR 2.85, 95% CI, 1.58-5.12). CONCLUSIONS: Despite an observed decrease in H. pylori infection prevalence, this study provides evidence for the association between H. pylori infection and dementia. These results should encourage further research on the mechanisms underlying the contribution of infectious diseases to pathological brain aging, especially the influence of gut inflammation on the brain.
