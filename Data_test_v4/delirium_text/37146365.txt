37146365|a|Aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases remain poorly understood and no disease-modifying treatments exist despite decades of investigation. Predominant in vitro (e.g., 2D cell culture, organoids) and in vivo (e.g., mouse) models of these diseases are insufficient mimics of human brain tissue structure and function and of human neurodegenerative pathobiology, and have thus contributed to this collective translational failure. This has been a longstanding challenge in the field, and new strategies are required to address both fundamental and translational needs. Bioengineered tissue culture models constitute a class of promising alternatives, as they can overcome the low cell density, poor nutrient exchange, and long term culturability limitations of existing in vitro models. Further, they can reconstruct the structural, mechanical, and biochemical cues of native brain tissue, providing a better mimic of human brain tissues for in vitro pathobiological investigation and drug development. We discuss bioengineering techniques for the generation of these neurodegenerative tissue models, including biomaterials-, organoid-, and microfluidics-based approaches, and design considerations for their construction. To aid the development of the next generation of functional neurodegenerative disease models, we discuss approaches to incorporate greater cellular diversity and simulate aging processes within bioengineered brain tissues.
