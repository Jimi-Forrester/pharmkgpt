32048098|t|Alzheimer's disease: targeting the glutamatergic system.
32048098|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that causes a progressive decline in memory, language and problem solving. For decades mechanism-based therapies have primarily focused on amyloid beta (Abeta) processing and pathways that govern neurofibrillary tangle generation. With the potential exception to Aducanumab, a monotherapy to target Abeta, clinical trials in these areas have been challenging and have failed to demonstrate efficacy. Currently, the prescribed therapies for AD are those that target the cholinesterase and glutamatergic systems that can moderately reduce cognitive decline, dependent on the individual. In the brain, over 40% of neuronal synapses are glutamatergic, where the glutamate level is tightly regulated through metabolite exchange in neuronal, astrocytic and endothelial cells. In AD brain, Abeta can interrupt effective glutamate uptake by astrocytes, which evokes a cascade of events that leads to neuronal swelling, destruction of membrane integrity and ultimately cell death. Much work has focussed on the post-synaptic response with little insight into how glutamate is regulated more broadly in the brain and the influence of anaplerotic pathways that finely tune these mechanisms. The role of blood branched chain amino acids (BCAA) in regulating neurotransmitter profiles under disease conditions also warrant discussion. Here, we review the importance of the branched chain aminotransferase proteins in regulating brain glutamate and the potential consequence of dysregulated metabolism in the context of BCAA or glutamate accumulation. We explore how the reported benefits of BCAA supplementation or restriction in improving cognitive function in other neurological diseases may have potential application in AD. Given that memantine, the glutamate receptor agonist, shows clinical relevance it is now timely to research related pathways, an understanding of which could identify novel approaches to treatment of AD.
