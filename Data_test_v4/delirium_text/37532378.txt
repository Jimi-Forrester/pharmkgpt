37532378|t|Acute Pain Management Protocols in Pediatric Intensive Care Units.
37532378|a|Pediatric pain has historically been difficult to assess and even more difficult to treat. It is encouraging that there is current research regarding pain control in pediatric patients that provide evidence for treating pediatric pain. Patients in a pediatric intensive care setting demonstrate a great deal of patient variability with regard to patient diagnosis, age, developmental level, weight, and amount of pain control needed. The use of an evidence-based protocol for pediatric pain control can decrease variability in pain control and decrease potential adverse effects such as respiratory depression, constipation, withdrawal, delirium, and developmental delays while allowing for patient variability.
