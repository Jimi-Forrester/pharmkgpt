37594509|a|The demographic change with an increase in the number of geriatric patients presents major challenges for perioperative medicine. Frailty is a multimorbidity complex that incorporates a combination of various factors, such as physical weakness, slower walking speed and unwanted weight loss. It is of great importance that these patients receive an individually adapted perioperative care. This includes, among others, a preoperative examination for frailty, a structured prehabilitation according to the concept of better in, better out, the compliance with the guidelines on prevention and timely treatment of postoperative delirium as well as the continuous maintenance of the body's homeostasis. By means of these measures the risk of complications in this patient group can be reduced and the best possible postoperative results can be achieved.
