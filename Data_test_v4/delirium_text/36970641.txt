36970641|t|The outcome of COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit in Sudan: A cross-sectional study.
36970641|a|Background and Aim: A major outbreak of coronavirus spread all over the world and gave rise to high mortality rate and high admission rate to intensive care unit (ICU). This cohort study aims to assess the outcome of COVID-19 patients in ICU and to investigate the factors associated with mortality. Method: This is a multicentered retrospective cohort study that was conducted among confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients, who were admitted to ICU in Sudan during March 2021. The data collection was done manually from the medical records of patients. Mortality rate and association and prediction of factors associated with mortality were obtained using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS) version 22. Results: The mortality rate among patients in this study was 70%. Using the chi-square test we found that age, needing intubation, developing Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, neurological complications, hematological complications, and cardiac complications have a significant association with the outcome. Conclusion: Majority of COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the ICU died. 55.8% of patients developed at least one complication during their stay in ICU. The age, the need for intubation, and developing of systematic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) are the factors that predict the mortality.
