31508118|a|This paper reports on the training of primary care physicians in the family medicine programme at the University of Gezira, Sudan, using the World Health Organization's Mental Health Gap Action Programme Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG). The training had a positive impact on their knowledge of and attitudes to mental disorder. More field tests of the mhGAP-IG would be useful to make further recommendations on its cultural relevance and its adaptation for use in low- and middle-income countries. Distance supervision of training of primary care physicians by internal facilitators is seen as critical for the sustainability of the intervention.
