3716704|t|[Clinico-psychopathologic features of manic states in old age].
3716704|a|Using a clinico-psychopathological method, the author studied some aspects of psychopathology and clinical typology of manic states characteristic of old age. The work is based on an analysis of 154 manic phases developing in 30 patients with endogenic psychoses (paroxysmal schizophrenia - 13 cases and manic-depressive psychosis - 17 cases) at the age over 50 years. Four types of manic states observed in advanced age were identified: merry or simple mania, wrathful mania, mania with expansive fantastic delirium and a senile type of mania. A certain correlation was elucidated between the identified types of manic states and some clinical characteristics associated with age.
