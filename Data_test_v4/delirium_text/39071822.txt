39071822|t|Overview of Artificial Intelligence Research Within Hip and Knee Arthroplasty.
39071822|a|Hip and knee arthroplasty are high-volume procedures undergoing rapid growth. The large volume of procedures generates a vast amount of data available for next-generation analytics. Techniques in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) can assist in large-scale pattern recognition and lead to clinical insights. AI methodologies have become more prevalent in orthopaedic research. This review will first describe an overview of AI in the medical field, followed by a description of the 3 arthroplasty research areas in which AI is commonly used (risk modeling, automated radiographic measurements, arthroplasty registry construction). Finally, we will discuss the next frontier of AI research focusing on model deployment and uncertainty quantification.
