37486507|t|Radiomics for Alzheimer's Disease: Fundamental Principles and Clinical Applications.
37486507|a|Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease with a huge impact on people's quality of life, life expectancy, and morbidity. The ongoing prevalence of the disease, in conjunction with an increased financial burden to healthcare services, necessitates the development of new technologies to be employed in this field. Hence, advanced computational methods have been developed to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis of the disease and improve all health outcomes. Artificial intelligence is now deeply involved in the fight against this disease, with many clinical applications in the field of medical imaging. Deep learning approaches have been tested for use in this domain, while radiomics, an emerging quantitative method, are already being evaluated to be used in various medical imaging modalities. This chapter aims to provide an insight into the fundamental principles behind radiomics, discuss the most common techniques alongside their strengths and weaknesses, and suggest ways forward for future research standardization and reproducibility.
