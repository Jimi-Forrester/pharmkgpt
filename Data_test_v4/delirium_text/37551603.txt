37551603|a|Multiple studies have shown that the activity of alkaline phosphatase (AP) increases during Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this paper, using UV-Visible spectroscopy, we show that this increase in activity is due to its interaction with key components of AD such as amyloid beta peptide and acetylcholinesterase. Activity increase also occurs due to high concentrations of acetylcholine and choline. These conditions are present in AD or could occur due to drugs used for treating AD.
