35391788|t|Involvement of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction on Microglia with Abnormal Sphingolipid Metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease.
35391788|a|Background: Abnormal sphingolipid metabolism is closely related to the occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). With heat-clearing and detoxifying effects, Huanglian Jiedu decoction (HLJDD) has been used to treat dementia and improve learning and memory impairments. Purpose: To study the therapeutic effect of HLJDD on AD as it relates to sphingolipid metabolism. Methods: The level of sphingolipids in the brains of APP/PS1 mice and in the supernatant of beta-amyloid (Abeta)25-35-induced BV2 microglia was detected by HPLC-QTOF-MS and HPLC-QTRAP-MS techniques, respectively. The co-expression of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) and Abeta as well as four enzymes related to sphingolipid metabolism, including serine palmitoyltransferase 2 (SPTLC2), cer synthase 2 (CERS2), sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1), and sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SGMS1), in the brains of APP/PS1 mice were evaluated by immunofluorescence double labelling. In addition, real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was conducted to determine the mRNA expression of SPTLC2, CERS2, SMPD1, SGMS1, galactosylceramidase (GALC), and sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2) in Abeta25-35-stimulated BV2 microglia. Results: Abnormal sphingolipid metabolism was observed both in APP/PS1 mouse brain tissues and Abeta25-35-stimulated BV2 cells. The levels of sphingosine, sphinganine, sphingosine-1-phosphate, sphinganine-1-phosphate and sphingomyelin were significantly reduced, while the levels of ceramide-1-phosphate, ceramide, lactosylceramide and hexosylceramide significantly increased in Abeta25-35-stimulated BV2 cells. In AD mice, more microglia were clustered in the Abeta-positive region. The decreased level of SGMS1 and increased levels of CERS2, SPTLC and SMPD1 were also found. In addition, the expressions of SPTLC2, CERS2, and SMPD1 in Abeta25-35-stimulated BV2 cells were increased significantly, while the expressions of GALC, SPHK2, and SGMS1 were decreased. These changes all showed a significant correction after HLJDD treatment. Conclusion: HLJDD is a good candidate for treating AD. This study provides a novel perspective on the potential roles of the sphingolipid metabolism in AD.
