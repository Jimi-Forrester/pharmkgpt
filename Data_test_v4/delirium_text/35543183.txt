35543183|a|This cross-sectional study assessed the experiences of family caregivers of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were recruited (n = 101) between April and December 2019. We applied a mixed-method approach. Quantitative data were analyzed using an independent samples t-test and logistic regression analysis, and qualitative experiences with modified thematic content analysis. The mean age of the family caregivers was 76 years (SD = 7), and 72% were females. Experiences of loneliness and worry during the pandemic were evaluated by self-assessment. Approximately one-third of the participants reported loneliness and worry. These experiences were further associated with female sex, increased psychological distress and depressive symptoms, and decreased physical condition and social relationships. Family caregivers were also worried about the pandemic's impact on health and well-being. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic has added an extra psychosocial load to family caregivers. The post-pandemic era requires increased attention to re-evaluating policies and services.
