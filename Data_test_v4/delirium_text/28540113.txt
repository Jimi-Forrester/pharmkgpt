28540113|t|Comparison of 3 Different Perioperative Care Models for Patients With Hip Fractures Within 1 Health Service.
28540113|a|INTRODUCTION: Orthogeriatric care models have been introduced within many health-care facilities to improve outcomes for hip fracture patients. This study aims to evaluate differences in care between 3 models, an orthopedic model, a geriatric model, and a comanaged model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted for hip fracture patients treated at Western Health between November 2012 and March 2014. All patients aged 65 years or older were included in the analysis. RESULTS: There were 183 patients in the orthopedic model, 137 in the geriatric model, and 126 in the comanaged model. Demographics and clinical characteristics were similar across the 3 models. Length of stay, mortality, and discharge destination were also consistent across the 3 groups. However, groups involving geriatricians were more likely to receive preoperative medical assessments, have greater recognition of postoperative medical problems, and have implementation of long-term osteoporosis management. CONCLUSION: The involvement of geriatricians in perioperative care models resulted in more comprehensive medical care without impacting length of stay, mortality, or discharge destination.
