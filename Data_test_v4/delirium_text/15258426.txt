15258426|a|BACKGROUND: Hip fracture is a frequent injury in the elderly, and is associated with a high incidence of functional impairment, complications and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To determine kinetics of C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in hip-fractured patients over a 1-month post-operative period; to examine the relationship of these parameters to cognition, operation type, post-operational complications, functional level 1 month post-operatively and 6-month mortality. METHODS AND SUBJECTS: 32 aged patients operated on for hip fracture were prospectively followed-up for 6 months. Fracture, type of operation and anesthetic risk were recorded. Cognition was evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination and pre-fracture functional level evaluated by the Katz Index of ADL. Follow-up included complications, mortality and functional outcome. CRP, fibrinogen and ESR were assessed during the first 10 h post-fracture; 48-60 h, and 7 and 30 days post-operatively, respectively. RESULTS: Only CRP kinetics were found to differ in patients with complications vs. those without, as a group (p = 0.006), and in patients suffering infections, delirium and cardiovascular complication vs. patients with no complications (p = 0.06, 0.03, 0.02, respectively). Mean (+/-SEM) CRP 48-60 h post-operatively was 20.9 +/- 2.1 and 13.1 +/- 1.6 mg/dl in complicated and uncomplicated patients, respectively (p = 0.002). The mean CRP 48-60 h post-operatively was highly correlated with the CRP area under the curve, R = 0.88 (p < 0.001). A cut-off level of 15 mg/dl for CRP, 48- 60 h post-operatively, was calculated for patients with complications (sensitivity 93%, specificity 65%, p = 0.003). CRP, fibrinogen and ESR were not related to fracture or type of operation, cognition, anesthetic risk, 1-month post-operative functioning and 6-month mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CRP measurement in elderly patients operated for hip fracture may be valuable in assessing and monitoring complications.
