7963616|t|Delirium after cataract extraction: a prospective study.
7963616|a|A prospective study of 350 consecutive in-patients undergoing cataract extraction revealed the incidence of postcataract extraction delirium to be 1.7%. While in one case the delirium was due to anticholinergic toxicity, in the remaining 5 cases no organic cause was evident. Sensory deprivation was present in 3 patients. In addition to organic causes sensory deprivation was found to be an important cause of postcataract extraction delirium.
