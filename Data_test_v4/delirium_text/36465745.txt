36465745|t|Rhabdomyolysis Associated With "Pruno" Prison-Made Alcohol Intake in Corrections Facility: A Case Report.
36465745|a|In this study, a case of severe rhabdomyolysis in a 28-year-old incarcerated patient is presented. The patient initially presented with emesis, abdominal pain, and myalgias to the clinic at the corrections facility and was treated with antiemetics and analgesics. The onset of symptoms occurred approximately 24 h after ingestion of an illicit substance produced by inmates. Despite intervention, the patient was eventually transferred to the hospital on the third day after symptom onset for further evaluation and treatment. The manuscript presents the events that preceded the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, as well as symptoms of hyperactive delirium that developed during the patient's hospital course, leading to the high suspicion of illicit substance intoxication as a contributing inciting factor of rhabdomyolysis. This study aimed to bring awareness to the medical community about substance use in the correction system and its consequences.
