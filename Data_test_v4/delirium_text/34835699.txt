34835699|a|Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a powerful and selective anti-cancer therapy utilizing 10B-enriched boron drugs. However, clinical advancement of BCNT is hampered by the insufficient loading of B-10 drugs throughout the solid tumor. Furthermore, the preparation of boron drugs for BNCT relies on the use of the costly B-10 enriched precursor. To overcome these challenges, polymer-coated boron carbon oxynitride (BCNO) nanoparticles, with ~30% of boron, were developed with enhanced biocompatibility, cell uptake, and tumoricidal effect via BNCT. Using the ALTS1C1 cancer cell line, the IC50 of the PEG@BCNO, bare, PEI@BCNO were determined to be 0.3 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL, and 0.05 mg/mL, respectively. As a proof-of-concept, the engineered non-10B enriched polymer-coated BCNO exhibited excellent anti-tumor effect via BNCT due to their high boron content per nanoparticle and due to the enhanced cellular internalization and retention compared to small molecular 10B-BPA drug. The astrocytoma ALTS1C1 cells treated with bare, polyethyleneimine-, and polyethylene glycol-coated BCNO exhibited an acute cell death of 24, 37, and 43%, respectively, upon 30 min of neutron irradiation compared to the negligible cell death in PBS-treated and non-irradiated cells. The radical approach proposed in this study addresses the expensive and complex issues of B-10 isotope enrichment process; thus, enabling the preparation of boron drugs at a significantly lower cost, which will facilitate the development of boron drugs for BNCT.
