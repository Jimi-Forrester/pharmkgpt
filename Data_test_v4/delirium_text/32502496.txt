32502496|a|Oxidative stress is a toxic cellular condition, strictly related to inflammation and known to be a common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases. The imbalanced redox state modifies several molecular processes including protein SUMOylation, JNK and Tau protein activation, important actors in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we showed a strong interaction among SUMO-1-JNK-Tau proteins and their molecular targets in an in vitro model (SHSY5Y cell line) of oxidative stress in which a significant reduction of cell viability and an augmented cell death was induced by increased doses of H2O2. The evoked oxidative stress led to a deficiency in the degradation system showing altered levels of Caspase-3, LC3BII/I and Ubiquitin. Curcumin, a natural compound with anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, demonstrated to tackle oxidative stress re-equilibrating SUMO-1, JNK and Tau functions. Importantly, 5 muM of curcumin induced an efficient recovery of cell viability, a reduction of cell death and a normalization of altered protein degradation marker levels. Interestingly, we found that H2O2 treatment induced a strong co-localization of SUMO-1-p-JNK-Tau proteins in nuclear bodies (NBs) and that curcumin was able to reduce these nuclear aggregates. These results highlight the SUMO-1-JNK-Tau axis key role in oxidative stress and the protective effect of curcumin against this pathological event, focusing on the importance of SUMO/deSUMOylation balance to regulate essential cellular processes.
