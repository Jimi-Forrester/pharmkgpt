37008742|a|Physical symptoms such as fatigue and muscle weakness, and psychiatric symptoms like depression and anxiety are considered as complications and sequelae of COVID-19. This epidemiological study investigated the actual status of psychiatric symptoms and disorders caused by COVID-19, from four major university hospitals and five general hospitals in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, having a population of 5 million. We conducted a survey of psychiatric disorders associated with COVID-19 using Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) data and the psychiatric records of the hospitals. In the study period from January 2019 to September 2021, 2743 COVID-19 admissions were determined from DPC data across the nine sites. These subjects had significantly more anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and were receiving higher rates of various psychotropic medications than controls influenza and respiratory infections. A review of psychiatric records revealed that the frequency of organic mental illness with insomnia and confusion was proportional to the severity of COVID-19 infection and that anxiety symptoms appeared independent of infection severity. These results indicate that COVID-19 is more likely to produce psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and insomnia than conventional infections.
