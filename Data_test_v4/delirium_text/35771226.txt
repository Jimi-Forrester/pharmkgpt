35771226|a|Sleep disorder caused by abnormal circadian rhythm is one of the main symptoms and risk factors of depression. As a known hormone regulating circadian rhythms, melatonin (MT) is also namely N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine. N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase (Asmt) is the key rate-limiting enzyme of MT synthesis and has been reportedly associated with depression. Although 50-90% of patients with depression have sleep disorders, there are no effective treatment ways in the clinic. Exercise can regulate circadian rhythm and play an important role in depression treatment. In the present study, we showed that Asmt knockout induced depression-like behaviors, which were ameliorated by swimming exercise. Moreover, swimming exercise increased serum levels of MT and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in Asmt knockout mice. In addition, the microarray data identified 10 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in KO mice compared with WT mice and 29 DEGs in KO mice after swimming exercise. Among the DEGs, the direction and magnitude of change in epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8-like 1 (Eps8l1) and phospholipase C-beta 2 (Plcb2) were confirmed by qRT-PCR partly. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis showed that these DEGs were enriched significantly in the p53 signaling pathway, long-term depression and estrogen signaling pathway. In the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, membrane palmitoylated protein 1 (Mpp1) and p53-induced death domain protein 1 (Pidd1) were hub genes to participate in the pathological mechanisms of depression and exercise intervention. These findings may provide new targets for the treatment of depression.
