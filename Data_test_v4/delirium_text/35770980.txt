35770980|a|OBJECTIVE: The effect of patient age on the outcome of Sun's procedure for acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) remains controversial. We retrospectively investigated the early outcomes of Sun's procedure in elderly patients with ATAAD in our single center. METHODS: This study involved 106 patients who underwent Sun's procedure. The patients were divided into the elderly group (>=70 years, n = 17) and younger group (<70 years). Baseline, intraoperative, and postoperative data were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The mean age in the elderly and younger groups was 75.7 and 50.7 years, respectively. The type of aortic root operations were not significantly different between the groups. Concomitant surgeries were more frequently performed in the elderly group, but without statistical significance. All intraoperative cardiopulmonary bypass variables as well as the in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates were similar between the groups. The incidences of most postoperative complications were also similar except for a higher incidence of sepsis in the elderly group. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency performance of Sun's procedure for patients with ATAAD characterized by dissection and/or entry tear in the aortic arch should not be denied on the basis of advanced age alone. Comparable early in-hospital outcomes can be achieved in elderly patients.
