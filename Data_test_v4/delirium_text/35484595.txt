35484595|a|Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) induced by perinatal asphyxia is a major cause of neurological disability among infants. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), derived from artemisinin, well known as an anti-malarial medicine, was proved to be able to inhibit oxidative stress and inflammation. However, whether those functions of DHA play roles in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD), an animal model of HIE in patient which also been observed to have oxidative stress and inflammation, is unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the DHA treatment on newborn rats significantly relieved the neuron loss and motor and cognitive impairment caused by HIBD. One of the underlying mechanisms is that DHA enhanced the anti-oxidant capacity of HIBD rats by up-regulating the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), gluathione reductase (GR) and catalase (CAT) while down regulating the pro-oxidative substances including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), total nitric oxide synthase (T-NOS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Thus, our study illustrated that DHA could alleviate the damage of brains and improve the cognitive and motor function of HIBD rats by inhibiting oxidative stress, provided an opportunity to interrogate potential therapeutics for affected HIE patients.
