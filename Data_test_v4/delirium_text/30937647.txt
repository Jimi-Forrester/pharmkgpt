30937647|t|Determining the Protein Stability of Alzheimer's Disease Protein, Amyloid Precursor Protein.
30937647|a|Determining protein thermal stability is integral in biomedical research. Here, with the use of two thermal stability assays, we show the melting temperature of amyloid precursor protein, an Alzheimer's disease related protein. The average melting temperature for amyloid precursor protein of 55.9  C was derived from differential scanning fluorometry (55.1 +- 0.3  C) and cellular thermal melt (56.7 +- 0.7  C). These experimental methods have significant application for Alzheimer's disease research including their use for amyloid precursor protein stability profiling and for the identification of additional binding partners to further elucidate novel protein functions.
