34336627|t|Anesthesia Considerations for Cataract Surgery in Patients with Schizophrenia: A Narrative Review.
34336627|a|Schizophrenia is ranked among the top 10 global burdens of disease. About 1% of people meet the diagnostic criteria for this disorder over their lifetime. Schizophrenic patients can develop cataract, particularly related to age and medications, requiring surgery and anesthesia. Many concerning factors, including cognitive function, anxiety, behavioral issues, poor cooperation and paroxysmal movements, may lead to general anesthesia as the default method. Antipsychotic agents should be continued during the perioperative period if possible. Topical/regional anesthesia is suitable in most schizophrenic patients undergoing cataract surgery. It reduces potential drug interactions and many postoperative complications; however, appropriate patient selection is paramount to its success. General anesthesia remains the primary technique for patients who are considered unsuitable for the topical/regional technique. Early involvement of a psychiatrist in the perioperative period, especially for patients requiring general anesthesia, is beneficial but often under-utilized. This narrative review summarizes the anesthetic considerations for cataract surgery in patients with schizophrenia.
