27618097|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. Amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) is identified as the core protein of neuritic plaques. Abeta is generated by the sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) via the APP cleaving enzyme (alpha-secretase, or beta-secretase) and gamma-secretase. Previous studies indicated that folate deficiency elevated Abeta deposition in APP/PS1 mice, and this rise was prevented by folic acid. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether folic acid could influence the generation of Abeta by regulating alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretase. Herein, we demonstrated that folic acid reduced the deposition of Abeta42 in APP/PS1 mice brain by decreasing the mRNA and protein expressions of beta-secretase [beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)] and gamma-secretase complex catalytic component-presenilin 1 (PS1)-in APP/PS1 mice brain. Meanwhile, folic acid increased the levels of ADAM9 and ADAM10, which are important alpha-secretases in ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family. However, folic acid has no impact on the protein expression of nicastrin (Nct), another component of gamma-secretase complex. Moreover, folic acid regulated the expression of miR-126-3p and miR-339-5p, which target ADAM9 and BACE1, respectively. Taken together, the effect of folic acid on Abeta deposition may relate to making APP metabolism through non-amyloidogenic pathway by decreasing beta-secretase and increasing alpha-secretase. MicroRNA (miRNA) may involve in the regulation mechanism of folic acid on secretase expression.
