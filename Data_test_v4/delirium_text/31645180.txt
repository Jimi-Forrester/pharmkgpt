31645180|t|Efficacy of Group Reminiscence Therapy on Cognition, Depression, Neuropsychiatric Symptoms, and Activities of Daily Living for Patients With Alzheimer Disease.
31645180|a|The current study aimed to investigate the effects of group reminiscence therapy on cognitive function, depression, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and activities of daily living in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease (AD). A single-blind randomized parallel-design controlled trial was conducted between May 1, 2017, and April 30, 2018. Ninety patients with mild-to-moderate AD recruited from Beijing Geriatric Hospital were randomly allocated into intervention (n = 45) and control groups (n = 45). In the intervention group, group-based reminiscence therapy was performed in two 30- to 45-minute sessions weekly for 12 weeks. Control participants received only conventional drug treatments and routine daily care. Alzheimer disease-related symptoms were evaluated using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive section, the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and the Barthel Index. Four time points were set for data collection: baseline (before treatment), 4 weeks (during treatment), 12 weeks (end of treatment), and 24 weeks (12 weeks posttreatment). chi2 Tests, independent t tests, repeated-measures analysis of variance, and Bonferroni tests were used for data analysis. Significant improvements in depressive and neuropsychiatric symptoms were found in the intervention group compared to the control group (P < .05). Mean CSDD scores in the intervention group were improved at all 3 time points compared to baseline and showed the greatest effect at 12 weeks (t = 2.076, P = .041) and 24 weeks follow-up (t = 3.834, P = .000) compared to controls. Group reminiscence therapy was effective for improving depressive symptoms and was beneficial for treating neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD.
