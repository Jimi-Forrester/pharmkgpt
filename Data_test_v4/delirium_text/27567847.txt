27567847|t|Validation of a Commercial Chemiluminescence Immunoassay for the Simultaneous Measurement of Three Different Amyloid-beta Peptides in Human Cerebrospinal Fluid and Application to a Clinical Cohort.
27567847|a|A comprehensive assay validation campaign of a commercially available chemiluminescence multiplex immunoassay for the simultaneous measurement of the amyloid-beta peptides Abeta38, Abeta40, and Abeta42 in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is presented. The assay quality parameters we addressed included impact of sample dilution, parallelism, lower limits of detection, lower limits of quantification, intra- and inter-assay repeatability, analytical spike recoveries, and between laboratory reproducibility of the measurements. The assay performed well in our hands and fulfilled a number of predefined acceptance criteria. The CSF levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 determined in a clinical cohort (n = 203) were statistically significantly correlated with available ELISA data of Abeta1-40 (n = 158) and Abeta1-42 (n = 179) from a different laboratory. However, Bland-Altman method comparison indicated systematic differences between the assays. The data presented here furthermore indicate that the CSF concentration of Abeta40 can surrogate total CSF Abeta and support the hypothesis that the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio outperforms CSF Abeta42 alone as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease due to a normalization to total Abeta levels.
