36923634|a|We conducted this systematic review to clarify the clinical characteristics, complications, and outcomes of surgical and non-surgical patients with fragility fracture of the pelvis (FFP). We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and MEDLINE for English language articles on FFP. We calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) or mean differences (MDs) of surgical patients in comparison to non-surgical patients for clinical characteristics (Rommens FFP classification, age, sex, dementia, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and malignancy), complications (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cardiac event, thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pressure ulcer, multiple organ failure, anemia caused by surgical bleeding, and surgical site infection), and outcomes (hospital mortality and one-year mortality). Five studies involving 1,090 patients with FFP (surgical patients, n = 432; non-surgical patients, n = 658) were included. FFP type III and IV (OR = 8.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.99 to 11.88; p<0.00001), a younger age (MD = -3.29; 95% CI -3.83 to -2.75; p<0.00001), the absence of dementia (OR = 0.36; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.57; p<0.0001), and the presence of osteoporosis (OR = 1.74; 95% CI 1.29 to 2.35; p = 0.0003) were significantly associated with the surgical patients. Urinary tract infection (OR = 2.06; 95% CI 1.37 to 3.10; p = 0.0005), anemia caused by surgical bleeding (OR = 4.55; 95% CI 1.95 to 10.62; p = 0.0005), and surgical site infection (OR = 16.74; 95% CI 3.05 to 91.87; p = 0.001) were significantly associated with the surgical patients. There were no significant differences in the outcomes between the surgical and non-surgical patients. Our findings may help to further understand the treatment strategy for FFP and improve clinical outcomes.
