31107181|a|Cystatins are the thiol Proteinase inhibitors, present ubiquitously in mammalian body. They prevent unwanted proteolysis and play important role in several diseases. Regulation of cysteine Proteinase and their inhibitors is of utmost importance in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer, amyloid angiopathy and in many other diseases. The action of these cysteine proteases is biologically controlled by proteinase inhibitors namely cystatins(cys) they constitute a superfamily of homologous proteins. The major role of cystatins is to protect the organism against endogenous proteases released from lysosomes, invading microorganisms and parasites that use cysteine proteases to enter the body. An enormous progress has been made in understanding of protein degradation process under normal and pathological conditions; in fact proteases are now clearly viewed as important drug targets. Some studies have suggested that cystatin C is a target for intervention in neurological disorders because its expression increases in response to human neurological disorders and in animal models of neurodegenerative states. Although, these studies did not clarify whether CysC up-regulation is a pathogenic factor in neurodegenerative disorders or whether it represents a neuroprotective compensatory response of the organisms aimed to prevent progression of the disease. However, for other diseases in some cases cystatins other than cys C are up regulated and in some it is down regulated.Cystatins have been implicated in the processes of neuronal degeneration and repair of the nervous system. Both CysC and CysB are potent, reversible inhibitors of most of the currently known cathepsins. The extent of proteolytic activity at any given time and location is the result of a balance between active proteases and physiological inhibitors. Uncontrolled proteolysis as a result of imbalance between active proteases and their endogenous inhibitors has been associated with neuronal cell death in different neuronal diseases, including brain tumors, stroke, some forms of epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and neurological autoimmune diseases.An antidepressant is a psychiatric medication used to alleviate mood disorders, major depression and other brain diseases. Drugs including the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are most commonly used antidepressant. They are also used to treat other conditions, such as anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and chronic pain. Although the mechanisms of the action of these antidepressants are not precisely understood, their principal target of action is at the monoamine transporter proteins located at nerve endings. Monoamine neurotransmitter transporters act to terminate synaptic neurotransmission. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs are also most widely used class of antidepressants. They work by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. SSRIs have fewer and milder side effects, fewer drug interactions, and are much less likely to be associated with suicide than TCAs.These antidepressants shows binding when incubated with cystatin, presenting the involvement of these antidepressant in cascade of disease, as leaving no cystatin to inhibit the cathepsin showing the myriad side effect after the administration of antidepressant. This might be one of the reason in the mechanism of action of antidepressant.So this review expound about the role of cystatins in neurological diseases which is considered to be highly significant as it pave the way for commanding tool in the drug design.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
