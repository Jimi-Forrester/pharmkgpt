28540646|t|The Molecular Mechanism of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Therapy in Alzheimer's Disease, Based on a Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Pathway.
28540646|a|The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an important molecule that connects aging, lifespan, energy balance, glucose and lipid metabolism, and neurodegeneration. Rapamycin exerts effects in numerous biological activities via its target protein, playing a key role in energy balance, regulation of autophagy, extension of lifespan, immunosuppression, and protection against neurodegeneration. There are many similar pathophysiological processes and molecular pathways between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and pharmacologic agents used to treat T2DM, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs, seem to be beneficial for AD. mTOR mediates the effects of GLP-1 analogs in the treatment of T2DM; hence, I hypothesize that mTOR is a key molecule for mediating the protective effects of GLP-1 for AD.
