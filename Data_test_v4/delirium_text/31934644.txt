31934644|a|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an incurable primary brain tumor containing a sub-population of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) proteins BMI1 and EZH2 are enriched in CSCs, promoting clonogenic growth and resistance to genotoxic therapies. We report here that when used at appropriate concentrations, pharmaceutical inhibitors of BMI1 could efficiently prevent GBM colony growth and CSC self-renewal in vitro and significantly extend lifespan in terminally ill tumor-bearing mice. Notably, molecular analyses revealed that the commonly used PTC596 molecule targeted both BMI1 and EZH2, possibly providing beneficial therapeutic effects in some contexts. On the other hand, treatment with PTC596 resulted in instant reactivation of EZH2 target genes and induction of a molecular program of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), possibly explaining the modified phenotype of some PTC596-treated tumors. Treatment with a related but more specific BMI1 inhibitor resulted in tumor regression and maintenance of cell identity. We conclude that inhibition of BMI1 alone is efficient at inducing GBM regression, and that dual inhibition of BMI1 and EZH2 using PTC596 may be also beneficial but only in specific contexts.
