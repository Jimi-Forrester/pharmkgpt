36211774|t|An important polysaccharide from fermentum.
36211774|a|Fermentum is a common unicellular fungus with many biological activities attributed to beta-polysaccharides. Different in vivo and in vivo experimental studies have long proven that fermentum beta-polysaccharides have antioxidant, anti-tumor, and fungal toxin adsorption properties. However, there are many uncertainties regarding the relationship between the structure and biological activity of fermentum beta-polysaccharides, and a systematic summary of fermentum beta-polysaccharides is still lacking. Herein, we reviewed the research progress about the extraction, structure and modification, structure-activity relationship, activity and application of fermentum beta-polysaccharides, compared the extraction methods of fermentum beta-polysaccharide, and paid special attention to the structure-activity relationship and application of fermentum beta-polysaccharide, which provided a strong basis for the development and application of fermentum beta-polysaccharide.
