33929084|t|The 5-HT2C receptor as a therapeutic target for alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders: A pilot study in treatment-seeking individuals.
33929084|a|Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) are prevalent and have high adverse impacts on both the individual and society. Current treatment strategies for these disorders are ineffective at a population level. Lorcaserin, a 5-HT2C receptor agonist, has shown potential at reducing the symptoms of substance use disorder. This pilot study (initiated prior to market withdrawal) examined feasibility and safety of lorcaserin treatment in people undergoing residential detoxification and treatment for AUD and MUD. This was an open label pilot study of lorcaserin where participants (n = 10 AUD; n = 8 MUD) received 10-mg lorcaserin daily for 4 days then twice daily for 1 month. Primary outcome measures included recruitment and retention rate, incidence of treatment-emergent events, incidence of methamphetamine or alcohol withdrawal-related events, heart rate, and blood pressure. Secondary measures included pharmacokinetic data and self-reported alcohol or methamphetamine use, craving, and psychological distress. AUD participants were recruited faster and had a greater retention rate compared with MUD participants. Lorcaserin did not alter vital signs, was well tolerated, and had a similar pharmacokinetic profile to individuals with obesity. Lorcaserin reduced self-reported alcohol and amphetamine-type substance use and craving in AUD and MUD participants, respectively. Self-reported psychological health also improved over the treatment period for all participants. Despite the pilot nature of this study, our data support the notion of 5-HT2C receptors as a therapeutic target for drug and alcohol abuse.
