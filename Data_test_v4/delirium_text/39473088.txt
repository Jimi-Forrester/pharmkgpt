39473088|t|Image-Based Generative Artificial Intelligence in Radiology: Comprehensive Updates.
39473088|a|Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to images for image quality enhancement, domain transfer, and augmentation of training data for AI modeling in various medical fields. Image-generative AI can produce large amounts of unannotated imaging data, which facilitates multiple downstream deep-learning tasks. However, their evaluation methods and clinical utility have not been thoroughly reviewed. This article summarizes commonly used generative adversarial networks and diffusion models. In addition, it summarizes their utility in clinical tasks in the field of radiology, such as direct image utilization, lesion detection, segmentation, and diagnosis. This article aims to guide readers regarding radiology practice and research using image-generative AI by 1) reviewing basic theories of image-generative AI, 2) discussing the methods used to evaluate the generated images, 3) outlining the clinical and research utility of generated images, and 4) discussing the issue of hallucinations.
