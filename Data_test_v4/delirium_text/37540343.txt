METHODS: Retrospective, longitudinal, and descriptive design. We collected data from patients with dementia due to AD who visited the outpatient clinic of the SARAH Network of Rehabilitation Hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between May 2009 and June 2019. The evaluated characteristics included age of onset, sex, education, family history, comorbidities, time until diagnosis, and survival rates. RESULTS: Overall, 1434 patients were evaluated, 74% of whom were women, with a mean age at symptom onset of 72.7 years and 75.8 at diagnosis. A positive family history was reported in 602 patients, with a first-degree relative in 86.3% of them. Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity, affecting 61.2% of the sample, and 16.2% were classified as having early-onset AD. The mean survival rate for the sample population was 112.8 months (9.4 years). The sample population was positively affected by dyslipidaemia. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a clinical and epidemiological analysis of a large and diverse group of patients with AD. The study confirms previous observations such as a higher prevalence of AD in women, low education among sufferers, and the presence of a family history. The study also found that comorbidities significantly affected patient survival and provides new data on the survival rates of patients with early and late AD in the Brazilian population.
