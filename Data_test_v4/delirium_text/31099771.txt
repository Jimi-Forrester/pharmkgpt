31099771|a|Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are important factors of protein homeostasis and possess chaperone properties, providing for a folding and intracellular transport of proteins and facilitating the recovery or utilization of proteins partly denatured on exposure to various stress factors. Proteins of the Hsp70 family are the most universal molecular chaperones and interact with the greatest number of protein substrates. Several proteins of the Hsp70 family are released into the extracellular space, where they play an important role in intercellular communications and act as alarmins, or "danger signals," to modulate the immune response. The secreted Hsp70 can additionally act as an effective neuroprotector, increasing the survival of neurons in various proteinopathies, as has been demonstrated in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease models. In this regard, recombinant Hsp70 and inducers of endogenous Hsp70 synthesis may be considered as candidate therapeutics with immune-modulating and neuroprotective properties.Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are important factors of protein homeostasis and possess chaperone properties, providing for a folding and intracellular transport of proteins and facilitating the recovery or utilization of proteins partly denatured on exposure to various stress factors.
