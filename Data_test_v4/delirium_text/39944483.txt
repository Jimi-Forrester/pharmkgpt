39944483|a|Gastric cancer, as one of the malignant tumors with a significant disease burden globally, emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and personalized treatment for improving patient prognosis. In recent years, clinical prediction models (CPMs) have played a crucial role in predicting disease risks, assisting medical decision-making, and evaluating clinical prognosis and benefits as tools for risk-benefit assessment. Nomograms, as an important visualization form of clinical prediction models, have been increasingly applied in tumor-related research. Numerous studies have constructed multiple nomogram models by integrating clinical, pathological, laboratory, imaging data, and genetic characteristics, providing an accurate and effective tool for predicting the risk of gastric cancer, early diagnosis, treatment response assessment, and prognosis analysis. This article aims to review the current clinical applications and research progress of nomograms in gastric cancer, with the goal of providing robust references and theoretical support for clinical practice.
