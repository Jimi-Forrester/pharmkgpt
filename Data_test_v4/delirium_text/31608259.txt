31608259|a|Sweet pepper is a non-pungent chili of the Capsicum annuum species and is an important ingredient in daily diets due to its characteristics such as pungency, aromas, and flavors. Sweet pepper is a rich source of bioactive compounds such as phenols, carotenoids, and flavonoids, which can promote potential health benefits against various non-communicable diseases. However, research focused on anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) properties of sweet peppers is limited. Thus, this study aimed investigate bioactive compounds (flavonoids, phenolic acids, and carotenoids), antioxidant activity and anti-AD properties of four colored sweet peppers (green, red, orange, and yellow) via their abilities to inhibit key enzymes relevant to AD [acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and beta-secretase (BACE1)]. Extraction solvents [hexane, ethyl acetate, and 70% (v/v) aqueous ethanol] were also investigated. Results suggested that yellow sweet pepper have the highest content of flavonoids, while green sweet pepper have the highest contents of phenolic acids and red sweet peppers have the highest content of carotenoids. In terms of anti-AD properties, green sweet peppers exhibited the highest antioxidant, anti-BChE, and anti-BACE1 activities; however, yellow sweet pepper extract exhibited the highest amounts of AChE inhibition. Bioactive compounds in sweet red peppers may therefore have anti-AD properties, and may be useful for AD prevention.
