35459762|t|Surgical Apgar Score and Controlling Nutritional Status Score are significant predictors of major complications after cervical spine surgery.
35459762|a|Nutritional screening scores, including Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) Score and Surgical Apgar Score (SAS), which reflect intraoperative hemodynamics, have been reported to be useful for predicting major postoperative complications in various kinds of surgery. We assessed independent risk factors for major complications after cervical spine surgery using those scoring measurements. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients who underwent cervical spine surgery at our institution from 2014 to 2019. Baseline clinical information, including the CONUT Score, and surgical factors, including the SAS, were assessed as risk factors for major postoperative complications. We analyzed 261 patients. Major postoperative complications occurred in 40 cases (15.3%). In the multivariate analysis, SAS (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; P < 0.01), CONUT (OR, 1.39; P < 0.01), and operative time (OR, 1.42; P < 0.01) were significant independent risk factors of major complications. The area under the SAS curve was 0.852 in the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Postoperative hospitalization duration was significantly longer in major complications group. Evaluating preoperative nutritional condition and intraoperative hemodynamics with CONUT score and SAS was useful for predicting major postoperative complications of cervical spine surgery. In addition, both scoring measurements are easily calculated, objective evaluations. Perioperative management utilizing those scoring measurements may help prevent them.
