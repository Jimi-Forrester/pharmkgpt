37577158|t|The Topics and Publication Trends in Emergence Deliri-Um: A Bibliometric Analysis from 2002 to 2022.
37577158|a|Background: Emergence delirium is an early postoperative behavior change in pediatric patients, posing risks to patient safety and leading to prolonged hospital stays and increased medical costs. As a result, the research on emergence delirium has grown substantially. This study aims to identify the most influential literature, trends, and topics in emergence delirium research, as well as to quantify the fundamental data of academic publications on this topic. Methods: We searched for articles on emergence delirium in the Science Citation Index Expanded databases, covering the period from 2002 to 2022. Bibliographic information, including countries, institutions, journals, authorships, references, and keywords, was collected for further analysis. Results: A total of 739 articles on emergence delirium published between 2002 and 2022 were collected. China emerged as the most prolific publisher in this field, accounting for over 30% of all articles (226 publications), followed by the United States (n = 143) and South Korea (n = 92). The top three productive journals were Pediatric anesthesia (n=78, IF=2.129), Anesthesia and Analgesia (n=28, IF=6.627), and BMC Anesthesiology (n=28, IF=2.583). Yonsei University was the most active institution, with 22 publications related to emergence delirium. Among authors, Kin, Hee-Soo (n = 9) published the most articles in this field, followed by Yao, Yusheng (n = 7), Lee, Ji-Hyun (n = 7). The prominent topics in emergence delirium research during the past two decades were "children", "emergence delirium" and "propofol". Conclusion: Through bibliometric analysis, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the trends and developments in the field of emergence delirium over the past two decades. The results demonstrate a significant growth in emergence delirium research worldwide, with China leading in the number of publications. Despite the wealth of literature on strategies for preventing and managing emergence delirium in clinical settings, further basic research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of emergence delirium.
