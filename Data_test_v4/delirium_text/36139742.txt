36139742|t|The Role Played by Ferroptosis in Osteoarthritis: Evidence Based on Iron Dyshomeostasis and Lipid Peroxidation.
36139742|a|Ferroptosis, a recently discovered regulated cell death modality, is characterised by iron-dependent accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides, which can reach lethal levels but can be specifically reversed by ferroptosis inhibitors. Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common degenerative joint disease, is characterised by a complex pathogenesis involving mechanical overload, increased inflammatory mediator levels, metabolic alterations, and cell senescence and death. Since iron accumulation and oxidative stress are the universal pathological features of OA, the role played by ferroptosis in OA has been extensively explored. Increasing evidence has shown that iron dyshomeostasis and lipid peroxidation are closely associated with OA pathogenesis. Therefore, in this review, we summarize recent evidence by focusing on ferroptotic mechanisms and the role played by ferroptosis in OA pathogenesis from the perspectives of clinical findings, animal models, and cell research. By summarizing recent research advances that characterize the relationship between ferroptosis and OA, we highlight avenues for further research and potential therapeutic targets.
