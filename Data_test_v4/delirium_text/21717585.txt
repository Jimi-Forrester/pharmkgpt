21717585|a|One of the main neuropathological lesions observed in brain autopsy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is the extracellular senile plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. Recently, treatment strategies have focused on modifying the formation, clearance, and accumulation of this potentially neurotoxic peptide. beta- and gamma-secretase are responsible for the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the generation of Abeta peptide. Treatments targeting these two critical secretases may therefore reduce Abeta peptide levels and positive impact on AD. Vaccination is also an advanced approach against Abeta. This review focuses on recent advances of our understanding of this key peptide, with emphasis on Abeta peptide synthesis, accumulation and neurotoxicity, and current therapies including vaccination and two critical secretase inhibitors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of conserved endogenous small noncoding RNAs, known to regulate the expression of complementary messenger RNAs, involved in AD development. We therefore address the relationship of miRNAs in the brain and Abeta generation, as a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of AD while also providing new insights on the etiology of this neurological disorder.
