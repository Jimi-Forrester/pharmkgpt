28540116|t|Using Care Bundles to Improve Surgical Outcomes and Reduce Variation in Care for Fragility Hip Fracture Patients.
28540116|a|INTRODUCTION: Fragility hip fractures constitute a large proportion of orthogeriatric admissions to orthopedic wards. This study looked at reducing variation in care in fragility hip fracture patients using a novel approach with care bundles. The care bundle comprises 5 elements targeted at providing adequate analgesia, early mobilization, improving recognition of delirium, and decreasing rates of urinary infections. METHODS: A total of 198 patients who sustained a fragility hip fracture during the intervention period were included in the study. The primary outcome measure was compliance in applying the bundle to the study population, and secondary outcome measures were in-hospital mortality, acute length of stay, delirium and duration of delirium, and urinary tract infections. RESULTS: During the 12-month intervention period, compliance to the bundle of care was 47% (n = 92) based on the "all-or-none" approach. This was 28% higher than the preintervention rate. Overall, there was an increased rate of compliance across all individual elements of the bundle in the intervention group when compared to the preintervention group (P = .01). The most significant clinical result was a 10.5% reduction in "in-hospital mortality" in the intervention group (P < .001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the implementation of specific care bundle in patients with fragility hip fracture significantly reduces variation in care.
