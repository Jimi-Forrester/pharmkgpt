37893101|t|Are Ischemic Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease Genetically Consecutive Pathologies?
37893101|a|Complex diseases that affect the functioning of the central nervous system pose a major problem for modern society. Among these, ischemic stroke (IS) holds a special place as one of the most common causes of disability and mortality worldwide. Furthermore, Alzheimer's disease (AD) ranks first among neurodegenerative diseases, drastically reducing brain activity and overall life quality and duration. Recent studies have shown that AD and IS share several common risk and pathogenic factors, such as an overlapping genomic architecture and molecular signature. In this review, we will summarize the genomics and RNA biology studies of IS and AD, discussing the interconnected nature of these pathologies. Additionally, we highlight specific genomic points and RNA molecules that can serve as potential tools in predicting the risks of diseases and developing effective therapies in the future.
