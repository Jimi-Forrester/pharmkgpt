37542650|a|Neuroinflammation and synaptic damage are important etiologies associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Linderae Radix (LR) has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study investigated whether LR attenuates microglia activation-mediated neuroinflammation and synaptic degeneration and improves AD pathological phenotypes induced by amyloid beta oligomers (AbetaO) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) toxicity. For in vitro studies, we treated LR to AbetaO-stimulated HT22 cells or LR LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. For in vivo studies, we administered LR to mice and AbetaO was injected by stereotaxic to induce cognitive impairment, neuroinflammation, and synaptic loss. We found that LR increased the cell viability reduced by AbetaO. Moreover, LR inhibited pro-inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and downregulated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in BV2 cells. Behavioral assessments demonstrated that LR administration significantly improved cognitive decline induced by AbetaO-injection. Furthermore, we found that microglia activation increased, and the expression of synaptic proteins decreased in the hippocampus of the AbetaO-injected group, which was alleviated in the LR-treated group. These findings suggest that LR may be a potential candidate for protection against neuroinflammation and synaptic loss, and may prevent or delay AD progression.
