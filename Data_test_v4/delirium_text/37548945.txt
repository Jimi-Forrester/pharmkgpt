37548945|t|Autophagy in Neuroinflammation: A Focus on Epigenetic Regulation.
37548945|a|Neuroinflammation, characterized by the secretion of abundant inflammatory mediators, proinflammatory polarization of microglia, and the recruitment of infiltrating myeloid cells to foci of inflammation, drives or exacerbates the pathological processes of central nervous system disorders, especially in neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy plays an essential role in neuroinflammatory processes, and the underlaying physiological mechanisms are closely correlated with neuroinflammation-related signals. Inhibition of mTOR and activation of AMPK and FOXO1 enhance autophagy and thereby suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activity and apoptosis, leading to the relief of neuroinflammatory response. And autophagy mitigates neuroinflammation mainly manifested by promoting the polarization of microglia from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state, reducing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, and up-regulating the levels of anti-inflammatory factors. Notably, epigenetic modifications are intimately associated with autophagy and the onset and progression of various brain diseases. Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, circular RNAs and long noncoding RNAs, and histone acetylation have been reported to adjust autophagy-related gene and protein expression to alleviate inflammation in neurological diseases. The present review primarily focuses on the role and mechanisms of autophagy in neuroinflammatory responses, as well as epigenetic modifications of autophagy in neuroinflammation to reveal potential therapeutic targets in central nervous system diseases.
