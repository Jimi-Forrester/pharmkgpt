29071699|a|AIM: Cognitive impairment is underdiagnosed in the elderly. We aimed to study the rate of positive responses to an informant-based questionnaires and functional disability after hospital discharge. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Observational prospective case series of patients aged 70-85 years-old admitted for hospitalization in an Internal Medicine ward. All medical records were reviewed and those patients with no previous diagnosis of dementia or related neurological conditions, no previous recent hospitalization or not having a caregiver were evaluated after signing an informed consent. A medical interview including the Alzheimer's Disease 8 (AD8), the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) and Barthel Index was completed. Barthel Index was obtained three months after discharge. RESULTS: During a 3-month period a total of 809 admissions were screened and 79 (9.7%) fulfilled the study criteria. Patient's mean age was 80 years-old. Common comorbidities were arterial hypertension (83.5%), major surgery (54.4%) and heart disorders (50.6%). The most frequent cause of admission was infectious disease (37.9%). Test positivity for cognitive impairment was 30.3% for IQCODE and 34.1% for AD8. At admission 37.9% of the patients were functionally independent. At three months this percentage dropped to 24%. CONCLUSIONS: In this small sample size, almost a third of older patients, without major comorbidities or neurological disorders, admitted to a general hospital showed an informant-based suggestion of cognitive impairment previously undiagnosed. Functional impairment affects almost a quarter of these patients three months after admission.
