37153931|t|Applications of Nanomaterials in Dentistry: A Review.
37153931|a|Aim and Objective: Currently, the major priority in the field of nanotechnology or nanoscience is research and development at the atomic- or molecular-level sciences. Almost every aspects of human health, including pharmaceutical, clinical research and analysis, and supplemental immunological systems, are significantly impacted by it. Diverse dental applications to the realm of nanotechnology, which also reflect developments in material sciences, have given rise to the field of nanodentistry and nanocatalytic drug development, especially in oral nanozyme research and application. This review is aimed to provide readers an in-depth analysis of nanotechnology's characteristics, varied qualities, and applications toward dentistry. Materials and Methods: A query was carried out in PubMed and Google Scholar databases for the articles published from 2007 to 2022 using the keywords/MESH term nanomaterials, dentistry, nanoenzymes, metals, and antibacterial activity. Data extraction and evidence synthesis have been performed by three researchers individually. Results: A total of 901 articles have been extracted, out of which 108 have been removed due to repetitions and overlapping. After further screening following exclusion and inclusion criteria, 74 papers were considered to be pertinent and that primarily addressed dental nanotechnology were chosen. Further, the data havebeen extracted and interpreted for the review. The results of the review indicated that the development of multifunctional nanozymes has been continuously assessed in relation to oro-dental illnesses to show the significant impact that nanozymes have on oral health. Conclusion: As evidenced by the obtained results, with the advent of ongoing breakthroughs in nanotechnology, dental care could be improved with advanced preventive measures.
