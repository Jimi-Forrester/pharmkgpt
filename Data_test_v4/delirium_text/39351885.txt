39351885|a|INTRODUCTION: Understanding the impact of biomarker-based dementia risk estimation in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and their care partners is critical for patient care. METHODS: MCI patients and study partners were counseled on Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker and dementia risk was disclosed. Data on mood, quality of life (QoL), and satisfaction with life (SwL) were obtained 1 week and 3 months after disclosure. RESULTS: Seventy-six dyads were enrolled, and two-thirds of the patients opted for biomarker testing. None of the participants experienced clinically relevant depression or anxiety after disclosure. All dyads reported moderate to high QoL and SwL throughout the study. Patients reported more subthreshold depressive symptoms 1 week and lower QoL and SwL 3 months after disclosure. In patients, depression (odds ratio [OR]: 0.76) and anxiety (OR: 0.81) were significant predictors for the decision against biomarker testing. DISCUSSION: No major psychological harm is to be expected in MCI patients and care partners after dementia risk disclosure. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered in the German clinical trials register (Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien, DRKS): http://www.drks.de/DRKS00011155, DRKS registration number: DRKS00011155, date of registration: 18.08.2017. HIGHLIGHTS: Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and study partners were counseled on Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker-based dementia risk estimation. About two-thirds of patients opted for biomarker testing and received their dementia risk based on their AD biomarker status. Patients who decided in favor or against CSF biomarker testing differed in psychological features. We did not observe major psychological harm after the dementia risk disclosure. Coping strategies were associated with better subsequent mood and well-being in all participants.
