AIM: This study aimed to assess stress, anxiety, depression, and resilience among cancer patients undergoing treatment with radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive cancer patients taking radiotherapy treatment from a tertiary care hospital were included in the study with their written informed consent. Subjects suffering from comorbid medical or psychiatric disorders were excluded from the study. Demographic and clinical details of the patients were recorded on a specially prepared pro forma. Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and Abbreviated Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale were administered. Scoring of the scales was carried out as per the test manual. The data were tabulated and analyzed using the SPSS software. RESULTS: The study sample included 100 patients (38 male and 62 females) with a confirmed diagnosis of cancer receiving radiotherapy. Based on the scores obtained on the DASS, depression was present in 24 patients, anxiety was significantly high in 25 patients, while stress was significantly high in five patients. Male patients undergoing radiotherapy had significantly higher scores on resilience and significantly lower scores on depression anxiety and stress compared to female patients. In patients undergoing radiotherapy, stress, anxiety, and depression were significantly negatively correlated while resilience. Anxiety, gender, and resilience were found to be significant predictors of depression based on multiple regression analysis. CONCLUSION: Cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy suffer from depression, anxiety, and stress which are negatively correlated with resilience. Resilience is significantly higher in males, while anxiety, depression, and stress are significantly higher in females. In addition to therapy aimed at reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, psychiatric management should also aim to increase the resilience of these patients.
