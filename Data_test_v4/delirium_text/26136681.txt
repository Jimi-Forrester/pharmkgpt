26136681|a|Although the causal role of Amyloid-beta (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear, it is still reasonable to expect that lowering concentrations of Abeta in the brain may decrease the risk of developing the neurocognitive symptoms of the disease. Brain capillary endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) express transporters regulating the efflux of Abeta out of the cerebral tissue. Age-related BBB dysfunctions, that have been identified in AD patients, might impair Abeta clearance from the brain. Thus, targeting BBB outward transport systems has been suggested as a way to stimulate the clearance of Abeta from the brain. Recent data indicate that the increase in soluble brain Abeta and behavioral impairments in 3xTg-AD mice generated by months of intake of a high-fat diet can be acutely reversed by the administration of a single dose of insulin. A concomitant increase in plasma Abeta suggests that clearance from the brain through the BBB is a likely mechanism for this rapid effect of insulin. Here, we review how BBB insulin response pathways could be stimulated to decrease brain Abeta concentrations and improve cognitive performance, at least on the short term.
