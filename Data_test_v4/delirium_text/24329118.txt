24329118|a|Synthetic tryptamines have gained popularity for their hallucinogenic properties, unscheduled status, and availability from "head shops" and through the internet. Here, we present a case of synthetic tryptamine-induced delirium secondary to 5-MeO-DALT ingestion in a previously healthy young male. 5-MeO-DALT led to the hospitalization of our patient after ingestion of a standard dose, presenting with extreme agitation, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and combativeness leading to physical restraint and intravenous sedation. A search of PubMed, Ovid, and Google Scholar for keywords of "5-MeO-DALT," "5-methoxy-N,N-diallyltryptamine," or "Lucy-N-Nate" found no case reports or clinical articles in the literature. Rapid emergence and commercialization of this novel synthetic tryptamine 5-MeO-DALT points to the importance of health care and forensic professionals keeping abreast of the latest drugs of abuse and their clinical features. The authors hope this report leads the way in disseminating the potential risks associated with unscheduled and unregulated substances, synthetic tryptamines such as 5-MeO-DALT in particular.
