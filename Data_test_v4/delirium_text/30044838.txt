30044838|a|Birth asphyxia resulting in brain hypoxia-ischemia (H-I) can cause neonatal death or lead to persistent brain damage. Recent investigations have shown that group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2/3) activation can provide neuroprotection against H-I but the mechanism of this effect is not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether mGluR2/3 agonists applied a short time after H-I reduce brain damage in an experimental model of birth asphyxia, and whether a decrease in oxidative stress plays a role in neuroprotection. Neonatal H-I in 7-day-old rats was used as an experimental model of birth asphyxia. Rats were injected intra peritoneally with mGluR2 (LY 379268) or mGluR3 (NAAG) agonists 1 h or 6 h after H-I (5 mg/kg). The weight deficit of the ischemic brain hemisphere, radical oxygen species (ROS) content levels, antioxidant enzymes activity and the concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured. Both agonists reduced weight loss in the ischemic hemisphere and mitigated neuronal degeneration in the CA1 hippocampal region and cerebral cortex. Both agonists reduced the elevated levels of ROS in the ipsilateral hemisphere observed after H-I and prevented an increase in antioxidant enzymes activity in the injured hemisphere restoring them to control levels. A decrease in GSH level was also restored after agonists application. The results show that the activation of mGluR2 and mGluR3 a short time after H-I triggers neuroprotective mechanisms that act through the inhibition of oxidative stress and ROS production. The prevention of ROS production by the inhibition of glutamate release and decrease in its extracellular concentration is likely the main mechanism involved in the observed neuroprotection.
