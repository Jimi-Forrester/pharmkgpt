22978824|a|A novel series of benzylideneindanone derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as multitarget-directed ligands against Alzheimer's disease. The in vitro studies showed that most of the molecules exhibited a significant ability to inhibit self-induced beta-amyloid (Abeta(1-42)) aggregation (10.5-80.1%, 20 muM) and MAO-B activity (IC(50) of 7.5-40.5 muM), to act as potential antioxidants (ORAC-FL value of 2.75-9.37), and to function as metal chelators. In particular, compound 41 had the greatest ability to inhibit Abeta(1-42) aggregation (80.1%), and MAO-B (IC(50) = 7.5 muM) was also an excellent antioxidant and metal chelator. Moreover, it is capable of inhibiting Cu(II)-induced Abeta(1-42) aggregation and disassembling the well-structured Abeta fibrils. These results indicated that compound 41 is an excellent multifunctional agent for the treatment of AD.
