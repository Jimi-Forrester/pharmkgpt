31753458|t|Association of oral health-related quality of life and Alzheimer disease: A systematic review.
31753458|a|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) is a subjective measure that assesses a person's perception of oral health. Patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) suffer from impaired cognitive function and a compromised ability to perform activities of daily living. Further exploration is needed to clarify whether OHRQoL is negatively impacted by cognitive degeneration and oral health conditions among patients with AD. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to increase understanding of OHRQoL among patients with AD and explore factors that may affect OHRQoL. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Searches were conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Library database, Medline, EBSCO, ProQuest, and EMBASE until August 30, 2018, with no date restrictions. The initial search targeted quantitative observational studies published in English that included the keywords AD, oral, prosthesis, and OHRQoL. Data extraction was independently conducted by 2 reviewers. OHRQoL was investigated as the outcome. Cognitive status and oral health conditions were treated as exposures. Tools used to measure OHRQoL included the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) and the Oral Health Impact Profile. The research adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. RESULTS: Six studies were included. The sample sizes ranged from 30 to 226 participants, 5 studies used cross-sectional designs, and 1 was a nonrandomized controlled trial. Three studies reported higher OHRQoL scores among participants with AD than those among controls, but only 1 study showed a statistically significant difference. A statistical analysis was conducted with 4 studies that reported GOHAI scores, and no significant differences were found in GOHAI scores between participants with AD and controls (standard mean difference: 0.09; 95% confidence interval: -0.66 to 0.85). All studies that explored factors affecting OHRQoL showed different associations between cognitive impairment, oral health conditions, and OHRQoL. One study showed that cognitive impairment was negatively associated with OHRQoL. Three studies found oral health conditions (including periodontitis, gingival bleeding, probing depth >4 mm, and number of natural teeth) impaired the OHRQoL of participants with AD. Three studies reported that prosthetic type and quality positively affected OHRQoL among participants with AD. CONCLUSIONS: OHRQoL may not fully represent actual oral health problems of patients with AD. Clinical dentists should evaluate oral problems in this population, preferably by using both subjective and objective examinations, including oral and dental conditions. This will ensure oral problems among patients with AD can be detected early and timely treatment provided.
