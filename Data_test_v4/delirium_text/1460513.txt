1460513|a|We evaluated the efficacy of murine monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) targeted to beta/A4 amyloid for development of procedures for the in vivo identification of amyloid angiopathy (AA) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mabs to beta/A4 amyloid were prepared and screened for effectiveness in visualizing AA and senile plaques in postmortem AD brain sections. They were assessed again after enzymatic cleavage to produce Fab fragments and after labeling with 99mTc using a diamide dimercaptide ligand system. Modified and radiolabeled Fab fragments retained activity and specificity towards amyloid-laden blood vessels and senile plaques. A highly specific murine Mab, 10H3, was identified and characterized that fulfills criteria necessary for the development of a diagnostic imaging agent. Expansion and adaptation of these strategies may provide the methods and materials for the noninvasive analysis of AA in living patients, and permit assessment of the contribution of AA to the clinical and pathological features of AD.
