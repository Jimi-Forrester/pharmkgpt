30311654|t|Whole brain imaging reveals distinct spatial patterns of amyloid beta deposition in three mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
30311654|a|A variety of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models overexpress mutant forms of human amyloid precursor protein (APP), producing high levels of amyloid beta (Abeta) and forming plaques. However, the degree to which these models mimic spatiotemporal patterns of Abeta deposition in brains of AD patients is unknown. Here, we mapped the spatial distribution of Abeta plaques across age in three APP-overexpression mouse lines (APP/PS1, Tg2576, and hAPP-J20) using in vivo labeling with methoxy-X04, high throughput whole brain imaging, and an automated informatics pipeline. Images were acquired with high resolution serial two-photon tomography and labeled plaques were detected using custom-built segmentation algorithms. Image series were registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework, a 3D reference atlas, enabling automated brain-wide quantification of plaque density, number, and location. In both APP/PS1 and Tg2576 mice, plaques were identified first in isocortex, followed by olfactory, hippocampal, and cortical subplate areas. In hAPP-J20 mice, plaque density was highest in hippocampal areas, followed by isocortex, with little to no involvement of olfactory or cortical subplate areas. Within the major brain divisions, distinct regions were identified with high (or low) plaque accumulation; for example, the lateral visual area within the isocortex of APP/PS1 mice had relatively higher plaque density compared with other cortical areas, while in hAPP-J20 mice, plaques were densest in the ventral retrosplenial cortex. In summary, we show how whole brain imaging of amyloid pathology in mice reveals the extent to which a given model recapitulates the regional Abeta deposition patterns described in AD.
