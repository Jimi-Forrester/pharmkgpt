36294756|t|Factors Influencing Personalized Management of Vestibular Schwannoma: A Systematic Review.
36294756|a|Management of vestibular schwannoma (VS) is a complex process aimed at identifying a clinical indication for fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (sRT) or microsurgical resection or wait and scan (WS). The aim of the review was to clarify which patient and tumor parameters may lead to different therapeutic choices, with a view to a personalized VS approach. A systematic review according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis criteria was conducted between February and March 2022. The authors defined six parameters that seemed to influence decision-making in VS management: 1-incidental VS; 2-tumor size; 3-tumor regrowth after sRT; 4-subtotal resection; 5-patients' age; 6-symptoms. The initial search yielded 3532 articles, and finally, 812 articles were included. Through a qualitative synthesis of the included studies, management strategies were evaluated and discussed. An individualized proposal of procedures is preferable as compared to a single gold-standard approach in VS decision-making. The most significant factors that need to be considered when dealing with a VS diagnosis are age, tumor size and hearing preservation issues.
