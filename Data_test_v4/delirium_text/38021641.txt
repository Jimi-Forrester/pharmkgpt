38021641|t|Challenges in the Clinical Diagnosis of Lithium Toxicity: A Case Report.
38021641|a|Lithium, a medication commonly used to treat bipolar disorders, has a narrow therapeutic index, putting patients at risk of lithium toxicity. Such toxicity could entail neurological-related complications and could be precipitated by several factors. In this paper, the authors discuss a case of a middle-aged woman taking lithium for bipolar disorder who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, tremors, generalized weakness, and dysarthria. Multiple differential diagnoses were considered during her hospitalization, which included an admission to the intensive care unit. This case highlights the variability of lithium toxicity presentations and its management challenges. Further research is needed to understand such manifestations, potential precipitating factors, differential diagnoses, and effective detection and management.
