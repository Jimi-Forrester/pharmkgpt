35761918|a|There is limited literature on electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with a severe schizophrenia spectrum illness and concomitant seizure disorder. In addition, it is unclear whether it is safe to perform ECT in a patient with these comorbidities and a history of status epilepticus. This is the case of a 48-year-old patient with a history of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, refractory psychosis on clozapine and ECT, and seizure disorder on carbamazepine. She presented to the emergency department with suspected post-ECT delirium four days after her last ECT treatment, was found to be in non-convulsive status epilepticus, and was admitted to the neuroscience intensive care unit. Coma induction was required for seizure control. As she stabilized, her psychosis worsened, and she required psychiatric hospitalization. Multiple factors may have contributed to the development of status epilepticus in this patient. She was on clozapine, which has a time- and dose-dependent risk of seizure that prescribers should be wary of. She had also been prescribed the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine, which induces clozapine and itself, decreasing their effectiveness. Upon the patient's discharge, ECT was suspended indefinitely due to concern that it may have led to status epilepticus. However, case reports suggest that intractable seizures following ECT are rare. We found no reports of status epilepticus occurring more than 60 minutes after the completion of ECT. If the benefits of ECT are significant, then it should remain a treatment option for the patient.
