32606422|a|We conducted a cross-trait meta-analysis of genome-wide association study on schizophrenia (SCZ) (n = 65,967), bipolar disorder (BD) (n = 41,653), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (n = 46,350), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (n = 55,374), and depression (DEP) (n = 688,809). After the meta-analysis, the number of genomic loci increased from 14 to 19 in ADHD, from 3 to 10 in ASD, from 45 to 57 in DEP, from 8 to 54 in BD, and from 64 to 87 in SCZ. We observed significant enrichment of overlapping genes among different disorders and identified a panel of cross-disorder genes. A total of seven genes were found being commonly associated with four out of five psychiatric conditions, namely GABBR1, GLT8D1, HIST1H1B, HIST1H2BN, HIST1H4L, KCNB1, and DCC. The SORCS3 gene was highlighted due to the fact that it was involved in all the five conditions of study. Analysis of correlations unveiled the existence of two clusters of related psychiatric conditions, SCZ and BD that were separate from the other three traits, and formed another group. Our results may provide a new insight for genetic basis of the five psychiatric disorders.
