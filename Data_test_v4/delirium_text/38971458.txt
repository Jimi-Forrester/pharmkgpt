38971458|a|The translocator protein (TSPO) has been widely investigated as a PET-imaging biomarker of neuroinflammation and, more recently, as a therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease. TSPO ligands have been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in vivo and in vitro models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), by reducing toxic beta amyloid peptides, and attenuating brain atrophy. Recent transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, and the generation of TSPO-KO mice, have enabled new insights into the mechanistic function of TSPO in AD. Using a multi-omics approach in both TSPO-KO- and TSPO ligand-treated mice, we have demonstrated a key role for TSPO in microglial respiratory metabolism and phagocytosis in AD. In this review, we discuss emerging evidence for therapeutic and immunomodulatory functions of TSPO in AD, and new tools for studying TSPO in the brain.
