OBJECTIVE: To describe the indication and safety of early mobilization and exercises in mild to severe COVID-19 patients and to investigate the use of telerehabilitation to deliver exercise programs to these patients. METHODS: This narrative literature review was conducted performing a comprehensive search of databases. RESULTS: 32 articles met the established criteria and the main findings were summarized and described, including indication, contraindication and recommendation for early rehabilitation and exercises prescription. CONCLUSIONS: The literature suggests that early mobilization and physical exercise are beneficial for individuals with COVID-19. However, much of what has been published is based on expert opinion due to a lack of randomized trials, which are needed.
