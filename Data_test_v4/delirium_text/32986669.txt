32986669|t|Elevated Tau PET Signal Depends on Abnormal Amyloid Levels and Correlates with Cognitive Impairment in Elderly Persons without Dementia.
32986669|a|BACKGROUND: The recent developed PET ligands for amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau allow these two neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to be mapped and quantified in vivo and to be examined in relation to cognition. OBJECTIVE: To assess the associations among Abeta, tau, and cognition in non-demented subjects. METHODS: Three hundred eighty-nine elderly participants without dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative underwent tau and amyloid PET scans. Cross-sectional comparisons and longitudinal analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between Abeta and tau accumulation. The correlations between biomarkers of both pathologies and performance in memory and executive function were measured. RESULTS: Increased amyloid-PET retention was associated with greater tau-PET retention in widespread cortices. We observed a significant tau increase in the temporal composite regions of interest over 24 months in Abeta+ but not Abeta- subjects. Finally, tau-PET retention but not amyloid-PET retention significantly explained the variance in memory and executive function. Higher level of tau was associated with greater longitudinal memory decline. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested PET-detectable Abeta plaque pathology may be a necessary antecedent for tau-PET signal elevation. Greater tau-PET retention may demonstrate poorer cognition and predict prospective memory decline in non-demented subjects.
