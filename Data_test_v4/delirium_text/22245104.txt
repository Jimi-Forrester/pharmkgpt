22245104|t|Delirium: a review of the nurses role in the intensive care unit.
22245104|a|AIM: This article aims to review current literature into the use of assessment tools for the diagnosis of delirium and the implications of care for the patient with delirium. BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common often misdiagnosed, unrecognised and misunderstood condition in the critical care setting that has been associated with increased mortality and cognitive dysfunction. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Delirium has implications for increasing cost to the National Health Service as it is linked to prolonged ventilation and the associated risks and increased hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Nurses play a key role in identification of delirium using CAM-ICU, a valid and reliable tool and identifying modifiable risks to improve the delirious ICU patient's outcome.
