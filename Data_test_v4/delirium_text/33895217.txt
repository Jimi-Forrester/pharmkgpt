33895217|t|Near ideal anesthetic technique for tracheal stenting in central airway obstruction with dexmedetomidine-ketamine infusion: a case report.
33895217|a|Central airway obstruction presents as an emergency with dyspnea and stridor. Anesthetic management of rigid bronchoscopy-guided tracheal stenting is highly stimulating procedure requiring general anesthesia. But it may lead to life threatening airway obstruction and cardiovascular collapse after induction. Total intravenous anesthesia based on propofol-remifentanil is an optimal anesthetic technique, but remifentanil is not available in many countries. Although dexmedetomidine-ketamine has been used for procedural sedation, its use for rigid bronchoscopy in the setting of central airway obstruction has not been described in literature. We describe near ideal anesthetic technique for management of central airway obstruction using dexmedetomidine-ketamine combination.
