30791425|t|Activated Protein C in Cutaneous Wound Healing: From Bench to Bedside.
30791425|a|Independent of its well-known anticoagulation effects, activated protein C (APC) exhibits pleiotropic cytoprotective properties. These include anti-inflammatory actions, anti-apoptosis, and endothelial and epithelial barrier stabilisation. Such beneficial effects have made APC an attractive target of research in a plethora of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Of note, the past decade or so has seen the emergence of its roles in cutaneous wound healing-a complex process involving inflammation, proliferation and remodelling. This review will highlight APC's functions and mechanisms, and detail its pre-clinical and clinical studies on cutaneous wound healing.
