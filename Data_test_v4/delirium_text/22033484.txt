22033484|t|Toward a modern search for schizophrenia genes.
22033484|a|Genetic epidemiology has provided consistent evidence that schizophrenia has a genetic component It is now clear that this genetic component is complex and polygenic, with several genes interacting in epistasis. Although molecular studies have failed to identify any DNA variant that clearly contributes to vulnerability to schizophrenia, several regions have been implicated by linkage studies. To overcome the difficulties in the search for schizophrenia genes, it is necessary (i) to use methods of analysis that are appropriate for complex multifactorial disorders; (ii) to gather large enough clinical samples; and (iii) in the absence of genetic validity of the diagnostic classification currently used, to apply new strategies in order to better define the affected phenotypes. For this purpose, we describe here two strategies: (i) the candidate symptom approach, which concerns affected subjects and uses proband characteristics as the affected phenotype, such as age at onset, severity, and negative/positive symptoms; and (ii) the endophenotypic approach, which concerns unaffected relatives and has already provided positive findings with phenotypes, such as P50 inhibitory gating or eye-movement dysfunctions.
