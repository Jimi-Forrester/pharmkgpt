34764761|t|A systematic review on nephron protective AYUSH drugs as constituents of NEERI-KFT (A traditional Indian polyherbal formulation) for the management of chronic kidney disease.
34764761|a|Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major health problem characterized by kidney dysfunction with progressive segmental glomerulosclerosis to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Due to lack of scientific data and comprehensive reports, the current systematic review provides an inclusive understanding and prospective associated with phytopharmacology of NEERI-KFT in CKD. The data was collected from more than five databases such as Science Direct, Google Scholar, Elsevier, PubMed, Springer, ACS publication etc using keywords like CKD/Kidney disease, epidemiology/prevalence, modern therapies for CKD management, NEERI-KFT and its role in kidney disease. The study was performed based on scientific reports screened by experts according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The pre-clinical and clinical findings suggested that NEERI-KFT has promising effects as nephroprotective and considered safe and well effective in primary care of kidney against disease. Phytopharmacological evaluation of NEERI-KFT suggest that it exhibit substantial potential against oxidative and inflammatory stress induced apoptosis by exerting antioxidants, nephroprotective and immunomodulatory effects. Hence, it can be enlighten that NEERI-KFT have potential herbs which exerts significant antioxidants, nephroprotective and immunomodulatory effects in the patients associated with renal dysfunction or CKD thus improving altered renal architecture and renal physiology. Clinically, it is concluded that NEERI-KFT works kidney malfunction and cease ESRD progression or even reduce the number of dialysis.
