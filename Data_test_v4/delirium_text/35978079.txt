35978079|a|A number of vascular risk factors (VRFs) have been reported to be associated with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), but it remains unclear whether these VRFs are related to patient outcomes after shunt surgery. Therefore, we investigated the risk factors for unfavourable outcomes after shunt surgery in iNPH patients using two samples from Tohoku University Hospital and from a multicentre prospective trial of lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt surgery for patients with iNPH (SINPHONI-2). We enrolled 158 iNPH patients. We compared the prevalence of VRFs and clinical measures between patients with favourable and unfavourable outcomes and identified predictors of unfavourable outcomes using multivariate logistic regression analyses. The presence of hypertension, longer disease duration, more severe urinary dysfunction, and a lower Evans' index were predictors of unfavourable outcomes after shunt surgery. In addition, hypertension and longer disease duration were also predictors in patients with independent walking, and a lower Evans' index was the only predictor in patients who needed assistance to walk or could not walk. Our findings indicate that hypertension is the only VRF related to unfavourable outcomes after shunt surgery in iNPH patients. Larger-scale studies are needed to elucidate the reason why hypertension can affect the irreversibility of symptoms after shunt placement.
