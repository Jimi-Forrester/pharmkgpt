22498096|t|Active Abeta vaccination fails to enhance amyloid clearance in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease with Abeta42-driven pathology.
22498096|a|Abeta vaccination has been shown to induce remarkable clearance of brain amyloid plaques in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the extent to which antibody-mediated Abeta clearance is affected by predominant formation of Abeta42 over Abeta40 is unclear. Here we demonstrate for the first time that in a mouse model carrying the human APP mutations KM670/671NL and the human PS1 mutation P166L, Abeta vaccination does not result in plaque clearance. This was in spite of the strong T- and B-cell immune responses evoked under the DR1501 genetic background and the activation of microglia at sites of Abeta plaques. Our findings suggest the existence of antibody-resistant forms of Abeta deposits in the brain consisting of primarily Abeta42, and shed light on the mechanisms of antibody-dependent amyloid clearance as well as novel therapeutic strategies for AD.
