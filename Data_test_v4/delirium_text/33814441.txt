33814441|t|Association of Plasma Hemoglobin A1c with Improvement of Cognitive Functions by Probiotic Bifidobacterium breve Supplementation in Healthy Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment.
33814441|a|We demonstrated the benefit of the probiotic strain, Bifidobacterium breve MCC1274 (synonym B. breve A1), at improving cognition in our previous double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study. Analysis of the association of blood parameters changes with the improvement of cognitive function revealed an inverse correlation of HbA1c with total RBANS score amelioration after the study only in the probiotic group (rho= -0.4218, p = 0.0067). A stratified analysis based on baseline HbA1c with a median value showed a more remarkable benefit by the probiotic supplementation in the higher median subgroup. These data support the mechanism of anti-inflammation in improving cognition by the probiotic strain.
