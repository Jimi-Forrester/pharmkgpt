38650831|a|The sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) gene, encoding the cellular endosomal sorting-related receptor with A-type repeats (SORLA), is now established as a causal gene for Alzheimer's disease. As the latest addition to the list of causal genes, the pathophysiological effects and biomarker potential of SORL1 variants remain relatively undiscovered. Metabolic dysfunction is, however, well described in patients with Alzheimer's disease and is used as an imaging biomarker in clinical diagnosis settings. To understand the metabolic consequences of loss-of-function SORL1 mutations, we applied two metabolic MRI technologies, sodium (23Na) MRI and MRI with hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate, in minipigs and mice with compromised expression of SORL1. At the age analysed here, both animal models display no conventional imaging evidence of neurodegeneration but show biochemical signs of elevated amyloid production, thus representing the early preclinical disease. With hyperpolarized MRI, the exchange from [1-13C]pyruvate to [1-13C]lactate and 13C-bicarbonate was decreased by 32 and 23%, respectively, in the cerebrum of SORL1-haploinsufficient minipigs. A robust 11% decrease in the sodium content was observed with 23Na-MRI in the same minipigs. Comparably, the brain sodium concentration gradually decreased from control to SORL1 haploinsufficient (-11%) to SORL1 knockout mice (-23%), suggesting a gene dose dependence in the metabolic dysfunction. The present study highlights that metabolic MRI technologies are sensitive to the functional, metabolic consequences of Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-linked genotypes. Further, the study suggests a potential avenue of research into the mechanisms of metabolic alterations by SORL1 mutations and their potential role in neurodegeneration.
