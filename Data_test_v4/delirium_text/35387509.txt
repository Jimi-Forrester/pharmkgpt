35387509|t|A Novel Way of Measuring Dual-Task Interference: The Reliability and Construct Validity of the Dual-Task Effect Battery in Neurodegenerative Disease.
35387509|a|BACKGROUND: Decreased automaticity is common among individuals with neurodegenerative disease and is often assessed using dual-task (DT) paradigms. However, the best methods for assessing performance changes related to DT demands remain inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the reliability and validity of a novel battery of DT measures (DT Effect-Battery (DTE-B)) encompassing three domains: task-specific interference, task prioritization, and automaticity. METHODS: Data for this retrospective cross-sectional study included 125 participants with Parkinson's disease (PD), 127 participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 84 healthy older adults. Reliability analyses were conducted using a subset of each population. DTE-B measures were calculated from single and DT performance on the Timed Up and Go test and a serial subtraction task. Construct validity was evaluated via associations within the DTE-B and with theoretically supported measures as well as known-groups validity analyses. RESULTS: Good to excellent reliability was found for DTE-B measures of task interference (motor and cognitive DT effects) (ICCs>=.658) and automaticity (combined DT effect (cDTE)) (ICCs>=.938). Evidence for convergent validity was found with associations within the hypothesized constructs. Known-groups validity analyses revealed differences in the DTE-B among the healthy group and PD and AD groups (ps<=.001), excepting task prioritization (ps>=.061). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence to support the DTE-B as a reliable measure of multiple constructs pertinent to DT performance. The cDTE demonstrated evidence to support its validity as a measure of automaticity. Further investigation of the utility of the DTE-B in both PD and AD, as well as other populations, is warranted.
