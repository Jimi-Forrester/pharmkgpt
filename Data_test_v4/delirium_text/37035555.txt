37035555|t|Paravertebral block vs. epidural block for percutaneous nephrolithotomy: A prospective, randomized study.
37035555|a|Background: Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PCNL) is the main method for urinary calculi. An anesthesia method with little effect on the blood circulation and which does not affect the postoperative activity of a patient is lacking. Objective: To compare the effects of paravertebral nerve block (PNB) and epidural block (EPB) on quadriceps femoris muscle (QFM) strength in patients after PCNL. Methods: 163 patients were separated into two groups: EPB (81) and PNB (82). Primary outcome parameters were QFM strength and range of motion (RoM) of the knee 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 24 h after anesthesia induction (AI). Secondary outcome parameters were: time from AI beginning to first ambulation; time of sensory-plane recovery; amount of additional analgesics given during and after surgery; prevalence of nausea and vomiting; duration of hospital stay (DoHS); mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) before, 0.5 h, and 1 h after AI; visual analog scale (VAS) score 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 24 h after AI. Results: There was no significant difference in QFM strength or knee RoM before or 24 h after AI between the two groups (P > 0.05). The time from AI to first ambulation was shorter (P < 0.05) and the sensory plane took longer to recover (P < 0.05) in the PNB group than in the EPB group. The amount of additional analgesics during surgery was more in the PNB group than in the EPB group (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference after surgery (P > 0.05). VAS scores were higher in the PNB group than in the EPB group 0.5 after AI (P < 0.05). MAP 1 h after AI was higher in the PNB group than in the EPB group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, DoHS, HR, or SpO2 at 0.5 h and 1 h after AI between the two groups (P > 0.05). Conclusions: For patients undergoing PCNL, PNB can meet the need for surgical analgesia while having little effect on QFM strength.
