37335453|t|Crosstalk between Alzheimer's disease and diabetes: a focus on anti-diabetic drugs.
37335453|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are two of the most common age-related diseases. There is accumulating evidence of an overlap in the pathophysiological mechanisms of these two diseases. Studies have demonstrated insulin pathway alternation may interact with amyloid-beta protein deposition and tau protein phosphorylation, two essential factors in AD. So attention to the use of anti-diabetic drugs in AD treatment has increased in recent years. In vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies have evaluated possible neuroprotective effects of anti-diabetic different medicines in AD, with some promising results. Here we review the evidence on the therapeutic potential of insulin, metformin, Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1R), thiazolidinediones (TZDs), Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV (DPP IV) Inhibitors, Sulfonylureas, Sodium-glucose Cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors, Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and Amylin analog against AD. Given that many questions remain unanswered, further studies are required to confirm the positive effects of anti-diabetic drugs in AD treatment. So to date, no particular anti-diabetic drugs can be recommended to treat AD.
