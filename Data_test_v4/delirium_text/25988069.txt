25988069|t|Localized malignant pleural mesothelioma with renal metastasis.
25988069|a|Localized malignant pleural mesothelioma (LMM) is a rare subset of malignant pleural mesothelioma. Its epidemiology, biology, natural history and optimal treatment are poorly understood. We report a case of LMM treated aggressively with complete surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy, but subsequently complicated by local chest wall recurrence and solitary metastasis to the kidney. This case is examined in the context of a small number of cases of LMM in the literature to emphasize the existence of this rare disease entity, their unusual biological behaviour and the need for further tumour molecular and genomic research.
