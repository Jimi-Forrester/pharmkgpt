31608112|t|Genetic and Expression Analysis of COPI Genes and Alzheimer's Disease Susceptibility.
31608112|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly and the leading cause of dementia in humans. Evidence shows that cellular trafficking and recycling machineries are associated with AD risk. A recent study found that the coat protein complex I (COPI)-dependent trafficking in vivo could significantly reduce amyloid plaques in the cortex and hippocampus of neurological in the AD mouse models and identified 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in COPI genes to be significantly associated with increased AD risk using 6,795 samples. Here, we used a large-scale GWAS dataset to investigate the potential association between the COPI genes and AD susceptibility by both SNP and gene-based tests. The results showed that only rs9898218 was associated with AD risk with P = 0.017. We further conducted an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) analysis and found that rs9898218 G allele was associated with increased COPZ2 expression in cerebellar cortex with P = 0.0184. Importantly, the eQTLs analysis in whole blood further indicated that 11 of these 12 genetic variants could significantly regulate the expression of COPI genes. Hence, these findings may contribute to understand the association between COPI genes and AD susceptibility.
