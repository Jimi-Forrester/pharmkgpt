38576679|t|Endobronchial Ultrasonography With Guide Sheath for the Diagnosis of Peripheral Pulmonary Lesions in Japan: A Literature Review.
38576679|a|We evaluated the usefulness of endobronchial ultrasonography with guide sheath (EBUS-GS) for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) in Japan. We searched the PubMed/Medline database using the keywords "EBUS guide sheath" for Japanese studies on EBUS-GS published between January 2004 and August 2023. We included 32 original articles that evaluated the diagnostic yield of EBUS-GS for PPLs. Case reports and conference abstracts were excluded due to limited information available for quality assessment. The diagnostic yield of EBUS-GS was 73.6% for 2996 malignant lesions, 65.4% for 752 ground-glass nodules, 59.4% for 414 benign lesions, 61.3% for 1114 lesions of size <=2 cm, and 75.6% for 1246 lesions of size >2 cm; it was 69.4% for lesions located in the upper lobe (n=793), 71.9% for the middle lobe/lingula (n=121), and 62.5% for the lower lobe (n=334). None of the patients experienced severe complications. In this review, EBUS-GS is effective for the diagnosis of malignant and benign PPLs. A multimodality approach is needed to further enhance its diagnostic performance.
