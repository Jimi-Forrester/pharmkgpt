34246526|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence and risks factors of short-term post-intensive care (ICU) cognitive impairment. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Closed university-affiliated intensive care unit. PATIENTS: We enrolled consecutive patients >18 yrs of age expected to be in intensive care unit for >=24 hours. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The score of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) less than 26 was defined as cognitive impairment at hospital discharge and short-term post-ICU cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 185 of 409 assessed patients (45.2%). According to univariate analysis, age, years of education, occupation, past medical history, main ICU diagnosis, Acute Physiology and Chronic Evaluation Scoring System (APACHE II) score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Charlson comorbidity index, ICU length-of-stay (LOS), total hospital LOS, sedation, vasoactive agents, muscle relaxants, mechanical ventilation and duration of mechanical ventilation, constraints, early active mobilisation, hypoxemia, frequency and severity of delirium, blood pressure, rescue experience, and infection were significant predictors of post-ICU cognitive impairment. Multivariate analysis results showed that the frequency and severity of delirium, and advanced age were risk factors of post-ICU cognitive impairment; high years of education and early active mobilisation were protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of post-ICU cognitive impairment is at a high level, which is similar to former researches' results; the frequency and severity of delirium, and advanced age were risk factors of post-ICU cognitive impairment; high years of education and early active mobilisation were protective factors of post-ICU cognitive impairment.
