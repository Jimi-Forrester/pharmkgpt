37297420|a|Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. (N. nucifera) tea is used as food and folk medicine to reduce toxicity in Southeast Asia. Mancozeb (Mz) is used for controlling fungi in agriculture and contains heavy metals. This study aimed to examine the effect of white N. nucifera petal tea on cognitive behavior, hippocampus histology, oxidative stress, and amino acid metabolism in rats poisoned with mancozeb. Seventy-two male Wistar rats were divided into nine groups (n = 8 in each). Y-maze spontaneous alternation test was used to assess cognitive behavior, and amino acid metabolism was investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR) from blood. There was a significant increase in relative brain weight in the Mz co-administered with the highest dose (2.20 mg/kg bw) of white N. nucifera group. The levels of tryptophan, kynurenine, picolinic acid, and serotonin in blood showed a significant decrease in the Mz group and a significant increase in the Mz co-administered with low dose (0.55 mg/kg bw) of white N. nucifera group. However, there was no significant difference in cognitive behavior, hippocampus histology, oxidative stress, and corticosterone. This study demonstrated that a low dose of white N. nucifera petal tea has a neuroprotective effect against mancozeb.
