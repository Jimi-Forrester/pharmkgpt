20691733|a|A primary therapeutic goal in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is to reduce the quantity of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) present in the brain. To develop an effective, safe system for vaccination against Alzheimer's disease, the plant virus Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) was engineered genetically to express Abeta-derived fragments that stimulate mainly humoral immune responses. Six chimeric constructs, bearing the Abeta1-15 or the Abeta4-15 sequence in positions 248, 392 or 529 of the CMV coat protein (CP) gene, were created. Viral products proved to be able to replicate in their natural host. However, only chimeric Abeta1-15-CMVs were detected by Abeta1-42 antiserum in Western blot analysis. Experimental evidence of Immunoelectron microscopy revealed a complete decoration of Abeta1-15-CMV(248) and Abeta1-15-CMV(392) following incubation with either anti-Abeta1-15 or anti-Abeta1-42 polyclonal antibodies. These two chimeric CMVs appear to be endowed with features making them possible candidates for vaccination against Alzheimer's disease.
