16252002|t|The amyloid-beta precursor protein: integrating structure with biological function.
16252002|a|Proteolytic processing of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) generates the Abeta amyloid peptide of Alzheimer's disease. The biological function of APP itself remains, however, unclear. In the current review, we study in detail the different subdomains of APP and try to assign functional significance to particular structures identified in the protein.
