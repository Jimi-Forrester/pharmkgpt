37426438|t|Balance and gait in progressive supranuclear palsy: a narrative review of objective metrics and exercise interventions.
37426438|a|Background: The use of objective gait and balance metrics is rapidly expanding for evaluation of atypical parkinsonism, and these measures add to clinical observations. Evidence for rehabilitation interventions to improve objective measures of balance and gait in atypical parkinsonism is needed. Aim: Our aim is to review, with a narrative approach, current evidence on objective metrics for gait and balance and exercise interventions in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Methods: Literature searches were conducted in four computerized databases from the earliest record up to April 2023: PubMed, ISI's Web of Knowledge, Cochrane's Library, and Embase. Data were extracted for study type (cross-sectional, longitudinal, and rehabilitation interventions), study design (e.g., experimental design and case series), sample characteristics, and gait and balance measurements. Results: Eighteen gait and balance (16 cross-sectional and 4 longitudinal) and 14 rehabilitation intervention studies were included. Cross-sectional studies showed that people with PSP have impairments in gait initiation and steady-state gait using wearable sensors, and in static and dynamic balance assessed by posturography when compared to Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy controls. Two longitudinal studies observed that wearable sensors can serve as objective measures of PSP progression, using relevant variables of change in turn velocity, stride length variability, toe off angle, cadence, and cycle duration. Rehabilitation studies investigated the effect of different interventions (e.g., balance training, body-weight supported treadmill gait, sensorimotor training, and cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation) on gait, clinical balance, and static and dynamic balance assessed by posturography measurements. No rehabilitation study in PSP used wearable sensors to evaluate gait and balance impairments. Although clinical balance was assessed in 6 rehabilitation studies, 3 of these studies used a quasi-experimental design, 2 used a case series, only 1 study used an experimental design, and sample sizes were relatively small. Conclusion: Wearable sensors to quantify balance and gait impairments are emerging as a means of documenting progression of PSP. Robust evidence for improving balance and gait in PSP was not found for rehabilitation studies. Future powered, prospective and robust clinical trials are needed to investigate the effects of rehabilitation interventions on objective gait and balance outcomes in people with PSP.
