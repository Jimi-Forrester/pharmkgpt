24312364|t|alpha7 Nicotinic receptor-mediated astrocytic gliotransmitter release: Abeta effects in a preclinical Alzheimer's mouse model.
24312364|a|It is now recognized that astrocytes participate in synaptic communication through intimate interactions with neurons. A principal mechanism is through the release of gliotransmitters (GTs) such as ATP, D-serine and most notably, glutamate, in response to astrocytic calcium elevations. We and others have shown that amyloid-beta (Abeta), the toxic trigger for Alzheimer's disease (AD), interacts with hippocampal alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Since alpha7nAChRs are highly permeable to calcium and are expressed on hippocampal astrocytes, we investigated whether Abeta could activate astrocytic alpha7nAChRs in hippocampal slices and induce GT glutamate release. We found that biologically-relevant concentrations of Abeta1-42 elicited alpha7nAChR-dependent calcium elevations in hippocampal CA1 astrocytes and induced NMDAR-mediated slow inward currents (SICs) in CA1 neurons. In the Tg2576 AD mouse model for Abeta over-production and accumulation, we found that spontaneous astrocytic calcium elevations were of higher frequency compared to wildtype (WT). The frequency and kinetic parameters of AD mice SICs indicated enhanced gliotransmission, possibly due to increased endogenous Abeta observed in this model. Activation of alpha7nAChRs on WT astrocytes increased spontaneous inward currents on pyramidal neurons while alpha7nAChRs on astrocytes of AD mice were abrogated. These findings suggest that, at an age that far precedes the emergence of cognitive deficits and plaque deposition, this mouse model for AD-like amyloidosis exhibits augmented astrocytic activity and glutamate GT release suggesting possible repercussions for preclinical AD hippocampal neural networks that contribute to subsequent cognitive decline.
