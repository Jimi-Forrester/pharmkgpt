32238862|a|During pregnancy, substantial alterations in cerebral plasticity, vascular remodeling and neuronal growth occur in the maternal brain. We investigated whether concentrations of selected neurodiagnostic biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid of women with preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome differ from those in healthy controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. We found that tau protein concentrations (p = 0.016) and phospho-tau/tau ratio (p < 0.001) in cerebrospinal fluid were significantly lower in 39 preeclamptic women compared to 44 healthy controls during third trimester of pregnancy. Beta-amyloid(1-40)/(1-42) ratio was significantly higher in HELLP syndrome than in severe preeclampsia (8.49 + 2.73 vs. 4.71 + 1.65; p = 0.007). We conclude that beta-amyloid(1-40)/(1-42) ratio in cerebrospinal fluid can discriminate severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome. High beta-amyloid peptide and low tau protein concentrations are associated with impaired development of the materno-feto-placental unit and correlate with placental dysfunction.
