31769564|a|During Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, microglial cells play complex roles and have potentially detrimental as well as beneficial effects. The use of appropriate model systems is essential for characterizing and understanding the roles of microglia in AD pathology. Here, we used organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) to investigate the impact of microglia on amyloid beta (Abeta)-mediated toxicity. Neurons in OHSCs containing microglia were not vulnerable to cell death after 7 days of repeated treatment with Abeta1-42 oligomer-enriched preparations. However, when clodronate was used to remove microglia, treatment with Abeta1-42 resulted in significant neuronal death. Further investigations indicated signs of endoplasmic reticulum stress and caspase activation after Abeta1-42 challenge only when microglia were absent. Interestingly, microglia provided protection without displaying any classic signs of activation, such as an amoeboid morphology or the release of pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-6, TNF-alpha, NO). Furthermore, depleting microglia or inhibiting microglial uptake mechanisms resulted in significant more Abeta deposition compared to that observed in OHSCs containing functional microglia, suggesting that microglia efficiently cleared Abeta. Because inhibiting microglial uptake increased neuronal cell death, the ability of microglia to engulf Abeta is thought to contribute to its protective properties. Our study argues for a beneficial role of functional ramified microglia whereby they act against the accumulation of neurotoxic forms of Abeta and support neuronal resilience in an in situ model of AD pathology.
