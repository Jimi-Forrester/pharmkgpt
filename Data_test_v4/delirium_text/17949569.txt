METHODS: Between May and October 2005, a descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted with patients older than 60 years that were admitted to the geriatric department. The CAM was used to detect delirium and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to identify cognitive impairment; also, comorbidity, length of hospital stay and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: According to CAM, the prevalence of delirium was 38.3 % and the incidence was 11.7%. 48.5% of patients who had developed delirium previously showed cognitive impairment. Patients who experienced delirium were older when compared to non-delirious patients (80 +/- 8.7 versus 74. 4 +/- 8.9 years of age; p < 0. 001). Similarly, length of hospital stay was higher among patients who developed delirium when compared with patients who never developed it (7.5 +/- 2.9 versus 5.8 +/- 2.6 days; p < 0.001). Pneumonia and uremia were most common in delirious patients. CONCLUSION: The CAM and MMSE seems to be an acceptable screening instrument for delirium and cognitive impairment; using theses tests routinely could contribute to improve quality of care for these patients.
