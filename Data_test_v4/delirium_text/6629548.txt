6629548|t|The absorption of intramuscular chlordiazepoxide (Librium) in patients with severe alcoholic liver disease.
6629548|a|Intramuscular chlordiazepoxide (CDX) is commonly administered to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) patients requiring prompt management of alcohol agitation, anxiety, and delirium tremors. Sedative action is associated with plasma levels of approximately 2.0 mcg/ml, however, intramuscular CDX has been shown to produce peak concentrations consistently below 2.0 mcg/ml in normal subjects. The present study was designed to define the absorption characteristics of intramuscular 25 mg CDX in males with ALD. Five normal males had mean CDX absorption half-lives of 3.0 h and peaked at 0.8 mcg/ml in 7.2 h, while 11 males with ALD had mean absorption half-lives of 9.0 h, and peaked at 0.7 mcg/ml in 19.1 h when they received the drug dissolved in normal saline. Four other males with ALD who received CDX dissolved in the manufacturer's diluent had significantly slower mean absorption half-lives of 16.1 h which peaked at 0.3 mcg/ml in 35.2 h. Significant linear correlations were found with age (r = 0.60, p less than 0.01), body weight (r = 0.55, p less than 0.01), and serum albumin (r = 0.60, p less than 0.01). Because of the extremely slow intramuscular absorption of CDX dissolved in normal saline or the manufacturer's diluent in males with ALD, we do not recommend this route of administration in this population.
