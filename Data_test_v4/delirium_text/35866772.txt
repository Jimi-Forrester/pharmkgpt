35866772|t|Evaluation of SARC-F and SARC-CalF for sarcopenia screening in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain: A prospective cross-sectional study.
35866772|a|OBJECTIVES: Early sarcopenia detection using screening tools, such as SARC-F and SARC-CalF, has been proven reliable. However, the relationship between chronic musculoskeletal pain with sarcopenia is unknown. This study assessed sarcopenia morbidity as well as the reliability of sarcopenia screening with SARC-F and SARC-CalF in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. METHODS: Overall, 172 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain were included in this cross-sectional study. All participants completed the SARC-F, SARC-CalF, numeric rating scale (NRS), and pain disability assessment scale (PDAS) assessments. Sarcopenia was diagnosed using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria 2019. Correlations between SARC-F and SARC-CalF scores and each measured variable were evaluated using univariate and multiple linear regression analyses. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted, and reliabilities of SARC-F and SARC-CalF scores for diagnosing sarcopenia were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were diagnosed with sarcopenia. Among these, 10 patients were <65 years old, and 29 were >65 years old. Both SARC-F and SARC-CalF scores significantly correlated with grip power, gait speed, skeletal mass index, numeric rating scale score, and PDAS score. In multiple linear regression analysis, SALC-F and SALC-CalF scores significantly correlated with PDAS score, skeletal mass index, and gait speed. The area under the curve were 0.70 for SARC-F and 0.88 for SARC-CalF; SARC-CalF had a significantly higher area under the curve than SARC-F. DISCUSSION: Sarcopenia was diagnosed in patients aged <65 years with chronic musculoskeletal pain. SALC-F and SARC-CalF scores showed a significant correlation with disability due to pain and were reliable sarcopenia screening tools for chronic musculoskeletal pain. SARC-CalF was more reliable than SARC-F.
