33936900|t|Hepatic Artery Pseudoaneurysm Presenting as Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage.
33936900|a|A hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm (HAP) is a rare complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It can vary in its clinical presentation; however, given its severe nature, prompt assessment and management are crucial. We report a case of a 73-year-old male who underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy complicated by a right hepatic artery injury. This subsequently presented as a life-threatening case of upper gastrointestinal bleeding from HAP, with presumable hemobilia and septic shock from multiple liver abscesses. The diagnosis was made with computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the abdomen and pelvis followed by visceral angiography. The patient ultimately underwent a right hepatectomy for definitive treatment. The primary objective of this case is to highlight a less novel, though rare, case presentation and define a spectrum of treatment options available based on severity.
