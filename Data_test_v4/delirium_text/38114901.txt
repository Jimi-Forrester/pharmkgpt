Technology has been effective in promoting healthy behaviour of physical activity. The purposes of this study were to examine the association between physical activity and technology acceptance with frailty and examine the moderation effect of technology acceptance on physical activity and frailty. We hypothesize that 1) physical activity and technology acceptance are associated with frailty, and 2) technology acceptance moderates the association of physical activity with frailty. METHODS: This study employed a cross-sectional design and was conducted in the community settings of Hong Kong in 2021. Eligible participants were old people aged >=60 and were community-dwelling. Key variables included physical activity measured by Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity (RAPA), social network measured by Lubben Social Network Scale-Six items (LSNS-6); depressive symptoms measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-Nine items (PHQ-9), technology acceptance measured by Senior Technology Acceptance Model-14 items (STAM-14) and frailty measured by Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illnesses, & Loss of Weight scale (FRAIL). Ordinal logistic regression was employed to test the hypotheses. The moderation effect was examined by introducing an interaction term formed by the multiplication of an independent variable (i.e., physical activity) and a moderating variable (i.e., technology acceptance). RESULTS: This study recruited 380 eligible participants with a mean age of 66.5 years. Technology acceptance (Beta = - 0.031, p < 0.001, Pseudo-R2 = 0.087) and physical activity (Beta = - 0.182, p = 0.003, Pseudo-R2 = 0.027) were associated with frailty in the unadjusted models. Technology acceptance (Beta = - 0.066, p < 0.001) and physical activity (Beta = - 1.192, p < 0.001) were also associated with frailty in the fully adjusted model (Pseudo-R2 = 0.352). Interaction term formed by the multiplication of technology acceptance and physical activity (Beta = 0.012, p = 0.001) was associated with frailty. Physical activity was significantly associated with frailty in the lower technology acceptance subgroup (Beta = - 0.313, p = 0.002) in the subgroup analysis. However, in the subgroup of higher technology acceptance, the association of physical activity (Beta = 0.104, p = 408) on frailty became positive but not significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that physical activity and technology acceptance were associated with frailty, and technology acceptance moderated the association of physical activity with frailty. This study recommends engaging older adults in physical activity to combat frailty preferentially in those with a lower level of technology acceptance.
