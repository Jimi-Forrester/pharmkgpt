12053128|t|Caudate nucleus dopamine d(2) receptors in vascular dementia.
12053128|a|Caudate nucleus dopamine (DA) D(2) receptors were studied in patients with vascular dementia (VaD) and in a control group using [(3)H]raclopride as a radioligand. There was no significant difference in the number of DA D(2) receptors in the VaD group as compared with controls. The binding affinity was significantly lower in the VaD group. When the VaD group was subdivided into subjects with or without neuroleptic treatment, there were no differences in the numbers of receptors as compared with controls, and the significant differences in binding affinity remained for both VaD subgroups. The present results are discussed with reference to the previous finding of a reduced density of caudate nucleus DA uptake sites in the same VaD group and to results from studies on DA D(2) receptors in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
