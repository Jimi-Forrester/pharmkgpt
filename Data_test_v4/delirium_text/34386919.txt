34386919|t|Apoptotic Pathways and Alzheimer's Disease: Probing Therapeutic Potential.
34386919|a|Apoptosis is an intrinsic biochemical, cellular process that regulates cell death and is crucial for cell survival, cellular homeostasis, and maintaining the optimum functional status. Apoptosis in a predetermined and programmed manner regulates several molecular events, including cell turnover, embryonic development, and immune system functions but may be the exclusive contributor to several disorders, including neurodegenerative manifestations, when it functions in an aberrant and disorganized manner. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal, chronic neurodegenerative disorder where apoptosis has a compelling and divergent role. The well-characterized pathological features of AD, including extracellular plaques of amyloid-beta, intracellular hyperphosphorylated tangles of tau protein (NFTs), inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and excitotoxic cell death, also instigate an abnormal apoptotic cascade in susceptible brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus). The apoptotic players in these regions affect cellular organelles (mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum), interact with trophic factors, and several pathways, including PI3K/AKT, JNK, MAPK, mTOR signalling. This dysregulated apoptotic cascade end with an abnormal neuronal loss which is a primary event that may precede the other events of AD progression and correlates well with the degree of dementia. The present review provides insight into the diverse and versatile apoptotic mechanisms that are indispensable for neuronal survival and constitute an integral part of the pathological progression of AD. Identification of potential targets (restoring apoptotic and antiapoptotic balance, caspases, TRADD, RIPK1, FADD, TNFalpha, etc.) may be valuable and advantageous to decide the fate of neurons and to develop potential therapeutics for treatment of AD.
