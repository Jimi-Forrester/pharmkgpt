33911331|a|Palliative care is the province of everyone, particularly people managing older patients. Most people die of multimorbidity, frailty and dementia rather than cancer and will never see a palliative care specialist. People dying from non-malignant disease have symptoms and problems that are usually predictable. Common symptoms like pain and dyspnoea can be anticipated. Planning to prevent them, or for when they occur, is more effective than waiting until they happen. Deprescribing is an effective way of preventing morbidity in this group. Getting to know a few medicines well for each symptom is important when providing palliative care for patients. Starting at low doses and increasing slowly is also key.
