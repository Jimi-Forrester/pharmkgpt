38058357|a|INTRODUCTION: Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) will increase diagnostic demand. A non-invasive blood-based biomarker (BBBM) test for detection of amyloid-beta pathology may reduce diagnostic barriers and facilitate DMT initiation. OBJECTIVE: To explore heterogeneity in AD care pathways and potential role of BBBM tests. METHODS: Survey of 213 healthcare professionals/payers in US/China/UK/Germany/Spain/France and two advisory boards (US/Europe). RESULTS: Current diagnostic pathways are heterogeneous, meaning many AD patients are missed while low-risk patients undergo unnecessary procedures. Confirmatory amyloid testing (cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers/positron emission tomography) is utilized in few patients, resulting in diagnostic/treatment delays. A high negative-predictive-value test could streamline the diagnostic pathway by reducing unnecessary procedures in low-risk patients; supporting confirmatory testing where needed. Imminent approval of DMTs will increase need for fast and reliable AD diagnostic tests. DISCUSSION: An easy-to-use, accurate, non-invasive BBBM test for amyloid pathology could guide diagnostic procedures or referral, streamlining early diagnosis and DMT initiation. Highlights: This study explored AD care pathways and how BBBM may meet diagnostic demandsCurrent diagnostic pathways are heterogeneous, with country and setting variationsMany AD patients are missed, while low-risk patients undergo unnecessary proceduresAn easy-to-use, accurate, non-invasive BBBM test for amyloid pathology is neededThis test could streamline early diagnosis of amyloid pathology and DMT initiation.
