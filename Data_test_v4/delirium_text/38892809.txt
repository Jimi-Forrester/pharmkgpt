38892809|t|Novel Therapeutic Strategies in Alzheimer's Disease: Pitfalls and Challenges of Anti-Amyloid Therapies and Beyond.
38892809|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes a significant challenge to global healthcare systems, with limited effective treatments available. This review examines the landscape of novel therapeutic strategies for AD, focusing on the shortcomings of traditional therapies against amyloid-beta (Abeta) and exploring emerging alternatives. Despite decades of research emphasizing the role of Abeta accumulation in AD pathogenesis, clinical trials targeting Abeta have obtained disappointing results, highlighting the complexity of AD pathophysiology and the need for investigating other therapeutic approaches. In this manuscript, we first discuss the challenges associated with anti-Abeta therapies, including limited efficacy and potential adverse effects, underscoring the necessity of exploring alternative mechanisms and targets. Thereafter, we review promising non-Abeta-based strategies, such as tau-targeted therapies, neuroinflammation modulation, and gene and stem cell therapy. These approaches offer new avenues for AD treatment by addressing additional pathological hallmarks and downstream effects beyond Abeta deposition.
