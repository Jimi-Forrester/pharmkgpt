37557068|a|ABSTRACT: Converging evidence suggests that COVID-19 infects not only the respiratory system, but also has a large impact on the central nervous system (CNS), leading to acute neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) such as anxiety and delirium. It is thus far unclear which acute NPSs are most common in COVID-19 and if NPSs are associated with an altered COVID-19 disease course. We used data from two independent retrospective cohort studies performed in an academic hospital. A total of 93 patients with NPS and 125 patients without NPS were included. Main outcome measures consisted of type of acute NPS, COVID-19 severity (based on CT severity score), admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and mortality. Most common acute NPSs were delirium, anxiety, and mood symptoms. NPS patients were more often admitted to the ICU than patients without NPS. However, there was no difference in duration of ICU admission, CT severity score, and mortality. Somatic comorbidity was similar between the two groups. These data suggest that delirium, anxiety, and mood symptoms were the most common NPS. Independent of other clinical characteristics, ICU admission in COVID-19 patients was associated with NPS. We recommend that all COVID-19 patients should be actively screened for acute NPS such as delirium, anxiety, and mood symptoms, especially when admitted to an ICU.
