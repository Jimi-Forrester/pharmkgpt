38903548|a|In this study, we delved into the hippocampal region to understand the effects of adipose stem cells (ADSCs) and rosemary extract (RE). Our main objective was to explore how these substances influence spatial memory, neurotrophins, and changes in antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, we meticulously investigated the impact of dopamine deficiency, a notable characteristic linked with Parkinson's disease (PD), on memory impairment. This study comprised five groups of Wistar rats - all male, all selected randomly. We labeled two of these gatherings "lesion" (L) and "sham" (SH). Each got injections in the bilateral form with 6 mug - one group getting saline, while another got 6-OHDA. From couple weeks before the neurotoxin injection to 8 weeks later on, our lesion cohort was treated with rosemary at a dosage rate of 50 mg/kg body weight - let's call it RE for simplicity sake. Moreover, there is also this other lot, designated as cell-transplanted lesion group or catchy exercise (CE) as we prefer to interpret them; they had cell transplants conducted exactly 7 days after receiving their respective injections. Bringing up the rear, we got a group treated with both cell transplant and rosemary (CE+R). We performed spatial memory tests at 4 weeks, then again at 8. At the end of eighth week, the brains were extracted for q-PCR, enzymatic and immunohistochemical studies. Turning our gaze toward a comparison between the CE+R and CE groups versus the L group, we spot an intriguing drop in escape latency time. There is also more time spent in quadrants. Digging deeper into this matter, the CE+R bunch unveiled a clear surge when it comes to the expression of four genes, namely NGF, BDNF, NT3, and NT4! This was notable especially while comparing with both R and even other fellows from its very own broader group - CE. In a bit complex bit related to enzyme activity now, there is some good news as well for those in favor of potent antioxidants such as GPx or SOD. CE + R group, showed a significant increase of GPX and SOD enzymes, compared to the SH and L groups, and a significant decrease of MDA activity as compared to other treated groups. A significant decrease of escape latency and increase of time in quadrant were observed in the CE+R and CE groups compared to L group. What's more, the levels of MDA in the CE+R group plummeted significantly when set up against the SH group. Wrapping things up, a definite downscale was observed in the density of GFAP-positive cells throughout different regions located within the hippocampus; this decline presented itself not solely in treatment groups but gripped onto those falling under SH as well, especially when compared to its comrade - the L group. Using ADSCs and taking RE orally have shown promising results in improving memory issues linked with PD.
