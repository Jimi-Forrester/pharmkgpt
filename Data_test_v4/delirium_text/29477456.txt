29477456|t|Incidence, risk factors, and clinical implications of post-operative delirium in lung transplant recipients.
29477456|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium significantly affects post-operative outcomes, but the incidence, risk factors, and long-term impact of delirium in lung transplant recipients have not been well studied. METHODS: We analyzed 155 lung transplant recipients enrolled in the Lung Transplant Outcomes Group (LTOG) cohort at a single center. We determined delirium incidence by structured chart review, identified risk factors for delirium, determined whether plasma concentrations of 2 cerebral injury markers (neuron-specific enolase [NSE] and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) were associated with delirium, and determined the association of post-operative delirium with 1-year survival. RESULTS: Fifty-seven (36.8%) patients developed post-operative delirium. Independent risk factors for delirium included pre-transplant benzodiazepine prescription (relative risk [RR] 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08 to 3.07; p = 0.025), total ischemic time (RR 1.10 per 30-minute increase; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.21; p = 0.027), duration of time with intra-operative mean arterial pressure <60 mm Hg (RR 1.07 per 15-minute increase; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.14; p = 0.041), and Grade 3 primary graft dysfunction (RR 2.13; 95% CI 1.27 to 3.58; p = 0.004). Ninety-one (58.7%) patients had plasma available at 24 hours. Plasma GFAP was inconsistently detected, whereas NSE was universally detectable, with higher NSE concentrations associated with delirium (risk difference 15.1% comparing 75th and 25th percentiles; 95% CI 2.5 to 27.7; p = 0.026). One-year mortality appeared higher among delirious patients, 12.3% compared with 7.1%, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: Post-operative delirium is common in lung transplant recipients, and several potentially modifiable risk factors deserve further study to determine their associated mechanisms and predictive values.
