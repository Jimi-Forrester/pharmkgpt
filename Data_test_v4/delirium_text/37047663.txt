37047663|t|Abeta Chronic Exposure Promotes an Activation State of Microglia through Endocannabinoid Signalling Imbalance.
37047663|a|Dysfunctional phenotype of microglia, the primary brain immune cells, may aggravate Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis by releasing proinflammatory factors, such as nitric oxide (NO). The endocannabinoids N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are bioactive lipids increasingly recognised for their essential roles in regulating microglial activity both under normal and AD-driven pathological conditions. To investigate the possible impact of chronic exposure to beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) on the microglial endocannabinoid signalling, we characterised the functional expression of the endocannabinoid system on neonatal microglia isolated from wild-type and Tg2576 mice, an AD-like model, which overexpresses Abeta peptides in the developing brain. We found that Abeta-exposed microglia produced 2-fold more 2-AG than normal microglia. Accordingly, the expression levels of diacylglycerol lipase-alpha (DAGLalpha) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the main enzymes responsible for synthesising and hydrolysing 2-AG, respectively, were consistently modified in Tg2576 microglia. Furthermore, compared to wild-type cells, transgenic microglia basally showed increased expression of the cannabinoid 2 receptor, typically upregulated in an activated proinflammatory phenotype. Indeed, following inflammatory stimulus, Abeta-exposed microglia displayed an enhanced production of NO, which was abolished by pharmacological inhibition of DAGLalpha. These findings suggested that exposure to Abeta polarises microglial cells towards a pro-AD phenotype, possibly by enhancing 2-AG signalling.
