34952285|a|The decreasing effectiveness of conventional drugs due to multidrug-resistance is a major challenge for the scientific community, necessitating development of novel antimicrobial agents. In the present era of coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients are being widely exposed to antimicrobial drugs and hence the problem of multidrug-resistance shall be aggravated in the days to come. Consequently, revisiting the phenomena of multidrug resistance leading to formulation of effective antimicrobial agents is the need of the hour. As a result, this review sheds light on the looming crisis of multidrug resistance in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights the problem, significance and approaches for tackling microbial resistance with special emphasis on anti-microbial peptides as next-generation therapeutics against multidrug resistance associated diseases. Antimicrobial peptides exhibit exceptional mechanism of action enabling rapid killing of microbes at low concentration, antibiofilm activity, immunomodulatory properties along with a low tendency for resistance development providing them an edge over conventional antibiotics. The review is unique as it discusses the mode of action, pharmacodynamic properties and application of antimicrobial peptides in areas ranging from therapeutics to agriculture.
