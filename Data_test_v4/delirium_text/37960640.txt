37960640|t|Prototype of Monitoring Transportation Pollution Spikes through the Internet of Things Edge Networks.
37960640|a|Air pollution is a critical problem in densely populated urban areas, with traffic significantly contributing. To mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution on public health and the environment, there is a growing need for the real-time monitoring and detection of pollution spikes in transportation. This paper presents a novel approach to using Internet of Things (IoT) edge networks for the real-time detection of air pollution peaks in transportation, specifically designed for innovative city applications. The proposed system uses IoT sensors in buses, cabs, and private cars. These sensors are equipped with air quality monitoring capabilities, including the measurement of pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon dioxide (CO2). The sensors continuously collect air quality data and transmit them to edge devices within the transportation infrastructure. The data collected by these sensors are analyzed, and alerts are generated when pollution levels exceed predefined thresholds. By deploying this system within IoT edge networks, transportation authorities can promptly respond to pollution spikes, improving air quality, public health, and environmental sustainability. This paper details the sensor technology, data analysis methods, and the practical implementation of this innovative system, shedding light on its potential for addressing the pressing issue of transportation-related pollution. The proposed IoT edge network for real-time air pollution spike detection in transportation offers significant advantages, including low-latency data processing, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. By leveraging the power of edge computing and IoT technologies, smart cities can proactively monitor and manage air pollution, leading to healthier and more sustainable urban environments.
