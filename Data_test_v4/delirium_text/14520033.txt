14520033|a|STUDY DESIGN: Clinical and radiologic analyses in elderly patients with cervical myelopathy. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathomechanism of cervical myelopathy and the surgical results of laminoplasty in elderly patients older than 70 years old. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: To date, there have been no reports on the pathomechanism of cervical myelopathy in elderly patients. Further, the surgical results and postoperative complications of laminoplasty have not been fully evaluated in elderly patients. METHODS: Eighty-nine patients who underwent cervical laminoplasty were reviewed. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the age at the time of operation (the elderly patient group: 20 patients who were older than 70 years old, and the control group: 69 patients who were younger than 69 years old). Pre- and postoperative neurologic status (the Japanese Orthopedic Association score) and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups. Radiologic features were also examined. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the recovery rate of Japanese Orthopedic Association score between the elderly patient group and the control group. Activities of daily living improved in the elderly patients. Several complications, such as delirium and worsening hypertension, were found in the elderly patient group. In the preoperative radiographs, the incidence of either retrolisthesis or anterolisthesis in the elderly patient group was significantly higher than that in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Retrolisthesis and anterolisthesis are often the cause of myelopathy in elderly patients. Surgical decompression for cervical myelopathy was beneficial even in elderly patients older than 70 years old. Laminoplasty achieves stability of the cervical spine, and this procedure is reasonable for the treatment.
