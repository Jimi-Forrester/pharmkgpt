32348223|t|Current Status of Drug Targets and Emerging Therapeutic Strategies in the Management of Alzheimer's Disease.
32348223|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease affecting the elderly. AD is associated with a progressive decline in memory and cognitive abilities, drastic changes in behavioural patterns and other psychiatric manifestations. It leads to a significant decline in the quality of life at personal, household as well as national level. Although AD was described about hundred years back and multiple theories have been proposed, its exact pathophysiology is unknown. There is no cure for AD and the life expectancy of AD patients remains low at 3-9 years. An accurate understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the pathogenesis of AD is imperative to devise a successful treatment strategy. This review explains and summarises the current understanding of different therapeutic strategies based on various molecular pathways known to date. Different strategies based on anti-amyloid pathology, glutamatergic pathway, anti-tau, neuroprotection through neurotrophic factors and cholinergic neurotransmission have been discussed. Further, the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, nutraceuticals, and dietary interventions has also been explained in the management of AD. It further describes different pharmacological and dietary interventions being used in treating and/or managing AD. Additionally, this article provides a thorough review of the literature for improving the therapeutic paradigm of AD.
