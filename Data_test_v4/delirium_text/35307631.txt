35307631|a|OBJECTIVE: The clinical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 may be more severe in individuals with diagnoses such as neurodegenerative diseases and cerebrovascular disease, which may occur at an advanced age, among the underlying chronic neurological disorders. In this study, we analyzed the incidence of underlying neurological disorders, the clinical process, the effects on prognosis, duration of hospitalization, and clinical parameters such as mortality and the incidence of neurological manifestations that occurred in the study group after being infected and their relationship with the prognosis in patients hospitalized due to coronavirus disease 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective and single-centered study. Individuals aged 65 years and older whose diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 was confirmed and who were hospitalized for treatment were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 282 individuals were included in the study. Neurological manifestaitons were observed in 217 (77.0%) patients, and 131 (46.5%) patients had a neurological disorders in their medical history. Of the 58 patients in intensive care, 36 (12.8%) had a positive history of neurological disorders (P=.006). The incidences of diseases common in advanced age were 22 (7.8%) for dementia, 37 (13.1%) for cerebrovascular disease, and 4 (1.4%) for movement disorders. The most common symptom were myalgia in 67 (23.8%) patients. CONCLUSION: The clinical presentation was more severe and the risk of being treated in the intensive care unit was higher in individuals with a history of neurological disorders and neurological manifestations. Furthermore, patients who developed neurological manifestations had a greater risk of mortality and longer periods of hospitalization.
