20925994|t|Remifentanil reduces the incidence of post-operative delirium.
20925994|a|A secondary exploratory analysis of data from an observational study was used to study the influence of the opioid used for intraoperative anaesthesia on the incidence of post-operative delirium. Patients who had been admitted to the recovery room following elective general anaesthesia were divided into those who had received fentanyl or remifentanil. For unbiased patient analysis, matched pairs were built with respect to gender, age, physical status, anaesthetic type and surgery duration. In 752 patients, the overall incidence of delirium was 9.9% in the recovery room and 3.8% on the first post-operative day. Compared with the remifentanil group, the fentanyl group had a significantly higher incidence of delirium in the recovery room (12.2% versus 7.7%) and on the first post-operative day (5.8% versus 1.9%). Delirium in the recovery room and on the first post-operative day were both associated with a significantly prolonged post-operative hospital stay. The choice of intraoperative opioid influences the incidence of post-operative delirium. Remifentanil was associated with a lower incidence of post-operative delirium in the early post-operative period.
