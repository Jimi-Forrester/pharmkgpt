39418583|a|PURPOSE: As artificial intelligence (AI) takes an increasingly prominent role in health care, a growing body of research is being dedicated to its application in the investigation of communication sciences and disorders (CSD). This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview, serving as a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and professionals seeking to comprehend the evolving landscape of AI in CSD research. METHOD: We conducted a bibliometric analysis of AI-based research in the discipline of CSD published up to December 2023. Utilizing the Web of Science and Scopus databases, we identified 15,035 publications, with 4,375 meeting our inclusion criteria. Based on the bibliometric data, we examined publication trends and patterns, characteristics of research activities, and research hotspot tendencies. RESULTS: From 1985 onwards, there has been a consistent annual increase in publications, averaging 16.51%, notably surging from 2012 to 2023. The primary communication disorders studied include autism, aphasia, dysarthria, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Noteworthy AI models instantiated in CSD research encompass support vector machine, convolutional neural network, and hidden Markov model, among others. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to AI applications in other fields, the adoption of AI in CSD has lagged slightly behind. While CSD studies primarily use classical machine learning techniques, there is a growing trend toward the integration of deep learning methods. AI technology offers significant benefits for both research and clinical practice in CSD, but it also presents certain challenges. Moving forward, collaboration among technological, research, and clinical domains is essential to empower researchers and speech-language pathologists to effectively leverage AI technology for the study, diagnosis, assessment, and rehabilitation of CSD.
