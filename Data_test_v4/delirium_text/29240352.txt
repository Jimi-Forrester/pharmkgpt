29240352|t|Baseline  Vulnerability and Inpatient Frailty Status in Relation to Adverse Outcomes in a Surgical Cohort.
29240352|a|This study aimed to derive measures of baseline vulnerability and inpatient frailty in elderly surgical patients and to study their association with adverse post-operative outcomes. Data from comprehensive geriatric assessment of 208 general surgical and orthopaedic patients aged 70 and over admitted to four acute hospitals in Queensland, Australia, were analysed to derive a baseline and inpatient Frailty Index (FI). The association of these indices with adverse outcomes was examined in logistic regression. The mean (SD) baseline FI was 0.19 (0.09) compared to 0.26 (0.12) on admission, with a predominant increase in domains related to functional status. Both baseline and inpatient FI were significant predictors of one year mortality, inpatient delirium, and a composite adverse outcome, after adjusting for age, sex and acuity of surgery. In summary, detecting baseline frailty pre-hospitalisation may be useful to trigger the implementation of supportive and preventative measures in hospital.
