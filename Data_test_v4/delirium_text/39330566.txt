39330566|a|This study aimed to investigate the toxicity of the fungicide ipconazole on oxidative status, cell death and inflammasome complex activation in the hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus of rats. Female albino rats were randomly divided into a control group and four groups treated with ipconazole at doses of 1, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg b.w., administered for six days. Ipconazole significantly increased MDA and ROS levels in all brain regions studied, while reducing catalase enzyme activity. The molecular expression of cell death-related genes (AKT1, APAF1, BNIP3, CASP3 and BAX) and the inflammasome complex (CASP1, IL1beta, IL6, NLRP3, NFkB and TNFalpha) was also assessed, showing increased expression in at least one brain region. The findings demonstrate that ipconazole induces central nervous system toxicity in mammals, highlighting its potential role as a risk factor in the development of neurodegenerative disorders in individuals exposed to this contaminant.
