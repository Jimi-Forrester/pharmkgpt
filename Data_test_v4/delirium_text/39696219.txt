This study aimed to report the metabolism-attributable global burden of AD and other dementias from 1990 to 2021. METHODS: The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2021 collected data on the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) related to AD and other dementias caused by metabolic risks, including high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and high body mass index (BMI). The analysis assessed the disease burden and temporal patterns worldwide, examining data by region, country, level of social development, age group, and sex. RESULTS: Globally, the count of AD and other dementia-related deaths due to metabolic risks grew from 98,608 to 399,824, a 4.1-fold increase. For dementias related to high FPG and high BMI, the age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) and age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) increased with age and were higher in females than in males. In 2021, the highest burden was observed in high-income North America. The ASMR and ASDR have grown worldwide between 1990 and 2021. The burden of metabolism-related AD and other dementias was positively correlated with the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI), with higher ASMR and ASDR in high SDI regions but showing more pronounced increases in low and low-middle SDI regions. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolism-related global burden of AD and other dementias is increasing, particularly among women and in high-income regions. Targeted prevention programs for dementia should be developed, along with early interventions for risk factors.
