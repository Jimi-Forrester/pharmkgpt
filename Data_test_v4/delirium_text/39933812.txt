39933812|t|Protocol for a meta-review of interventions to prevent and manage ICU delirium.
39933812|a|INTRODUCTION: Intensive care unit (ICU) delirium is an acute brain dysfunction that affects up to 7 out of 10 patients admitted to ICUs. Patients who develop ICU delirium cannot think clearly, have trouble paying attention, do not understand what is happening around them and may see or hear things that are not there. ICU delirium increases the time patients spend in ICUs and hospitals and therefore healthcare costs. ICU delirium is also associated with increased mortality and dementia in the longer term. ICU delirium prevention and management strategies are likely to include both pharmacological and non-pharmacological components as part of a complex intervention, but it is unclear which components should be included. The objective of this meta-review is to systematically map the quantity and certainty of the available evidence from reviews and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, which will be used to design a multicomponent intervention to prevent and manage ICU delirium. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic search strategy was performed in MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO and Web of Science (from inception to 26 September 2023), as well as Epistemonikos (from inception to 19 July 2023). We will include all critically ill adults (aged>=18 years) and any ICU delirium prevention or management intervention (pharmacological or non-pharmacological). For pharmacological interventions, we will include reviews of RCTs. For non-pharmacological interventions, we will consider reviews of RCTs, quasi-experimental and cohort studies. We will use the International Consensus Study (Del-COrS) core outcome set for research evaluating interventions to prevent or manage ICU delirium and synthesise our findings using quantitative data description methods. We will involve our Patient and Public Involvement group of people who experienced ICU delirium to develop and comment on such aspects as the research question, methodology and which outcomes are most important. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical approval is required for this study. The results of this meta-review will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conferences. They will also form part of an evidence map and logic model for the prevention and management of ICU delirium. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42023473260.
