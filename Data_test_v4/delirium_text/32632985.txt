32632985|t|State of the science in pediatric ICU delirium: An integrative review.
32632985|a|Delirium is a complication of critical illness associated with poor outcomes. Although widely studied in adults, comparatively little is understood about delirium in pediatric intensive care units (ICUs). The purpose of this integrative review is to determine the extent and nature of current evidence, identify gaps in the literature, and outline future areas for investigation of pediatric ICU delirium. Eligible articles included research reports of delirium in pediatric ICU samples published in English since 2009. After an extensive literature search and consideration for inclusion/exclusion criteria, 22 articles were chosen for review. Delirium was highly prevalent in the ICU. Delirium episodes developed early in hospitalization, lasted several days, and consisted of hypoactive or mixed motor subtypes. Frequently identified independent risk factors included young age, developmental delay, mechanical ventilation, and benzodiazepine exposure. Pediatric delirium was independently associated with increased length of stay, costs, and mortality. The long-term cognitive, psychological, and functional morbidities associated with pediatric delirium remain largely unknown. Few researchers have implemented interventions to prevent or manage delirium. There was little evidence for the efficacy or safety of pharmacological management. Multicomponent delirium bundles may significantly decrease delirium incidence. Key quality issues among studies included variation in delirium screening, low levels of evidence (i.e., observational studies), and limited ability to determine intervention efficacy in quasi-experimental designs. Although the quantity and quality of pediatric delirium research has rapidly increased, further studies are needed to understand the long-term effects of pediatric delirium and determine the efficacy and safety of interventions for prevention and management.
