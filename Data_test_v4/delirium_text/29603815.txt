29603815|a|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship of delirium and risk factors for cardiology intensive care unit (ICU) patients with the nursing workload. BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common syndrome in patients with cardiac problems. The risk factors causing delirium and the presence and type of delirium affect the nurse workload and patient care quality adversely. DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 133 patients staying at the cardiology ICU of a university hospital between 5 January-31 March 2017. METHOD: The study data were collected using the Patient Information Form, Delirium Risk Factors' Form and Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System-28 (TISS-28) scale to identify the nurse workload. The statistical analysis of the data was performed using frequency, chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, correlation and regression analyses. RESULTS: It was found that patients who developed delirium were 65 years or older, they had more nasogastric/total parenteral nutrition (NG/TPN), benzodiazepine and physical restraints in comparison with those with no delirium development, and that the prevalence of hypoxia and hypoalbuminemia were higher in these patients. The mean TISS-28 score was higher in patients with delirium, compared with those without delirium. There was a positive correlation between the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores and the mean TISS-28 score of the patients. The mean TISS-28 score was found to significantly increase with being at the age of 65 and above and the administration of mechanical ventilation. The patients with delirium required a mean of 60-min additional care. CONCLUSIONS: Our study results suggest that the presence of delirium and the delirium risk factors, irrespective of delirium, increase the nurse workload. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: An effective management of delirium risk factors can improve the patient care quality by reducing delirium occurrence and nurse workload.
