2543486|t|[Alzheimer's disease: immunohistochemical characterization of cerebral amyloid deposits].
2543486|a|In Alzheimer cortex tissue sections, thioflavine stained three patterns of amyloid lesions: neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), senile plaques (SP) and vessel walls (amyloid angiopathy AA). An anti serum against Tau proteins detected NFT but neither SP nor AA. In contrast, an anti serum against beta protein amyloid (BP A4) revealed SP and AA but not NFT. A periodic acid pretreatment dramatically enhanced the anti-BP A4 immunolabelling corresponding to microplaques as well as a large amount of diffuse extracellular amyloid substance, but never stained NFT. Pretreatment of tissue sections with a mixture of endo and exoglycosidases gave identical results and corroborates the extraneuronal processing of BP A4 that appears in a glycosylated form in the extracellular compartment.
