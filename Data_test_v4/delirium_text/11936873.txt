11936873|t|On the structural form of iron in ferritin cores associated with progressive supranuclear palsy and Alzheimer's disease.
11936873|a|Recently, Quintana and others published the results of TEM investigations of ferritin cores extracted from the brain tissue of patients suffering from progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). These ferrihydrite (fFe2O3.9H2O) cores from the iron storage protein ferritin were found to contain a ferrous (Fe2+) iron-bearing biomineral with cubic structure similar to the magnetite standards which were measured. This is a highly important result as magnetic and electron microscopy analysis has demonstrated the presence of magnetite (Fe3O4) and maghemite (gammaFe2O3) in human brain tissue.
