34542070|a|BACKGROUND: Studies have found that blood lipids are associated with plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Two Abeta transporters, soluble form of low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (sLRP1) and soluble receptor of advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), are crucial in peripheral Abeta transport. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the effects of lipids on the relationships between plasma Abeta and transporter levels. METHODS: This study included 1,436 adults aged 40 to 88 years old. Blood Abeta, sLRP1, sRAGE, and lipid levels were measured. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to analyze the relationships between lipids and plasma Abeta, sLRP1, and sRAGE. RESULTS: After adjusting for all possible covariates, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-c) was positively associated with plasma Abeta42 and sRAGE (beta= 6.158, p = 0.049; beta= 121.156, p < 0.001, respectively), while triglyceride (TG) was negatively associated with plasma Abeta40, Abeta42, and sRAGE (beta= -48.389, p = 0.017; beta= -11.142, p = 0.020; beta= -147.937, p = 0.003, respectively). Additionally, positive correlations were found between plasma Abeta and sRAGE in the normal TG (Abeta40: beta= 0.034, p = 0.005; Abeta42: beta= 0.010, p = 0.001) and HDL-c groups (Abeta40: beta= 0.023, p = 0.033; Abeta42: beta= 0.008, p = 0.002) but not in the high TG and low HDL-c groups. CONCLUSION: Abnormal levels of TG and HDL-c are associated with decreased Abeta and sRAGE levels. Positive correlations between plasma Abeta and sRAGE were only found in the normal TG and HDL-c groups but not in the high TG and low HDL-c groups. These results indicated that dyslipidemia contributing to plasma Abeta levels might also be involved in peripheral Abeta clearance.
