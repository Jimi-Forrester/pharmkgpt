36469008|a|We propose the hypothesis that the cerebellar electrophysiology and sleep-wake cycles may be altered at the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), proceeding the amyloid-beta neuropathological hallmarks. The electrophysiologic characteristics of cerebellum thereby might be served as a biomarker in the prepathological detection of AD. Sleep disturbances are common in preclinical AD patients, and the cerebellum has been implicated in sleep-wake regulation by several pioneer studies. Additionally, recent studies suggest that the structure and function of the cerebellum may be altered at the early stages of AD, indicating that the cerebellum may be involved in the disease's progression. We used APPswe /PS1DeltaE9 mice as a model of AD, monitored and analyzed electroencephalogram data, and assessed neuropathological profiles in the cerebellum of AD mice. Our hypothesis may establish a linkage between the cerebellum and AD, thereby potentially providing new perspectives on the pathogenesis of the disease.
