36324397|a|Background: Subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) are associated with higher risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) have been also associated with cognitive decline, MCI, and dementia. Few studies have examined the associated of CVRF and SCC. Methods: Participants were cognitively normal Mexican Americans from the HABLE study. Participants were categorized as with and without SCC, and SCC was also measured as a continuous variable. CVRF diagnosis were ascertained during consensus review. Cognitive measures used were MMSE, Trails B, SEVLT, and digit span. Logistic regression and linear regression were used to asses the association of SCC with CVRF and cognitive scores. Results: A total of 673 participants [mean age 63.3 (SD=7.71), 69.2% female] were included. SCC was present in 323 participants (47.99%). Dyslipidemia and depression were associated with SCC. Individuals with dyslipidemia had 1.72 times the odds (95% CI = 1.20 to 2.47) of SCC, and those with depression had 3.15 times the odds (95% CI = 2.16 to 4.59) of self-reporting SCC. Higher SCC scores, were significantly associated with MMSE (B = 0.07; SE = 0.03; p = 0.02), and SEVLT immediate and delayed (B= -0.03; SE = 0.00; p = 0.000 and B = -0.03; SE = 0.00; p = 0.000, respectively). Conclusions: In a cognitively normal Mexican Americans sample of older adults, depression and dyslipidemia were correlated with self-reported SCC. A greater self-perception of cognitive decline correlated with lower scores on the MMSE and SEVLT.
