9428657|a|Heptylphysostigmine is in advanced clinical trial as a drug for Alzheimer's disease. 8-Morpholinooctylphysostigmine and 8-(cis-2,6-dimethylmorpholino)octylphysostigmine are currently undergoing pre-clinical evaluation. The mechanism of action of these compounds in the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase has been investigated. All the examined compounds display non competitive-like kinetics of inhibition. There are no reversible components in the observed inhibition: the whole inhibitory effect is due to the time-dependent pseudo-irreversible carbamylation of the active site. Yet the observed time course of the inhibition does not match a simple second order kinetics. An influence of the quaternary structure of the enzyme on the more complex kinetics of carbamylation is hypothesized. Reactivation experiments on the inhibited enzyme show long lasting inhibitory effects for these compounds. The higher duration of the anticholinesterase effect of the morpholino derivatives compared to heptylphysostigmine should provide the basis for their higher therapeutic potential.
