33241010|a|BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is reportedly caused by the synergistic effects of persistent high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Cervical microbiota represent a unique and dynamically changing microecological system that is directly exposed to the vagina. The relationship between HPV and the composition of the cervical microbiome has long been a primary focus of research. METHODS: To determine the specific differential florae throughout the process of cervical cancer development, in the present study, 16S rRNA sequencing was combined with KEGG pathway enrichment analysis to analyse five groups of cervical scraping samples with increasing durations of HPV infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia pathological classification. RESULTS: The findings revealed that decreasing levels of probiotics, including Shuttleworthia, Prevotella, Lactobacillus, and Sneathia, and increasing levels of pathogenic bacteria, including Dispar, Streptococcus, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, could be the direct result of early HPV infection. Other pathogenic bacteria, such as Bifidobacteriaceae, might represent key factors in cancer progression. Additionally, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that HPV infection directly inhibits multiple pathways, including those of sporulation, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, and ansamycin biosynthesis, which may lead to the development of early symptoms of cervical cancer. Biomarkers were predicted based on operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundance data, and OTU851726 and OTU715913 were undoubtedly the best potential indicators of cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study could assist with the development of a guideline for screening new clinical drugs for cervical cancer.
