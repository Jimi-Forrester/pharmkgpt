37347493|a|In this post-hoc analysis of the AXEPT study, 855 patients were analyzed, 544 (63.6%) females. The mean (+- SD) MMSE score in women vs men was 20.8 +- 2.6 vs. 21.2 +- 2.5; p = 0.0087, and women were more likely affected by psychiatric disorders (n = 76, 14.0% women vs. n = 21, 6.8% men; p = 0.0015). Men were mainly assisted by their wives (n = 207, 66.6%), women mainly by their daughters (n = 243, 44.7%) and only in a minority of cases by their husbands (n = 92, 16.9%). Women less frequently cohabited with their caregivers than men (n = 233, 43.1% vs. n = 240, 77.9%, p < 0.0001), and received less daily time of caregiving (mean (+- SD): 10.0 +- 7.2 vs. 15.2 +- 8.2; p < 0.0001). No gender differences were highlighted in compliance to treatment and caregiver satisfaction, while gender differences in caregiving were found at disadvantage of women affected by more severe cognitive and psychiatric conditions.
