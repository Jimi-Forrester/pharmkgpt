15926136|a|AIM: In this review we present and discuss the main risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) reported by epidemiological, genetic and biochemical studies. DEVELOPMENT: The most frequently mentioned factors are: 1. Age. It is the principal marker for the disease risk; 2. Sex. It is estimated that the prevalence of AD is higher in women than in men; 3. Genetics. Although the genetic role has been demonstrated, there is an important genetic heterogeneity; 4. Tobacco. Various studies have found a protective effect, however this effect could be attributed to survival bias; 5. Alcohol. The regular consumption of alcohol was associated with reduced incidence of AD, especially with wine consumption; 6. Family history of dementia. Nearly 40% of persons with AD have family history of dementia; 7. Non steroidal antiinflammatories (NSAIDs). The use of NSAIDS could help in reducing the symptoms of the disease or even avoid them; 8. Craneoencephalic trauma. The role of the craneoencephalic trauma is controversial; 9. Education. The increase of AD in low education persons was published; 10. Diet. The consumption of antioxidants in diet o in supplementary forms appears to be neuroprotector. CONCLUSIONS: The grand variety of published epidemiological studies with different methodology makes it difficult to find homogeneous results. This leaves us controversial impressions about how to prevent the disease.
