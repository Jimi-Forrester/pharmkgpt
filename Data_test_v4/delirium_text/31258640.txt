31258640|a|As an atherosclerotic disease, the process of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is complicated and includes the abnormal proliferation of vascular smooth muscle. The current study aimed to determine the role of microRNA-15b (miR-15b) in the development of PAD and its associated mechanisms. Human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs) were used in the current study. To assess the effects of miR-15b on hVSMCs, miR-15b was up- or downregulated in hVSMCs using miR-15b mimics or miR-15b inhibitors respectively. Cell viability, migration and apoptosis were then determined via MTT, transwell and flow cytometry assays, respectively. TargetScan bioinformatics software was utilized to predict the targets of miR-15b, and the binding sites between insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and miR-15b were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The results reveled that the miR-15b mimic significantly reduced hVSMC cell viability and migration, and promoted cell apoptosis. However, the opposite effect was observed following miR-15b inhibitor transfection. It was also determined that miR-15b directly targeted IGF1R and negatively regulated its expression in hVSMCs. Additionally, the results demonstrated that the miR-15b mimic inhibited the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in hVSMCs, whereas the miR-15b inhibitor promoted it. Furthermore, the results indicated that the effect of the miR-15b mimic on hVSMCs was reversed by IGF1R overexpression. In conclusion, the data indicated that miR-15b participated in the occurrence and development of PAD by modulating hVSMC proliferation, apoptosis and migration via the regulation of IGF1R expression.
