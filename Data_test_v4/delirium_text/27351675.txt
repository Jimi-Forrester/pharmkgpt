27351675|t|Regulation of SET Gene Expression by NFkB.
27351675|a|SET is elevated and mislocalized in the neuronal cytoplasm in brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS) patients. Cytoplasm SET leads to inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A and is involved in the tau pathology. However, the regulation of SET gene expression remains elusive. In the present study, we cloned a 1399-bp segment of the 5' flanking region of the human SET gene and identified that the transcription start site (TSS) of SET transcript 1 is located at 123 bp upstream of the translation start site ATG in exon 1. Sequence analysis reveals several putative regulatory elements including NFkB, Sp1, and HSE. Luciferase assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) identified a functional cis-acting NFkB-responsive element in the SET gene promoter. Overexpression and activation of NFkB upregulate transcription of SET isoform 1 but not isoform 2, indicating that the expression of these two isoforms is differentially regulated. The results demonstrate that NFkB plays an important role in regulation of the human SET gene expression. Our findings suggest that oxidative stress and inflammatory responses could result in abnormal SET gene expression, contributing to the tauopathy in AD pathogenesis.
