38296163|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major global health problem today and is the most common form of dementia. AD is characterized by the formation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary clusters, leading to decreased brain acetylcholine levels in the brain. Another mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of AD is the abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein that accumulates at the level of neurofibrillary aggregates, and the areas most affected by this pathological process are usually the cholinergic neurons in cortical, subcortical, and hippocampal areas. These effects result in decreased cognitive function, brain atrophy, and neuronal death. Malnutrition and weight loss are the most frequent manifestations of AD, and these are also associated with greater cognitive decline. Several studies have confirmed that a balanced low-calorie diet and proper nutritional intake may be considered important factors in counteracting or slowing the progression of AD, whereas a high-fat or hypercholesterolemic diet predisposes to an increased risk of developing AD. Especially, fruits, vegetables, antioxidants, vitamins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and micronutrients supplementation exert positive effects on aging-related changes in the brain due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and radical scavenging properties. The purpose of this review is to summarize some possible nutritional factors that may contribute to the progression or prevention of AD, understand the role that nutrition plays in the formation of Abeta plaques typical of this neurodegenerative disease, to identify some potential therapeutic strategies that may involve some natural compounds, in delaying the progression of the disease.
