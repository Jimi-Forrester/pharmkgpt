38399602|t|Efficacy of Supplemental Ultrasound-Guided Pericapsular Nerve Group (PENG) Block Combined with Lateral Femoral Cutaneous Nerve Block in Patients Receiving Local Infiltration Analgesia after Hip Fracture Surgery: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial.
38399602|a|Background and Objectives: Local infiltration analgesia (LIA) represents a potential approach to reducing pain in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA). The pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block also provides adequate analgesia for fractures and THA. As most hip surgeries use a lateral incision, affecting the cutaneous supply by branches of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN), the LFCN block can contribute to postoperative analgesia. However, no studies have investigated the effectiveness of supplemental PENG block combined with LFCN block in patients undergoing LIA after hip fracture surgery. Our study aimed to assess the effectiveness of PENG combined with LFCN block following hip fracture surgery in patients who underwent LIA. Materials and Methods: Forty-six patients were randomly assigned to LIA or PENG + LFCN + LIA groups. The primary outcome was the pain score at rest and during movement at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h postoperatively. The total opioid dose for postoperative analgesia was also measured at the same time points. Secondary outcomes included postoperative cognitive function assessment. Results: The median pain scores at rest and during movement were lower in the PENG + LFCN + LIA group throughout the study periods compared to the LIA group, except at 2 h (at rest) and 48 h (during movement) after surgery. The total fentanyl dose was lower in the PENG + LFCN + LIA group at all time points after surgery when compared to the LIA group. Postoperative delirium incidence and the median abbreviated mental test scores were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions: The combination of PENG and LFCN blocks may contribute to enhanced recovery for patients undergoing LIA after hip fracture surgery. However, further well-controlled research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of supplemental PENG combined with LFCN block in addressing cognitive deficits in these patients.
