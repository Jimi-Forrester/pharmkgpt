34112537|a|The use of 17 beta-estradiol and genistein in women with menopause helps in the reduction of vasomotor symptoms and cognitive improvement. There is evidence on the use of certain flavonoids such as genistein, which has a potentially neuroprotective role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Scientific evidence on the effects of phytoestrogens and genistein during menopause and their effect on cognition are scarce, however, in the present review it was found that the intervention with 17 beta-estradiol has positive effects on cognition in women with Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the use of genistein, daidzein or any supplement based on isoflavones may influence vasomotor symptoms. 17 beta-estradiol supplements in women in early menopause and with some degree of cognitive impairment may have beneficial effects.
