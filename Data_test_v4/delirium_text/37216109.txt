37216109|t|Low-temperature resin embedding of the whole brain for various precise structures dissection.
37216109|a|Resin embedding combined with ultra-thin sectioning has been widely used in microscopic and electron imaging to acquire precise structural information of biological tissues. However, the existing embedding method was detrimental to quenchable fluorescent signals of precise structures and pH-insensitive fluorescent dyes. Here, we developed a low-temperature chemical polymerization method named HM20-T to maintain weak signals of various precise structures and to decrease background fluorescence. The fluorescence preservation ratio of green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged presynaptic elements and tdTomato labeled axons doubled. The HM20-T method was suitable for a variety of fluorescent dyes, such as DyLight 488 conjugated Lycopersicon esculentum lectin. Moreover, the brains also retained immunoreactivity after embedding. In summary, the HM20-T method was suitable for the characterization of multi-color labeled precise structures, which would contribute to the acquisition of complete morphology of various biological tissues and to the investigation of composition and circuit connection in the whole brain.
