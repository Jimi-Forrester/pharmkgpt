38308229|t|The effect of haloperidol's perioperative application on postoperative delirium in elderly patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
38308229|a|OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the evidence about the effect of haloperidol on postoperative delirium in elderly patients. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were used to find concerned studies for meta-analysis. The main outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium, and the secondary outcomes were side effects of haloperidol and the length of hospital stay. The meta-analyses were conducted using the Review Manager Version 5.1. This study was conducted based on the PRISMA statement. RESULTS: Eight RCTs (1569 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. There was a significant difference in the incidence of postoperative delirium between haloperidol and control groups (OR = 0.62, 95%CI 0.48-0.80, P = 0.0002, I2 = 20%). In addition, side effects of haloperidol and the duration of hospitalization were comparable (OR = 0.58, 95%CI 0.25-1.35, P = 0.21, I2 = 0%; MD =-0.01, 95%CI -0.16-0.15, P = 0.92, I2 = 28%). Subgroup analysis implied the effect of haloperidol on postoperative delirium might vary with the dose (5 mg daily: OR = 0.40, 95%CI 0.22-0.71, P = 0.002, I2 = 0%; <5 mg daily: OR = 0.72, 95%CI 0.42-1.23, P = 0.23, I2 = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis revealed perioperative application of haloperidol could decrease the occurrence of postoperative delirium without obvious side effects in elderly people, and high-dose haloperidol (5 mg daily) possessed a greater positive effect.
