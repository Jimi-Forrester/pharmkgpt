31604561|a|Olfactory dysfunction seems to occur earlier than classic motor and cognitive symptoms in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, the use of the olfactory system as a clinical marker for neurodegenerative diseases is helpful in the characterization of prodromal stages of these diseases, early diagnostic strategies, differential diagnosis, and, potentially, prediction of treatment success. The use of genetic and neurotoxin animal models has contributed to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunction in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. In this chapter, we provide an overview of behavioral and neurochemical alterations observed in animal models of different neurodegenerative diseases (such as genetic and Abeta infusion models for AD and neurotoxins and genetic models of PD), in which olfactory dysfunction has been described.
