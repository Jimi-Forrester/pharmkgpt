33238370|a|The treatment of memory impairments associated with the central nervous system diseases remains an unmet medical need with social and economic implications. Here we show, that a multi-target ligand of aminergic G protein-coupled receptors with antipsychotic activity in vivo (D2AAK1) stimulates neuron growth and survival and promotes neuron integrity. We focused on the multilevel evaluation of the D2AAK1-related effects on neurons in terms of behavioral, cellular, molecular, and biochemical features in vivo and in vitro, such as memory-related responses, locomotor activity, tissue sections analysis, metabolic activity, proliferation level, neurons morphology, and proteins level involved in intracellular signaling pathways. In silico studies indicate that activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI) may underline some of the observed activities of the compound. Furthermore, the compound increases hippocampal neuron proliferation via the activation of neurotrophic factors and cooperating signals responsible for cell growth and proliferation. D2AAK1 improves memory and learning processes in mice after both acute and chronic administration. D2AAK1 also causes an increase in the number of hippocampal pyramidal neurons after chronic administration. Because of its neuroprotective properties and pro-cognitive activity in behavioral studies D2AAK1 has the potential for the treatment of memory disturbances in neurodegenerative and mental diseases.
