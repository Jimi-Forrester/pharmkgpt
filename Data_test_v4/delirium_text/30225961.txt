30225961|a|AIM: Geriatric syndromes are common among older individuals, and can affect their health and quality of life. The present study aimed to determine if combinations of geriatric syndromes affected adverse outcomes among older Koreans. METHODS: Korean national health insurance data were collected for a cohort of 5 058 720 individuals who were aged >=65 years in 2008. The same data source was used to follow these individuals until 2015. Diagnostic codes were used to assess four major geriatric syndromes (delirium, fall-related fractures, incontinence and pressure ulcers) and adverse outcomes (mortality and nursing home institutionalization). RESULTS: The prevalence of geriatric syndromes was 0.3% for delirium, 3.49% for fall-related fractures, 1.08% for incontinence and 0.82% for pressure ulcers. All four geriatric syndromes were associated with increased risks of institutionalization (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.18, 95% CI 2.08-2.17 for delirium; aHR 1.59, 95% CI 1.58-1.60 for fall-related fractures; aHR 1.43, 95% CI 1.41-1.44 for incontinence; and aHR 2.51, 95% CI 2.47-2.55 for pressure ulcers) and increased risks of mortality (aHR 2.13, 95% CI 2.08-2.17 for delirium; aHR 1.41, 95% CI 1.40-1.42 for fall-related fractures; aHR 1.09, 95% CI 1.07-1.10 for incontinence; and aHR 3.23, 95% CI 3.20-3.27 for pressure ulcers). The aHR for institutionalization were 1.64 (95% CI 1.63-1.65) for one geriatric syndrome, 2.40 (95% CI 2.35-2.44) for two coexisting geriatric syndromes and 2.56 (95% CI 2.35-2.74) for three coexisting geriatric syndromes. The aHR for mortality were 1.52 (95% CI 1.51-1.53) for one geriatric syndrome, 2.36 (95% CI 2.32-2.40) for two coexisting geriatric syndromes and 2.90 (95% CI 2.72-3.09) for three coexisting geriatric syndromes. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium, fall-related fractures, incontinence and pressure ulcers were associated with increased risks of institutionalization and mortality. The magnitude of these risks increased with increasing numbers of coexisting geriatric syndromes. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18: 1463-1468.
