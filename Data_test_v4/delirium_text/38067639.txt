38067639|t|Can We Improve Diosmetin Activity? The State-of-the-Art and Promising Research Directions.
38067639|a|Diosmetin is a natural substance widely distributed in nature, with documented multidirectional biological effects. The wide spectrum of biological activity of diosmetin gives hope that derivatives of this flavonoid may also be used as drugs or dietary supplements used in many diseases. Modification of the structure may, on the one hand, lead to an increase in biological potency, new biological activity, or an increase in solubility and thus bioavailability. This is an important direction of research because the use of pure diosmetin is limited due to its low bioavailability. This work is an attempt to collect information on the possibility of modifying the structure of diosmetin and its impact on biological activity.
