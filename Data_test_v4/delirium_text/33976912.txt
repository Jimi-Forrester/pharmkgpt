33976912|a|INTRODUCTION: We aimed to evaluate the superiority of different comorbidity indices in determining the most suitable elderly male candidates for uro-oncological operations. While making this assessment, we also aimed to determine the risk factors that may affect surgery-related major complications and overall survival. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data of 543 male patients, 60 years or older, who underwent uro-oncological surgery (radical cystectomy, radical prostatectomy, radical or partial nephrectomy, transurethral resection of bladder tumor) between September 2009 and January 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Demographic, clinical and pathological characteristics of the patients, preoperative comorbidity indices, postoperative complications, length of hospitalization, re-admission rates within 90 days and postoperative follow-up outcomes were recorded. Patients in similar tumor stages were divided into different subgroups. All subgroups were divided into two main categories: middle age (60-69 years-old) and elderly age (>=70-years-old). RESULTS: No significant difference was found for all types of surgery in terms of postoperative outcomes in both age groups (p >0.05). Age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (ACCI), Preoperative Score to Predict Postoperative Mortality (POSPOM), Rockwood Frailty Index (RFI) and tumor characteristics were found to be more significant predictors for postoperative major complications and overall mortality than Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that patient age alone is not a risk factor for increased postoperative complications and overall mortality. Although many different comorbidity indices have been used in urological practice, ACCI, POSPOM and RFI are more valuable predictors. Uro-oncological surgeries may be performed safely in elderly males after a good clinical decision based on these indices.
