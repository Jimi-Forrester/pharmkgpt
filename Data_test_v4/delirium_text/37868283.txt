Aim: To assess the effect of transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) combined with low-dose dexmedetomidine on elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy. Material and methods: Sixty-two elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy between March 2021 and March 2022 were randomly selected and equally divided into Group A (low-dose dexmedetomidine) and Group B (TAPB + low-dose dexmedetomidine) by the randomized double-blind method. The treatment outcomes were compared. Results: The resting and active Visual Analogue Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores were lower in Group B than those in Group A at 6 h, 1 day, 2 days and 3 days after operation (p < 0.05). The two groups had no significant differences in the levels of cluster of differentiation 4+ (CD4+), CD8+ and free Cor, CD4+/CD8+ ratio and NK cell level before anesthesia (p > 0.05). At 24 h after the operation, the level of CD4+, CD4+/CD8+ ratio and NK cell level were higher in Group B than those in Group A, and the levels of CD8+ and free Cor were lower in Group B (p < 0.05). Group B had higher partial pressure of oxygen ((45.52 +-11.14) mm Hg) and pH (7.42 +-0.06) (p < 0.05) and lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide ((4.05 +-0.32) mm Hg) than those of Group A (p < 0.05). Conclusions: TAPB combined with low-dose dexmedetomidine can exert better anesthetic, analgesic and sedative effects, and ameliorate stress responses.
