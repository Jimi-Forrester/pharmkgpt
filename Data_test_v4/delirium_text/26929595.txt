26929595|a|PURPOSE: Silent information regulator T1 (SIRT1), a member of the sirtuin family, has a preventive role in various ocular diseases. We evaluated the relations between the aqueous humor level of SIRT1 and age, sex, systemic diseases, the severity of lens opacity, and other factors. SETTING: This study was conducted at a university teaching hospital in Tokyo, Japan. DESIGN: This study was designed based on the consecutive case series. METHODS: Aqueous humor samples were obtained from 29 eyes of the 21 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for age-related cataract (ARC). SIRT1 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Aqueous humor levels of SIRT1 showed a positive correlation with visual acuity (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) and with the severity of nuclear cataract (r=0.32 and 0.30, respectively, P<0.05). However, only visual acuity was correlated with SIRT1 according to the stepwise multiple regression analysis (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that SIRT1 may have an effect on the formation of ARC, acting as a defensive factor against ARC.
