11146593|a|The acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin and other neurotransmitters may be reduced in the subcommissural regions even in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease(AD), due to hypoperfusion of the anterior perforating and anterior choroidal arteries. This hypothesis was confirmed after the transplant of omental tissue on the optic chiasma, carotid crotch and anterior perforated space in a woman with moderate AD. Neurological improvement was better in the first week after the surgery than in the following months.
