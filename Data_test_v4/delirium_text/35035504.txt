35035504|t|RNA Sequencing Analysis of Gene Expression by Electroacupuncture in Guinea Pig Gallstone Models.
35035504|a|BACKGROUND: Clinical studies have shown that electroacupuncture (EA) promotes gallbladder motility and alleviates gallstone. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of EA on gallstone is poorly understood. In this study, the mRNA transcriptome analysis was used to study the possible therapeutic targets of EA. METHODS: Hartley SPF guinea pigs were employed for the gallstone models. Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform was used for the RNA sequencing of guinea pig gallbladders in the normal group (Normal), gallstone model group (Model), and EA-treated group (EA). Differently expressed genes (DEGs) were examined separately in Model vs. Normal and EA vs. Model. DEGs reversed by EA were selected by comparing the DEGs of Model vs. Normal and EA vs. Model. Biological functions were enriched by gene ontology (GO) analysis. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was analyzed. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of EA, 257 DEGs in Model vs. Normal and 1704 DEGs in EA vs. Model were identified. 94 DEGs reversed by EA were identified among these DEGs, including 28 reversed upregulated DEGs and 66 reversed downregulated DEGs. By PPI network analysis, 10 hub genes were found by Cytohubba plugin of Cytoscape. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) verified the changes. CONCLUSION: We identified a few GOs and genes that might play key roles in the treatment of gallstone. This study may help understand the therapeutic mechanism of EA for gallstone.
