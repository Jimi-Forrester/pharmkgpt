28574413|t|Effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on post-surgical complications and mortality following a hip fracture: a cohort study.
28574413|a|There is increasing evidence suggesting that the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may have beneficial effects on bone. Data on the potential post-surgical effects of these medications on orthopedic interventions are very limited. This study was designed to determine whether the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is associated with a decrease in post-surgical mortality and complications in hip fracture patients with Alzheimer's disease. To accomplish this objective, a retrospective cohort study was performed using data from the Clinical Practice Research Database, UK. The study included 532 Alzheimer's disease patients of age 65 years and older, who sustained a hip fracture between 1998 and 2012. During the follow-up period, 34% of the patients died (n=182), 22% sustained a second hip fracture (n=118) and 5% (n=29) required reintervention. The users of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors had a 56% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR= 0.44, 95% CI 0.30-0.63) and a 41% reduction in second hip fracture incidence during a year of post-surgical follow-up (HR= 0.59, 95% CI 0.38-0.94) after adjusting for potential confounders. Our results show that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may have the potential to reduce all-cause mortality and the risk of suffering a second hip fracture during the first year after surgery.
