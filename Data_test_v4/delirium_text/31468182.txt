31468182|a|PURPOSE: Loss of brain synapses is an early pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease. The current study assessed synaptic loss in vivo with positron emission tomography and an 18F-labelled radiotracer of the synaptic vesicle protein 2A, [18F]UCB-H. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease and positive [18F]Flutemetamol amyloid-PET were compared to 19 healthy controls. [18F]UCB-H brain uptake was quantified with Logan graphical analysis using an image-derived blood input function. SPM12 and regions-of-interest (ROI) analyses were used for group comparisons of regional brain distribution volumes and for correlation with cognitive measures. RESULTS: A significant decrease of [18F]UCB-H uptake was observed in several cortical areas (11 to 18% difference) and in the thalamus (16% difference), with the largest effect size in the hippocampus (31% difference). Reduced hippocampal uptake was related to patients' cognitive decline (ROI analysis) and unawareness of memory problems (SPM and ROI analyses). CONCLUSIONS: The findings thus highlight predominant synaptic loss in the hippocampus, confirming previous autopsy-based studies and a recent PET study with an 11C-labelled SV2A radiotracer. [18F]UCB-H PET allows to image in vivo synaptic changes in Alzheimer's disease and to relate them to patients' cognitive impairment.
