36904213|t|Sex-Specific Response of the Brain Free Oxylipin Profile to Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Inhibition.
36904213|a|Oxylipins are the oxidation products of polyunsaturated fatty acids and have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, including dementia. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) converts epoxy-fatty acids to their corresponding diols, is found in the brain, and its inhibition is a treatment target for dementia. In this study, male and female C57Bl/6J mice were treated with an sEH inhibitor (sEHI), trans-4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-cyclohexyloxy]-benzoic acid (t-AUCB), for 12 weeks to comprehensively study the effect of sEH inhibition on the brain oxylipin profile, and modulation by sex. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure the profile of 53 free oxylipins in the brain. More oxylipins were modified by the inhibitor in males than in females (19 versus 3, respectively) and favored a more neuroprotective profile. Most were downstream of lipoxygenase and cytochrome p450 in males, and cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase in females. The inhibitor-associated oxylipin changes were unrelated to serum insulin, glucose, cholesterol, or female estrous cycle. The inhibitor affected behavior and cognitive function as measured by open field and Y-maze tests in males, but not females. These findings are novel and important to our understanding of sexual dimorphism in the brain's response to sEHI and may help inform sex-specific treatment targets.
