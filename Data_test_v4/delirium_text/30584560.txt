30584560|t|Hyper Acute Quadriplegia with Chronic Lead Toxicity; a Case Report.
30584560|a|Industrial lead toxicity is more common among miners. This type of toxicity occurs in two forms: acute and chronic. Chronic toxicity is associated with different levels of brain dysfunction, motor impairment, cognitive dysfunction, and neuropsychiatric problems, including depression, anxiety, irritability, and emotional disorders. However, quadriplegia induced by chronic toxicity is very rare. Here we report a 37-year-old male patient with a history of desert hunting, where he used to roll lead bullets in his mouth, who was admitted with sensory impairment, muscle weakness, and quadriplegia and final diagnosis of lead toxicity.
