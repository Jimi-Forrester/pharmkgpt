22864563|a|In this Extra View, we highlight recent Drosophila research that has uncovered a new role for the innate immune response. The research indicates that, in addition to combating infection, the innate immune response promotes neurodegeneration. Our publication (Petersen et al., 2012) reveals a correlative relationship between the innate immune response and neurodegeneration in a model of the human disease Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). We also found that glial cells are responsible for the innate immune response in the A-T model, and work by others implicates glial cells in neurodegeneration. Additionally, publications by Chinchore et al. (2012) and Tan et al. (2008) reveal a causative role for the innate immune response in models of human retinal degenerative disorders and Alzheimer disease, respectively. Collectively, these findings suggest that activation of the innate immune response is a shared cause of neurodegeneration in different human diseases.
