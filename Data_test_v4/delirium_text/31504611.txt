31504611|t|Prevalence and Risk Factors for Delirium in Elderly Patients With Severe Burns: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
31504611|a|Little is known about delirium in elderly burn center patients. The aim of this study is to provide information on the prevalence of delirium and risk factors contributing to the onset of delirium. All patients aged 70 years or older admitted with burn injuries to the Burn Center, Maasstad Hospital, in 2011 to 2017 were eligible for inclusion. We retrospectively collected data regarding the presence of delirium, potential risk factors contributing to the onset of delirium and outcome after delirium. We included elderly 90 patients in this study. The prevalence of delirium in our population was 13% (N = 12). Risk factors for delirium were advanced age, increased American Society for Anesthesiologists score, physical impairment and the use of anticholinergic drugs during admission. Patients with delirium had a poorer outcome, with prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality 6 and 12 months after discharge. Delirium is diagnosed in 13% of the elderly patients admitted to our burn center. Risk factors for delirium found in this study are advanced age, poor physical health status, physical impairment, and the use of anticholinergic drugs. Delirium is related to poor outcomes, including prolonged hospital stay and mortality after discharge.
