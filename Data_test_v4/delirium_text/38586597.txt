38586597|t|Review of Phenotypic Heterogeneity of Neuronal Intranuclear Inclusion Disease and NOTCH2NLC-Related GGC Repeat Expansion Disorders.
38586597|a|Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is an underdiagnosed neurodegenerative disorder caused by pathogenic GGC expansions in NOTCH2NLC. However, an increasing number of reports of NOTCH2NLC GGC expansions in patients with Alzheimer disease, essential tremor, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and oculopharyngodistal myopathy have led to the proposal of a new concept known as NOTCH2NLC-related GGC repeat expansion disorders (NREDs). The majority of studies have mainly focused on screening for NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat variation in populations previously diagnosed with the associated disease, subsequently presenting it as a novel causative gene for the condition. These studies appear to be clinically relevant but do have their limitations because they may incorrectly regard the lack of MRI abnormalities as an exclusion criterion for NIID or overlook concomitant clinical presentations not typically observed in the associated diseases. Besides, in many instances within these reports, patients lack pathologic evidence or undergo long-term follow-up to conclusively rule out NIID. In this review, we will systematically review the research on NOTCH2NLC 5' untranslated region GGC repeat expansions and their association with related neurologic disorders, explaining the limitations of the relevant reports. Furthermore, we will integrate subsequent studies to further demonstrate that these patients actually experienced distinct clinical phenotypes of NIID.
