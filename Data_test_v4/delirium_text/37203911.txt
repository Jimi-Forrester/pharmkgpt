37203911|a|Introduction: Dyslipidemia is the imbalance of various lipids in our body like cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein. It has been established as a major factor associated with cardiovascular disease. The aim of our study was to find out the prevalence of dyslipidemia among pilots visiting a tertiary care centre. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in the family medicine department of Grande International Hospital, Dhapasi, Kathmandu from 1 May 2022 to 30 July 2022 (Reference number: 08/2022). Seventy pilots were included in this study. Lipid profiles like total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were measured. Results: Among 70 pilots, only 2 (2.85%) (0-6.12, 90% Confidence Interval) had dyslipidemia with an increased level of triglycerides. Dyslipidemia was seen among pilots 41 to 60 years. Conclusions: Dyslipidemia among pilots was lower than in other studies done in similar settings. Keywords: dyslipidemia; lipids; pilot.
