37011667|a|This study on the longer-term health consequences of ovarian hormone deficiency (OHD) received the Henry Burger Prize in 2022. Osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and dementia are major degenerative diseases that are also causally associated with OHD. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) revealed no significant difference in bone mineral density by adding alendronate to ongoing menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) or combining alendronate at MHT initiation. Another RCT pursuing the effects on fracture recurrence and total mortality in women with hip fracture disclosed that MHT with percutaneous estradiol gel (PEG) and micronized progesterone (MP4) was comparable to risedronate. Basic studies reported that 17beta-estradiol exerted direct beneficial actions on vascular smooth muscle in cell proliferation, fibrinolysis and apoptosis. A fourth RCT showed that MP4 had a neutral impact on the PEG response of blood pressure and arterial stiffness. A fifth RCT suggested that the combination therapy of conjugated equine estrogen and MP4 was superior to tacrine in preserving activities in daily living in women with Alzheimer's disease. In addition, PEG plus MP4 attenuated cognitive decline in women with mild cognitive impairment in a sixth RCT. Finally, the all-cause mortality in recently menopausal women receiving MHT was updated using an adaptive meta-analysis of four RCTs.
