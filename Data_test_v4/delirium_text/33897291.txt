33897291|a|Glaucoma is the neurodegenerative disease of retinal ganglion cells. The main risk factor for glaucoma is increased intraocular pressure. The processes leading to cell death due to presence of the injury factor comprise multiple molecular mechanisms, as well as the immunological response. The knowledge of immunological mechanisms occurring in glaucomatous degeneration makes it possible to introduce glaucoma treatment modulating the cellular degradation. The glaucoma treatment of the future will make it possible not only to lower the intraocular pressure, but also to moderate the intracellular mechanisms in order to prevent retinal cell degeneration. Citicoline is a drug modulating glutamate excitotoxicity that is already in use. Rho kinase inhibitors were found to stimulate neurite growth and axon regeneration apart from lowering intraocular pressure. The complementary action of brimonidine is to increase neurotrophic factor (NTF) concentrations and inhibit glutamate toxicity. Immunomodulatory therapies with antibodies and gene therapies show promising effects in the current studies. The supplementation of NTFs prevents glaucomatous damage. Resveratrol and other antioxidants inhibit reactive oxygen species formation. Cell transplantation of stem cells, Schwann cells and nerve extracts was reported to be successful so far. Our review presents the most promising new strategies of neuroprotection and immunomodulation in glaucoma.
