37509744|t|Rapid Screening of Microalgae as Potential Sources of Natural Antioxidants.
37509744|a|In order to rapidly screen microalgae species as feedstocks for antioxidants, extracts were obtained from 16 microalgae strains (under 11 genera, 7 classes) using two methods: a one-step extraction with ethanol/water and a three-step fractionating procedure using hexane, ethylacetate, and water successively. Measuring the total phenol content (TPC), total carotenoid content (TCC), and antioxidant activity of the extracts, indicating TPC and TCC, played an important role in determining the antioxidant activity of the microalgae. A weighted scoring system was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity, and the scores of microalgal samples from two extraction methods were calculated using the same system. Among the investigated microalgae, Euglena gracilis SCSIO-46781 had the highest antioxidant score, contributing to high TPC and TCC, followed by Arthrospira platensis SCSIO-44012, Nannochloropsis sp. SCSIO-45224, Phaeodactylum tricornutum SCSIO-45120, and Nannochloropsis sp. SCSIO-45006, respectively. Additionally, the above-mentioned five strains are currently being applied in commercial production, indicating this system could be effective not only for screening microalgal antioxidants, but also for screening microalgal species/strains with strong adaptation to environmental stress, which is a critical trait for their commercial cultivation.
