36234346|t|A Water-Stable Zn-MOF Used as Multiresponsive Luminescent Probe for Sensing Fe3+/Cu2+, Trinitrophenol and Colchicine in Aqueous Medium.
36234346|a|A water-stable Zn-MOF was constructed based on H2PBA and 1, 10-phenanthroline under solvothermal conditions. The compound exhibited a 3D (2,3,8)-connected (43)2(46.66.815.12)(8) topology framework. The crystal structure and phase purity of the compound was verified by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Subsequently, some studies on the morphology, structure, and luminescent properties were carried out. The results showed that this compound could be used as a versatile chemosensor for Fe3+/Cu2+, trinitrophenol and colchicine via a luminescence quenching effect in an aqueous medium.
