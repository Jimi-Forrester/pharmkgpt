METHODS: Participants included 459 older adults diagnosed as cognitively normal (n = 202), or with non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n = 61), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n = 96), Alzheimer's disease dementia (n = 44), or LBD (n = 56). RESULTS: Speeded Attention demonstrated strong convergent validity and moderate discriminant validity when compared to established neuropsychological tests. Noise Pareidolia demonstrated strong discriminant validity, but limited convergent validity. Noise Pareidolia scores were significantly lower in those with reported hallucinations, delusions, or REM sleep behavior disorder symptoms. LBD Module tests discriminated well between cognitively normal adults and those with LBD. DISCUSSION: The LBD Module demonstrates promising construct validity and clinical utility, which support its use across research and clinical settings.
