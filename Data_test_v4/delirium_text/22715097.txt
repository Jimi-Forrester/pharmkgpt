22715097|a|Over 50% of all human cancers lose p53 function. To evaluate the role of aggregation in cancer, we asked whether wild-type (WT) p53 and the hot-spot mutant R248Q could aggregate as amyloids under physiological conditions and whether the mutant could seed aggregation of the wild-type form. The central domains (p53C) of both constructs aggregated into a mixture of oligomers and fibrils. R248Q had a greater tendency to aggregate than WT p53. Full-length p53 aggregated into amyloid-like species that bound thioflavin T. The amyloid nature of the aggregates was demonstrated using x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, FTIR, dynamic light scattering, cell viabilility assay, and anti-amyloid immunoassay. The x-ray diffraction pattern of the fibrillar aggregates was consistent with the typical conformation of cross beta-sheet amyloid fibers with reflexions of 4.7 A and 10 A. A seed of R248Q p53C amyloid oligomers and fibrils accelerated the aggregation of WT p53C, a behavior typical of a prion. The R248Q mutant co-localized with amyloid-like species in a breast cancer sample, which further supported its prion-like effect. A tumor cell line containing mutant p53 also revealed massive aggregation of p53 in the nucleus. We conclude that aggregation of p53 into a mixture of oligomers and fibrils sequestrates the native protein into an inactive conformation that is typical of a prionoid. This prion-like behavior of oncogenic p53 mutants provides an explanation for the negative dominance effect and may serve as a potential target for cancer therapy.
