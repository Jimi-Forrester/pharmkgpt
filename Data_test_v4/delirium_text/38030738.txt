38030738|t|Norepinephrine prevents hypotension in older patients under spinal anesthesia with intravenous propofol sedation: a randomized controlled trial.
38030738|a|Reducing hypotension is crucial as hypotension is the most common side effect of spinal anesthesia, and in older patients with various comorbidities, it can lead to fatality. We hypothesized that continuous infusion of norepinephrine could effectively prevent hypotension in older patients undergoing hip surgery under spinal anesthesia with propofol sedation. The study randomly assigned patients aged >= 70 years to either a control (Group C, n = 35) or a norepinephrine group (Group N, n = 35). After spinal anesthesia, continuous infusion of propofol and normal saline or norepinephrine was initiated. The number of hypotensive episodes, the primary outcome, as well as other intraoperative hemodynamic events and postoperative complications were compared. In total, 67 patients were included in the final analysis. The number of hypotensive episodes was significantly higher in Group C than in Group N (p < 0.001). Furthermore, Group C required a greater amount of fluid to maintain normovolemia (p = 0.008) and showed less urine output (p = 0.019). However, there was no difference in postoperative complications between the two groups. Continuous intravenous infusion of prophylactic norepinephrine prevented hypotensive episodes, reduced the requirement of fluid, and increased the urine output in older patients undergoing unilateral hip surgery under spinal anesthesia with propofol sedation.Clinical trial registration number: KCT0005046 ( https://cris.nih.go.kr ).
