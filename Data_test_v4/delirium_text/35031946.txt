35031946|a|The accumulation and propagation of misfolded proteins in the brain is a pathological hallmark shared by many neurodegenerative diseases, such as the depositions of beta-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in Alzheimer's disease. Initial evidence shows the role of nitric oxide synthases in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. A recent, in an exciting paper (Bourgognon et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 118, 1-11, 2021. 10.1073/pnas.2009579118) it was shown that the inducible nitric oxide synthase plays an important role in promoting oxidative and nitrergic stress leading to neuroinflammation and consequently neuronal function impairments and decline in synaptic strength in mouse prion disease. In this context, we reviewed the possible mechanisms of nitric oxide synthase in the generation of neurodegenerative diseases.
