14741412|t|Possible association between Cys311Ser polymorphism of paraoxonase 2 gene and late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Chinese.
14741412|a|The common polymorphism at codon 311 (C311S) of paraoxonase 2 gene (PON2) was investigated in 165 patients with sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and 174 controls in Chinese. The PON2*C allele frequency was significantly increased in the patients as compared with controls. However, no significant difference was observed after stratification of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 allele. These results suggested that the PON2 polymorphism might be a risk factor for LOAD independent of ApoE epsilon4 status in Chinese.
