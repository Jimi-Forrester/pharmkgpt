31689778|t|Postoperative delirium after hysteroscopy in young woman: A case report.
31689778|a|RATIONALE: Postoperative delirium is extremely rare in young women and in minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries in gynecology and obstetrics. It greatly affects both physicians and patients. This report presents a special case of postoperative delirium after hysteroscopy in a young woman and a literature review of the associated etiology, diagnosis, and treatment. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 39-year-old woman was admitted to the gynecology ward following irregular vaginal bleeding for 3 months and an intrauterine space-occupying lesion for 1 week. Hysteroscopy, endometrial polypectomy, and fractional curettage procedures were successfully performed; however, the patient became unresponsive after surgery. DIAGNOSIS: Postoperative delirium. INTERVENTIONS: Sedatives and vasoactive medicines, such as dexmedetomidine, midazolam, and dopamine were administered for maintenance treatment. OUTCOMES: The patients gradually regained consciousness. LESSONS: Physicians should attach importance and improvise effective clinical management strategies for postoperative delirium based on clinical specialty characteristics and related guidelines.
