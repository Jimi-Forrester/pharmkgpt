35831620|a|The development of disease-modifying drugs and differential diagnostic agents is an urgent medical need in Parkinson's disease. Despite the complex pathophysiological pathway, the misfolding of alpha-synuclein has been identified as a putative biomarker for detecting the onset and progression of the neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's disease. Identifying the most appropriate alpha-synuclein-based diagnostic modality with clinical translation will revolutionize the diagnosis of Parkinson's. Likewise, molecules that target alpha-synuclein could alter the disease pathway that leads to Parkinson's and may serve as first-in class therapeutics compared to existing treatment options such as levodopa and dopamine agonist that do not necessarily modify the disease pathway. Notwithstanding the promising benefits that alpha-synuclein presents to therapeutics and diagnostics development for Parkinson's disease, finding ways to address potential challenges such as inadequate preclinical models, safety and efficacy will be paramount to achieving clinical translation. In this comprehensive review paper, we described the role of alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, as well as how its structure and function relationship delineate disease onset and progression. We further discussed different alpha-synuclein-based diagnostic modalities including biomolecular assays and molecular imaging. Finally, we presented current small molecules and biologics that are being developed as disease-modifying drugs or positron emission tomography imaging probes for Parkinson's disease.
