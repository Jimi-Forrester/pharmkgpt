38357643|a|Background: This study aims to explore the value of the Lymphocyte-to-Monocyte Ratio (LMR) in predicting delirium among older adult patients with sepsis. Methods: Retrospective data were obtained from the MIMIC-IV database in accordance with the STROBE guidelines. Patients aged 65 and above, meeting the Sepsis 3.0 criteria, were selected for this study. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). Demographic information, comorbid conditions, severity of illness scores, vital sign measurements, and laboratory test results were meticulously extracted. The prognostic utility of the Lymphocyte-to-Monocyte Ratio (LMR) in predicting delirium was assessed through logistic regression models, which were carefully adjusted for potential confounding factors. Results: In the studied cohort of 32,971 sepsis patients, 2,327 were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. The incidence of delirium within this subgroup was observed to be 55%. A univariate analysis revealed a statistically significant inverse correlation between the Lymphocyte-to-Monocyte Ratio (LMR) and the risk of delirium (p < 0.001). Subsequent multivariate analysis, which accounted for comorbidities and illness severity scores, substantiated the role of LMR as a significant predictive marker. An optimized model, achieving the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), incorporated 17 variables and continued to demonstrate LMR as a significant prognostic factor (p < 0.01). Analysis of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve indicated a significant enhancement in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) upon the inclusion of LMR (p = 0.035). Conclusion: The Lymphocyte-to-Monocyte Ratio (LMR) serves as a significant, independent prognostic indicator for the occurrence of delirium in older adult patients with sepsis. Integrating LMR into existing predictive models markedly improves the identification of patients at elevated risk, thereby informing and potentially guiding early intervention strategies.
