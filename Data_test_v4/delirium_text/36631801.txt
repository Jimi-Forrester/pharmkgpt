36631801|t|The effect of skin traction on pain relief in patients with isolated intertrochanteric fractures, a randomized clinical trial.
36631801|a|BACKGROUND: Hip fractures are common in elderly patients. The surgery is usually delayed due to underlying conditions, and pain control is crucial while the patient is cleared for surgery. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT) study, we hypothesized that the application of skin traction in patients with intertrochanteric fracture does not significantly change the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) of pain. METHODS: This is a prospective, single institution, parallel randomized controlled trial. Two hundred and twenty-nine patients with isolated intertrochanteric fractures were enrolled in the study. Patients with neurologic issues, drug addiction, scars or swelling, or vascular issues at the site of skin traction application were excluded from the study. Patients were divided into two groups: group A included 97 patients, and group B included 95 patients. Skin traction was applied for group A, while only a soft pillow was put beneath the patients' knees in the other group. The VAS score was measured after the diagnosis, two hours before the operation, and 24 h after the surgery. The morphine dosage administered per day was documented for both groups. RESULTS: After excluding patients with postoperative delirium, 154 patients (55 males and 99 females) with isolated intertrochanteric fractures (69 right-sided and 85 left-sided), and a mean age of 70 +- 10 remained in the study. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding age, gender, and mean time from injury to admission (P > .05). The mean VAS score measures and morphine dosage administered per day were not significantly different between the two groups (P > .05). Both groups experienced significant pain relief 24 h postoperatively (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Pre-operative skin traction application affected neither the patients' VAS scores nor the mean morphine dosage per day in patients with isolated intertrochanteric fractures. Our data does not support the routine application of pre-operative skin traction in patients with intertrochanteric fractures. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The project was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (registration reference: IRCT20180729040636N3, registration date: 01/07/2020). LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1:
