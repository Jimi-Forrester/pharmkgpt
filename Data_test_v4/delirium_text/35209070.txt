35209070|a|Discovering new and effective drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major clinical challenge. This study focuses on chemical modulation of the gut microbiome in an established murine AD model. We used the 16S rDNA sequencing technique to investigate the effect of xanthohumol (Xn) on the diversity of intestinal microflora in 2-month- and 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice, respectively. APP/PS1 and wild-type mice were treated by gavage with corn oil with or without Xn every other day for 90 days. Prior to and following treatment, animals were tested for spatial learning, cognitive and memory function. We found Xn reduced cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice and significantly regulated the composition and abundance of gut microbiota both in prevention experiments (with younger mice) and therapeutic experiments (with older mice). Differential microflora Gammaproteobacteria were significantly enriched in APP/PS1 mice treated with Xn. Nodosilineaceae and Rikenellaceae may be the specific microflora modulated by Xn. The penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis pathway and the atrazine degradation pathway may be the principal modulation pathways. Taken together, oral treatment with Xn may have a neuroprotective role by regulating the composition of intestinal microflora, a result that contributes to the scientific basis for a novel prophylactic and therapeutic approach to AD.
