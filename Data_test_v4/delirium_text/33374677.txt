33374677|t|Alteration within the Hippocampal Volume in Patients with LHON Disease-7 Tesla MRI Study.
33374677|a|PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the volumetry of the hippocampus in the Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) of blind patients. METHODS: A total of 25 patients with LHON were randomly included into the study from the national health database. A total of 15 patients were selected according to the inclusion criteria. The submillimeter segmentation of the hippocampus was based on three-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled acquisition in steady state (3D-SPGR) BRAVO 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed that compared to healthy controls (HC), LHON subjects had multiple significant differences only in the right hippocampus, including a significantly higher volume of hippocampal tail (p = 0.009), subiculum body (p = 0.018), CA1 body (p = 0.002), hippocampal fissure (p = 0.046), molecular layer hippocampus (HP) body (p = 0.014), CA3 body (p = 0.006), Granule Cell (GC) and Molecular Layer (ML) of the Dentate Gyrus (DG)-GC ML DG body (p = 0.003), CA4 body (p = 0.001), whole hippocampal body (p = 0.018), and the whole hippocampus volume (p = 0.023). DISCUSSION: The ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging allowed hippocampus quality visualization and analysis, serving as a powerful in vivo diagnostic tool in the diagnostic process and LHON disease course assessment. The study confirmed previous reports regarding volumetry of hippocampus in blind individuals.
