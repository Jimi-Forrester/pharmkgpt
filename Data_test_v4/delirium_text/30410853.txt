30410853|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes recent studies on the molecular mechanisms of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that control neurological functions and pathogenesis in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and spinocerebellar ataxia. RECENT FINDINGS: RBPs are critical players in gene expression that regulate every step of posttranscriptional modifications. Recent genome-wide approaches revealed that many proteins associate with RNA, but do not contain any known RNA binding motifs. Additionally, many causal and risk genes of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are RBPs. Development of high-throughput sequencing methods has mapped out the fingerprints of RBPs on transcripts and provides unprecedented potential to discover new mechanisms of neurological diseases. Insights into how RBPs modulate neural development are important for designing effective therapies for numerous neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. SUMMARY: RBPs have diverse mechanisms for modulating RNA processing and, thereby, controlling neurogenesis. Understanding the role of disease-associated RBPs in neurogenesis is vital for developing novel treatments for neurological diseases.
