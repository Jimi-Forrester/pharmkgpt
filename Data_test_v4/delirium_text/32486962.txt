32486962|t|Molecular Targets from Traditional Medicines for Neuroprotection in Human Neurodegenerative Diseases.
32486962|a|Neurodegeneration is one of the greatest threats to global public health. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease are among the major causes of chronic neurological conditions in the elderly populations. Hence, neuroprotection is at the epicenter of the current 21st-century research agenda in biomedicine. Yet, novel molecular targets are limited and solely needed for neuroprotection. Marked person-to-person variations in outcomes require a deeper understanding of drug targets in neurology and clinical neurosciences. In this context, traditional medicines offer untapped potentials for discovery and translation of novel molecular targets to human neurodegenerative disease research and clinical neurology. This expert review offers a synthesis of the prospects and challenges of harnessing new molecular targets from traditional medicines, with a view to applications for neuroprotection in human neurodegenerative diseases.
