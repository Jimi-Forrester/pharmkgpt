37779143|a|Glial cell activation precedes neuronal cell death during brain aging and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Under neuroinflammatory stress conditions, lipocalin-2 (LCN2), also known as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin or 24p3, is produced and secreted by activated microglia and reactive astrocytes. Lcn2 expression levels are known to be increased in various cells, including reactive astrocytes, through the activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. In the central nervous system, as LCN2 exerts neurotoxicity when secreted from reactive astrocytes, many researchers have attempted to identify various strategies to inhibit LCN2 production, secretion, and function to minimize neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death. These strategies include regulation at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational levels, as well as blocking its functions using neutralizing antibodies or antagonists of its receptor. The suppression of NF-kappaB signaling is a strategy to inhibit LCN2 production, but it may also affect other cellular activities, raising questions about its effectiveness and feasibility. Recently, LCN2 was found to be a target of the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Therefore, autophagy activation may be a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce the levels of secreted LCN2 and overcome neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we focused on research progress on astrocyte-derived LCN2 in the central nervous system.
