12210343|a|The presenilin genes encode proteins that modify, mediate, or perform similar functions to gamma-secretase, the enzyme responsible for converting amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) into beta-amyloid. Mutations in the presenilin genes cause an increased production of Abeta42, the aberrant form of beta-amyloid found in the neural plaques of Alzheimer disease patients. Previously reported association studies of presenilin 2 (PSEN2) polymorphisms with early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) have produced contradictory results. In an effort to resolve these differences, we tested eight single nucleotide polymorphisms in and around the 3' region of the PSEN2 gene for association with EOAD. An initial set of Scottish EOAD cases (n = 121) and controls (n = 152) was screened using the genotyping method dynamic allele-specific hybridization (DASH). No significant differences were seen between allele or genotype frequencies of cases and controls. However, when conditioned on the risk allele (epsilon 4) APOE, three polymorphisms showed allelic association with a P value below 0.05. These same polymorphisms were in near 100% linkage disequilibrium with each other (P < 5 x 10(-5)), and in each, one of the homozygous genotypes was absent in controls but present in the cases. Replication in an independent set of Scottish EOAD cases (n = 84) and controls (n = 173) did not confirm this finding. From this study we find no evidence to suggest that variations in the PSEN2 gene pose as major risk factors for sporadic EOAD.
