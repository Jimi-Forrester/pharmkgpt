34181215|t|Investigation and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in older patients with delirium: a cross-sectional survey of Canadian physicians.
34181215|a|OBJECTIVES: Current guidelines suggest assessing non-infectious causes and careful observation before giving antibiotics to delirious patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Our study aims to describe the current practice of Canadian physicians regarding the investigation and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in delirious older patients (aged >= 65 years). METHODS: Our team of medical experts designed and reviewed a cross-sectional online survey. Study participants were physicians who conduct their clinical practice in Canada and care for older patients with delirium in their current practice. Potential study participants were reached through Canadian associations: Canadian Geriatrics Society, the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, the Association des Medecins d'Urgence du Quebec and members of Choosing Wisely Canada. RESULTS: 297 physicians were included. The main results show 79.4% of our participants request a urine dipstick or urinalysis in delirious patients and 52.4% immediately order a urine culture with the urinalysis. If bacteriuria is found in delirious but afebrile patients without urinary symptoms, 38% of physicians immediately treat with antibiotics, 33.8% wait for culture before initiating treatment, 14.4% treat if no other cause is found for delirium and only 13.7% would refrain from giving antibiotics. Results from respondents were similar for delirious patients with known cognitive impairment. Participants were almost unanimous (92.5%) in saying they need clear guidelines regarding the treatment of bacteriuria in older delirious patients. CONCLUSIONS: This survey highlights the heterogeneous clinical management of asymptomatic bacteriuria in delirious patients and the need for clear guidelines for patients.
