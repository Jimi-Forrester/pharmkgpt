38455030|t|Inhibition of toxic metal-alpha synuclein interactions by human serum albumin.
38455030|a|Human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant protein in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, not only serves as a crucial carrier of various exogenous and endogenous ligands but also modulates the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins, including alpha synuclein (alphaSyn), which is associated with Parkinson's disease and other alpha-synucleinopathies. HSA decreases alphaSyn toxicity through the direct binding to monomeric and oligomeric alphaSyn species. However, it is possible that HSA also sequesters metal ions that otherwise promote aggregation. Cu(ii) ions, for example, enhance alphaSyn fibrillization in vitro, while also leading to neurotoxicity by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it is currently unclear if and how HSA affects Cu(ii)-binding to alphaSyn. Using an integrated set of NMR experiments, we show that HSA is able to chelate Cu(ii) ions from alphaSyn more efficiently than standard chelators such as EDTA, revealing an unexpected cooperativity between the HSA metal-binding sites. Notably, fatty acid binding to HSA perturbs this cooperativity, thus interfering with the sequestration of Cu(ii) ions from alphaSyn. We also observed that glycation of HSA diminished Cu(ii)-binding affinity, while largely preserving the degree of cooperativity between the HSA metal-binding sites. Additionally, our results show that Cu(ii)-binding to HSA stabilizes the interactions of HSA with alphaSyn primarily at two different regions, i.e. the N-terminus, Tyr 39 and the majority of the C-terminus. Our study not only unveils the effect of fatty acid binding and age-related posttranslational modifications, such as glycation, on the neuroprotective mechanisms of HSA, but also highlights the potential of alphaSyn as a viable NMR-based sensor to investigate HSA-metal interactions.
