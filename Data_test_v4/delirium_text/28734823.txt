28734823|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium in critically ill patients is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Neuroinflammation might be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of delirium, and since simvastatin has anti-inflammatory properties it might reduce delirium. We aimed to establish whether early treatment with simvastatin would decrease the time that survivors of critical illness spent in delirium or coma. METHODS: We undertook this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in a general adult intensive care unit (ICU) in Watford General Hospital (Watford, UK). We enrolled critically ill patients (>=18 years) needing mechanical ventilation within 72 h of admission. We randomly assigned patients (1:1 ratio) to receive either simvastatin 80 mg or placebo daily for up to a maximum of 28 days, irrespective of coma or delirium status. We assessed delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). The primary outcome was number of days alive and was assessed as delirium-free and coma-free in the first 14 days after being randomly allocated to receive treatment or placebo. ICU clinical and research staff and patients were masked to treatment. We did intention-to-treat analyses with no extrapolation. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Registry, number ISRCTN89079989. FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, 2013, and July 29, 2016, 142 patients were randomly assigned to receive simvastatin (n=71) or placebo (n=71), and were included in the final analysis. The mean number of days alive without delirium and without coma at day 14 did not differ significantly between the two groups (5 7 days [SD 5 1] with simvastatin and 6 1 days [5 2] with placebo; mean difference 0 4 days, 95% CI -1 3 to 2 1; p=0 66). The most common adverse event was an elevated creatine kinase concentration to more than ten times the upper limit of normal (eight [11%] in the simvastatin group vs three [4%] in the placebo group p=0 208). No patient had a serious adverse event related to the study drug. INTERPRETATION: These results do not support the hypothesis that simvastatin modifies duration of delirium and coma in critically ill patients. FUNDING: National Institute for Health Research.
