30942115|a|AIM: Exertional heastroke (EHS) can lead to acute kidney injury. Oral rehydration solution III (ORS III), recommended by WHO in 2004, is used to rehydrate children with gastroenteritis. This study aimed to characterize the renoprotective effect of ORS III in EHS rats. METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into Group Control, Group EHS, Group EHS + Water, and Group EHS + ORS. Thirty minutes before the experiment, ORS III was orally administrated to Group EHS + ORS, Water was given to Group EHS + Water. Rats from Group EHS, Group EHS + Water and Group EHS + ORS were then forced to run until they fatigued. Core temperature (Tc) was monitored and 40.5  C was considered as the onset of heatstroke. Serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured using an automated biochemical analyzer. Serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) was measured using an NGAL ELISA Kit. Light microscopy was used for kidney structural analysis. RESULTS: SCr level in Group EHS was no different from Group Control (p > .05), while BUN and NGAL levels in Group EHS were higher than Group Control (p <.001, p < .001). SCr, BUN and NGAL concentrations in group EHS + Water were no different from Group EHS (p > .05). SCr, BUN levels in Group EHS + ORS were no different from Group EHS (p > .05). But NGAL levels were significant in these two groups (p = .012). Renal histopathologies of rats in Group EHS and Group EHS + Water showed flattened lumens filled with eosinophilic materials. The damage was milder in Group EHS + ORS, in which injured tubules showed degeneration of the tubular epithelium and sloughing of the brush border membrane. CONCLUSION: ORS III could alleviate the kidney injury in EHS rats.
