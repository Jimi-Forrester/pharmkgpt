29224729|t|Different Cognitive Complaint Profiles in Memory Clinic and Depressive Patients.
29224729|a|OBJECTIVE: Cognitive complaints are considered early indicators of incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD) but are very common in geriatric patients, especially in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The clinical assessment of cognitive complaints is still poorly operationalized. Recent qualitative research suggests that certain phenomenologic complaint themes may have some specificity for prodromal AD. The aim of the study was to replicate and explore their occurrence in a clinical setting. METHODS: In a cross-sectional, case-control study using a mixed-methods approach, 23 memory clinic (cognitive complainers [CC]) patients, 21 psychiatric inpatients with MDD, and 21 healthy control subjects, aged 55-86 years, were assessed at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy and German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Bonn. A newly developed semistructured interview addressing 12 complaint themes was used, and transcribed open format responses were coded by qualitative expert rating (theme absent versus present) and compared between the groups. RESULTS: Seven complaint themes (e.g., sense of predomination, progression) were significantly more often endorsed by the CC group, together with a novel theme of "distractible speech." Complaint themes in those with depression aligned with the depressive symptoms and appeared to be partly different from the complaint pattern of the CC group. CONCLUSION: Previously established themes were found to be feasible for conversion into a semistructured interview. Several complaint phenotypes were confirmed and previous themes significantly expanded by providing first evidence for a qualitatively different complaint profile in MDD compared with CC. Future investigations may benefit from better characterizing the phenomenologic and qualitative characteristics of AD-related complaints.
