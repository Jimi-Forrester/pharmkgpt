26419490|t|First magenetic resonance imaging studies on aluminium maltolate-treated aged New Zealand rabbits: an Alzheimer's animal model.
26419490|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a devastative neurodegenerative disorder. To date, there has been no animal model that could unravel the complete disease pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging has played a pivotal role in the quantitative assessment of brain tissue atrophy for a few decades. In particular, temporal lobe atrophy and ventricular dilatation have been found to be sensitive in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The present study focused on the replication of these crucial pathological events to enable disease progression to be diagnosed at an early stage and stopped through the use of potential therapeutic strategies. RESULT: The objective of this study was to show temporal lobe atrophy and ventricular dilatation in aluminium maltolate-treated aged New Zealand rabbit, and our study was able to demonstrate this for the first time. CONCLUSION: The present study makes this animal model a substantial one for further molecular level studies and opens up new targets for potential therapeutic strategies.
