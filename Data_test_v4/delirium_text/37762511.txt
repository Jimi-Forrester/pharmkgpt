37762511|t|A Human Brain Model Mimicking Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells for the Treatment of Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury.
37762511|a|We used an in vitro model of the human brain immune microenvironment to simulate hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) and treatment with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUMSCs) to address the transformation barriers of gene differences between animals and humans in preclinical research. A co-culture system, termed hNAME, consisted of human hippocampal neurons (N), astrocytes (A), microglia (M), and brain microvascular endothelial cells (E). Flow cytometry measured the apoptosis rates of neurons and endothelial cells. hNAME-neurons and endothelial cells experienced more severe damage than monolayer cells, particularly after 48 h and 24 h of reoxygenation (OGD48/R24). Western blotting identified neuroinflammatory response markers, including HIF-1alpha, C1q, C3, TNF-alpha, and iNOS. Inflammatory factors originated from the glial chamber rather than the neurons and vascular endothelial chambers. A gradual increase in the release of inflammatory factors was observed as the OGD and reoxygenation times increased, peaking at OGD48/R24. The hNAME value was confirmed in human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUMSCs). Treatment with hUMSCs resulted in a notable decrease in the severity of neuronal and endothelial cell damage in hNAME. The hNAME is an ideal in vitro model for simulating the immune microenvironment of the human brain because of the interactions between neurons, vessels, astrocytes, and microglia.
