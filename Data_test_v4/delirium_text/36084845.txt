36084845|a|2021 was the year of the 100th anniversary of the first administration of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) to a human being. It was the start of a long journey of the world's most widely used vaccine and the oldest vaccine still in use. More than 4 billion children have been vaccinated with BCG for protection against tuberculosis. However, over the years it became apparent that BCG also has beneficial non-specific effects. As such, it provides protection against various heterologous infectious and non-infectious diseases and is used to treat non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. As BCG was developed at the Institut Pasteur de Lille by Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin, the Institute has celebrated this important anniversary with an international scientific symposium on all aspects of BCG, held from November 17 to 19, 2021 at the Institut Pasteur de Lille. It covered BCG against tuberculosis and described novel vaccine approaches, the effect of BCG against heterologous infections, including BCG and COVID-19, the effect of BCG against cancer, and BCG against auto-immune and inflammatory diseases. To discuss these areas, the symposium gathered close to 200 participants from all five continents, 2/3 on-line. This article presents the highlights of this 3rd International Symposium on BCG.
