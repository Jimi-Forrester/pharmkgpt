30647232|a|Datura plants contain anticholinergic properties. Consumers may present with a spectrum of anticholinergic symptoms, including hallucination, agitation, tachycardia, delirium, hyperthermia, and dilated pupils. Prompt identification of the symptoms with appropriate treatment can be life-saving. Some patients might not be able to provide history and therefore recognition of toxidromes is imperative. Awareness should be built among the public who may be exposed to such fruits or plants.
