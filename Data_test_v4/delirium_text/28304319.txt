28304319|t|A case of infant delirium in the neonatal intensive care unit.
28304319|a|Infant delirium is an under-recognized clinical entity in neonatal intensive care, and earlier identification and treatment could minimize morbidities associated with this condition. We describe a case of a 6-month-old former 32 weeks gestation infant undergoing a prolonged mechanical ventilation course diagnosed with delirium related to the combination of his underlying illness and the use of multiple sedative and analgesic medications. Initiation of the atypical antipsychotic risperidone allowed for weaning from continuous infusions of benzodiazepines and opiods, and lower dosages of bolus-dosed sedation and analgesics. The patient experienced no adverse side effects from use of this neuroleptic.
