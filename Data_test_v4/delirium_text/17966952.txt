17966952|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify the possible anatomic sites and risk factors for the development of confusion or delirium in patients with posterior cerebral arterial (PCA) infarction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients aged 34-86 years with PCA infarction were divided into two groups: one with and the other without perturbed mentation. The clinical and laboratory data, including neuroimages, were retrospectively reviewed. Student-t, chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were performed for data analysis. RESULTS: Confusion or delirium tended to develop in the left (10/13) or bilateral (5/5) PCA infarction as compared to the right PCA infarction (3/15) (P< 0.05) and medial occipital-temporal gyri involvement was crucial for its development (P< 0.05). The results were also noted in the patients with first-ever stroke. Diabetes mellitus was the sole biochemical factor to be associated with confusion or delirium (P< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The involvement of the medial occipito-temporal gyri, especially on the left side was the pivotal factor for the development of confusion or delirium in patients with PCA infarction. Higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus was also observed in the group with mental perturbation.
