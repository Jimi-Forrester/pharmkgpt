29462849|a|Neuroinflammation is an immune response within the central nervous system against various proinflammatory stimuli. Abnormal activation of this response contributes to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington disease. Therefore, pharmacologic modulation of abnormal neuroinflammation is thought to be a promising approach to amelioration of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we evaluated the synthetic flavone derivative 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone, investigating its anti-neuroinflammatory activity in BV2 microglial cells and in a mouse model. In BV2 microglial cells, 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone successfully inhibited production of chemokines such as nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 and proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 beta, and interleukin 6 in BV2 microglia. It also inhibited phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation. This indicates that the anti-inflammatory activities of 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone might be related to suppression of the proinflammatory MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Similar anti-neuroinflammatory activities of the compound were observed in the mouse model. These findings suggest that 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone is a potential drug candidate for the treatment of microglia-related neuroinflammatory diseases.
