38101837|a|INTRODUCTION: Frailty has been currently considered as a multidimensional concept, including physical, cognitive and social frailty. Frailty has also been associated with a range of adverse events, which might increase the risks of disability, falls, fractures, delirium and death. Increasing evidence has shown that multicomponent exercise training can improve physical and cognitive function, delay or reverse frailty. However, there is still a lack of exercise intervention programmes for the frail older adults in China. This trial aims to investigate the effects of the muscle-building and antifrailty exercise combined with Baduanjin on the physical function of frail older adults, as well as the effectiveness and safety of the intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a prospective randomised controlled trial. A total of 192 patients, aged 70 years or older, who are diagnosed as prefrailty or frailty based on the Fried criteria will be included. Prior written and informed consent will be obtained from every subject. These subjects will be randomly assigned to the exercise intervention group (n=96) and the control group (n=96). The exercise intervention group will undergo different exercise programmes for different levels of physical function. They will perform the muscle-building and antifrailty exercise three times per week for 30-60 min for 24 weeks. The control group will implement health education on frailty and maintain the old lifestyle without any intervention.The primary outcomes include the change in frailty and functional capacity, assessed according to the Fried Scale and the Short Physical Performance Battery. Secondary outcomes include the changes in body composition, Activities of daily living, Mini-Mental State Examination, The Geriatric Depression Scale-15 and the haematological indicators. ETHICS STATEMENT: The study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the PLA General Hospital (approval no.: S2022-600-02). TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2300070535.
