10510284|a|Increasing evidence suggests that the pathological alterations observed in brains affected by neurodegenerative disorders such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Alzheimer's disease also involve changes in glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). In the present study, we have isolated, purified, and characterized total GAGs from brain stems of healthy cows or those infected with the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent and we report on the differences between the two groups. Purification of the GAGs was achieved by gel filtration after homogenization, delipidation, and sequential treatment with pronase, DNase, and alkali borohydride. Fractionation of the total GAGs by Superose 6 gel filtration and HPLC revealed four major fractions, with average molecular masses of 360, 180, 15, and 2.3 kDa, respectively, both in controls and infected tissues. Enzymatic characterization, using GAG-degrading enzymes, showed that in both infected and normal brain stems, the 360- and 180-kDa fractions correspond to hyaluronic acid, which was also the most abundant GAG, while the 15-kDa fractions correspond to chondroitin sulfates as well as heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate, the latter being the least prominent GAG. Electrophoresis on cellulose acetate membranes revealed that the relative ratio of GAGs was not significantly modified in infected brain stems, compared to controls. However, total GAGs in infected brain stems was significantly decreased by approximately 40%, compared to controls, and this decrease applied equally to all of the above GAG fractions. The diminution observed in total GAGs in infected brain stems is in good agreement with the recently reported neuroprotective role of certain GAG molecules and offers an additional criterion for differential diagnosis of BSE-infected animals.
