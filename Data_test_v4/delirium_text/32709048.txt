32709048|t|Marine-Derived Macrocyclic Alkaloids (MDMAs): Chemical and Biological Diversity.
32709048|a|The curiosity and attention that researchers have devoted to alkaloids are due to their bioactivities, structural diversity, and intriguing chemistry. Marine-derived macrocyclic alkaloids (MDMAs) are considered to be a potential source of drugs. Trabectedin, a tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative, has been approved for the treatment of metastatic soft tissue sarcoma and ovarian cancers. MDMAs displayed potent activities that enabled them to be used as anticancer, anti-invasion, antimalarial, antiplasmodial, and antimicrobial. This review presents the reported chemical structures, biological activities, and structure-activity relationships of macrocyclic alkaloids from marine organisms that have been published since their discovery until May 2020. This includes 204 compounds that are categorized under eight subclasses: pyrroles, quinolines, bis-quinolizidines, bis-1-oxaquinolizidines, 3-alkylpiperidines, manzamines, 3-alkyl pyridinium salts, and motuporamines.
