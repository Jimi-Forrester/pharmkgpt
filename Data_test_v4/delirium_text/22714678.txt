22714678|t|S-52, a novel nootropic compound, protects against beta-amyloid induced neuronal injury by attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction.
22714678|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced oxidative DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction may initiate and contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study evaluated the neuroprotective effects of S-52, a novel nootropic compound, on Abeta-induced mitochondrial failure. In an established paradigm of moderate cellular injury induced by Abeta, S-52 was observed to attenuate the toxicity of Abeta to energy metabolism, mitochondrial membrane structure, and key enzymes in the electron transport chain and tricarboxylic acid cycle. In addition, S-52 also effectively inhibited reactive oxygen species accumulation dose dependently not only in Abeta-harmed cells but also in unharmed, normal cells. The role of S-52 as a scavenger of free radicals is involved in the antioxidative effect of this compound. The beneficial effects on mitochondria and oxidative stress extend the neuroprotective effects of S-52. The present study provides crucial information for better understanding the beneficial profiles of this compound and discovering novel potential drug candidates for AD therapy.
