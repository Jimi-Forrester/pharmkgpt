35439970|a|BACKGROUND: U.S. nursing homes provide long-term care to over 1.2 million older adults, 60% of whom were physically frail and 68% had moderate or severe cognitive impairment. Limited research has examined the longitudinal experience of these two conditions in older nursing home residents. METHODS: This national longitudinal study included newly-admitted non-skilled nursing care older residents who had Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 (2014-16) assessments at admission, 3 months, and 6 months (n = 266,001). Physical frailty was measured by FRAIL-NH and cognitive impairment by the Brief Interview for Mental Status. Separate sets of group-based trajectory models were fitted to identify the trajectories of physical frailty and trajectories of cognitive impairment, and to estimate the association between older residents' characteristics at admission with each set of trajectories. A dual trajectory model was used to quantify the association between the physical frailty trajectories and cognitive impairment trajectories. RESULTS: Over the course of the first six months post-admission, five physical frailty trajectories ["Consistently Frail" (prevalence: 53.0%), "Consistently Pre-frail" (29.0%), "Worsening Frailty" (7.6%), "Improving Frailty" (5.5%), and "Consistently Robust" (4.8%)] and three cognitive impairment trajectories ["Consistently Severe Cognitive Impairment" (35.5%), "Consistently Moderate Cognitive Impairment" (31.8%), "Consistently Intact/Mild Cognitive Impairment" (32.7%)] were identified. One in five older residents simultaneously followed the trajectories of "Consistently Frail" and "Consistently Severe Cognitive Impairment". Characteristics associated with higher odds of the "Improving Frailty", "Worsening Frailty", "Consistently Pre-frail" and "Consistently Frail" trajectories included greater at-admission cognitive impairment, age >= 85 years, admitted from acute hospitals, cardiovascular/metabolic diagnoses, neurological diagnoses, hip or other fractures, and presence of pain. Characteristics associated with higher odds of the "Consistently Moderate Cognitive Impairment" and "Consistently Severe Cognitive Impairment" included worse at-admission physical frailty, neurological diagnoses, hip fracture, and receipt of antipsychotics. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provided information regarding the trajectories of physical frailty, the trajectories of cognitive impairment, the association between the two sets of trajectories, and their association with residents' characteristics in older adults' first six months post-admission to U.S. nursing homes. Understanding the trajectory that the residents would most likely follow may provide information to develop a comprehensive care approach tailored to their specific healthcare goals.
