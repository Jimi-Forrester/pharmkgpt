15631993|t|The PSD95-nNOS interface: a target for inhibition of excitotoxic p38 stress-activated protein kinase activation and cell death.
15631993|a|The stress-activated protein kinase p38 and nitric oxide (NO) are proposed downstream effectors of excitotoxic cell death. Although the postsynaptic density protein PSD95 can recruit the calcium-dependent neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) to the mouth of the calcium-permeable NMDA receptor, and depletion of PSD95 inhibits excitotoxicity, the possibility that selective uncoupling of nNOS from PSD95 might be neuroprotective is unexplored. The relationship between excitotoxic stress-generated NO and activation of p38, and the significance of the PSD95-nNOS interaction to p38 activation also remain unclear. We find that NOS inhibitors reduce both glutamate-induced p38 activation and the resulting neuronal death, whereas NO donor has effects consistent with NO as an upstream regulator of p38 in glutamate-induced cell death. Experiments using a panel of decoy constructs targeting the PSD95-nNOS interaction suggest that this interaction and subsequent NO production are critical for glutamate-induced p38 activation and the ensuing cell death, and demonstrate that the PSD95-nNOS interface provides a genuine possibility for design of neuroprotective drugs with increased selectivity.
