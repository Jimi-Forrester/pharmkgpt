35730871|a|PURPOSE: To identify the factors associated with frailty in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: Cross-sectional study, whose sample consisted of 150 patients diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases seen at a speech-language therapy clinic in a reference hospital in southern Brazil. A secondary exploratory analysis of the medical records of patients treated at this clinic between April 2016 and May 2019 was performed. The information collected was sex, age, education, type of neurodegenerative disease, time of disease, frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale-EFS), swallowing (Northwestern Dysphagia Patient CheckSheet-NDPCS, Eating Assessment Tool-EAT 10), and cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination-MMSE and Montreal Cognitive Assessment-MoCA). Continuous quantitative variables were analyzed using mean and standard deviation and categorical quantitative variables from absolute and relative frequency, as well as their association with the outcome using the Chi-square test. Crude and adjusted Prevalence Ratios were assessed using Poisson regression with robust variance. All statistical tests were considered significant at a level of 5%. RESULTS: The significant factors associated with frailty were the presence of oropharyngeal dysphagia and altered cognitive performance. Individuals with frailty have a higher prevalence of oropharyngeal dysphagia (PR= 1.772(1.094-2.872)), while cognition alteration presented a lower prevalence (PR= 0.335(0.128-0.873). CONCLUSION: Oropharyngeal dysphagia can be an important clinical predictive factor for consideration in cases of frailty in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.
