38291398|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the improvement of perioperative sleep quality and neurocognitive impairment in elderly patients under general anesthesia by nasal administration of dexmedetomidine. METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients admitted to our hospital for various laparoscopic elective gynecological surgeries lasting more than 1 h under general anesthesia from July 2021 to March 2023 were selected. All subjects were divided into 3 groups according to the random number table method. From 21:00 to 21:30 every night from one day before to 5 days after surgery, group A was given alprazolam 0.4 mg orally; group B was given dexmedetomidine 1.5ug/kg nasal drip; group C was given saline nasal drip. All subjects were observed for general information, sleep quality, postoperative cognitive function, anxiety status, sleep quality, adverse effects and complication occurrence. RESULTS: The difference in general information between the three groups was not statistically significant, P > 0.05; the sleep quality scores of the three groups on admission were not statistically significant, P > 0.05. At the Preoperative 1d, postoperative 1d, 3d and 5d, the RCSQ scores of the subjects in group A and group B were higher than those in groups C, and with the postoperative RCSQ scores of subjects in group B were higher as the time increased; the assessment of anxiety status in the three groups 1d before surgery was not statistically significant, P > 0.05. The cognitive function scores of subjects in the three groups were not statistically significant in the preoperative 1d, P > 0.05. The postoperative 1d (24.63 +- 2.23), 3d (25.83 +- 2.53), and 5d (26.15 +- 2.01) scores of the subjects in group B were higher than those in groups A and C (P < 0.05), and the subjects in group B had better recovery of postoperative cognitive function with increasing time; the occurrence of postoperative delirium (POD) in group B (12.5%) were lower on postoperative 5d than those in groups A (37.5%) and C (32.5%) (P < 0.05). There was no statistical significance in the evaluation of anxiety state of the three groups on the first day before operation (P > 0.05). The scores in group B were lower than those in group C on the postoperative 1d, 3d, 5 d (P < 0.05). The overall incidence of adverse reactions and complications in subjects in group B was 17.5% significantly lower than that in groups A and C (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine can effectively improve the sleep disorder of elderly general anesthesia patients, reduce the damage to their neurocognitive function and the occurrence of POD, effectively reduce the anxiety of patients and the occurrence of adverse reactions and complications, and has better sedative, improve postoperative cognitive function and anti-anxiety effects, with a high drug safety, worthy of clinical application and promotion.
