36359916|a|The metabolism disorders are a common convergence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The characteristics of AD are senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed by deposits of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and phosphorylated tau, respectively. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are a stable modification of proteins by non-enzymatic reactions, which could result in the protein dysfunction. AGEs are associated with some disease developments, such as diabetes mellitus and AD, but the effects of the glycated gamma2 subunit of AMPK on its activity and the roles in AD onset are unknown. METHODS: We studied the effect of glycated gamma2 subunit of AMPK on its activity in N2a cells. In 3 x Tg mice, we administrated L-arginine once every two days for 45 days and evaluated the glycation level of gamma2 subunit and function of AMPK and alternation of pathologies. RESULTS: The glycation level of gamma2 subunit was significantly elevated in 3 x Tg mice as compared with control mice, meanwhile, the level of pT172-AMPK was obviously lower in 3 x Tg mice than that in control mice. Moreover, we found that arginine protects the gamma2 subunit of AMPK from glycation, preserves AMPK function, and improves pathologies and cognitive deficits in 3 x Tg mice. CONCLUSIONS: Arginine treatment decreases glycated gamma2 subunit of AMPK and increases p-AMPK levels in 3 x Tg mice, suggesting that reduced glycation of the gamma2 subunit could ameliorate AMPK function and become a new target for AD therapy in the future.
