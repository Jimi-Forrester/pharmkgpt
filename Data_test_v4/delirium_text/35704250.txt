35704250|t|Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamic Effect of a Blood-Brain Barrier-Crossing Fusion Protein Therapeutic for Alzheimer's Disease in Rat and Dog.
35704250|a|PURPOSE: We have recently demonstrated the brain-delivery of an Amyloid-ss oligomer (Asso)-binding peptide-therapeutic fused to the BBB-crossing single domain antibody FC5. The bi-functional fusion protein, FC5-mFc-ABP (KG207-M) lowered both CSF and brain Ass levels after systemic dosing in transgenic mouse and rat models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For development as a human therapeutic, we have humanized and further engineered the fusion protein named KG207-H. The purpose of the present study was to carry out comparative PK/PD studies of KG207-H in wild type rat and beagle dogs (middle-aged and older) to determine comparability of systemic PK and CSF exposure between rodent species and larger animals with more complex brain structure such as dogs. METHOD: Beagle dogs were used in this study as they accumulate cerebral Ass with age, as seen in human AD patients, and can serve as a model of sporadic AD. KG207-H (5 to 50 mg/kg) was administered intravenously and serum and CSF samples were serially collected for PK studies and to assess target engagement. KG207-H and Abeta levels were quantified using multiplexed selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. RESULTS: After systemic dosing, KG207-H demonstrated similar serum pharmacokinetics in rats and dogs. KG207-H appeared in the CSF in a time- and dose-dependent manner with similar kinetics, indicating CNS exposure. Further analyses revealed a dose-dependent inverse relationship between CSF KG207-H and Ass levels in both species indicating target engagement. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates translational attributes of BBB-crossing Abeta-targeting biotherapeutic KG207-H in eliciting a pharmacodynamic response, from rodents to larger animal species.
