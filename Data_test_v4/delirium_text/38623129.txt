38623129|a|INTRODUCTION: Hip fractures cause severe pain during positioning for spinal anesthesia (SA). Intravenous systemic analgesics can lead to various complications in elderly patients, hence peripheral nerve blocks are emerging as a standard of care in pain management for hip fractures, among which femoral nerve block (FNB) is widely known and practiced. Pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block is a recently described technique that blocks the articular nerves of the hip with motor-sparing effects and is used to manage positional pain in hip fractures. This study aims to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of PENG block over FNB in managing pain during positioning before SA in hip fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. After ethical clearance, 70 patients undergoing hip fracture surgery under SA in a tertiary-care hospital were recruited and randomized to receive either ultrasound-guided PENG block or FNB with 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine before performing SA. We compared pain severity using the visual analog scale (VAS) 15 and 30 minutes after the block and during positioning. The sitting angle, requirement of rescue analgesia for positioning, and anesthesiologist and patient satisfaction scores were also analyzed. Continuous data were analyzed with an unpaired t-test while the chi-square test was used for categorical data. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in VAS scores after PENG block (PENG: 0.66 +- 1.05 and FNB: 1.94 +- 1.90; p = 0.001) with lesser requirement of rescue analgesia for positioning compared to FNB. The anesthesiologist and patient satisfaction scores were also significantly better in the PENG group. CONCLUSION: PENG block offers better analgesia for positioning before SA than FNB without any significant side effects, and improves patient and anesthesiologist satisfaction, thus proving to be an effective analgesic alternative for painful hip fractures.
