24820019|t|Asian Pacific Islander dementia care network: a model of care for underserved communities.
24820019|a|This study presents the results of the work of the Asian Pacific Islander Dementia Care Network (APIDCN)--a collaborative model of care created to develop community capacity to deliver dementia capable services, build community awareness about Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and offer direct services to caregivers in the API community in Los Angeles. Through trainings, mentoring, and outreach campaigns, the APIDCN expanded the availability of culturally competent services in the API community. The knowledge that was embedded within partner organizations and in the community at large assures sustainability of the services after the project ended.
