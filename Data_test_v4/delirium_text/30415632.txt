30415632|t|Instance-Based Representation Using Multiple Kernel Learning for Predicting Conversion to Alzheimer Disease.
30415632|a|The early detection of Alzheimer's disease and quantification of its progression poses multiple difficulties for machine learning algorithms. Two of the most relevant issues are related to missing data and results interpretability. To deal with both issues, we introduce a methodology to predict conversion of mild cognitive impairment patients to Alzheimer's from structural brain MRI volumes. First, we use morphological measures of each brain structure to build an instance-based feature mapping that copes with missed follow-up visits. Then, the extracted multiple feature mappings are combined into a single representation through the convex combination of reproducing kernels. The weighting parameters per structure are tuned based on the maximization of the centered-kernel alignment criterion. We evaluate the proposed methodology on a couple of well-known classification machines employing the ADNI database devoted to assessing the combined prognostic value of several AD biomarkers. The obtained experimental results show that our proposed method of Instance-based representation using multiple kernel learning enables detecting mild cognitive impairment as well as predicting conversion to Alzheimers disease within three years from the initial screening. Besides, the brain structures with larger combination weights are directly related to memory and cognitive functions.
