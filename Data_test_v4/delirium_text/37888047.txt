37888047|t|The Current Situation of Anaesthesia for Hysteroscopy in Mainland China: A National Survey.
37888047|a|Purpose: The need for anaesthesia or analgesia for performing hysteroscopy remains debatable. This study aimed to conduct an overview of the situation of anaesthesia for hysteroscopy in mainland China. Methods: Two questionnaires were separately designed for anaesthesiologists and gynaecologists and distributed to every medical institution that performed hysteroscopic procedures on patients with infertility in mainland China. Electronic questionnaires were distributed via WeChat, and data on anaesthesia regimen, monitoring parameters, procedure number, and other information were collected. Results: Reproductive technology is conducted by 536 institutions in mainland China. The survey received 491 responses from anaesthetists (91.6%) and 436 from gynaecologists (81.3%). In 2021, 552,225 hysteroscopies were conducted in 268 medical centres. The average percentage of hysteroscopy under anaesthesia is 63.8% in 2021, wherein 47.3% of institutions have an anaesthesia percentage of >75%. Propofol and opioid analgesics, such as fentanyl and sufentanil, were the most commonly used intravenous anaesthetics. All sedations were performed by anaesthesiologists. Monitoring parameters included pulse oxygen saturation (98.9%), electrocardiogram (91.6%) and noninvasive blood pressure (91.3%). An anaesthesiologist-to-operating room ratio of <1 was observed in 31.3% of medical institutions. Surprisingly, 52.4% of medical institutions performing hysteroscopy had no postanaesthesia care unit (PACU). Most institutions with PACU were equipped with independent oxygen sources, suction and monitors. Both rigid and flexible hysteroscopes (rigid hysteroscope, 45.1%; flexible hysteroscope, 4.5%; both types, 50.4%) were used, and the hysteroscopic diameter was <=5 mm in 60.3% of medical centres. Conclusions: China performs a large number of hysteroscopies, and sedation is the most frequently used anesthesia regimen. However, issues such as inadequate emergency support devices, insufficient personnel and weak resuscitation management after anaesthesia, have been observed.
