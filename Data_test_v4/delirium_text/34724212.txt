34724212|t|The emerging role of noncoding RNAs in neuroinflammation: Implications in pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches.
34724212|a|Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression in different cell processes. Due to their ability in monitoring neural development genes, these transcripts confer neurons with the potential to exert broad control over the expression of genes for performing neurobiological functions. Although the change of ncRNA expression in different neurodegenerative diseases has been reviewed elsewhere, only recent evidence drove our attention to unravel the involvement of these molecules in neuroinflammation within these devastating disorders. Remarkably, the interactions between ncRNAs and inflammatory pathways are not fully recognized. Therefore, this review has focused on the interplay between diverse inflammatory pathways and the related ncRNAs, including microRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and competing endogenous RNAs in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and prion diseases. Providing novel insights in the field of combining biomarkers is a critical step for using them as diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets in clinical settings.
