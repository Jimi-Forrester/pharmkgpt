34536437|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with increased depression-related behaviours. Previous studies have reported a greater risk of AD and depression in women. In recent years, we and others have provided evidence that exercise during life could be used as a therapeutic strategy for stress-related disorders such as depression. The main goal of the current study was to determine whether treadmill exercise during life can reduce depression-related behaviours in male and female Wistar rats with sporadic Alzheimer-like disease (ALD). Animals were subjected to treadmill exercise eight weeks before and four weeks after ALD induction by streptozocin (STZ). We measured body weight, food intake, and depression-related symptoms in rats using five behavioural tests. We measured brain-derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-10 levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of animals. Our findings showed that exercise but not ALD induction decreased body weight and food intake in male and female rats. ALD induction increased depression-related symptoms and hippocampal TNF-alpha in male and female rats. Besides, treadmill exercise alone decreased depression-related behaviours and increased hippocampal BDNF in females but not males. We also found that treadmill exercise decreased depression-related behaviours and TNF-alpha in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and increased IL-10 in the prefrontal cortex and BDNF in the hippocampus of female ALD-induced rats. However, treadmill exercise only reduced anhedonia-like behaviour and hippocampal TNF-alpha in male ALD-induced rats. Overall, the evidence from this study suggests that treadmill exercise alters depression-related behaviours, brain BDNF and cytokines in a sex-dependant manner in rats with sporadic Alzheimer-like disease.
