37720090|t|Spinal TAOK2 contributes to neuropathic pain via cGAS-STING activation in rats.
37720090|a|Thousand and one amino acid kinase 2 (TAOK2) is a member of the mammalian sterile 20 kinase family and is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders; however, its role in neuropathic pain remains unknown. Here, we found that TAOK2 was enriched and activated after chronic constriction injury (CCI) in the rat spinal dorsal horn. Meanwhile, cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling was also activated with hyperalgesia. Silencing TAOK2 reversed hyperalgesia and suppressed the activation of cGAS-STING signaling induced by CCI, while pharmacological activation of TAOK2 induced pain hypersensitivity and upregulation of cGAS-STING signaling in naive rats. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition or gene silencing of cGAS-STING signaling attenuated CCI-induced hyperalgesia. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the activation of spinal TAOK2 contributes to CCI-induced hyperalgesia via cGAS-STING signaling activation, providing new molecular targets for the treatment of neuropathic pain.
