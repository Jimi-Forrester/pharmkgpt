38189347|t|Alzheimer, Parkinson, dementia, and phytochemicals: insight review.
38189347|a|Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and dementia are the leading neurodegenerative diseases that threaten the world with the aging population. Although the pathophysiology of each disease is unique, the steps to be taken to prevent diseases are similar. One of the changes that a person can make alone is to gain the habit of an antioxidant-rich diet. Phytochemicals known for their antioxidant properties have been reported to prevent neurodegenerative diseases in various studies. Phytochemicals with similar chemical structures are grouped. Accordingly, there are two main groups of phytochemicals, flavonoid and non-flavonoid. Various in vitro and in vivo studies on phytochemicals have proven neuroprotective effects by increasing cognitive function with their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms. The purpose of this review is to summarize the in vitro and in vivo studies on phytochemicals with neuroprotective effects and to provide insight.
