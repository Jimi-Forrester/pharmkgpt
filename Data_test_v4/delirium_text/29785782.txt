29785782|a|AIM: To determine the direct and indirect relationships of sociodemographic, emotional and behavioral characteristics of family caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients who have neuropsychiatric symptoms. METHODS: A total of 134 family caregivers answered a questionnaire with sociodemographic data, and questions regarding the context of care, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Zarit Burden Interview, Dementia Management Strategies Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory. A path analysis was used to model the direct and indirect relationships among the selected variables. RESULTS: Being a female caregiver, presenting high levels of burden, a moderate degree of depressive symptoms, distress (Neuropsychiatric Inventory total distress score), active management strategies and criticism management strategies were significantly associated with the total score of neuropsychiatric symptoms. The caregiver burden and use of criticism management strategies were directly related to neuropsychiatric symptoms in older adults with Alzheimer's disease. The use of active management strategies and depressive symptoms of caregivers had indirect relationships with neuropsychiatric symptoms through caregiver burden. CONCLUSIONS: Overburdened caregivers and the use of dysfunctional management strategies are associated with a greater presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease patients. These aspects should be considered when developing interventions for caregivers to manage neuropsychiatric symptoms and overall treatment of patients with dementia.
