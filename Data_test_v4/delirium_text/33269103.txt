33269103|a|The search for viable, effective treatments for acute stroke continues to be a global priority due to the high mortality and morbidity. Current therapeutic treatments have limited effects, making the search for new treatments imperative. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a well-established cytoprotective neuropeptide that participates in diverse neural physiological and pathological activities, such as neuronal proliferation, differentiation, and migration, as well as neuroprotection. It is considered a promising treatment in numerous neurological diseases. Thus, PACAP bears potential as a new therapeutic strategy for stroke treatment. Herein, we provide an overview pertaining to the current knowledge of PACAP, its receptors, and its potential neuroprotective role in the setting of stroke, as well as various mechanisms of neuroprotection involving ionic homeostasis, excitotoxicity, cell edema, oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death, as well as the route of PACAP administration.
