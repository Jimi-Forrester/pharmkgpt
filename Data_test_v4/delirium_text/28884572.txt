28884572|t|Nanobody-Based Apolipoprotein E Immunosensor for Point-of-Care Testing.
28884572|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers can reflect the neurochemical indicators used to estimate the risk in clinical nephrology. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is an early biomarker for AD in clinical diagnosis. In this research, through bactrian camel immunization, lymphocyte isolation, RNA extraction, and library construction, ApoE-specific Nbs with high affinity were successfully separated from an immune phage display nanobody library. Herein, a colorimetric immunosensor was developed for the point-of-care testing of ApoE by layer-by-layer nanoassembly techniques and novel nanobodies (Nbs). Using highly oriented Nbs as the capture and detection antibodies, an on-site immunosensor was developed by detecting the mean gray value of fade color due to the glutaraldehyde@3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane oxidation by H2O2. The detection limit of AopE is 0.42 pg/mL, and the clinical analysis achieves a good performance. The novel easily operated immunosensor may have potential application in the clinical diagnosis and real-time monitoring for AD.
