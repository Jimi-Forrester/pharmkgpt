26214373|t|Identification of neurodegenerative factors using translatome-regulatory network analysis.
26214373|a|For degenerative disorders of the CNS, the main obstacle to therapeutic advancement has been the challenge of identifying the key molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal loss. We developed a combinatorial approach including translational profiling and brain regulatory network analysis to search for key determinants of neuronal survival or death. Following the generation of transgenic mice for cell type-specific profiling of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, we established and compared translatome libraries reflecting the molecular signature of these cells at baseline or under degenerative stress. Analysis of these libraries by interrogating a context-specific brain regulatory network led to the identification of a repertoire of intrinsic upstream regulators that drive the dopaminergic stress response. The altered activity of these regulators was not associated with changes in their expression levels. This strategy can be generalized for the identification of molecular determinants involved in the degeneration of other classes of neurons.
