30856524|t|Ability to predict team members' behaviors in ICU teams is associated with routine ABCDE implementation.
30856524|a|PURPOSE: Poor coordination may impede delivery of the Awakening, Breathing Coordination, Delirium monitoring/management and Early exercise/mobility (ABCDE) bundle. Developing a shared mental model (SMM), where all team members are on the same page, may support coordination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We administered a survey at the 2016 MHA Keystone Center ICU workshop. We measured different components of SMMs using five items from a validated survey, each on a 5-point Likert scale (strongly agree-strongly disagree). We measured self-reported routine ABCDE implementation using a single item 4-point Likert scale (ABCDE is routine-Made no steps to implement ABCDE). We examined the relationship between SMMs and routine ABCDE implementation using logistic regression, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: Among the 206 (75%) responses, 157 (84%) reported using the ABCDE bundle and 80 (51% of 157) reported routine use. When clinicians agreed it was difficult to predict team members' behaviors, the odds of reporting routine ABCDE implementation significantly decreased [0.26 (0.10-0.66)]. Other SMM components related to knowing team members' skills, access to information, team adaptability, and team help behavior, were not significantly associated with the outcome. CONCLUSION: Increasing awareness of team members' behaviors may be a mechanism to improve the implementation of complex care bundles like ABCDE.
