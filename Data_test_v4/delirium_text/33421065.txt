33421065|a|Sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) and FTLD-TDP are neurodegenerative diseases within the spectrum of TDP-43 proteinopathies. Since abnormal blood vessels and altered blood-brain barrier have been described in sALS, we wanted to know whether TDP-43 pathology also occurs in blood vessels in sALS/FTLD-TDP. TDP-43 deposits were identified in association with small blood vessels of the spinal cord in 7 of 14 cases of sALS and in small blood vessels of frontal cortex area 8 in 6 of 11 FTLD-TDP and sALS cases, one of them carrying a GRN mutation. This was achieved using single and double-labeling immunohistochemistry, and double-labeling immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. In the sALS spinal cord, P-TDP43 Ser403-404 deposits were elongated and parallel to the lumen, whereas others were granular, seldom forming clusters. In the frontal cortex, the inclusions were granular, or elongated and parallel to the lumen, or forming small globules within or in the external surface of the blood vessel wall. Other deposits were localized in the perivascular space. The present findings are in line with previous observations of TDP-43 vasculopathy in a subset of FTLD-TDP cases and identify this pathology in the spinal cord and frontal cortex in a subset of cases within the sALS/FTLD-TDP spectrum.
