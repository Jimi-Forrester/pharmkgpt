31799376|a|Recent discoveries support the principle that palliative care may improve the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease and those who care for them. Advance care planning, a component of palliative care, provides a vehicle through which patients, families, and clinicians can collaborate to identify values, goals, and preferences early, as well as throughout the disease trajectory, to facilitate care concordant with patient wishes. While research on this topic is abundant in other life-limiting disorders, particularly in oncology, there is a paucity of data in Parkinson's disease and related neurological disorders. We review and critically evaluate current practices on advance care planning through the analyses of three bioethical challenges pertinent to Parkinson's disease and propose recommendations for each.
