33307856|a|OBJECTIVE: It is believed that microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the specified function of miR-10b-5p in the disease has not been thoroughly understood. Thereafter, this research aimed to assess the function of miR-10b-5p in AD. METHODS: Rat AD models were established by injected with amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42), which were mainly treated with lentivirus-miR-10b-5p inhibitor, or lentivirus-overexpressed homeobox D10 (HOXD10). MiR-10b-5p, HOXD10, RhoA, ROCK1 and ROCK2 expression in rat hippocampal tissues were determined. Afterwards, the behaviour of rats was tested, and neuronal apoptosis, pathological injury, and inflammatory factors and oxidative stress-related factors were all assessed. Finally, the target relation between miR-10b-5p and HOXD10 was detected. RESULTS: MiR-10b-5p was upregulated while HOXD10 was downregulated, and the Rho/ROCK signalling pathway was activated in hippocampal tissues of rats with AD. Inhibition of miR-10b-5p could attenuate the neuronal apoptosis, pathological injury, inflammation reaction, and oxidative stress by elevating HOXD10 and inhibiting the Rho/ROCK signalling pathway in AD rats. Moreover, HOXD10 was targeted by miR-10b-5p. CONCLUSION: Inhibited miR-10b-5p decelerated the development of AD by promoting HOXD10 and inactivating the Rho/ROCK signalling pathway, and our findings may contribute to the exploration of AD treatment.
