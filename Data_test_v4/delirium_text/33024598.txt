33024598|t|Considerations for future novel human-infecting coronavirus outbreaks.
33024598|a|Up until, June 13, 2020, >7,500,000 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and >400,000 deaths, across 216 countries, have been confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO). With reference to the two previous beta-CoV outbreaks (SARS-CoV and middle east respiratory syndrome [MERS]), this paper examines the pathophysiological and clinical similarities seen across all three CoVs, with a special interest in the neuroinvasive capability and subsequent consequences for patients with primary or metastatic brain tumors. More widely, we examine the lessons learned from the management of such large-scale crises in the past, specifically looking at the South Korean experience of MERS and the subsequent shift in disaster management response to SARS-CoV-2, based on prior knowledge gained. We assess the strategies with which infection prevention and control can, or perhaps should, be implemented to best contain the spread of such viruses in the event of a further likely outbreak in the future.
