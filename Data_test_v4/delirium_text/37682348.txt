37682348|t|[Polypharmacy and medication review in the context of prehabilitation].
37682348|a|Against the background of typical geriatric multimorbidity and with the particular vulnerability of geriatric patients, polypharmacy deserves special attention. In accordance with the guidelines, medication should not only be reviewed regularly, but also on an ad hoc basis and with each hospital stay-and also in the context of prehabilitation. Thus, not only substances that interfere with the currently planned intervention, anesthesia, or risk of bleeding should be considered, but any medication that increases common risks for geriatric patients. These include drugs that cause or increase a tendency to fall, induce delirium, or alter the comedication through potential drug-drug interactions. Measures to minimize the risk include the following: exact documentation of medications, structured and complete transfer of information, patient and family training about any side effects that may occur, a recall system for possible laboratory checks, and compliance with the instructions for taking the medication.
