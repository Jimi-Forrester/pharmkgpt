39711617|a|Recently, interest has surged in the environmental and biomedical applications of two-dimensional transition metal borides, commonly referred to as MBenes. These materials have emerged as promising candidates for energy storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors. Additionally, MBenes have shown remarkable catalytic activity due to their high surface area and tunable electronic properties. They exhibit significant promise in various catalytic applications, particularly in nitrogen reduction reactions (NRRs), electrocatalytic conversion of nitrogen oxides, and several electrochemical reactions such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Notably, MBenes have shown great potential in water treatment and pollutant removal applications, such as desalination and water purification. Their high water permeability, ion selectivity, and excellent stability make them suitable for efficient water treatment processes. On the other hand, MBenes are emerging as versatile materials with significant potential in various biomedical applications, particularly in biosensing, cancer therapy, and the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, several challenges hinder their practical implementation in biomedical and environmental fields. One significant issue is the scalability of synthesis methods; producing MBenes in large quantities while maintaining high purity and uniformity is often complex and costly. Moreover, the stability of MBenes and their composites under different environmental and biological conditions raises concerns, as they may undergo degradation or lose their functional properties over time, which could limit their long-term effectiveness. Additionally, there is a need for comprehensive toxicity assessments to ensure the safety of MBenes in biomedical applications, particularly when interacting with human tissues or biological systems. This review aims to systematically investigate the environmental and biomedical applications of MBenes and their composites, emphasizing their unique characteristics and potential roles in addressing pressing global challenges. Furthermore, the review will identify and discuss the existing challenges and limitations in the operational performance of MBenes and their composites, providing a critical assessment of their current state in various applications.
