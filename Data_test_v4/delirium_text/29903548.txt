29903548|a|Antibodies are antigen recognizing immunoglobulins with an amazingly diverse repertoire in the antigen specific domain. The diversity of the antibody response is further increased by modifications such as somatic recombination and hypermutation. Furthermore, variation in the isotype and post-translational modifications such as Fc glycosylation further increase diversity of the effector functions. In particular variations in the glycan structures contribute significantly to the functional capacities of the antibodies. This is of particular interest given the dynamic nature of these modifications that is strongly influenced by the inflammatory environment. Intriguingly, the glycan profile of antibodies has been unravelled in great detail in inflammatory (auto)immune diseases but received only limited attention in the area of infectious diseases and vaccination. Here, we reviewed the current knowledge on immunoglobulin glycosylation and specifically focussed on studies in the field of infectious diseases and vaccination against infectious diseases, an area with a lot of interesting opportunities.
