25205934|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) typically appears in late middle aged and elderly persons and progresses over a period of several years. It is characterised by defective motor and cognitive function. Oxidative stress is believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of PD. PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to assess the oxidative burden and mRNA expression of AQP4 related to oxidative pathology of PD related symptoms of Hoehn and Yahr stages. METHODS: The study included 30 healthy controls and 90 PD patients who were undergoing treatment. The blood samples were collected and analyzed for biochemical assays and whole blood DNA was used for mRNA expression of AQP4 using RT-PCR. RESULTS: The level of SOD, CAT and Gpx were found to be decreased while there was increase in LPO when compared to the healthy controls. The levels of SOD, CAT in stage III were significantly decreased when compared with stage I. The mRNA expression of AQP4 was found to be reduced when compared with that of healthy control samples. There was no variation in observed oxidative burden and the AQP4 mRNA expression among the different stages of disease. CONCLUSION: Based on the results obtained this study may be helpful in validating novel approach to treatment of PD by advancing antioxidant strategies.
