38874841|t|Investigation of 3-Phenylcoumarin Derivatives as Potential Multi-target Inhibitors for Human Cholinesterases and Monoamine oxidases: A Computational Approach.
38874841|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the predominant etiology of dementia, impacting a global population of approximately 50 million individuals. In the field of medicinal chemistry, there have been notable advancements in the utilization of monoamine oxidase (MAO) and cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors for the purpose of addressing the neurotransmitter shortage associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A selection of previously synthesized 3-Phenylcoumarin derivatives (5a-m) were selected for examination in the pursuit of potential multi-targeting inhibitors of MAO-A, MAO-B, AChE, and BChE. The stability and reactivity of the compounds were investigated through the utilization of density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Subsequently, a CoMFA technique, grounded in 3D-QSAR principles, was employed to construct a model and predict the inhibitory properties of analogues belonging to the class of 3-phenylcoumarin derivatives. Through the application of molecular docking methodologies, we have employed predictive analyses to determine the potential binding interactions and stability of the drugs under investigation. The results obtained from the present investigation indicate that the 3-phenylcoumarin derivatives possess a reactive electronic characteristic that is crucial for their anti-cholinesterase activity. Compound 5a demonstrated a noteworthy binding score with AChE, BChE, MAO-A and MAO-B, respectively, indicating a robust binding affinity.
