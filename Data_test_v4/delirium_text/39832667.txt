39832667|a|Cerebrolysin (CBL) is a combination of neurotrophic peptides and amino acids derived from pig brains. CBL can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and its biological effect is similar to the effect of endogenous neurotrophic effects. The mechanism of action of CBL is related to the induction of neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, and neurotrophicity. Therefore, CBL may be effective against the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and cerebrovascular disorders such as vascular dementia (VD). Moreover, many studies highlighted that CBL is effective in the improvement of cognitive impairment in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. However, the underlying neuroprotective effects of CBL against the VD neuropathology were not fully elucidated. Thus, this review aims to discuss the possible therapeutic efficacy of CBL in the management of VD. In conclusion, CBL could be effective therapeutic strategy in preventing and treating VD by targeting neuroinflammation, BBB injury, and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.
