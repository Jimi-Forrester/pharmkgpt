39908579|t|Successes and failures: the latest advances in the clinical development of amyloid-beta-targeting monoclonal antibodies for treating Alzheimer's disease.
39908579|a|INTRODUCTION: The amyloid cascade hypothesis postulated that the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) was the first step of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological process. Effective reduction of Abeta plaque load by numerous drug candidates, among which anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies, has produced discussible clinical successes and several failures. It was questioned whether Abeta may be the principal AD pathogenic factor and a valid therapeutic target and if targeting Abeta different species could make the difference. AREAS COVERED: This review article summarized successes and failures of anti-Abeta monoclonal antibody therapy for AD, delineating the latest advances for their clinical development also according to their target engagement and downstream biomarkers. EXPERT OPINION: The preliminary success of the recent Phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of lecanemab, donanemab, and remternetug, and lessons learned from the failure of previous anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies RCTs, provided critical evidence to support the role of Abeta in AD pathogenesis. The loss of free Abeta instead of an Abeta toxicity may promote AD neuropathology. Cerebrospinal fluid analyses (i.e. increases in Abeta1-42) may indicate a potential benefit of anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies in AD and downstream biomarkers should be considered for providing comprehension in cognitive and clinical efficacy of future AD RCTs.
