Mucuna pruriens commonly known asvelvet beans, or cow itch, are used in case of spasms associated with Parkinsonism. PURPOSE: To investigate the antiparkinsonism activity of hydro alcoholic root extract of P. zeylanica L (PZE) aloneand its combination withaqueous extract of C. sinensis leaves (AECS) in Haloperidol induced model. METHODS: Parkinsonism (PD) was induced by intraperitoneal administration of Haloperidol (1 mg/kg). The extracts/drugs being tested were administered orally (p.o) 60 min prior to the administration of the Haloperidol. Catalepsy was measured using the metal bar test. RESULTS: Haloperidol induced a time dependent increase in cataleptic score in rats, as compared to vehicle treated groups. All the groups ie L-dopa + carbidopa (syndopa), hydro-alcoholic extract of P. zeylanica alone and its combination with C. sinensis showed significantly (P<0.001) lower scores of catalepsy at all time periods as compared to Haloperidol. Results were analyzed by one way ANOVA followed by Dunnet's multiple comparison tests. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that P. zeylanica alone and its combination with C. sinensis exert a protective effect against PD, while bi-herbal extracts showed more significant protective effect. Hence it may offer a safer therapeutic approach to the treatment of PD and drug induced dyskinesia.
