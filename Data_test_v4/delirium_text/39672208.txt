39672208|t|Glial polarization in neurological diseases: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities.
39672208|a|Glial cell polarization plays a pivotal role in various neurological disorders. In response to distinct stimuli, glial cells undergo polarization to either mitigate neurotoxicity or facilitate neural repair following injury, underscoring the importance of glial phenotypic polarization in modulating central nervous system function. This review presents an overview of glial cell polarization, focusing on astrocytes and microglia. It explores the involvement of glial polarization in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and meningoencephalitis. Specifically, it emphasizes the role of glial cell polarization in disease pathogenesis through mechanisms including neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, calcium signaling dysregulation, synaptic dysfunction and immune response. Additionally, it summarizes various therapeutic strategies including pharmacological treatments, dietary supplements and cell-based therapies, aimed at modulating glial cell polarization to ameliorate brain dysfunction. Future research focused on the spatio-temporal manipulation of glial polarization holds promise for advancing precision diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases.
