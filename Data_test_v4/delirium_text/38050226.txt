38050226|a|Anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity is a major concern for anesthetists for more than 20 years. Many experimental and clinical studies have been conducted on this topic since late 1990s. However, bibliometric analysis of these papers has not been reported. In this study, we aimed to analyze the 100 most cited articles on anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity. It was planned as cross-sectional study. On January 30, 2023, we searched the "Web of Science (WOS)" database for anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity and most cited 100 papers about this topic were obtained. Data such as authors' names, year of publication, name of the journal, type of paper, and citation numbers were analyzed. The most cited 100 papers were read by the investigators, and the anesthetic, animal type in experimental studies, any protective agent and the method for detecting neurotoxicity used in the studies were also noted. There were 75 articles and 22 reviews in the 100 most cited articles. We found that most of the papers in most cited 100 list were published between 2010 to 1024. Most of the papers (11%) were from Harvard University and almost half of the papers (49%) were published in Anesthesiology. A great number of studies were performed in newborns or early childhood (85.5%) and inhalational anesthetics (54.7%) were the most studied anesthetic type. Most of the most cited 100 papers were published in Q1 journals (P = .012) and the continent of the most journals in this list was America (P = .014). The median total and annual citation numbers of funded papers were statistically significantly higher (P < .001 and P < .001 respectively). Anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity is very important, especially for pediatric anesthetists. This study is the first to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the most cited 100 publications on this field. Although there was a gap in the publications about this topic during COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that there will be many more publications on anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity since the mechanism, outcome and possible protection are still unknown.
