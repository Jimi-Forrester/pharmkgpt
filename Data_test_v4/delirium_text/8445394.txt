8445394|t|Genetic characterization of a familial non-specific dementia originating in Jutland, Denmark.
8445394|a|Dementias with non-specific pathological changes are a relatively common but under diagnosed form of presenile dementia. A high proportion of reported cases are familial. We report on molecular genetic findings in the largest known pedigree with this syndrome. We have excluded the mutations known to cause familial prion disease, APP-linked familial Alzheimer's disease and candidate regions for Huntington's disease, other forms of Alzheimer's disease and motor neuron disease. We have demonstrated that familial non-specific dementia is a novel genetic dementia.
