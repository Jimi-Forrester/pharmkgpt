15003389|a|The insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose-6-phosphate (IGF-II/M6P) receptor is a multifunctional single transmembrane glycoprotein which, along with the cation-dependent M6P (CD-M6P) receptor, mediates the trafficking of M6P-containing lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to lysosomes. Cell surface IGF-II/M6P receptors also function in the degradation of the non-glycosylated IGF-II polypeptide hormone, as well as in the capture and activation/degradation of extracellular M6P-bearing ligands. In recent years, the multifaceted role of the receptor has become apparent, as several lines of evidence have indicated that in addition to its role in lysosomal enzyme trafficking, clearance and/or activation of a variety of growth factors and endocytosis-mediated degradation of IGF-II, the IGF-II/M6P receptor may also mediate transmembrane signal transduction in response to IGF-II binding under certain conditions. However, very little is known about the physiological significance of the receptor in the function of the central nervous system (CNS). This review aims to delineate what is currently known about IGF-II/M6P receptor structure, its ligand binding properties and role in lysosomal enzyme transport. It also summarizes the recent data regarding the role of the receptor in the CNS, including its distribution, possible importance for normal and activity-dependent functioning as well as its implications in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).
