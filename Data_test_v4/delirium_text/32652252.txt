32652252|a|BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a novel disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective evaluation of patients admitted with COVID-19 to one site in March 2020. Patients were stratified into 3 groups: survivors who did not receive mechanical ventilation (MV), survivors who received MV, and those who received MV and died during hospitalization. RESULTS: There were 140 hospitalizations; 22 deaths (mortality rate 15.7%), 83 (59%) survived and did not receive MV, 35 (25%) received MV and survived; 18 (12.9%) received MV and died. Thee mean age of each group was 57.8, 55.8 and 72.7 years, respectively (P = .0001). Of those who received MV and died, 61% were male (P = .01). More than half the patients (n = 90, 64%) were African American. First measured d-dimer >575.5 ng/mL, procalcitonin > 0.24 ng/mL, lactate dehydrogenase >445.6 units/L, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) >104.75 pg/mL had odds ratios of 10.5, 5, 4.5 and 2.9, respectively for MV (P < .05 for all). Peak BNP >167.5 pg/mL had an odds ratio of 6.7 for inpatient mortality when mechanically ventilated (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Age and gender may impact outcomes in COVID-19. D-dimer, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase and BNP may serve as early indicators of disease trajectory.
