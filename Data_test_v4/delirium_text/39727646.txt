39727646|t|ECMO in the Management of Noncardiogenic Pulmonary Edema with Increased Inflammatory Reaction After Cardiac Surgery: A Case Report and Literature Review.
39727646|a|Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema after cardiac surgery is a rare but severe complication. The etiology remains poorly understood; however, the issue may arise from multiple sources. Possible causes include a significant inflammatory response or an autoimmune process. Pulmonary edema resulting from noncardiac etiologies can necessitate extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) because most of the cases present a substantial volume of fluid expelled from the lungs and the medical team must manage the inability to achieve effective ventilation. A 64-year-old patient with known heart disease was admitted to our clinic with acute pulmonary edema. His medical history included Barlow's disease, severe mitral regurgitation (IIP2), moderate-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. The patient had a coronary angiography performed in a prior hospitalization before the surgical intervention which indicated the absence of coronary lesions. Preoperative screening (nasal, pharyngeal exudate, inguinal pouch culture, and urine culture) was negative, with no active dental infections. The patient was stabilized, and 14 days post-admission, mitral and tricuspid valve repair was performed via a thoracoscopic approach. After being admitted to intensive care post-surgery, the patient quickly developed pulmonary edema, producing a large volume (4.5 L) of yellow secretions through the intubation tube followed by hemodynamic instability necessitating high doses of medications to support circulation but no cardiorespiratory arrest. Due to his worsening condition, the patient was urgently taken back to the operating room, where veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) was initiated to support oxygenation and stabilize the patient.
