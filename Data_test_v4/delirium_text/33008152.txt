33008152|t|Cardiovascular vulnerability in COVID-19 elderly patients: getting into the biological mechanisms
33008152|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has had an important impact on older adults, conferring a worse prognosis. Older adults may have atypical presentations, which can delay the diagnosis of the disease, making its evolution more unfavorable. In addition to the cardiovascular damage mechanisms conferred by SARS-CoV-2 infection, the changes inherent in the aging cardiovascular and immune system favor the appearance of cardiovascular complications in a more relevant way in this population. The objective of this article will be to summarize the knowledge about cardiovascular involvement in older adults and explain its pathophysiological mechanisms, to alert about the early recognition and timely treatment of these complications.
