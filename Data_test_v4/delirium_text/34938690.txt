34938690|t|Usefulness of Synthetic Osteoconductive Bone Graft Substitute with Zeta Potential Control for Intramedullary Fixation with Proximal Femur Nail Antirotation in Osteoporotic Unstable Femoral Intertrochanteric Fracture.
34938690|a|PURPOSE: This study was conducted in order to examine the usefulness of osteoconductive bone substitutes with zeta potential control (geneX  ds; Biocomposites, England) by comparing the complications and radiographic evaluation with or without geneX  ds augmentation for internal fixation with proximal femur nail antirotation (PFNA) for treatment of osteoporotic unstable intertrochanteric fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 101 patients who underwent fixation with PFNA in osteoporotic unstable intertrochanteric fractures was conducted from December 2015 to August 2020. The radiographic evaluation and complication rates were compared between patients with geneX  ds (Group A: 41 cases) and those without geneX  ds (Group B: 60 cases). RESULTS: In radiological valuation, the degree of blade sliding from the time immediately after surgery to one year after surgery was 1.4+-1.2 mm and 5.8+-2.7 mm in Group A and Group B, respectively (P<0.001). During the same time frame, a significant difference of 2.3+-2.2  and 7.4+-3.1  , respectively (P<0.001), in varus collapse, was observed for Group A and Group B. CONCLUSION: Among patients fixed with PFNA for treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures, less blade sliding and varus collapse was observed for those with geneX  ds augmentation compared to those without it. In addition, there was no increase in the incidence of complications. The authors believe it can be regarded as a safe and effective additive for intramedullary fixation for treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures.
