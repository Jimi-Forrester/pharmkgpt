32605280|t|On-Chip Detection of the Biomarkers for Neurodegenerative Diseases: Technologies and Prospects.
32605280|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and glaucoma are all regarded as neurodegenerative diseases (neuro-DDs) because these diseases are highly related to the degeneration loss of functions and death of neurons with aging. The conventional diagnostic methods such as neuroimaging for these diseases are not only expensive but also time-consuming, resulting in significant financial burdens for patients and public health challenge for nations around the world. Hence early detection of neuro-DDs in a cost-effective and rapid manner is critically needed. For the past decades, some chip-based detection technologies have been developed to address this challenge, showing great potential in achieving point-of-care (POC) diagnostics of neuro-DDs. In this review, chip-based detection of neuro-DDs' biomarkers enabled by different transducing mechanisms is evaluated.
