35128041|t|The Effect of Major and Minor Complications After Lung Surgery on Length of Stay and Readmission.
35128041|a|The effect of post-operative adverse events (AEs) on patient outcomes such as length of stay (LOS) and readmissions to hospital is not completely understood. This study examined the severity of AEs from a high-volume thoracic surgery center and its effect on the patient postoperative LOS and readmissions to hospital. This study includes patients who underwent an elective lung resection between September 2018 and January 2020. The AEs were grouped as no AEs, 1 or more minor AEs, and 1 or more major AEs. The effects of the AEs on patient LOS and readmissions were examined using a survival analysis and logistic regression, respectively, while adjusting for the other demographic or clinical variables. Among 488 patients who underwent lung surgery, (Wedge resection [n = 100], Segmentectomy [n = 51], Lobectomy [n = 310], Bilobectomy [n = 10], or Pneumonectomy [n = 17]) for either primary (n = 440) or secondary (n = 48) lung cancers, 179 (36.7%) patients had no AEs, 264 (54.1%) patients had 1 or more minor AEs, and 45 (9.2%) patients had 1 or more major AEs. Overall, the median of LOS was 3 days which varied significantly between AE groups; 2, 4, and 8 days among the no, minor, and major AE groups, respectively. In addition, type of surgery, renal disease (urinary tract infection [UTI], urinary retention, or acute kidney injury), and ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) score were significant predictors of LOS. Finally, 58 (11.9%) patients were readmitted. Readmission was significantly associated with AE group (P = 0.016). No other variable could significantly predict patient readmission. Overall, postoperative AEs significantly affect the postoperative LOS and readmission rates.
