27589526|a|Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in the pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the heightened levels of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid-beta (Abeta), and neurodegeneration. We have previously shown that an antisense oligonucleotide directed at the Tyr 216 site on GSK-3beta (GAO) when injected centrally can decrease GSK-3beta levels, improve learning and memory, and decrease oxidative stress. In addition, we showed that GAO can cross the blood-brain barrier. Herein the impact of peripherally administered GAO in both the non-transgenic SAMP8 and transgenic Tg2576 (APPswe) models of AD were examined respective to learning and memory. Brain tissues were then evaluated for expression changes in the phosphorylated-Tyr 216 residue, which leads to GSK-3beta activation, and the phosphorylated-Ser9 residue, which reduces GSK-3beta activity. SAMP8 GAO-treated mice showed improved acquisition and retention using aversive T-maze, and improved declarative memory as measured by the novel object recognition (NOR) test. Expression of the phosphorylated-Tyr 216 was decreased and the phosphorylated-Ser9 was increased in GAO-treated SAMP8 mice. Tg2576 GAO-treated mice improved acquisition and retention in both the T-maze and NOR tests, with an increased phosphorylated-Ser9 GSK-3beta expression. Results demonstrate that peripheral administration of GAO improves learning and memory, corresponding with alterations in GSK-3beta phosphorylation state. This study supports peripherally administered GAO as a viable means to mediate GSK-3beta activity within the brain and a possible treatment for AD.
