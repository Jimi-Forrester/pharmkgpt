32411319|t|Preprotection of Tea Polysaccharides with Different Molecular Weights Can Reduce the Adhesion between Renal Epithelial Cells and Nano-Calcium Oxalate Crystals.
32411319|a|Crystal adhesion is an important link in the formation of kidney stones. This study investigated and compared the adhesion differences between nano-calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) and human renal proximal tubule epithelial (HK-2) cells before and after treatment with tea polysaccharides (TPSs) TPS0, TPS1, TPS2, and TPS3 with molecular weights of 10.88, 8.16, 4.82, and 2.31 kDa, respectively. TPS treatment effectively reduced the damage of COM to HK-2 cells, thereby resulting in increased cell activity, decreased release of lactate dehydrogenase, cell morphology recovery, decreased level of reactive oxygen species, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased lysosomal integrity, decreased expression of adhesion molecule osteopontin and eversion of phosphatidylserine, and decreased crystal adhesion. Among the TPSs, TPS2 with moderate molecular weight had the best protective effect on cells and the strongest effect on the inhibition of crystal adhesion. Thus, TPS2 may be a potential anticalculus drug.
