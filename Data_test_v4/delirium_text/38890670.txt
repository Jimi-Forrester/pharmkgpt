38890670|t|Efficacy and safety of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation for anxiety symptoms: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
38890670|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: There is uncertainty about the optimum dose of omega-3 fatty acids for anxiety symptoms. We aimed to find the dose-dependent effect of omega-3 supplementation on anxiety symptoms. METHODS: We systematically reviewed PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science until December 2022 to find randomized trials that assessed the effects of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation on anxiety symptoms in adults. Investigators performed the literature search and screened the titles/abstracts and full-texts and between-reviewer agreement was assessed as Cohen's kappa coefficient. We conducted a random-effects dose-response meta-analysis to estimate standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE framework. RESULTS: A total of 23 trials with 2189 participants were included. Each 1 gram per day supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids resulted in a moderate decrease in anxiety symptoms (SMD: -0.70, 95%CI: -1.17, -0.22; GRADE = low). The non-linear dose-response analysis indicated the greatest improvement at 2 g/d (SMD: -0.93, 95%CI: -1.85, -0.01), and that supplementation in a dose lower than 2 g/d did not affect anxiety symptoms. Omega-3 fatty acids did not increase adverse events (odds ratio: 1.20, 95%CI: 0.89, 1.61; GRADE = moderate). CONCLUSIONS: The present dose-response meta-analysis suggested evidence of very low certainty that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may significantly improve anxiety symptoms, with the greatest improvements at 2 g/d. More trials with better methodological quality are needed to reach more robust evidence. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO (CRD42022309636).
