39868844|a|This proceedings article summarizes the inaugural "T Cells in the Brain" symposium held at Columbia University. Experts gathered to explore the role of T cells in neurodegenerative diseases. Key topics included characterization of antigen-specific immune responses, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, microbial etiology in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and microglia-T cell crosstalk, with a focus on how T cells affect neuroinflammation and AD biomarkers like amyloid beta and tau. The symposium also examined immunotherapies for AD, including the Valacyclovir Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (VALAD) trial, and two clinical trials leveraging regulatory T cell approaches for multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis therapy. Additionally, single-cell RNA/TCR sequencing of T cells and other immune cells provided insights into immune dynamics in neurodegenerative diseases. This article highlights key findings from the symposium and outlines future research directions to further understand the role of T cells in neurodegeneration, offering innovative therapeutic approaches for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. HIGHLIGHTS: Researchers gathered to discuss approaches to study T cells in brain disorders. New technologies allow high-throughput screening of antigen-specific T cells. Microbial infections can precede several serious and chronic neurological diseases. Central and peripheral T cell responses shape neurological disease pathology. Immunotherapy can induce regulatory T cell responses in neuroinflammatory disorders.
