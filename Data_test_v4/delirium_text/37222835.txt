37222835|a|PURPOSE: Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is accompanied with an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Whether AKI is induced by chemotoxicity or hyperthermia-related changes in renal perfusion remains controversial. The influence of HIPEC on renal perfusion has not been evaluated in patients yet. METHODS: Renal blood perfusion was assessed in ten patients treated with HIPEC by intraoperative renal Doppler pulse-wave ultrasound. Ultrasound (US) examinations were performed pre-, intra-, and postoperative with analyses of time-velocity curves. Patient demographics, surgical details, and data regarding renal function were recorded perioperatively. For evaluation of renal Doppler US to predict AKI, patients were divided in two groups with (AKI +) and without (AKI -) kidney injury. RESULTS: Throughout HIPEC perfusion, neither significant nor consistent changes in renal perfusion could be observed. Postoperative AKI occurred in 6 of 10 participating patients. Intraoperative renal resistive index (RRI) values > 0.8 were observed in one patient developing stage 3 AKI according KDIGO criteria. At 30 min in perfusion, RRI values were significantly higher in AKI + patients. CONCLUSION: AKI is a common and frequent complication after HIPEC, but underlying pathophysiology remains elusive. High intraoperative RRI values may indicate an increased risk of postoperative AKI. Present data challenges the relevance of hyperthermia-derived hypothesis of renal hypoperfusion with prerenal injury during HIPEC. More attention should be drawn towards chemotoxic-induced hypothesis of HIPEC-induced AKI and caution applying regimens containing nephrotoxic agents in patients. Further confirmatory and complementary studies on renal perfusion as well as pharmacokinetic HIPEC studies are required.
