21732316|t|Detection and analysis of proteins modified by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine.
21732316|a|O-GlcNAc is a common post-translational modification of nuclear, mitochondrial, and cytoplasmic proteins that is implicated in the etiology of type II diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cardioprotection. This unit covers simple and comprehensive techniques for identifying proteins modified by O-GlcNAc, studying the enzymes that add and remove O-GlcNAc, and mapping O-GlcNAc modification sites.
