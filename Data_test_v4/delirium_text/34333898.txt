34333898|a|OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the overall profile of patients in a psycho-oncology clinic and the differences in their characteristics according to the cancer site. METHODS: The charts of 740 patients aged under 81 years were reviewed. The data from 586 completed questionnaires were subjected to multiple comparison analyses using one-way analysis of variance to examine the demographic and clinical differences according to the cancer site. RESULTS: Most (n=532, 71.9%) patients were referred. Most new patients (n=426, 96.6%) received a psychiatric diagnosis; the most common diagnosis was depressive disorder (n=234, 31.6%). Likewise, depressive disorder accounted for the majority of diagnoses in all groups except for the digestive system cancer group in which sleep-wake disorder was the most prevalent. The female genital cancer group showed a higher level of anxiety symptoms than other groups, except for breast and haematolymphoid cancer groups, and psychological distress than all other groups. CONCLUSION: There appear to be delays in the referral of cancer patients seeking psychiatric help to a psycho-oncology clinic. Along with tailoring approaches by cancer site, thorough evaluation and appropriate management of sleep-wake and anxiety symptoms are important for digestive system and female genital cancer patients, respectively.
