37522073|a|Purpose: The aim of the study was to determine whether hand grip strength (HGS) predicts functional independence in older patients who have undergone hip replacement due to osteoarthritis versus older patients who have undergone hip replacement surgery due to fracture. Patients and Methods: The study included 239 patients aged 65 and over in the first weeks after total hip replacement during rehabilitation treatment. Multivariate linear regression was used to determine HGS as a predictor of activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in both groups: patients post hip replacement due to osteoarthritis and patients post hip replacement due to a fracture. Results: Analysis showed that pre-rehab HGS in the osteoarthritis group predicts improved activities of daily living after rehabilitation (ADL, OR = 1.098; CI 95% 1.052-1.147 and IADL, OR = 1.182; CI 95% 1.103-1.267) and 6 months after (ADL, OR = 1.191; CI 95% 1.066-1.329 and IADL, OR = 1.096; CI 95% 1.012-1.186). In the fracture group, HGS predicts the ADL (OR = 1.081; CI 95% 1.015-1.152) after rehabilitation, and IADL after rehabilitation (OR = 1.122; CI 95% 1.046-1.205) and 6 months after (OR = 1.090; 95% CI 1.021-1.64). Conclusion: HGS in patients after hip replacement surgery predicts functional independence in basic and complex activities of daily living. This can allow the identification of osteoarthritis patients with low hand grip - who can be considered as patients with a higher risk of an unsatisfying outcome of surgery. These patients should undergo pre-rehabilitation and should be monitored, and/or supported in terms of rehabilitation after discharge.
