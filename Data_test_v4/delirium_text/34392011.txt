34392011|t|Generation of inducible pluripotent stem cell lines from Alzheimer's disease patients with APOE e3/e3 genotype.
34392011|a|iPSCs were generated from B lymphocytes of two Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients homozygous for the APOE e3 allele. The iPSCs express pluripotency-specific markers and have the capacity to differentiate into all three embryonic germ layers. Karyotyping analyses confirmed the iPSCs have normal karyotypes. These iPSCs can be utilized as an in vitro model to study AD and to evaluate efficacies of new treatments.
