35461033|a|Treatment guidelines for the COVID-19 treatment are still evolving, moreover, the changing variants of the virus with varying virulence, pose challenges for the healthcare professionals (HCP) not only in managing the primary infection but also a myriad of physical and neuropsychiatric complications. The neuropsychiatric adverse consequences associated with the COVID-19 are attributable to the direct effect of the virus, secondary complications, drug-drug interaction, and neuropsychiatric manifestations of drugs used in its treatment. These neuropsychiatric manifestations not only complicate the ongoing treatment but also adversely affect the prognosis. As the treatment guidelines for the management of the COVID are still evolving, the use of non-evidence-based medications, including their off-label use, are rampant that often extend to their non-judicious or irrational use (more than the recommended dose, multiple medications, etc.). Despite the significance of the topic, literature is sparse. Knowing about the risk factors and the potential neuropsychiatric adverse effects with various anti-COVID-19 medications would help HCPs in effectively preventing, early identifying, and promptly managing these neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore, this narrative review is aimed to highlight the neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with medications/interventions used in the management of COVID-19 and how to manage them, especially in view of the world facing the third wave of COVID-19.
