38298301|t|Benzodiazepine Consumption, Functionality, Cognition, and Somnolence in Older Adults at a Tertiary Care Psychiatric Hospital in Mexico City.
38298301|a|BACKGROUND: The aging population in Mexico, particularly those aged 60 and above, faces challenges in healthcare, including potentially inappropriate prescriptions of benzodiazepines. Physiological changes in older adults make precise drug prescriptions crucial. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate and compare functionality, cognition, and daytime somnolence in older adults using benzodiazepines versus non-users. Additionally, it outlines the demographic and clinical characteristics of both groups. METHODS: A cross-sectional study enrolled 162 participants aged 60 and above, categorized as benzodiazepine consumers or non-consumers. Assessment tools included Lawton's Index, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Benzodiazepine Dependence Questionnaire. Statistical analysis employed t-tests and chi-square tests. RESULTS: Benzodiazepine users (n=81) exhibited lower cognitive scores, increased sleepiness, and reduced daily living activities compared to non-users (n=81). Demographically, BZD users had lower education levels. CONCLUSION: Benzodiazepine use in older adults is associated with cognitive decline, daytime somnolence, and functional limitations, emphasizing the need for cautious prescription practices and continual monitoring. This study contributes insights into the impact of benzodiazepines on the cognitive health of older adults in Mexico.
