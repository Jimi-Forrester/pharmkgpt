37802845|a|This study aimed to explore the possible effect of Xixin Decoction(XXD) on the learning and memory ability of Alzheimer's disease(AD) model senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8(SAMP8) and the related mechanism in enhancing neuroprotective effect and reducing neuroinflammation. Forty SAMP8 were randomly divided into a model group(10 mL kg~(-1) d~(-1)), a probiotics group(0.39 g kg~(-1) d~(-1)), a high-dose group of XXD granules(H-XXD, 5.07 g kg~(-1) d~(-1)), a medium-dose group of XXD granules(M-XXD, 2.535 g kg~(-1) d~(-1)), and a low-dose group of XXD granules(L-XXD, 1.267 5 g kg~(-1) d~(-1)). Eight senescence-accelerated mouse-resistant 1(SAMR1) of the same age and strain were assigned to the control group(10 mL kg~(-1) d~(-1)). After ten weeks of intragastric administration, the Morris water maze was used to test the changes in spatial learning and memory ability of mice after treatment. Meanwhile, immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the positive expression of receptor for advanced glycation end products(AGER), Toll-like receptor 1(TLR1), and Toll-like receptor 2(TLR2) in the hippocampal CA1 region of mice. Western blot was employed to test the protein expression levels of silencing information regulator 2 related enzyme 1(SIRT1), AGER, TLR1, and TLR2 in the hippocampus of mice. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) was applied to assess the levels of Abeta_(1-42) in the hippocampus of mice and the levels of nuclear factor kappaB p65(NF-kappaB p65), NOD-like receptor protein 3(NLRP3), tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1beta(IL-1beta) in the serum and hippocampus of mice. Compared with the model group, XXD significantly improved the spatial learning and memory ability of SAMP8, increased the expression of neuroprotective factors in the hippocampus, decreased the levels of neuroinflammatory factors, and inhibited the expression of Abeta_(1-42). In particular, H-XXD significantly increased the expression of SIRT1 in the hippocampus of mice, reduced the expression levels of NF-kappaB p65, NLRP3, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta in the serum and hippocampus of mice, and decreased the expression of AGER, TLR1, and TLR2 in the hippocampus of mice(P<0.05 or P<0.01). XXD may improve the spatial learning and memory ability of AD model SAMP8 by enhancing the neuroprotective effect and inhibiting neuroinflammation.
