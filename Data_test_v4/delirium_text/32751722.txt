32751722|t|Insights into the Effect of Curcumin and (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate on the Aggregation of Abeta(1-40) Monomers by Means of Molecular Dynamics.
32751722|a|In this study, we compared the effects of two well-known natural compounds on the early step of the fibrillation process of amyloid-beta (1-40), responsible for the formation of plaques in the brains of patients affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). The use of extensive replica exchange simulations up to the micros scale allowed us to characterize the inhibition activity of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and curcumin (CUR) on unfolded amyloid fibrils. A reduced number of beta-strands, characteristic of amyloid fibrils, and an increased distance between the amino acids that are responsible for the intra- and interprotein aggregations are observed. The central core region of the amyloid-beta (Abeta(1-40)) fibril is found to have a high affinity to EGCG and CUR due to the presence of hydrophobic residues. Lastly, the free binding energy computed using the Poisson Boltzmann Surface Ares suggests that EGCG is more likely to bind to unfolded Abeta(1-40) fibrils and that this molecule can be a good candidate to develop new and more effective congeners to treat AD.
