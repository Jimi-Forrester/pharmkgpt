34057078|t|Expression and Localization of AbetaPP in SH-SY5Y Cells Depends on Differentiation State.
34057078|a|Neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, due to its capacity to differentiate into neurons, easy handling, and low cost, is a common experimental model to study molecular events leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is prevalently used in its undifferentiated state, which does not resemble neurons affected by the disease. Here, we show that the expression and localization of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP), one of the key molecules involved in AD pathogenesis, is dramatically altered in SH-SY5Y cells fully differentiated by combined treatment with retinoic acid and BDNF. We show that insufficient differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells results in AbetaPP mislocalization.
