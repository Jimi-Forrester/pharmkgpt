33716645|t|Diffusion Tensor Imaging Detects Acute Pathology-Specific Changes in the P301L Tauopathy Mouse Model Following Traumatic Brain Injury.
33716645|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been linked with tauopathy. However, imaging methods that can non-invasively detect tau-protein abnormalities following TBI need further investigation. This study aimed to investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to detect tauopathy following TBI in P301L mutant-tau-transgenic-pR5-mice. A total of 24 9-month-old pR5 mice were randomly assigned to sham and TBI groups. Controlled cortical injuries/craniotomies were performed for TBI/sham groups followed by DTI data acquisition on days 1 and 7 post-injury. DTI data were analyzed by using voxelwise analysis and track-based spatial statistics for gray matter and white matter. Further, immunohistochemistry was performed for total-tau and phosphorylated-tau, astrocytes, and microglia. To detect the association of DTI with these pathological markers, a correlation analysis was performed between DTI and histology findings. At day 1 post-TBI, DTI revealed a widespread reduction in fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AxD) in the TBI group compared to shams. On day 7, further reduction in FA, AxD, and mean diffusivity and increased radial diffusivity were observed. FA was significantly increased in the amygdala and cortex. Correlation results showed that in the ipsilateral hemisphere FA reduction was associated with increased phosphorylated-tau and glial-immunoreactivity, whereas in the contralateral regions, the FA increase was associated with increased immunostaining for astrocytes. This study is the first to exploit DTI to investigate the effect of TBI in tau-transgenic mice. We show that alterations in the DTI signal were associated with glial activity following TBI and would most likely reflect changes that co-occur with/without phosphorylated-tau. In addition, FA may be a promising measure to identify discrete pathological processes such as increased astroglia activation, tau-hyperphosphorylation or both in the brain following TBI.
