29228048|a|The present study examined the temporal trends in the management of blood pressure, glucose, and lipid levels among middle-aged and elderly patients with type 2 diabetes using data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1998-2014). A total of 3,689 patients with diabetes were included and divided into middle-aged (30-64 years old) and elderly (>=65 years old) groups. Demographic and lifestyle data were obtained using a self-reported questionnaire, and trained medical staff obtained fasting blood samples and blood pressure data. Laboratory testing was performed to determine blood glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. In the multivariable adjusted models, significant decreasing trends in the prevalences of hyperglycemia and hypertension were observed in both age groups during 1998-2014, although no trends were observed for lipid levels. Based on the most recent survey, approximately 50% of patients with diabetes had hyperglycemia, and one-third of patients with diabetes and hypertension did not appropriately manage their blood pressure. In addition, 50% of the patients in both age groups did not manage their lipid profiles, and the management of lipid profiles did not improve in recent years. These results suggest that continuous follow-up is needed to effectively manage metabolic risk factors, especially lipid profiles, among patients with diabetes.
