39405916|a|AIMS: To investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of Semaglutide in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and identify its potential targets. METHODS: We systematically evaluated the effect of Semaglutide on Alzheimer's disease (AD), using both mice and human organoid models. RESULTS: Behavioral analyses on APP/PS1 mice demonstrated that Semaglutide improved the cognitive capabilities, particularly in the learning and memory domains. Biochemical investigations further highlighted its role in reducing amyloid plaque deposition and down-regulating the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) expression in the mouse brain tissues. Meanwhile, oxytocin (OXT) was up-regulated after Semaglutide treatment. Subsequent studies using human AD-brain organoids (BOs) models revealed that, upon Semaglutide treatment, these AD-BO models also exhibited reduced levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta), phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) and GFAP expression as well as increased OXT level. CONCLUSIONS: Semaglutide can ameliorate Alzheimer's disease in pre-clinical models, suggesting the promising therapeutic potential in AD patients.
