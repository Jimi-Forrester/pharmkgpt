35882530|t|Reliability and Validity of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire Using a Rasch Analysis.
35882530|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to expand on the limited psychometric testing of the NPI-Q, and extend testing to include hospitalized older adults. METHOD: This was a descriptive study using data from 318 dyads in an ongoing cluster randomized clinical trial. Rasch analysis and hypothesis testing were done. RESULTS: The majority of the participants were female (62%), non-Hispanic (98%), and black (50%) with a mean age of 81.62 (SD = 8.43). There was evidence of internal consistency and invariance across race and gender. The items fit with each subscale. Hypothesis testing was supported with a significant association between the NPI-Q and dementia and caregiver distress. CONCLUSIONS: The NPI-Q is short, easy to complete, and reliable and valid when used with hospitalized older adults.
