33466963|t|Review of Clinical Questions Submitted to Norwegian Drug Information Centres Concerning Administration and Dosage to Older Patients of Relevance to Patient-Centric Care.
33466963|a|Patient-centric care entails optimising healthcare provision to patients based on their perspective and opinion. It involves appropriate treatment at a reasonable cost and a focus on patient characteristics in the decision-making process to make it more personally useful. The optimisation of medicines in the older population is a challenge due to physiological changes, comorbidity, and polypharmacy. Furthermore, patient-centric care is difficult to achieve due to the high proportion of patients with dementia and frailty. Decision support concerning the appropriateness of indication, formulation, dose, administration, co-prescribing, and length of treatment to older patients is frequently in demand. In the current study, we aimed to review clinical questions concerning administration and dosage to older patients of relevance to patient-centric care. We analysed questions concerning medicines to patients 65 years or older in the database of the network of Norwegian drug information centres from 2010 to 2020. The analysis included the distribution of drugs, diseases, and recurring topics among the questions. Through a Boolean search that combined the indexed categories of "older" and "administration and dosage", we retrieved 84 question-answer pairs. Questions about psychotropic and cardiovascular drugs in relation to therapy, adverse drug reactions, and pharmacokinetics dominated, and more than 60% of the questions came from physicians. Topics relevant to patient-centric pharmacotherapy were drug withdrawal (10 questions), drug formulation (8 questions), drug initiation (8 questions), and switching drugs (5 questions). One question concerned drug withdrawal and switching, and one question drug formulation and switching. Answers provided decision support regarding appropriate formulations of drugs to patients with dementia who chew capsules or tablets, the use of parenteral administration in patients who refuse to take oral formulations, and the pharmacokinetics of transdermal or rectal drug administration. The results highlight the importance of including pharmacological factors in the assessment of the acceptability and appropriateness of oral and parenteral medicine to older patients.
