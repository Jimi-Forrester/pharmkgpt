36439572|t|Anesthetic Management Using Remimazolam for Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair of the Mitral Valve in Patients With Reduced Ejection Fraction: A Case Report of Two Cases.
36439572|a|Remimazolam is an ultrashort-acting benzodiazepine that causes minimal hemodynamic changes. We present two patients, with reduced ejection fraction, who underwent remimazolam anesthesia for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of the mitral valve with the MitraClip system. In case 1, the patient's vitals were stable throughout the surgery. However, in case 2, which had a lower cardiac output, the patient's blood pressure decreased remarkably after anesthesia induction. Though remimazolam does not alter the cardiac output, it reportedly has vasodilatory effects. Since remimazolam can reduce blood pressure in patients where the reduction in cardiac output is compensated for by high peripheral vascular resistance, caution should be exercised.
