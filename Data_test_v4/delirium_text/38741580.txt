38741580|t|Serum NPTX2 as a Potential Predictive Biomarker for Postoperative Delirium in Patients with Acute Type A Aortic Dissection.
38741580|a|Background: Postoperative delirium (POD) significantly impacts patient outcomes after acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) surgeries. This study investigates the role of Neuronal Pentraxin 2 (NPTX2) as a potential biomarker for POD in ATAAD patients. Methods: This secondary analysis involved ATAAD patients from a prospective observational study. Serum NPTX2 levels were measured preoperatively and immediately postoperatively using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) or CAM for the ICU (CAM-ICU). Statistical analyses included the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and multivariate logistic regression to evaluate the association between NPTX2 levels and POD. Results: Among the 62 patients included, 46.77% developed POD. Patients with POD had significantly lower preoperative and postoperative serum NPTX2 levels. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that postoperative NPTX2 had a strong predictive capability for POD (AUC = 0.895). The optimal cutoff for postoperative NPTX2 in predicting POD was less than 421.4 pg/mL. Preoperative NPTX2 also demonstrated predictive value, albeit weaker (AUC = 0.683). Conclusion: Serum NPTX2 levels, both preoperatively and postoperatively, are promising biomarkers for predicting POD in ATAAD patients. These findings suggest that NPTX2 could be instrumental in early POD detection and intervention strategies.
