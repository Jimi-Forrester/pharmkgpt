37026834|t|Efficacy of peripheral electrical nerve stimulation on improvements of urodynamics and voiding diary in patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
37026834|a|BACKGROUND: Peripheral electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) is a routinely recommended treatment for non-neurogenic overactive bladder but has not been approved for patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD). This systematic review and meta-analysis was to elucidate the efficacy and safety of electrostimulation and thus provide firm evidence for treating NLUTD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically performed the literature search through PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases in March 2022. The eligible studies were identified across the inclusion criteria and the data on urodynamic outcomes, voiding diary parameters, and safety was collected to quantitatively synthesize the pooled mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were subsequently used to investigate the possible heterogeneity. This report was achieved in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies involving 464 subjects and 8 studies with 400 patients were included for systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. The pooled effect estimates indicated that electrostimulation could significantly improve urodynamic outcomes, including maximum cystometric capacity (MD=55.72, 95% CI 15.73, 95.72), maximum flow rate (MD=4.71, 95% CI 1.78, 7.65), maximal detrusor pressure (MD=-10.59, 95% CI -11.45, -9.73), voided volume (MD=58.14, 95% CI 42.97, 73.31), and post-void residual (MD=-32.46, 95% CI -46.63, -18.29); for voiding diary parameters, patients undergoing electrostimulation showed lower MDs of incontinence episodes per 24 hours (MD=-2.45, 95% CI -4.69, -0.20) and overactive bladder symptom score (MD=-4.46, 95% CI -6.00, -2.91). In addition to surface redness and swelling, no stimulation-related severe adverse events were reported else. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence demonstrated that PENS might be effective and safe for managing NLUTD, whereas more reliable data from large-scale randomized controlled trials are necessary to strengthen this concept.
