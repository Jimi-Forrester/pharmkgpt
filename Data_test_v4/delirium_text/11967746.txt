11967746|t|[The abbreviated mental test in a German version for detection of postoperative delirium].
11967746|a|OBJECTIVES: Delirium is the most common acute organic psychosis postoperatively, and occurs more frequently in the elderly than anticipated. The abbreviated mental test (AMT) is a widely used cognitive test in Great Britain. The present study assessed the AMT in a German version for diagnosis of postoperative delirium. METHODS: 40 patients (older than 65 years), scheduled for total knee or hip replacement, were tested repeatedly for delirium according to the ICD-10. These patients were investigated with the AMT simultaneously by a second investigator. RESULTS: Delirium was present in four orthopaedic patients (10 %) and was diagnosed correctly in these patients by the AMT. All but one patient without delirium showed no deterioriation in AMT score. CONCLUSION: As in Great Britain, the AMT in its German version is useful in diagnosing delirium. We recommend the use of the AMT preoperatively in elderly patients at risk for delirium.
