34767546|a|The rotenone-induced animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been used to investigate the pathogenesis of PD. Oxidative stress is one of the main contributors of neurodegeneration in PD. Flavonoids have the potential to modulate neuronal function and combat various neurodegenerative diseases. The pre- and post-supplementation of quercetin (50 mg/kg, p.o) was done in rats injected with rotenone (1.5 mg/kg, s.c). After the treatment, behavioral activities were monitored for motor activity, depression-like behavior, and cognitive changes. Rats were decapitated after behavioral analysis and the brain samples were dissected out for neurochemical and biochemical estimation. Results showed that supplementation of quercetin significantly (p<0.01) restored rotenone-induced motor and non-motor deficits (depression and cognitive impairments), enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (p<0.01), and attenuated neurotransmitter alterations (p<0.01). It is suggested that quercetin supplementation improves neurotransmitter levels by mitigating oxidative stress via increasing antioxidant enzyme activity and hence improves motor activity, cognitive functions, and reduces depressive behavior. The results of the present study showed that quercetin pre-supplementation produced more significant results as compared to post-supplementation. These findings show that quercetin can be a potential therapeutic agent to reduce the risk and progression of PD.
