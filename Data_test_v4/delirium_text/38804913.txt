38804913|t|Adherence to evidence-based guidelines for prevention of urinary retention in hip surgery patients: a multicentre observational study.
38804913|a|Urinary retention is a healthcare complication putting patients at risk of unnecessary suffering and harm. Orthopaedic patients are known to face an increased such risk, calling for evidence-based preoperative assessment and corresponding measures to prevent bladder problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate healthcare professionals' adherence to risk assessment guidelines for urinary retention in hip surgery patients. This was an observational study from January 2021 to April 2021 with a descriptive and comparative design, triangulating three data sources: (I) Medical records for 1382 hip surgery patients across 17 hospitals in Sweden were reviewed for preoperative risk assessments for urinary retention and voiding-related variables at discharge; (II) The patients completed a survey regarding postoperative lower urinary tract symptoms, and; (III) data were extracted from a national quality registry regarding type of surgery, preoperative physical status, and perioperative urinary complications. Group differences were analysed with Chi-square/Fisher's exact test, t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, or Mann-Whitney U-test. Logistic regression was used to analyse variables associated with completed risk assessments for urinary retention. Of all study participants, 23.4% (n = 323) had a preoperative documented risk assessment of urinary retention. Whether a risk assessment was performed was significantly associated with acute surgery [odds ratio (OR) 3.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.48-5.12] and undergoing surgery at an academic hospital (OR 4.59, 95% CI 2.68-7.85). Acute patients were more often affected by urinary retention and had bladder issues and/or an indwelling catheter at discharge. More than every tenth patient (11. 9%, n = 53) completing the survey experienced intensified bladder problems after their hip surgery. The study shows a lack of adherence to risk assessment for urinary retention according to evidence-based guidelines, which negatively affects quality of care and patient safety.
