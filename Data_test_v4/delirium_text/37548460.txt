37548460|a|ABSTRACT: This study aims to investigate whether venous injection of sedative agent or regional nerve block in alliance with major anesthesia could decrease the risk of postoperative delirium occurrence in patients receiving cardio-thoracic surgery. Electronic academic databases were retrieved for related publications, and statistical software was used for data pooling and analysis. Forrest plot was used to show the pooled sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio. Combined ROC curve was used to show the area of under curve of complex data. seven studies were included for analysis. The risk of occurrence of delirium still showed no difference (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.85 - 1.03) between intervention group and placebo group. Postoperative pain feeling was more alleviated in patients with prophylactic application of regional nerve block. Additionally, prophylactic application of regional nerve block could decrease the risk of post-operative in-hospital stay (RR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.02 - 0.54). Our study demonstrated that, in elderly patients or pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery, prophylactic application of regional nerve block failed to decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium. However, the option of regional nerve block could decrease the duration of in-hospitalization stay and alleviate the acute pain during postoperative period after open-heart surgery.
