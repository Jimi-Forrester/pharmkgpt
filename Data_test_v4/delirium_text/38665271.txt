38665271|a|There is considerable interest in the significance of structural and functional connections between the two brain hemispheres in terms of both normal function and in relation to psychiatric disorders. In recent years, many studies have used voxel mirrored homotopic connectivity analysis of resting state data to investigate the importance of connectivity between homotopic regions in the brain hemispheres in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. The current review summarizes findings from these voxel mirrored homotopic connectivity studies in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depression disorders, and schizophrenia, as well as disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, epilepsy, and insomnia. Overall, other than attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, studies across psychiatric disorders report decreased homotopic resting state functional connectivity in the default mode, attention, salience, sensorimotor, social cognition, visual recognition, primary visual processing, and reward networks, which are often associated with symptom severity and/or illness onset/duration. Decreased homotopic resting state functional connectivity may therefore represent a transdiagnostic marker for general psychopathology. In terms of disorder specificity, the extensive decreases in homotopic resting state functional connectivity in autism differ markedly from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, despite both occurring during early childhood and showing extensive co-morbidity. A pattern of more posterior than anterior regions showing reductions in schizophrenia is also distinctive. Going forward, more studies are needed to elucidate the functions of these homotopic functional connections in both health and disorder and focusing on associations with general psychopathology, and not only on disorder specific symptoms.
