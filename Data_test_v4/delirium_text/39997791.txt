39997791|t|Exploring Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Critical Care Nursing: A Systematic Review.
39997791|a|Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly employed in healthcare across diverse domains, including medical imaging, personalized diagnostics, therapeutic interventions, and predictive analytics using electronic health records. Its integration is particularly impactful in critical care, where AI has demonstrated the potential to enhance patient outcomes. This systematic review critically evaluates the current applications of AI within the domain of critical care nursing. Methods: This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024545955) and was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Comprehensive searches were performed across MEDLINE/PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Results: The initial review identified 1364 articles, of which 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies employed diverse AI techniques, including classical models (e.g., logistic regression), machine learning approaches (e.g., support vector machines, random forests), deep learning architectures (e.g., neural networks), and generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT). The analyzed health outcomes encompassed postoperative complications, ICU admissions and discharges, triage assessments, pressure injuries, sepsis, delirium, and predictions of adverse events or critical vital signs. Most studies relied on structured data from electronic medical records, such as vital signs and laboratory results, supplemented by unstructured data, including nursing notes and patient histories; two studies also integrated audio data. Conclusion: AI demonstrates significant potential in nursing, facilitating the use of clinical practice data for research and decision-making. The choice of AI techniques varies based on the specific objectives and requirements of the model. However, the heterogeneity of the studies included in this review limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of AI applications in critical care nursing. Future research should focus on more robust, interventional studies to assess the impact of AI on nursing-sensitive outcomes. Additionally, exploring a broader range of health outcomes and AI applications in critical care will be crucial for advancing AI integration in nursing practices.
