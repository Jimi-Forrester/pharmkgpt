34535362|t|Palliative Care Training for Geriatric Psychiatry Fellows: A National Survey Project.
34535362|a|OBJECTIVES: Palliative care is an essential part of the standard of care for individuals with serious medical illnesses. Integration of palliative care and mental health is important for elderly patients with medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Geriatric psychiatrists are natural stewards of palliative care-mental health integration, however this is contingent on palliative care training. Currently, palliative care training in geriatric psychiatry fellowship programs is uncharacterized. We surveyed geriatric psychiatry fellowship program directors in the United States to assess current palliative care training practices. METHODS: Web-based anonymous survey of geriatric psychiatry fellowship training directors RESULTS: Forty-six percent (28/61) of program directors responded. Seventy one percent (20/28) of programs provide didactics on palliative care. Seventy-seven percent (20/26) of programs provide clinical experiences in palliative care. Sixty-three percent (15/24) have formalized interactions between geriatric psychiatry and palliative care fellows. CONCLUSIONS: Palliative care training for geriatric psychiatry fellows is robust but unstandardized. Operationalizing palliative care training for geriatric psychiatrists may improve mental health integration into serious illness care.
