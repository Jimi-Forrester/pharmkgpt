35729466|t|The Transcription Factor, alpha1ACT, Acts Through a MicroRNA Network to Regulate Neurogenesis and Cell Death During Neonatal Cerebellar Development.
35729466|a|MicroRNAs, a class of small RNA regulators, function throughout neurodevelopment, from neural stem cell neurogenesis to neuronal maturation, synaptic formation, and plasticity. alpha1ACT, a transcription factor (TF), plays a critical role in neonatal cerebellar development by regulating an ensemble of genes. Of these, ChIP-seq analysis matched near 50% genes directly regulated by alpha1ACT. Yet, more than half the regulated transcripts lacked direct interaction with alpha1ACT. To investigate whether alpha1ACT acts through a microRNA network, we studied alpha1ACT-associated simultaneous miRNA:mRNA transcriptome profiles, using miRNA-seq paired with RNA-seq. Thirty-one differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) associated with alpha1ACT-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were profiled in alpha1ACT-overexpressing PC12 cells and were further validated in neonatal transgenic mouse cerebellum overexpressing alpha1ACT in a context-dependent manner. Here, we also demonstrated that alpha1ACT facilitates neurogenesis and development of dendritic synapses and is partially a result of the downregulation of the miR-99 cluster, miR-143, miR-23, miR-146, miR-363, and miR-484. On the other hand, the miR-181, miR-125, and miR-708 clusters were upregulated by alpha1ACT, which inhibit MAPK signaling and cell death pathways by targeting Ask1, Odc1, Atf4, and Nuf2 for decreased expression. MiR-181a-5p was verified as the most abundant DEM in neonatal cerebellum, which was further induced by alpha1ACT. Overall, under alpha1ACT modulation, up-/downregulated miRNA clusters with their paired target genes may form a regulatory network controlling the balance between the neuronal proliferation, differentiation, and cell death in the cerebellum to promote neonatal development. Our findings concerning the alpha1ACT-related miRNA/mRNA expression profiles in neonatal cerebellum may inform future investigations for cerebellar development.
