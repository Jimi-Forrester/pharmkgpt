36497843|a|The mental health impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently the subject of intense research. Mental disorders in the course of coronavirus infection are non-specific. They most often have a sudden onset and short-term course and resolve spontaneously or after the administration of low doses of antipsychotic drugs. At the same time, attempts have been made to develop recommendations for COVID-19 therapy. Single reports suggest the effectiveness of amantadine in the treatment. The mechanism of action of the drug in this case is not known; it is expected that amantadine, by reducing the expression of the cathepsin L gene, may interfere with SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition, this drug stimulates dopaminergic transmission, which may result in numerous side effects, often of a neuropsychological nature, the most common of which are visual hallucinations. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to unequivocally diagnose the cause of mental disorders among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who took amatatide for off-label treatment. A clear assessment of whether the psychological symptoms in this group of patients are the primary or secondary clinical manifestation of the infection or a complication of amantadine treatment is difficult. In this context, we attempted to describe a case of a patient with psychotic symptoms who was confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and treated with amantadine.
