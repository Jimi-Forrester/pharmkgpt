However, studies on blood-based biomarkers associated with other biological processes for a comprehensive evaluation of AD status are limited. METHODS: We developed a blood-based, multiplex biomarker assay for AD that measures the levels of 21 proteins involved in multiple biological pathways. We evaluated the assay's performance for classifying AD and indicating AD-related endophenotypes in three independent cohorts from Chinese or European-descent populations. RESULTS: The 21-protein assay accurately classified AD (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.9407 to 0.9867) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; AUC = 0.8434 to 0.8945) while also indicating brain amyloid pathology. Moreover, the assay simultaneously evaluated the changes of five biological processes in individuals and revealed the ethnic-specific dysregulations of biological processes upon AD progression. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated the utility of a blood-based, multi-pathway biomarker assay for early screening and staging of AD, providing insights for patient stratification and precision medicine. HIGHLIGHTS: The authors developed a blood-based biomarker assay for Alzheimer's disease. The 21-protein assay classifies AD/MCI and indicates brain amyloid pathology. The 21-protein assay can simultaneously assess activities of five biological processes. Ethnic-specific dysregulations of biological processes in AD were revealed.
