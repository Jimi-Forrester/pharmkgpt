36290606|t|Kynurenine Pathway of Tryptophan Metabolism Is Associated with Hospital Mortality in Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Prospective Cohort Study.
36290606|a|Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) involves dysregulated immune-inflammatory responses, characterized by severe oxidative stress and high mortality. Metabolites modulating the inflammatory and immune responses may play a central role in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Most biogenic amines may induce the production of reactive oxygen species, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and programmed cell death. We conducted a prospective study on metabolic profiling specific to the amino acids and biogenic amines of 69 patients with ARDS. Overall, hospital mortality was 52.2%. Between day 1 and day 7 after ARDS onset, plasma kynurenine levels and the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio were significantly higher among non-survivors than in survivors (all p < 0.05). Urine metabolic profiling revealed a significantly higher prevalence of tryptophan degradation and higher concentrations of metabolites downstream of the kynurenine pathway among non-survivors than among survivors upon ARDS onset. Cox regression models revealed that plasma kynurenine levels and the plasma kynurenine/tryptophan ratio on day 1 were independently associated with hospital mortality. The activation of the kynurenine pathway was associated with mortality in patients with ARDS. Metabolic phenotypes and modulating metabolic perturbations of the kynurenine pathway could perhaps serve as prognostic markers or as a target for therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing oxidative stress and mortality in ARDS.
