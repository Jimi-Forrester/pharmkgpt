31048034|a|The sigma-1 (sigma1) receptor is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein, enriched in mitochondria-associated membranes. Its activation triggers physiological responses to ER stress and modulate Ca2+ mobilization in mitochondria. Small sigma1 agonist molecules activate the protein and act behaviorally as antidepressant, anti-amnesic and neuroprotective agents. Recently, several chemically unrelated molecules were shown to be sigma1 receptor positive modulators (PMs), with some of them a clear demonstration of their allostericity. We here examined whether a sigma1 PM also shows neuroprotective potentials in pharmacological and genetic models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For this aim, we describe (+-)-2-(3-chlorophenyl)-3,3,5,5-tetramethyl-2-oxo-[1,4,2]-oxazaphosphinane (OZP002) as a novel sigma1 PM. OZP002 does not bind sigma1 sites but induces sigma1 effects in vivo and boosts sigma1 agonist activity. OZP002 was antidepressant in the forced swim test and its effect was blocked by the sigma1 antagonist NE-100 or in sigma1 receptor knockout mice. It potentiated the antidepressant effect of the sigma1 agonist igmesine. In mice tested for Y-maze alternation or passive avoidance, OZP002 prevented scopolamine-induced learning deficits, in a NE-100 sensitive manner. Pre-administered IP before an ICV injection of amyloid Abeta25-35 peptide, a pharmacological model of Alzheimer's disease, OZP002 prevented the learning deficits induced by the peptide after one week in the Y-maze, passive avoidance and novel object tests. Biochemical analyses of the mouse hippocampi showed that OZP002 significantly decreased Abeta25-35-induced increases in reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and increases in Bax, TNFalpha and IL-6 levels. Immunohistochemically, OZP002 prevented Abeta25-35-induced reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis in the hippocampus. It also alleviated Abeta25-35-induced decreases in synaptophysin level and choline acetyltransferase activity. Moreover, chronically administered in APPswe mice during 2 months, OZP002 prevented learning deficits (in all tests plus place learning in the water-maze) and increased biochemical markers. This study shows that sigma1 PM with high neuropotective potential can be identified, combining pharmacological efficacy, selectivity and therapeutic safety, and identifies a novel promising compound, OZP002.
