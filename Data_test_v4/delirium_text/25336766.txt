25336766|a|BACKGROUND: Mania is an important psychological problem. This disorder can be detected anywhere in the world. This psychological disorder becomes an important concern in modern psychological medicine. AIMS: There are some researches on the pathogenesis of this disease; however, there is no clear-cut on its etiopathogenesis. The big query is on the genetic underlying of the mania. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, the author uses the physiological genomics study to better understand the pathogenesis of mania. RESULTS: According to this work, the physiogenomics relationship on chromosomes could not be identified. CONCLUSION: The result from this study shows that mania might not have a genetic, but epigenic origin, which is different from the well-known disorder in psychological medicine, Alzheimer's disease.
