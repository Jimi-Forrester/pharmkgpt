38282693|a|Introduction: Any persistent degree of cognitive impairment in older adults is a concern as it can progress to dementia. This study aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors for early postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients undergoing spine surgery. Methods: Patients were enrolled from a previous prospective observational study after screening for normal cognitive function using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Cognitive function was evaluated before surgery and at 1 week, month, and year post-surgery using MMSE and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (MoCA). Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was determined using the MoCA scores adjusted for age. POCD was defined as a drop of three or more points on the MMSE 1 week post-surgery. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed to identify POCD risk factors. Results: A total of 427 patients were included. Eighty-five (20%) had pre-existing MCI. The MCI group showed lower MoCA scores at each time point (baseline, 1 week after surgery, 1 month after surgery, 1 year after surgery) compared to the non-MCI group. Those in the MCI group had a higher rate of admission to intensive care unit after surgery, postoperative delirium, and POCD 1 week post-surgery, than those in the non-MCI group (16.5% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.008; 27.1% vs. 15.8%, p = 0.024; and 18.8% vs. 8.2%, p < 0.001, respectively). Among them, 10.3% were assessed for POCD on postoperative day 7 and self-reported poor social roles and physical functioning 1 week postoperatively. Conclusion: Preoperative MCI was seen in ~20% of surgical patients aged >70 years. POCD was seen in ~20% of patients with pre-existing MCI, and ~ 10% of those without. Benzodiazepine use, significant comorbidities, pre-existing MCI, and depressive tendencies were risk factors for POCD.
