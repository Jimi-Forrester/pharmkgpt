28953621|t|Perceptions, attitudes, and current practices regards delirium in China: A survey of 917 critical care nurses and physicians in China.
28953621|a|The purpose of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and managements regarding delirium of intensive care nurses and physicans, and to assess the perceived barriers related to intensive care unit (ICU) delirium monitoring in China. A descriptive survey was distributed to 1156 critical care nurses and physicians from 74 tertiary and secondary hospitals across Shandong province, China. The overall response rate was 86.18% (n = 917). The majority of respondents (88%) believed that deirium was associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, and 79.72% thought delirium was associated with prolonged length of hospitalization. Only 14.17% of respondents believed that delirium was common in the ICU setting. Only 25.62% of the respondents reported routine screening of ICU delirium, and only 15.81% utilized Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit screening tools. "Lack of appropriate screening tools" and "time restraints" were the most common perceived barriers. 45.4% of the participants had never received any education on ICU delirium. In conclusion, most nurses and physicians consider ICU delirium to be a serious problem, but lack knowledge on delirium and monitor this condition poorly. The survey infers a disconnection between the perceived significance and current monitoring of ICU delirium. There is a critical unmet need for in-service education on ICU delirium for physicians and nurses in China.
