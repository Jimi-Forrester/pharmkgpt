17194646|a|Neurofibrillary degeneration is well correlated to the clinical signs of Alzheimer disease. However, the amyloid cascade is so well established in the scientific and medical community that the role of neurofibrillary degeneration in Alzheimer's disease etiopathogenesis is often underestimated. However, neuronal vulnerability is clearly a key factor for facilitating the amyloid pathology which allows the propagation of the degenerating process. In the present work, the role of tau pathology as both diagnostic marker and therapeutic target is highlighted in Alzheimer disease and related disorders.
