33974497|a|The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that lacks globally accessible effective antivirals or extensively available vaccines. Numerous clinical trials are exploring the applicability of repurposed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting cytokines that cause adverse COVID-19-related pathologies, and novel mAbs directly targeting SARS-CoV-2. However, comorbidities and the incidence of cytokine storm (CS)-associated pathological complexities in some COVID-19 patients may limit the clinical use of these drugs. Additionally, CS-targeting mAbs have the potential to cause adverse events that restrict their applicability in patients with comorbidities. Novel mAbs targeting SARS-CoV-2 require pharmacological and toxicological characterization before a marketable product becomes available. The affordability of novel mAbs across the global economic spectrum may seriously limit their accessibility. This review presents a perspective on antibody-based research efforts and their limitations for COVID-19.
