35775444|a|BACKGROUND: Hospital visitation restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted concerns about unintended consequences for older patients, including an increased incidence of delirium and agitation. While first-line interventions for these conditions are non-pharmacologic, a lack of family support could result in increased use of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, which are associated with poor outcomes in older adults. Little is known about the association of visitation policies with use of these medications among older adults. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study among adults aged >=65 hospitalized from March 1 through May 31, 2020 at four hospitals in the Mid-Atlantic. The dates of onset of visitation restrictions (i.e., hospital-wide guidelines barring visitors) were collected from hospital administrators. Outcomes were use of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, assessed using patient-level electronic health record data. Using multivariable logistic regression with hospital and study-day fixed effects, the quasi-experimental study design leveraged the staggered onset of visitation restrictions across the hospitals to measure the odds of receiving each medication when visitors were versus were not allowed. RESULTS: Among 2931 patients, mean age was 76.6 years (SD, 8.3), 51.6% were female, 58.6% white, 32.5% black, and 2.6% Hispanic. Overall, 924 (31.5%) patients received a benzodiazepine and 298 (10.2%) an antipsychotic. The adjusted odds of benzodiazepine use was lower on days when visitors were versus were not allowed (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39, 0.99). Antipsychotic use did not significantly differ between days when visitors were versus were not allowed (AOR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.43, 2.21). CONCLUSIONS: Among older patients hospitalized during the first wave of the pandemic, benzodiazepine use was lower on days when visitors were allowed. These findings suggest that the presence of caregivers impacts use of potentially inappropriate medications among hospitalized older adults, supporting efforts to recognize caregivers as essential members of the care team.
