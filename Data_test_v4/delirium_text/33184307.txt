33184307|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a substantial loss of neurons and synapses throughout the brain. The exact mechanism behind the neurodegeneration is still unclear, but recent data suggests that spreading of amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology via extracellular vesicles (EVs) may contribute to disease progression. We have previously shown that an incomplete degradation of Abeta42 protofibrils by astrocytes results in the release of EVs containing neurotoxic Abeta. Here, we describe the cellular mechanisms behind EV-associated neurotoxicity in detail. EVs were isolated from untreated and Abeta42 protofibril exposed neuroglial co-cultures, consisting mainly of astrocytes. The EVs were added to cortical neurons for 2 or 4 days and the neurodegenerative processes were followed with immunocytochemistry, time-lapse imaging and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Addition of EVs from Abeta42 protofibril exposed co-cultures resulted in synaptic loss, severe mitochondrial impairment and apoptosis. TEM analysis demonstrated that the EVs induced axonal swelling and vacuolization of the neuronal cell bodies. Interestingly, EV exposed neurons also displayed pathological lamellar bodies of cholesterol deposits in lysosomal compartments. Taken together, our data show that the secretion of EVs from Abeta exposed cells induces neuronal dysfunction in several ways, indicating a central role for EVs in the progression of Abeta-induced pathology.
