36766442|a|The vast use of corticosteroids (CCSs) globally has led to an increase in CCS-induced neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs), a very common manifestation in patients after CCS consumption. These neuropsychiatric disorders range from depression, insomnia, and bipolar disorders to panic attacks, overt psychosis, and many other cognitive changes in such subjects. Though their therapeutic importance in treating and improving many clinical symptoms overrides the complications that arise after their consumption, still, there has been an alarming rise in NPD cases in recent years, and they are seen as the greatest public health challenge globally; therefore, these potential side effects cannot be ignored. It has also been observed that many of the neuronal functional activities are regulated and controlled by genomic variants with epigenetic factors (DNA methylation, non-coding RNA, and histone modeling, etc.), and any alterations in these regulatory mechanisms affect normal cerebral development and functioning. This study explores a general overview of emerging concerns of CCS-induced NPDs, the effective molecular biology approaches that can revitalize NPD therapy in an extremely specialized, reliable, and effective manner, and the possible gene-editing-based therapeutic strategies to either prevent or cure NPDs in the future.
