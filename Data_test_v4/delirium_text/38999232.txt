38999232|t|Trends in Hospital Stay, Complication Rate, and Mortality in Hip Fracture Patients: A Two-Decade Comparison at a National Tertiary Referral Center.
38999232|a|Background: Since the turn of the century, the age-adjusted incidence of proximal femoral fractures has caused a plateau or fall. However, it was anticipated that the number of patients with proximal femoral fractures would rise as life expectancy rose and the population over 80 years old expanded. The aim of this study was to compare the length of hospital stay, complication rate, and mortality in patients with proximal femoral fractures between two different time periods: 20 years ago and the present. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of medical records of patients aged 65 years and above who underwent surgery for proximal femoral fractures between January 2000 and December 2001 and between January 2020 and December 2021. We collected information on age, gender, fracture type, length of hospital stay, and complication rate. Dates of death were obtained from the Ministry of the Interior and Safety. Results: We included 136 patients who were operated on between 2000 and 2001 and 134 patients between 2020 and 2021. The average age increased significantly from 71.6 years to 79.0 years (p < 0.001). The length of hospital stay decreased dramatically from 15.1 days to 6.0 days (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in delirium, urinary tract infection, or pneumonia. No difference was found in 30-day or 1-year mortality between the two groups. Conclusions: The complication rate and mortality between the two time periods appeared comparable, although the length of hospital stay decreased substantially. Therefore, we recommend considering expedited discharge from the acute care hospital for elderly hip fracture patients while implementing an individualized approach for better outcomes.
