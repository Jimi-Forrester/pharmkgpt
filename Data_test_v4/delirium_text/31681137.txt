31681137|t|Albumin Exchange in Alzheimer's Disease: Might CSF Be an Alternative Route to Plasma?
31681137|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) in brain parenchyma is thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is transported from the brain to the plasma via complex transport mechanisms at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). About 90-95% of plasma Abeta may be bound to albumin. Replacement of serum albumin in plasma has been proposed as a promising therapy for AD. However, the efficacy of this approach may be compromised by altered BBB Abeta receptors in AD, as well as multiple pools of Abeta from other organs in exchange with plasma Abeta, competing for albumin binding sites. The flow of interstitial fluid (ISF) into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is another major route of Abeta clearance. Though the concentration of albumin in CSF is much lower than in plasma, the mixing of CSF with ISF is not impeded by a highly selective barrier and, hence, Abeta in the two pools is in more direct exchange. Furthermore, unlike in plasma, Abeta in CSF is not in direct exchange with multiple organ sources of Abeta. Here we consider albumin replacement in CSF as an alternative method for therapeutic brain Abeta removal and describe the possible advantages and rationale supporting this hypothesis.
