24623361|a|The link between neuroinflammation and neurogenesis is an area of intensive research in contemporary neuroscience. The burgeoning amount of evidence accumulated over the past decade has been incredible, and now there remains the figuring out of minutia to give us a more complete picture of what individual, synergistic, and antagonistic events are occurring between neurogenesis and neuroinflammation. An intricate study of the inflammatory microenvironment influenced by the presence of the various inflammatory components like cytokines, chemokines, and immune cells is essential for: 1) understanding how neurogenesis can be affected in such a specialized niche and 2) applying the knowledge gained for the treatment of cognitive and/or motor deficits arising from inflammation-associated diseases like stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. This review is written to provide the reader with up-to-date information explaining how these inflammatory components are effecting changes on neurogenesis.
