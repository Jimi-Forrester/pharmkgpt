35862342|a|OBJECTIVE: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has been used in cognition impairment due to various neuropsychiatric disorders. However, its optimum parameters and the neuroimaging mechanism are still of uncertainty. In order to simulate a study setting as close to real world as possible, the present study introduces a new orthogonally-designed protocol, consisting of the rTMS intervention with four key parameters (stimulating site, frequency, intensity and pulse number) and three different levels in each one, and aims to investigate the optimum parameters and the brain activity and connectivity in default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), central executive network (CEN) following rTMS intervention to post-stroke cognition impairment (PSCI). METHODS: A single-center, orthogonally-designed, triple-blind randomized controlled trial will be conducted and forty-five PSCI patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of nine active rTMS groups based on four rTMS paraments: stimulating site, frequency, intensity and pulse number. Neuropsychological, activities of daily living, quality of life and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evaluations were be performed pre-, post- and 3 months after rTMS. DISCUSSION: This study evaluates the optimum parameters of rTMS for patients with post-stroke cognition impairment and explores the alteration of neural function in DMN, DAN, CEN brain network. These results would facilitate the standardized application of rTMS in cognition impairment rehabilitation.
