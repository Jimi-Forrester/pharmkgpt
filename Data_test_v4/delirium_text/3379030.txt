3379030|t|Treatment of severe, refractory agitation with a haloperidol drip.
3379030|a|A case of agitated delirium secondary to bilateral occipital cerebral infarctions in a cancer patient was refractory to trials of large doses of intravenous psychotropic agents, but continuous intravenous infusion of haloperidol controlled agitation rapidly and safely. A total haloperidol dose of 600 mg/day was used without complications. Haloperidol by continuous infusion should be considered in the management of severe, refractory agitation in patients who are medically ill.
