38019259|a|OBJECTIVE: Cancer poses a significant challenge in modern medicine, standing as the primary cause of death in many countries, second only to cardiovascular diseases. Among the various treatments available, carboplatin, a chemotherapy drug, is employed for specific cancer types, including brain carcinoma. The main objective of this investigation is to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of carboplatin by utilizing niosomal nanocarriers. METHODS: We synthesized nanoniosomal carboplatin using the reverse-phase evaporation technique and conducted an assessment of its particle size, zeta potential, and drug-release properties. Subsequently, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of nanoniosomal carboplatin using the C6 rat glioma cell line. RESULTS: Our research revealed that these niosomal nanoparticles possessed a particle size of 290.5+-5.5 nm and a zeta potential of -21.7+-7.4 mV. The amount of encapsulated drug and drug loading level were found to be 60.2+-2.3% and 2.5+-1.1%, respectively. Importantly, the cytotoxic impact of these nanoniosomes on the C6 rat glioma cell line exhibited a significant increase compared to the free drug (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on our discoveries, it is evident that carboplatin niosomal nanocarriers hold potential as an innovative approach to chemotherapy for brain cancer therapy.
