1436693|t|Axonal sprouting induced in the sciatic nerve by the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and other antiproteases.
1436693|a|Protease inhibition is the mechanism by which some trophic factors promote the extension of neurites. In the rat sciatic nerve, we assessed the ability to induce sprouts of the APP isoform that embodies the Kunitz antiprotease domain and other antiproteases. With the electron microscope, axonal sprouts were found when antiproteases were supplied but not after administration of inactive substances. We conclude that axons have a drive to sprout which can be released by the unbalance of an extracellular protease-antiprotease system. We propose that this system is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
