Polygala tenuifolia is a traditional Chinese medicine with multiple neuroprotective effects. In present study, we investigated the effects of three active constituents [3,6'-disinapoyl sucrose (DISS), onjisaponin B (OB) and tenuifolin (TEN)] of Polygala tenuifolia (PT) on the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) to identify the potential active constituent of PT promoting hippocampal neurogenesis. METHODS: NSCs were isolated from hippocampi of newborn C57BL/6 mice, and transfected with mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene to establish an AD cell model (APP-NSCs). 3-(4,5- Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays were performed, and the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs were assessed by neurosphere formation assay, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay and immunofluorescence (IF) staining analysis. APP/PS1 transgenic mice were administrated with the potential active constituent DISS for 4 weeks. Morris water maze (MWM), Nissl staining assay and IF staining assays were carried out to evaluate the cognitive function, neural damages and hippocampal neurogenesis, respectively. RESULTS: DISS exerted the optimal ability to strengthen APP-NSCs proliferation and neuronal differentiation, followed by OB and TEN. Furthermore, DISS treatment for 4 weeks strikingly rescued the cognitive deficits, neuronal injures, and neurogenesis disorder in adult APP/PS1 transgenic mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that DISS is the constituent of PT that triggers the most potent increase of hippocampal neurogenesis in our mouse model of AD.
