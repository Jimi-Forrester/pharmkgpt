34574951|t|Perceptions of Care Quality during an Acute Hospital Stay for Persons with Dementia and Family/Carers.
34574951|a|OBJECTIVES: to report on acute hospital care experiences for persons with dementia and family/carers in a pilot study (PiP) of person-centred care compared with usual care. METHODS: participants were recruited from one acute aged care ward and one mixed medical/surgical ward. One-on-one interviews occurred soon after discharge using a semi-structured interview guide framed by person-centred principles whereby the person is: V-valued; I-treated as an individual; P-perceived as having a unique identity; and S-supported socially and psychologically. Data were analysed deductively with reference to these a priori principles. RESULTS: 11 consented persons with dementia and 36 family/carers participated. A total of eight core VIPS concepts were derived from the data. While many occasions of person-centred care occurred, there was variability in staff expertise, interest and aptitude for dementia care work. Neglect of person-centred principles more frequently occurred for the usual care group, where staff failed to place the person and their family/carer at the centre of service. CONCLUSIONS: person-centred services for persons with dementia requires that hospital executive equip staff with the relevant knowledge, skills and support to adhere to person-centred care guidelines. Hospitals must address workplace cultures and procedures that favour organisational systems over person-centred services.
