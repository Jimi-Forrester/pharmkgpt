37213811|t|Heavy metals contamination in shrimp and crab from southwest regions in Bangladesh: Possible health risk assessment.
37213811|a|Shrimp and Crab, important sources of protein, are currently being adversely affected by the rising industrialization, which has led to higher levels of heavy metals. The goal of this study was to evaluate the health risks of contamination associated with nine heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cu, Cr, Zn, Ni, As, Al, and Fe) in two species of shrimp (Macrobrachium rosenbergii and Metapenaeus monoceros) and one species of crab (Scylla serrata) that were collected from the Khulna, Satkhira, and Bagerhat areas of Bangladesh. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used for the study. The results showed that all metal concentrations in shrimp and crab samples were below the recommended level, indicating that ingestion of these foods would not pose any substantial health risks to individuals. To evaluate the non-carcinogenic health risks, the target hazard quotient (THQ) and hazard index (HI) were determined, and the target cancer risk (TR) was utilized to evaluate the carcinogenic health risks. From the health point of view, this study showed that crustaceans obtained from the study sites were non - toxic (THQ and HI < 1), and long-term, continuous intake is unlikely to pose any significant health hazards (TR = 10-7-10-5) from either carcinogenic or non-carcinogenic effects.
