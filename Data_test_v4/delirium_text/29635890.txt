29635890|t|MiR-21 attenuates apoptosis-triggered by amyloid-beta via modulating PDCD4/ PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta pathway in SH-SY5Y cells.
29635890|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains the most common neurodegenerative disease with amyloid beta (Abeta) formatted and accumulated. Recently, microRNAs have been identified as significant regulators in neurogenesis of the central nervous system (CNS). However, the biological role of miR-21 in AD remains unclear. The purpose of our study was to investigate the mechanism of miR-21 in AD. AD model was established using 20 muM Abeta1-42 in SH-SY5Y cells. Abeta1-42 can induce cell apoptosis via increasing Bax and decreasing Bcl-2 protein levels. Meanwhile, we observed that miR-21 was remarkably elevated by indicated Abeta1-42 in vitro. Subsequently, miR-21 mimics were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells and it was found that miR-21 can inhibit cell apoptosis induced by Abeta1-42. Programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4), an important tumor suppressor in various cancers has been reported to prevent AKT activation. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/GSK-3beta pathway can release a survival signal to protect from multiple injuries. Interestingly, it was found that PDCD4 was involved in miR-21-repressed cell apoptosis in AD models. miR-21 mimics can increase the PI3K, AKT and GSK-3beta activity while PDCD4 ovexexpression inhibited their activity respectively. Moreover, knockdown of PDCD4 can rescue PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta pathway in SH-SY5Y cells. Taken these together, it was suggested by our data that miR-21 can exert protective roles in AD, which might be dependent on PDCD4/PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta signaling pathway in vitro.
