34300254|a|Dementia is an important health issue worldwide, and non-pharmacological strategies for the management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are considered to be important. This review analyzes the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for BPSD. Thirteen electronic databases were comprehensively searched to find clinical studies using acupuncture on BPSD, published up to December 2020. Five randomized controlled clinical trials and two before-after studies, mainly on Alzheimer's disease (AD), were included. Meta-analysis suggested that the total effective rate based on BPSD symptoms in the acupuncture combined with psychotropic drugs group was significantly higher than that in the psychotropic drugs group (risk ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.45; I2 = 51%). In terms of other outcomes related to BPSD, acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy, but not as monotherapy, was associated with significant benefits in most included studies. However, the included studies did not have optimal methodological quality. Our review highlights the limited evidence proving the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for BPSD in patients with AD. Although some clinical studies have reported the potential benefits of adjuvant acupuncture in managing BPSD, the evidence is not robust and is based on small studies. Therefore, high-quality research in this field is needed.
