38793703|a|BCG vaccination affects other diseases beyond tuberculosis by unknown-potentially immunomodulatory-mechanisms. Recent studies have shown that BCG vaccination administered during overt type 1 diabetes (T1D) improved glycemic control and affected immune and metabolic parameters. Here, we comprehensively characterized Ghanaian T1D patients with or without routine neonatal BCG vaccination to identify vaccine-associated alterations. Ghanaian long-term T1D patients (n = 108) and matched healthy controls (n = 214) were evaluated for disease-related clinical, metabolic, and immunophenotypic parameters and compared based on their neonatal BCG vaccination status. The majority of study participants were BCG-vaccinated at birth and no differences in vaccination rates were detected between the study groups. Notably, glycemic control metrics, i.e., HbA1c and IDAA1c, showed significantly lower levels in BCG-vaccinated as compared to unvaccinated patients. Immunophenotype comparisons identified higher expression of the T cell activation marker CD25 on CD8+ T cells from BCG-vaccinated T1D patients. Correlation analysis identified a negative correlation between HbA1c levels and CD25 expression on CD8+ T cells. In addition, we observed fractional increases in glycolysis metabolites (phosphoenolpyruvate and 2/3-phosphoglycerate) in BCG-vaccinated T1D patients. These results suggest that neonatal BCG vaccination is associated with better glycemic control and increased activation of CD8+ T cells in T1D patients.
