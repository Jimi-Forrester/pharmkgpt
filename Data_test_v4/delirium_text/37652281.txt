37652281|a|Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play crucial roles in various human disorders, with the alpha7, alpha4, alpha6, and alpha3-containing nAChR subtypes extensively studied in relation to conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, nicotine dependence, mood disorders, and stress disorders. In contrast, the alpha2-nAChR subunit has received less attention due to its more restricted expression and the scarcity of specific agonists and antagonists for studying its function. Nevertheless, recent research has shed light on the unique expression pattern of the Chrna2 gene, which encodes the alpha2-nAChR subunit, and its involvement in distinct populations of inhibitory interneurons. This review highlights the structure, pharmacology, localization, function, and disease associations of alpha2-containing nAChRs and points to the unique expression pattern of the Chrna2 gene and its role in different inhibitory interneuron populations. These populations, including the oriens lacunosum moleculare (OLM) cells in the hippocampus, Martinotti cells in the neocortex, and Renshaw cells in the spinal cord, share common features and contribute to recurrent inhibitory microcircuits. Thus, the alpha2-nAChR subunit's unique expression pattern in specific interneuron populations and its role in recurrent inhibitory microcircuits highlight its importance in various physiological processes. Further research is necessary to uncover the comprehensive functionality of alpha2-containing nAChRs, delineate their specific contributions to neuronal circuits, and investigate their potential as therapeutic targets for related disorders.
