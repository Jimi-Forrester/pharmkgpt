35740958|t|Association between Vitamin D Receptor Gene Polymorphisms and Periodontal Bacteria: A Clinical Pilot Study.
35740958|a|Background: Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease caused by microorganisms involving the supporting tissues of the teeth. Gene variants may influence both the composition of the biofilm in the oral cavity and the host response. The objective of the study was to investigate the potential correlations between the disease susceptibility, the presence and the quantity of periodontopathogenic oral bacterial composition and the VDR gene polymorphisms. Methods: Fifty (50) unrelated periodontal patients and forty-one (41) healthy controls were selected for genomic DNA extraction. DNA concentration was measured and analyzed. The periodontopathogenic bacterial species were identified and quantified using a Real Time PCR performed with species-specific primers and probes. Results: Genotype distribution showed a different distribution between the groups for BsmI rs1544410 genotypes (p = 0.0001) with a prevalence of the G(b) allele in periodontal patients (p = 0.0003). Statistical significance was also found for VDR TaqI rs731236 (p <= 0.00001) with a prevalence of the T(T) allele in periodontal patients (p <= 0.00001). The average bacterial copy count for the periodontitis group was significantly higher than that of control group. Dividing patients into two groups based on high or low bacterial load, FokI rs2228570 T allele (f) was statistically more represented in patients with high bacterial load. Conclusions: The findings of the study suggest the involvement of the VDR gene BsmI and TaqI polymorphisms in periodontal disease, while FokI and BsmI may be involved in determining an increased presence of periodontopathogens.
