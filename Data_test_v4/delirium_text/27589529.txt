27589529|t|Reliability and Validity of a Novel Internet-Based Battery to Assess Mood and Cognitive Function in the Elderly.
27589529|a|Dementia is a chronic condition in the elderly and depression is often a concurrent symptom. As populations continue to age, accessible and useful tools to screen for cognitive function and its associated symptoms in elderly populations are needed. The aim of this study was to test the reliability and validity of a new internet-based assessment battery for screening mood and cognitive function in an elderly population. Specifically, the Helping Hand Technology (HHT) assessments for depression (HHT-D) and global cognitive function (HHT-G) were evaluated in a sample of 57 elderly participants (22 male, 35 female) aged 59-85 years. The study sample was categorized into three groups: 1) dementia (n = 8; Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score 10-24), 2) mild cognitive impairment (n = 24; MMSE score 25-28), and 3) control (n = 25; MMSE score 29-30). Test-retest reliability (Pearson correlation coefficient, r) and internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha, alpha) of the HHT-D and HHT-G were assessed. Validity of the HHT-D and HHT-G was tested via comparison (Pearson r) to commonly used pencil-and-paper based assessments: HHT-D versus the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and HHT-G versus the MMSE. Good test-retest (r = 0.80; p < 0.0001) and acceptable internal consistency reliability (alpha= 0.73) of the HHT-D were established. Moderate support for the validity of the HHT-D was obtained (r = 0.60 between the HHT-D and GDS; p < 0.0001). Results indicated good test-retest (r = 0.87; p < 0.0001) and acceptable internal consistency reliability (alpha= 0.70) of the HHT-G. Validity of the HHT-G was supported (r = 0.71 between the HHT-G and MMSE; p < 0.0001). In summary, the HHT-D and HHT-G were found to be reliable and valid computerized assessments to screen for depression and cognitive status, respectively, in an elderly sample.
