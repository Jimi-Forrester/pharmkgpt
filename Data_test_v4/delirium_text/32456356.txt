32456356|t|The Relationship between Chronotype, Physical Activity and the Estimated Risk of Dementia in Community-Dwelling Older Adults.
32456356|a|Our study examined the association between chronotype, daily physical activity, and the estimated risk of dementia in 170 community-dwelling older adults. Chronotype was assessed with the Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). Daily physical activity (of over 3 METs) was measured with a tri-axial accelerometer. The Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) was used to measure the estimated risk of dementia. The evening chronotype, low daily physical activity, and dementia were positively associated with each other. The participants with low physical activity alongside evening preference had 3.05 to 3.67 times higher estimated risk of developing dementia, and participants with low physical activity and morning preference had 1.95 to 2.26 times higher estimated risk than those with high physical activity and morning preference. Our study design does not infer causation. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that chronotype and daily physical activity are predictors of the risk of having dementia in older adults aged 70 years and above.
