36583066|a|The spleen is a key immune-related organ that plays a role in communication between the brain and the immune system through the brain-spleen axis and brain-gut-microbiota axis. However, how the gut microbiota affects spleen and brain function remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether microbiome depletion induced by administration of an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) affects spleen and brain function. Treatment with ABX for 14 days resulted in a significant decrease in spleen weight and significant alterations in splenic functions, including the percentage of neutrophils, NK cells, macrophages, and CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, ABX treatment resulted in the depletion of a large portion of the gut microbiota. Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that ABX treatment caused alterations in the levels of certain compounds in the plasma, spleen, and brain. Moreover, ABX treatment decreased the expression of microglia marker Iba1 in the cerebral cortex. Interestingly, correlations were found between the abundance of different microbiome components and metabolites in various tissues, as well as splenic cell populations and spleen weight. These findings suggest that ABX-induced microbiome depletion and altered metabolite levels may affect spleen and brain function through the gut-microbiota-spleen-brain axis.
