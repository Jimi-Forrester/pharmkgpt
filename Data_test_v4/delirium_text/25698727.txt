25698727|a|The extracellular accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, formation of diffusible, oligomeric forms of Abeta, both on and off pathways to amyloid fibrils, is thought to include neurotoxic species responsible for synaptic loss and neurodegeneration, rather than polymeric amyloid aggregates. The 8-hydroxyquinolines (8-HQ) clioquinol (CQ) and PBT2 were developed for their ability to inhibit metal-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species from Abeta:Cu complexes and have both undergone preclinical and Phase II clinical development for the treatment of AD. Their respective modes of action are not fully understood and may include both inhibition of Abeta fibrillar polymerization and direct depolymerization of existing Abeta fibrils. In the present study, we find that CQ and PBT2 can interact directly with Abeta and affect its propensity to aggregate. Using a combination of biophysical techniques, we demonstrate that, in the presence of these 8-HQs and in the absence of metal ions, Abeta associates with two 8-HQ molecules and forms a dimer. Furthermore, 8-HQ bind Abeta with an affinity of 1-10 mum and suppress the formation of large (>30 kDa) oligomers. The stabilized low molecular weight species are nontoxic. Treatment with 8-HQs also reduces the levels of in vivo soluble oligomers in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of Abeta toxicity. We propose that 8-HQs possess an additional mechanism of action that neutralizes neurotoxic Abeta oligomer formation through stabilization of small (dimeric) nontoxic Abeta conformers.
