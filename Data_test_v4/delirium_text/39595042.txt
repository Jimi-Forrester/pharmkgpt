39595042|t|Comparison of Malondialdehyde, Acetylcholinesterase, and Apoptosis-Related Markers in the Cortex and Hippocampus of Cognitively Dysfunctional Mice Induced by Scopolamine.
39595042|a|Objectives: Until now, many researchers have conducted evaluations on hippocampi for analyses of cognitive dysfunction models using scopolamine. However, depending on the purposes of these analyses, there are differences in the experimental results for the hippocampi and cortexes. Therefore, this study intends to compare various analyses of cognitive dysfunction after scopolamine administration with each other in hippocampi and cortexes. Methods: Scopolamine was administered at three dosages in mice: 0.5, 1, and 3 mg/kg. And this study evaluates the differences in cognitive function and the expression of malondialdehyde (MDA), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mice's hippocampi and cortexes based on scopolamine dosages. Results: The Morris water maze test was conducted between 1 and 3 h after scopolamine injection to assess its duration. A significant decrease in behavioral ability was evaluated at 1 h, and we observed a similar recovery to the normal group at 3 h. And the Morris water maze escape latency showed differences depending on scopolamine concentration. While the escape waiting time in the control group and scop 0.5 administration group remained similar to that seen before administration, the administration of scop 1 and 3 increased it. In the experimental group administered scop 1 and 3, cerebral MDA levels in the cerebral cortex significantly increased. In the hippocampus, the MDA level in the scopolamine-administered groups slightly increased compared to the cortex. A Western blotting assay shows that Bax and Bcl-xl showed a tendency to increase or decrease depending on the concentration, but BDNF increased in scop 0.5, and scop 1 and 3 did not show a significant decrease compared to the control at the cerebral cortex. In the hippocampus, BDNF showed a concentration-dependent decrease in expression. Conclusions: This study's findings indicate that chemical analyses for MDA and AChE can be performed in the cerebral cortex, while the hippocampus is better suited for protein analysis of apoptosis and BDNF.
