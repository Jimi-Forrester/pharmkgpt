36062196|t|Mechanism of Ferroptosis and Its Relationships with Other Types of Programmed Cell Death: Insights for Potential Therapeutic Benefits in Traumatic Brain Injury.
36062196|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious health issue with a high incidence, high morbidity, and high mortality that poses a large burden on society. Further understanding of the pathophysiology and cell death models induced by TBI may support targeted therapies for TBI patients. Ferroptosis, a model of programmed cell death first defined in 2012, is characterized by iron dyshomeostasis, lipid peroxidation, and glutathione (GSH) depletion. Ferroptosis is distinct from apoptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, and necroptosis and has been shown to play a role in secondary brain injury and worsen long-term outcomes after TBI. This review systematically describes (1) the regulatory pathways of ferroptosis after TBI, (2) the neurobiological links between ferroptosis and other cell death models, and (3) potential therapies targeting ferroptosis for TBI patients.
