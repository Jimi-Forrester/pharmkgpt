31141342|t|Interactions between BIM Protein and Beta-Amyloid May Reveal a Crucial Missing Link between Alzheimer's Disease and Neuronal Cell Death.
31141342|a|Extensive neuronal cell death is among the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. While neuron death is coincident with formation of plaques comprising the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide, a direct causative link between Abeta (or other Alzheimer's-associated proteins) and cell toxicity is yet to be found. Here we show that BIM-BH3, the primary proapoptotic domain of BIM, a key protein in varied apoptotic cascades of which elevated levels have been found in brain cells of patients afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, interacts with the 42-residue amyloid isoform Abeta42. Remarkably, BIM-BH3 modulated the structure, fibrillation pathway, aggregate morphology, and membrane interactions of Abeta42. In particular, BIM-BH3 inhibited Abeta42 fibril-formation, while it simultaneously enhanced protofibril assembly. Furthermore, we discovered that BIM-BH3/Abeta42 interactions induced cell death in a human neuroblastoma cell model. Overall, our data provide a crucial mechanistic link accounting for neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's disease patients and the participation of both BIM and Abeta42 in the neurotoxicity process.
