36641614|t|Age- and Sex-Different Associations between Cognitive Performance and Inflammatory Biomarkers in Community Dwelling Older Adults: towards Precision Preventive Strategies.
36641614|a|BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated associations between inflammatory biomarkers and cognitive function in people with dementia or stroke, but little is known regarding these associations in healthy middle-aged and older populations. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to examine associations between inflammatory biomarkers (both vascular and systemic) and cognitive performance in stroke- and dementia-free middle-aged and older adults without apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE epsilon4) allele carriers. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS) 2006. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 983 participants aged 53 years and older. MEASUREMENTS: Composite cognitive function assessment, including the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Overnight venous blood sampling for 6 inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, fibrinogen, homocysteine, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin) and ApoE genotyping. RESULTS: Among 983 participants (mean age: 65.8+-9.5 years), 808 were non-ApoE e4 allele carriers and were stroke- and dementia-free. Higher log fibrinogen was associated with poorer cognitive function after adjustment for potential confounding factors in non-ApoE e4 allele carriers and stroke- and dementia-free populations (unstandardized coefficients beta= -1.553, P value= 0.003). In participants aged 65 years or older, both of elevated fibrinogen and homocysteine were associated with poorer cognitive function (beta= -2.288, P value= 0.015; beta= -1.331, P value= 0.012, respectively). Elevated log CRP was significantly associated with lower cognitive function only in women (beta= -0.514, P value= 0.024). CONCLUSION: Higher serum levels of fibrinogen were negatively associated with cognitive function, which was independent of ApoE genotyping and prior cerebrovascular events in dementia-free community-dwelling older adults. Further studies are needed to validate the roles of fibrinogen in the pathophysiology of dementia and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
