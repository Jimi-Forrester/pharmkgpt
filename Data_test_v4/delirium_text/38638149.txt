38638149|a|Prior efforts have manifested that functional connectivity (FC) network disruptions are concerned with cognitive disorder in presbycusis. The present research was designed to investigate the topological reorganization and classification performance of low-order functional connectivity (LOFC) and high-order functional connectivity (HOFC) networks in patients with presbycusis. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (Rs-fMRI) data were obtained in 60 patients with presbycusis and 50 matched healthy control subjects (HCs). LOFC and HOFC networks were then constructed, and the topological metrics obtained from the constructed networks were compared to evaluate topological differences in global, nodal network metrics, modularity and rich-club organization between patients with presbycusis and HCs. The use of HOFC profiles boosted presbycusis classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity compared to that using LOFC profiles. The brain networks in both patients with presbycusis and HCs exhibited small-world properties within the given threshold range, and striking differences between groups in topological metrics were discovered in the constructed networks (LOFC and HOFC). NBS analysis identified a subnetwork involving 26 nodes and 23 signally altered internodal connections in patients with presbycusis in comparison to HCs in HOFC networks. This study highlighted the topological differences between LOFC and HOFC networks in patients with presbycusis, suggesting that HOFC profiles may help to further identify brain network abnormalities in presbycusis.
