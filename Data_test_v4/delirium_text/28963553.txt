28963553|a|Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) warrants early detection and management. We sought to develop a risk score for screening patients at bedside for risk of delayed PSCI. Ischemic stroke survivors with PSCI and no cognitive impairments (NCI) 3-6 months post-stroke were studied to identify candidate variables predictive of PSCI. These variables were used to develop a risk score using regression models. The score, and the best identified clinical cutoff point, underwent development, stability testing, and internal and external validation in three independent cohorts from Singapore and Hong Kong. Across 1,088 subjects, the risk score, dubbed CHANGE, had areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) from 0.74 to 0.82 in detecting significant risk for PSCI, and had predicted values following actual prevalence. In validation data 3-6 and 12-18 months post-stroke, subjects with low, medium, and high scores had PSCI prevalence of 7-23%, 25-58%, and 67-82%. CHANGE was effective in screening ischemic stroke survivors for significant risk of developing PSCI up to 18 months post-stroke. CHANGE used readily available and reliable clinical data, and may be useful in identifying at-risk patients for PSCI.
