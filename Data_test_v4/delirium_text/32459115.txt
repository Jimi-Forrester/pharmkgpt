32459115|a|OBJECTIVE: The study investigated the prevalence and impact of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) among women in Jordan. METHODS: A correlational study was conducted to evaluate 500 Jordanian women aged >20 years. Women with symptoms of dementia, delirium, neurodegenerative changes and osteodegenerative changes were excluded. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires (Arabic version of the Urogenital Distress Inventory-6 and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7) short forms). RESULTS: A total of 200 (40%) women reported SUI; 47% reported mild symptoms, 37% reported moderate symptoms and 16% reported severe symptoms. There were positive correlations between SUI prevalence and number of pregnancies, age and obesity. SUI had a substantial impact on all aspects of quality of life (QoL), as assessed by the IIQ-7. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate prevalence of SUI was reported. There was a significant association between development of SUI and age, higher body mass index and number of pregnancies. Because SUI is highly prevalent and has a major effect on QoL, healthcare professionals should inquire about this condition and refer patients to related specialties for treatment.
