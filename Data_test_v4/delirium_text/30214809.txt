30214809|t|Treating electroconvulsive therapy-induced mania with more electroconvulsive therapy: Evidence for electroconvulsive therapy as the ultra-mood stabilizer.
30214809|a|Electroconvulsive therapy has been described as a mood stabilizer, as it is effective in all stages of bipolar disorder. Electroconvulsive therapy-induced mania is a known and potentially dangerous risk of treating bipolar depression with electroconvulsive therapy and there are no established guidelines for the management of electroconvulsive therapy-induced mania. We report a case of electroconvulsive therapy-induced mania where electroconvulsive therapy was continued as the sole, effective antimanic agent, which is the first described case in literature.
