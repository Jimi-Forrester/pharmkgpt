27406082|a|Deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is a key component in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As an anti-amyloid natural polyphenol, curcumin (Cur) has been used as a therapy for AD. Its fluorescent activity, preferential binding to Abeta, as well as structural similarities with other traditional amyloid-binding dyes, make it a promising candidate for labeling and imaging of Abeta plaques in vivo. The present study was designed to test whether dietary Cur and nanocurcumin (NC) provide more sensitivity for labeling and imaging of Abeta plaques in brain tissues from the 5x-familial AD (5xFAD) mice than the classical Abeta-binding dyes, such as Congo red and Thioflavin-S. These comparisons were made in postmortem brain tissues from the 5xFAD mice. We observed that Cur and NC labeled Abeta plaques to the same degree as Abeta-specific antibody and to a greater extent than those of the classical amyloid-binding dyes. Cur and NC also labeled Abeta plaques in 5xFAD brain tissues when injected intraperitoneally. Nanomolar concentrations of Cur or NC are sufficient for labeling and imaging of Abeta plaques in 5xFAD brain tissue. Cur and NC also labeled different types of Abeta plaques, including core, neuritic, diffuse, and burned-out, to a greater degree than other amyloid-binding dyes. Therefore, Cur and or NC can be used as an alternative to Abeta-specific antibody for labeling and imaging of Abeta plaques ex vivo and in vivo. It can provide an easy and inexpensive means of detecting Abeta-plaque load in postmortem brain tissue of animal models of AD after anti-amyloid therapy.
