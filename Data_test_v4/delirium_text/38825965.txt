38825965|t|Age-related changes to macrophage subpopulations and TREM2 dysregulation characterize attenuated fracture healing in old mice.
38825965|a|Fracture healing complications increase with age, with higher rates of delayed unions and nonunions and an associated increase in morbidity and mortality in older adults. Macrophages have a dynamic role in fracture healing, and we have previously demonstrated that age-related changes in macrophages are associated with attenuated fracture repair in old mice. Here, we provide a single cell characterization of the immune cells involved in the early phase of fracture healing. We show that there were multiple transcriptionally distinct macrophage subpopulations present simultaneously within the healing tissue. Fracture healing was attenuated in old mice compared to young, and macrophages from the fracture callus of old mice demonstrated a pro-inflammatory phenotype compared to young. Interestingly, Trem2 expression was decreased in old macrophages compared to young. Young mice lacking Trem2 demonstrated attenuated fracture healing and inflammatory dysregulation similar to old mice. Trem2 dysregulation has previously been implicated in other age-related diseases, but its role in fracture healing is unknown. This work provides a robust characterization of the macrophage subpopulations involved in fracture healing, and further reveals the important role of Trem2 in fracture healing and may be a potential driver of age-related inflammatory dysregulation. Future work may further examine macrophages and Trem2 as potential therapeutic targets for management of fracture repair in older adults.
