36430017|t|Before-and-After Study of the First Four Years of the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS ) Programme in Older Adults Undergoing Elective Colorectal Cancer Surgery.
36430017|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine whether the inclusion of older patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer resection in the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS ) programme could improve clinical outcomes during hospital admission. METHODS: A before-and-after study in >=70-year-old patients electively admitted for colorectal cancer resection was designed. In total, 213 patients were included in the ERAS  group, and 158 were included in the control group. RESULTS: The average age was 77.9 years old (SD 5.31) and 57.14% of them were men, with a Charlson Index score of 3.42 (SD 3.32). The ERAS  group presented a lower transfusion rate of 42 (19.7%), compared to 75 (47.5%) in the control group (p < 0.001). The crude odds ratio (OR) for transfusion was 0.27 (95% CI 0.17-0.43; p < 0.001), and the adjusted odds ratio was 0.26 (95% CI 0.14-0.48; p < 0.001). The ERAS  group had a lower percentage of patients with moderate-severe malnutrition on admission, at 23.4% (37 patients) against 36.2% in the control group (42 patients) (p = 0.023), with an OR of 0.47 (95% CI 0.29-0.75; p < 0.002) and an adjusted OR of 0.48 (95% CI 0.29-0.78; p = 0.003). The number of patients who required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was also markedly lower: 54 from the ERAS  group (25.4%) versus 71 from the control group (44.9%) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of >=70-year-old adults in the ERAS  programme resulted in a decrease in transfusions, number of erythrocyte concentrates transfused, and number of ICU admissions, along with improved nutritional status.
