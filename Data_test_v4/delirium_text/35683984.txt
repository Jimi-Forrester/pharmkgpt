35683984|a|A high-calorie diet has contributed greatly to the prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide for decades. These conditions also affect pregnant women and have a negative impact on the health of both the woman and the fetus. Numerous studies indicate that an unbalanced maternal diet, rich in sugars and fats, can influence the in utero environment and, therefore, the future health of the child. It has also been shown that prenatal exposure to an unbalanced diet might permanently alter neurotransmission in offspring. In this study, using a rat model, we evaluated the effects of a maternal high-sugar diet on the level of extracellular glutamate and the expression of key transporters crucial for maintaining glutamate homeostasis in offspring. Glutamate concentration was assessed in extracellular fluid samples collected from the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of male and female offspring. Analysis showed significantly increased glutamate levels in both brain structures analyzed, regardless of the sex of the offspring. These changes were accompanied by altered expression of the EAAT1, VGLUT1, and xc- proteins in these brain structures. This animal study further confirms our previous findings that a maternal high-sugar diet has a detrimental effect on the glutamatergic system.
