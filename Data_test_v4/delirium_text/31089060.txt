31089060|t|miR-15b-5p targeting amyloid precursor protein is involved in the anti-amyloid eflect of curcumin in swAPP695-HEK293 cells.
31089060|a|Curcumin exerts a neuroprotective effect on Alzheimer's disease; however, it is not known whether microRNAs are involved in this protective effect. This study was conducted using swAPP695-HEK293 cells as an Alzheimer's disease cell model. swAPP695-HEK293 cells were treated with 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 muM curcumin for 24 hours. The changes in miR-15b-5p, miR-19a-3p, miR-195-5p, miR-101-3p, miR-216b-5p, miR-16-5p and miR-185-5p expression were assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The mRNA and protein levels of amyloid precursor protein, amyloid-beta40 and amyloid-beta42 were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. swAPP695-HEK293 cells were transfected with miR-15b-5p mimic, or treated with 1 muM curcumin 24 hours before miR-15b-5p inhibitor transfection. The effects of curcumin on amyloid precursor protein, amyloid-beta40 and amyloid-beta42 levels were evaluated by western blot assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Luciferase assays were used to analyze the interaction between miR-15b-5p and the 3'-untranslated region of amyloid precursor protein. The results show that amyloid precursor protein and amyloid-beta expression were enhanced in swAPP695-HEK293 cells compared with HEK293 parental cells. Curcumin suppressed the expression of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid-beta and up-regulated the expression of miR-15b-5p in swAPP695-HEK293 cells. In addition, we found a negative association of miR-15b-5p expression with amyloid precursor protein and amyloid-beta levels in the curcumin-treated cells. Luciferase assays revealed that miR-15b-5p impaired the luciferase activity of the plasmid harboring the 3'-untranslated region of amyloid precursor protein. These findings indicate that curcumin down-regulates the expression of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid-beta in swAPP695-HEK293 cells, which was partially mediated by miR-15b-5p via targeting of the 3'-untranslated region of amyloid precursor protein.
