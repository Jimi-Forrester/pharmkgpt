33494255|a|The damage to SH-SY5Y cells by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) is an established cellular model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Redox nanoparticles are a promising tool for therapy, including neurodegenerative diseases. As pH of the brain tissue at sites affected by PD is lowered down to 6.5, we studied the effect of pH-responsive redox nanoparticles (poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly[4-(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl)aminomethylstyrene]), which change their structure in a pH-dependent manner and become active below pH 7 (NRNPs pH), on the viability of SH-SY5Y cells treated with 6-OHDA at pH 6.5 and 7.4. Pretreatment of the cells with NRNPs pH (15-75 muM) prior to the 6-OHDA treatment increased their survival in a concentration-dependent manner at pH 6.5, but not at pH 7.4. Among several parameters studied (ATP and GSH content, the level of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial potential, mitochondrial mass), only the mitochondrial mass was dose-dependently protected by NRNPs pH at pH 6.5, but not at pH 7.4. These results indicate that the action of NRNPs pH on mitochondria underlies their protective effect in this cellular model of PD. These results may have potential importance for future applications of NRNPs pH in preclinical and perhaps clinical studies.
