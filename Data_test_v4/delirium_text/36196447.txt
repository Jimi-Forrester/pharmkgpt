36196447|a|Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder which is caused due to repetitive CAG or glutamine expression along the coding region of the Huntington gene. This disease results in certain movement abnormalities, affective disturbances, dementia and cognitive impairments. To this date, there is no proper cure for this rare and fatal neurological condition but there have been certain advancements in the field of genetic animal model research studies to elucidate the understanding of the pathogenesis of this condition. Currently, HD follows a certain therapeutic approach which just relieves the symptoms but doesn't cure the underlying cause of the disease. Stem cell therapy can be a breakthrough in developing a potential cure for this condition. In this review, we have discussed the pathogenesis and the efficacy and clinical practicality of the therapeutic application of stem cell transplantation in Huntington's disease. The application of this groundbreaking therapy on genetically altered animal models has been listed and analyzed in brief.
