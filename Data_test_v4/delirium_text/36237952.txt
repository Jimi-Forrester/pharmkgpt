36237952|t|Evaluating the Use of Communication Board on Cortisol Level and Physiological Parameters in Mechanically Ventilated Patients.
36237952|a|Background: Mechanically ventilated patients experience a high level of anxiety due to their therapeutic condition. Anxiety is one of the strongest emotions that patients under mechanical ventilation experience due to their inability to communicate with others. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of using a communication board on these patients' by assessing serum cortisol level and vital signs. Materials and Methods: This randomized clinical trial study was conducted in 2020. This study included 60 ventilated patients, who had been randomly assigned into two intervention and control groups. After blood sampling and evaluation of cortisol and physiological parameters, patients in the control group received routine communication by nurses, whereas those in the intervention group received communication using a communication board. Subsequently, the serum cortisol level and physiological parameters were measured again. Results: No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of demographic characteristics. There was a significant difference in blood cortisol levels before and after in the intervention group (t 29 = 15.52, p < 0.001). After the intervention, the intervention group's systolic blood pressure (t 58 = -3.78, p < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (t 58 = -3.79, p < 0.001), and heart rate (t 58 = -2.09, p = 0.041) were significantly lower than the control group. Conclusions: Communication through a communication board in mechanically ventilated patients leads to decreased cortisol levels and physiological parameters. It is recommended to do more studies about communication boards' content and use this tool for more prolonged periods.
