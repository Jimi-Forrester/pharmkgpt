29416595|t|RCAN1 in the inverse association between Alzheimer's disease and cancer.
29416595|a|The inverse association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer has been reported in several population-based studies although both of them are age-related disorders. However, molecular mechanisms of the inverse association remain elusive. Increased expression of regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) promotes the pathogenesis of AD, while it suppresses cancer growth and progression in many types of cancer. Moreover, aberrant RCAN1 expression is detected in both AD and various types of cancer. It suggests that RCAN1 may play a key role in the inverse association between AD and cancer. In this article, we aim to review the role of RCAN1 in the inverse association and discuss underlying mechanisms, providing an insight into developing a novel approach to treat AD and cancer.
