38087359|t|Nano biomaterials based strategies for enhanced brain targeting in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases: an up-to-date perspective.
38087359|a|Neurons and their connecting axons gradually degenerate in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), leading to dysfunctionality of the neuronal cells and eventually their death. Drug delivery for the treatment of effected nervous system is notoriously complicated because of the presence of natural barriers, i.e., the blood-brain barrier and the blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Palliative care is currently the standard care for many diseases. Therefore, treatment programs that target the disease's origin rather than its symptoms are recommended. Nanotechnology-based drug delivery platforms offer an innovative way to circumvent these obstacles and deliver medications directly to the central nervous system, thereby enabling treatment of several common neurological problems, i.e., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Interestingly, the combination of nanomedicine and gene therapy enables targeting of selective mutant genes responsible for the progression of NDs, which may provide a much-needed boost in the struggle against these diseases. Herein, we discussed various central nervous system delivery obstacles, followed by a detailed insight into the recently developed techniques to restore neurological function via the differentiation of neural stem cells. Moreover, a comprehensive background on the role of nanomedicine in controlling neurogenesis via differentiation of neural stem cells is explained. Additionally, numerous phytoconstituents with their neuroprotective properties and molecular targets in the identification and management of NDs are also deliberated. Furthermore, a detailed insight of the ongoing clinical trials and currently marketed products for the treatment of NDs is provided in this manuscript.
