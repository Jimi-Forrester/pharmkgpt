36979639|t|Regulation of ErbB Receptors by the Ca2+ Sensor Protein Calmodulin in Cancer.
36979639|a|Overexpression and mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1/HER1) and other tyrosine kinase receptors of the ErbB family (ErbB2/HER2, ErbB3/HER3 and ErbB4/HER4) play an essential role in enhancing the proliferation, the migratory capacity and invasiveness of many tumor cells, leading to cancer progression and increased malignancy. To understand these cellular processes in detail is essential to understand at a molecular level the signaling pathways and regulatory mechanisms controlling these receptors. In this regard, calmodulin (CaM) is a Ca2+-sensor protein that directly interacts with and regulates ErbB receptors, as well as some CaM-dependent kinases that also regulate these receptors, particularly EGFR and ErbB2, adding an additional layer of CaM-dependent regulation to this system. In this short review, an update of recent advances in this area is presented, covering the direct action of Ca2+/CaM on the four ErbB family members mostly in tumor cells and the indirect action of Ca2+/CaM on the receptors via CaM-regulated kinases. It is expected that further understanding of the CaM-dependent mechanisms regulating the ErbB receptors in future studies could identify new therapeutic targets in these systems that could help to control or delay cancer progression.
