37198113|a|Objective: To assess the impact of Friday surgery on clinical outcomes in elderly patients with hip fracture under multidisciplinary treatment. Methods: A retrospective cohort study. The clinical data of 414 geriatric patients with hip fractures admitted to Zhongda Hospital Affiliated with Southeast University from January 2018 to March 2021 were analyzed retrospectively, including 126 males and 288 females with a mean age of (81.3+-7.6) years. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether they underwent surgery on Friday or not. The Friday group(n=69) and the non-Friday group(n=345) were compared in terms of general information, American Society of Anesthesiologists(ASA) classification, fracture type, injury to admission time, preoperative waiting time, surgical method, anesthesia type and use of intensive care unit (ICU) fast track. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed based on age, ASA grade, time from injury to admission, preoperative waiting time, hemoglobin and albumin levels at admission. Clinical outcomes were collected and compared between the two groups, including length of hospital stay, total hospitalization cost and 30-day, 90-day and 1-year mortality rates, and postoperative complications. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify influencing factors for 1-year mortality in geriatric patients with hip fracture. Results: Baseline data showed statistically significant differences in hemoglobin, albumin and preoperative waiting time between the two groups (all P<0.05). After PSM matching, 69 patients were included in each group, and no significant differences were observed in baseline data between the two groups (all P>0.05). There was no significant differences in 30-day mortality rate (4.3% vs 0, P=0.080), 90-day mortality rate (7.2% vs 1.4%, P=0.095), length of hospital stay [(10.85+-4.45)d vs (10.92+-3.68)d, P=0.919], total hospitalization cost [(60.9+-15.4) thousands yuan vs (59.1+-15.4) thousands yuan, P=0.489], postoperative complications [pneumonia (11.6% vs 13.0%, P=0.796), cardio-cerebrovascular complications (11.6% vs 8.7%, P=0.573) and delirium (5.7% vs 2.9%, P=0.245)] between the Friday group and the non-Friday group (all P>0.05). However, the 1-year mortality rate was higher in the Friday group than that in the non-Friday group(18.8% vs 4.3%, P=0.008). Multivariate analysis revealed that surgery on Friday (OR=11.222, 95%CI: 2.198-57.291, P=0.004), low hemoglobin levels at admission (OR=0.920, 95%CI: 0.875-0.967, P=0.001), hemiarthroplasty treatment (OR=5.127, 95%CI: 1.308-20.095, P=0.019) and longer surgery duration (OR=0.958, 95%CI: 0.927-0.989, P=0.009) were influencing factors for 1-year mortality in geriatric patients with hip fracture. Conclusions: In the context of multidisciplinary treatment, Friday surgery does not increase short-term mortality, length of hospital stay, total hospitalization cost or incidence of complications in geriatric patients with hip fracture. However, it remains a influencing factor for 1-year mortality in those patients.
