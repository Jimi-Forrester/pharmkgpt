35600079|t|Neuronal ER-Signalosome Proteins as Early Biomarkers in Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease Independent of Amyloid-beta Production and Tau Phosphorylation.
35600079|a|There exists considerable interest to unveil preclinical period and prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by significant memory and/or other cognitive domains impairments, and is often considered the prodromal phase of AD. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of beta-amyloid (betaA), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) have been used as biomarkers of AD albeit their significance as indicators during early stages of AD remains far from accurate. The new biomarkers are being intensively sought as to allow identification of pathological processes underlying early stages of AD. Fifty-three participants (75.4 +- 8.3 years) were classified in three groups as cognitively normal healthy controls (HC), MCI, and subjective memory complaints (SMC). The subjects were subjected to a battery of neurocognitive tests and underwent lumbar puncture for CSF extraction. The CSF levels of estrogen-receptor (ER)-signalosome proteins, betaA, t-tau and p-tau, were submitted to univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistical analyses. We have found that the components of the ER-signalosome, namely, caveolin-1, flotilin-1, and estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), insulin growth factor-1 receptor beta (IGF1Rbeta), prion protein (PrP), and plasmalemmal voltage dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC) could be detected in the CSF from all subjects of the HC, MCI, and SMC groups. The six proteins appeared elevated in MCI and slightly increased in SMC subjects compared to HC, suggesting that signalosome proteins undergo very early modifications in nerve cells. Using a multivariate approach, we have found that the combination of ERalpha, IGF-1Rbeta, and VDAC are the main determinants of group segregation with resolution enough to predict the MCI stage. The analyses of bivariate relationships indicated that collinearity of ER-signalosome proteins vary depending on the stage, with some pairs displaying opposed relationships between HC and MCI groups, and the SMC stage showing either no relationships or behaviors similar to either HC or MCI stages. The multinomial logistic regression models of changes in ER-signalosome proteins provide reliable predictive criteria, particularly for the MCI. Notably, most of the statistical analyses revealed no significant relationships or interactions with classical AD biomarkers at either disease stage. Finally, the multivariate functions were highly correlated with outcomes from neurocognitive tests for episodic memory. These results demonstrate that alterations in ER-signalosome might provide useful diagnostic information on preclinical stages of AD, independently from classical biomarkers.
