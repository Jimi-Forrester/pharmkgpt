38844925|a|BACKGROUND: This study aims to investigate the benefits of employing a Physical Lifelike Brain (PLB) simulator for training medical students in performing craniotomy for glioblastoma removal and decompressive craniectomy. METHODS: This prospective study included 30 medical clerks (fifth and sixth years in medical school) at a medical university. Before participating in the innovative lesson, all students had completed a standard gross anatomy course as part of their curriculum. The innovative lesson involved PLB Simulator training, after which participants completed the Learning Satisfaction/Confidence Perception Questionnaire and some received qualitative interviews. RESULTS: The average score of students' overall satisfaction with the innovative lesson was 4.71 out of a maximum of 5 (SD = 0.34). After the lesson, students' confidence perception level improved significantly (t = 9.38, p < 0.001, effect size = 1.48), and the average score improved from 2,15 (SD = 1.02) to 3.59 (SD = 0.93). 60% of the students thought that the innovative lesson extremely helped them understand the knowledge of surgical neuroanatomy more, 70% believed it extremely helped them improve their skills in burr hole, and 63% thought it was extremely helpful in improving the patient complications of craniotomy with the removal of glioblastoma and decompressive craniectomy after completing the gross anatomy course. CONCLUSION: This innovative lesson with the PLB simulator successfully improved students' craniotomy knowledge and skills.
