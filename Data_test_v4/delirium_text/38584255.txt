38584255|t|STING inhibition suppresses microglia-mediated synapses engulfment and alleviates motor functional deficits after stroke.
38584255|a|Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of adult disability. Ischemia leads to progressive neuronal death and synapse loss. The engulfment of stressed synapses by microglia further contributes to the disruption of the surviving neuronal network and related brain function. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective target for suppressing the microglia-mediated synapse engulfment. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an important participant in innate immune response. In the brain, microglia are the primary cell type that mediate immune response after brain insult. The intimate relationship between STING and microglia-mediated neuroinflammation has been gradually established. However, whether STING affects other functions of microglia remains elusive. In this study, we found that STING regulated microglial phagocytosis of synapses after photothrombotic stroke. The treatment of STING inhibitor H151 significantly improved the behavioral performance of injured mice in grid-walking test, cylinder test, and adhesive removal test after stroke. Moreover, the puncta number of engulfed SYP or PSD95 in microglia was reduced after consecutive H151 administration. Further analysis showed that the mRNA levels of several complement components and phagocytotic receptors were decreased after STING inhibition. Transcriptional factor STAT1 is known for regulating most of the decreased molecules. After STING inhibition, the nucleus translocation of phosphorylated STAT1 was also suppressed in microglia. Our data uncovered the novel regulatory effects of STING in microglial phagocytosis after stroke, and further emphasized STING as a potential drug-able target for post-stroke functional recovery.
