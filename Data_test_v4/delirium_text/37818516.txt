37818516|t|Baclofen Toxicity in a Dialysis-Dependent Patient: A Case Report.
37818516|a|Baclofen toxicity is a significant concern, particularly in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. We present a case of a 74-year-old female who developed depressed consciousness after receiving 20 mg of baclofen for back pain control. A presumptive diagnosis of baclofen toxicity was made, and the patient underwent continuous hemodialysis sessions, leading to neurological recovery within two days. This case highlights the risk of baclofen toxicity in dialysis-dependent patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, emphasizing the importance of vigilance and alternative treatment options in this population.
