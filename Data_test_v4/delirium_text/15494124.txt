15494124|a|The effects of (+) securinine on behavior and morphological changes after intracerebral ventricle injection of beta-amyloid (25-35) (Abeta(25-35)) in rats were investigated. A single high dose of Abeta(25-35) could impair the spatial cognitive function. The latency of locating the platform was longer in the model group than in the sham-operated group. While chronic administration of D-securinine (40 mg kg(-1)) could significantly shorten the latency. After Morris water maze, the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) were detected. The results showed that D-securinine could decrease the AchE activity significantly and have no effect on ChAT. Meanwhile, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that D-securinine could reduce the glial inflammatory responses induced by beta-amyloid protein. These results suggest that the effect of D-securinine in improving the cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration in betaAP(25-35)-treated rats may involve direct and indirect actions on targets. The GABA receptor plays a key role in these therapeutic effects and may be helpful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
