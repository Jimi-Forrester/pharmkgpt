35604618|t|Cognitive phenotyping of post-infectious SARS-CoV-2 patients.
35604618|a|BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection entails neuroinvasive, neuroinflammatory, and treatment-related features accounting for cognitive deficits in COVID-19-recovered patients. Although screening for such dysfunctions in this population is considered clinically relevant, contributions to cognitive phenotyping including premorbid and disease-related confounders are scarcely represented. This study thus aimed at describing the cognitive outcome at the function-/domain-level of post-infectious SARS-CoV-2 patients being already at risk (RCD +) or not (RCD -) for cognitive decline. METHODS: Fifty-four COVID-19-recovered individuals were classified as either RCD + or RCD - according to medical records. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Addebrooke Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and Attentive Matrices (AM) were administered (N = 54, 34, 28, and 28 patients, respectively). RESULTS: Prevalence of defective (cutoff = 24.89) MMSE scores was 24.3% in RCD + patients and 5.9% in the RCD - group. ACE-R-total below cutoff scores were less frequent (RCD + : 5.4%; RCD - : 5.9%). Abnormal performances at the FAB an AM were respectively detected in 18.9% and 8.1% of RCD + patients and 0% and 11.8% of the RCD - group. Within the ACE-R subtests, those assessing orientation, attention, and fluency were the most frequently impaired in both groups. Disease-related variables were mostly unassociated with cognitive measures. DISCUSSION: Both RCD + and RCD - COVID-19-recovered individuals might show cognitive deficits within the dysexecutive-inattentive and amnesic spectrum. Non-instrumental, executive/attentive dysfunctions are predominant in this population and can be detected by both screening and domain-specific psychometric tests-although the latter might be more sensitive in RCD - patients.
