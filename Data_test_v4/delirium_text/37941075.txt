37941075|a|Advances in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy have significantly improved clinical outcomes of patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies. However, progress is still hindered as clinical benefit is only available for a fraction of patients. A lack of understanding of CAR-T cell behaviors in vivo at the single-cell level impedes their more extensive application in clinical practice. Mounting evidence suggests that single-cell sequencing techniques can help perfect the receptor design, guide gene-based T cell modification, and optimize the CAR-T manufacturing conditions, and all of them are essential for long-term immunosurveillance and more favorable clinical outcomes. The information generated by employing these methods also potentially informs our understanding of the numerous complex factors that dictate therapeutic efficacy and toxicities. In this review, we discuss the reasons why CAR-T immunotherapy fails in clinical practice and what this field has learned since the milestone of single-cell sequencing technologies. We further outline recent advances in the application of single-cell analyses in CAR-T immunotherapy. Specifically, we provide an overview of single-cell studies focusing on target antigens, CAR-transgene integration, and preclinical research and clinical applications, and then discuss how it will affect the future of CAR-T cell therapy.
