38512663|t|Photo-Excited Dyes: Emerging Technique Against Tau Protein Aggregation.
38512663|a|Tau aggregates are considered a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The screening of molecules against Tau aggregation is a novel strategy for Alzheimer's disease. The photo-excited molecules have proven to be effective as a therapeutic agent in several diseases. In recent studies, the photo-excited dyes showed an inhibitory effect on Alzheimer's disease-related Tau protein aggregation and toxicity. The present chapter deals with the effect of rose bengal on the aggregation of Tau. The in vitro studies carried out with the help of electron microscopy, ThS fluorescence, and circular dichroism suggested that RB attenuated the Tau aggregation under in vitro conditions, whereas PE-RB disaggregated the mature Tau fibrils. Photo-excited rose bengal and the classical rose bengal induced a low degree of toxicity in cells. Thus, for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, the rose bengal could be considered a potential molecule.
