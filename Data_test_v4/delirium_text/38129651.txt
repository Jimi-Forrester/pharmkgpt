38129651|a|PURPOSE: Preterm children with cerebral palsy (CP) often have varying hand dysfunction, while the specific brain injury with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) cannot quite explain its mechanism. We aimed to investigate glymphatic activity using diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) method and evaluate its association with brain lesion burden and hand dysfunction in children with CP secondary to PVL. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 18 children with bilateral spastic CP due to PVL and 29 age- and sex-matched typically developing controls. The Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) was used to assess severity of hand dysfunction in CP. A mediation model was performed to explore the relationship among the DTI-ALPS index, brain lesion burden, and the MACS level in children with CP. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the DTI-ALPS index between children with CP and their typically developing peers. The DTI-ALPS index of the children with CP was lower than that of the controls (1.448 vs. 1.625, P = 0.003). The mediation analysis showed that the DTI-ALPS index fully mediated the relationship between brain lesion burden and the MACS level (c' = 0.061, P = 0.665), explaining 80% of the effect. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights into the neural basis of hand dysfunction in children with CP, demonstrating an important role of glymphatic impairment in such patients. These results suggest that PVL might affect hand function in children with CP by disrupting glymphatic drainage.
