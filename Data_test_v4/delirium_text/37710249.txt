37710249|t|The roles of different microRNAs in the regulation of cholesterol in viral hepatitis.
37710249|a|Cholesterol plays a significant role in stabilizing lipid or membrane rafts, which are specific cellular membrane structures. Cholesterol is involved in numerous cellular processes, including regulating virus entry into the host cell. Multiple viruses have been shown to rely on cholesterol for virus entry and/or morphogenesis. Research indicates that reprogramming of the host's lipid metabolism is associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in the progression to severe liver disease for viruses that cause chronic hepatitis. Moreover, knowing the precise mode of viral interaction with target cells sheds light on viral pathogenesis and aids in the development of vaccines and therapeutic targets. As a result, the area of cholesterol-lowering therapy is quickly evolving and has many novel antiviral targets and medications. It has been shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) either directly or indirectly target the viral genome, preventing viral replication. Moreover, miRNAs have recently been shown to be strong post-transcriptional regulators of the genes involved in lipid metabolism, particularly those involved in cholesterol homeostasis. As important regulators of lipid homeostasis in several viral infections, miRNAs have recently come to light. In addition, multiple studies demonstrated that during viral infection, miRNAs modulate several enzymes in the mevalonate/cholesterol pathway. As cholesterol metabolism is essential to the life cycle of viral hepatitis and other viruses, a sophisticated understanding of miRNA regulation may contribute to the development of a novel anti-HCV treatment. The mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of miRNAs as cholesterol regulators against viral hepatitis are explored in this review. Video Abstract.
