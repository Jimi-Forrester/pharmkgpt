35184674|a|BACKGROUND: A major barrier to nurses adopting evidence-based practice (EBP) has been the limited awareness of evidence underpinning clinical practice, often due to poor access and understanding of the literature base. To address this, we piloted the development of educational posters summarizing the evidence base around clinical practices to see if they help nurses better understand the rationale behind their care. Our first poster focused on the evidence supporting the management of delirium in older persons, specifically delirium identification and its prevention. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of an evidence-based poster education on the delirium knowledge of student nurses. DESIGN: A prospective two-armed quasi-experimental study. METHODS: 188 student nurses were recruited in December 2017. Participants were alternated to receive either an evidence-based poster education session or a reflective education session as a control. Both groups were assessed on their general knowledge on delirium, knowledge on delirium detection and knowledge on delirium prevention. This was conducted both before exposure to either the intervention or control, and one week after exposure. Unpaired t-tests with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were applied to compare the mean change in pre-test and post-test delirium knowledge. We used the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Nonrandomized Designs (TREND) checklist to report our methods and findings. RESULTS: Students in the poster education group reported greater improvements in mean scores of delirium identification (Mean increase  = 1.0, p = 0.007, 95% CI: 0.3-1.6), delirium prevention (Mean increase  = 1.6, p < 0.001, 9% CI: 1.0-2.2) and overall delirium knowledge (Mean increase = 2.7, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 1.5-3.8) than students in the control. CONCLUSION: Summarised research evidence within a poster format can increase student nurses' access to the evidence base. This has shown to increase their knowledge to guide their clinical practice. IMPACT STATEMENT: Exposure to poster summaries of research evidence underpinning delirium care increases student nurses' clinical knowledge of delirium identification and prevention.
