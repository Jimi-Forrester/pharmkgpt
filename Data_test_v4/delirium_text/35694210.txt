35694210|a|Neuropathic pain, a heterogeneous condition, affects 7%-10% of the general population. To date, efficacious and safe therapeutic approaches remain limited. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy has opened the door to treat spinal muscular atrophy, with many ongoing clinical studies determining its therapeutic utility. ASO therapy for neuropathic pain and peripheral nerve disease requires efficient gene delivery and knockdown in both the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and sciatic nerve, key tissues for pain signaling. We previously developed a new DNA/RNA heteroduplex oligonucleotide (HDO) technology that achieves highly efficient gene knockdown in the liver. Here, we demonstrated that intravenous injection of HDO, comprising an ASO and its complementary RNA conjugated to alpha-tocopherol, silences endogenous gene expression more than 2-fold in the DRG, and sciatic nerve with higher potency, efficacy, and broader distribution than ASO alone. Of note, we observed drastic target suppression in all sizes of neuronal DRG populations by in situ hybridization. Our findings establish HDO delivery as an investigative and potentially therapeutic platform for neuropathic pain and peripheral nerve disease.
