33498897|a|The available drug therapy for post-ischemic neurodegeneration of the brain is symptomatic. This review provides an evaluation of possible dietary therapy for post-ischemic neurodegeneration with myricetin. The purpose of this review was to provide a comprehensive overview of what scientists have done regarding the benefits of myricetin in post-ischemic neurodegeneration. The data in this article contribute to a better understanding of the potential benefits of myricetin in the treatment of post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration, and inform physicians, scientists and patients, as well as their caregivers, about treatment options. Due to the pleiotropic properties of myricetin, including anti-amyloid, anti-phosphorylation of tau protein, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and autophagous, as well as increasing acetylcholine, myricetin is a promising candidate for treatment after ischemia brain neurodegeneration with full-blown dementia. In this way, it may gain interest as a potential substance for the prophylaxis of the development of post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration. It is a safe substance, commercially available, inexpensive and registered as a pro-health product in the US and Europe. Taken together, the evidence available in the review on the therapeutic potential of myricetin provides helpful insight into the potential clinical utility of myricetin in treating neurodegenerative disorders with full-blown dementia. Therefore, myricetin may be a promising complementary agent in the future against the development of post-ischemic brain neurodegeneration. Indeed, there is a scientific rationale for the use of myricetin in the prevention and treatment of brain neurodegeneration caused by ischemia.
