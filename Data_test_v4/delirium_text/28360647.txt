28360647|t|Management of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia.
28360647|a|Symptoms of disturbed perception, thought content, mood, or behavior that frequently occur in patients with dementia are defined as the term "Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD)." The behavioral symptoms of dementia include physical/verbal aggression, agitation, disinhibition, restlessness, wandering, culturally inappropriate behaviors, sexual disinhibition, and hoarding, and the psychological symptoms of dementia are anxiety, depressive mood, hallucinations and delusions, apathy, and misidentification syndrome. With the cognitive decline in Alzheimer's Dementia (AD), the frequency of neuropsychiatric symptoms increases. Apathy, depression, irritability, agitation, and anxiety are the most frequently detected neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD. In the mild stage of AD, affective symptoms are more likely to occur; agitated and psychotic behaviors are frequent in patients with moderately impaired cognitive function. When neuropsychiatric symptoms are first detected, medical conditions, such as delirium, infection, dehydration, diarrhea, and drug interactions, must be ruled out. The treatment of mild BPSD must be started with psychosocial approaches, such as behavioral management, caregiver education, and physical activity. Medications are indicated for BPSD symptoms that are refractory to non-pharmacological interventions or severe or jeopardizing the safety of a patient or others, often in conjunction with non-pharmacological interventions.
