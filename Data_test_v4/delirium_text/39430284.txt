39430284|a|Introduction: Sleep quality is the main concern of patients after cardiac surgery. We compared the effect of two routinely used sedatives on the sleep quality of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after cardiovascular surgery. Methods: It is a prospective, controlled, randomized clinical trial. A total of 120 patients, after cardiac surgery were enrolled. During extubating, patients were randomized into two groups: 60 patients received an infusion of dexmedetomidine (precede; 0.5 mug/kg/h), and 60 patients received 50 mug/kg/min propofol for 6 hours. Baseline characteristics were compared between the groups. The patients completed the St. Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaire, and the scores were compared between the groups. Results: The groups were not different in terms of demographics, underlying diseases, smoking/drug abuse/alcohol, number of vessels involved, history of non-cardiac surgery, and mean levels of serum parameters (P>0.05). Most of the medications used were similar between the groups (P>0.05), except calcium channel blockers (more frequently used in the propofol group [P=0.027). The details of surgery were not statistically significant different (P>0.05); but, the mean volume of platelet received after the surgery was higher in propofol group (P=0.03). The propofol group had less problems with last night's sleep (0 vs 0.1+-0.66), felt more clear-headed (4.9+-0.6 vs 4.68+-0.58, were more satisfied with their last night's sleep (52.1% vs 47.9%), but spent more time getting into sleep (0.38+-1.67 vs 0 ) (P<0.5). Conclusion: The sleep quality of patients under the influence of propofol seemed to be better than dexmedetomidine after cardiac surgery.
