36550895|a|To explore the effects and safety of low dose of esketamine combined with propofol in elderly patients undergoing fibronchoscopy. Eighty elderly patients who underwent painless fibronchoscopy in our hospital from June 2021 to September 2021 were recruited,and randomly divided into experimental group (esketamine 0.15mg/ kg + propofol 1mg/ kg) and control group (sufentanil 0.1 mug/ kg + propofol 1mg/ kg), with 40 cases in each group. There were significant differences in MAP, HR and SpO2 of T2, T3 and T4 between the experimental and control groups (P < .05). Besides, there were significantly differences on the trend of change between the 2 groups, with a small and relatively stable fluctuation in the experimental group (P < .05). Compared with the control group, the total dosage of propofol in the experimental group was significantly lower, and the number of vasoactive drugs, the incidence of respiratory depression and bronchospasm were significantly lower (P < .05). There was no significant difference in microscopic examination time, wake-up time, visual analogue score, and agitation, mental symptoms, increased secretion, nausea and vomiting, choking cough and laryngeal spasm during awakening period between the 2 groups. The incidence of total adverse reactions in the experimental group were strongly lower than those in control group. (P < .05). Low dose of esketamine combined with propofol can be safely used for fibronchoscopy in elderly patients, with good effects, more stable respiration and circulation, and low incidence of adverse reactions.
