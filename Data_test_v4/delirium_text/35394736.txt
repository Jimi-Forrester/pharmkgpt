35394736|t|Real-Time Monitoring of Neurotransmitters in the Brain of Living Animals.
35394736|a|Neurotransmitters, as important chemical small molecules, perform the function of neural signal transmission from cell to cell. Excess concentrations of neurotransmitters are often closely associated with brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease. On the other hand, the release of neurotransmitters under the induced stimulation indicates the occurrence of reward-related behaviors, including food and drug addiction. Therefore, to understand the physiological and pathological functions of neurotransmitters, especially in complex environments of the living brain, it is urgent to develop effective tools to monitor their dynamics with high sensitivity and specificity. Over the past 30 years, significant advances in electrochemical sensors and optical probes have brought new possibilities for studying neurons and neural circuits by monitoring the changes in neurotransmitters. This Review focuses on the progress in the construction of sensors for in vivo analysis of neurotransmitters in the brain and summarizes current attempts to address key issues in the development of sensors with high selectivity, sensitivity, and stability. Combined with the latest advances in technologies and methods, several strategies for sensor construction are provided for recording chemical signal changes in the complex environment of the brain.
