34755048|t|Prevalence and Predictors of Caregiver Burden in a Memory Clinic Population.
34755048|a|BACKGROUND: Although caregiver burden is common among carers of people with dementia, little is known about its prevalence and predictors among caregivers of patients attending memory clinics. OBJECTIVE: To examine carer and patient-specific characteristics associated with caregiver burden across the cognitive spectrum in a memory clinic population. METHODS: Consecutive patients referred to a university hospital geriatric memory clinic were included. Caregiver burden was scored using the Caregiver Burden Score (CBS), (modified Zarit), with scores>=15/30 suggesting burden. BPSD were measured with the dysfunctional behaviour rating instrument (DBRI). Cognition was screened using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment (Qmci) screen. RESULTS: In all, 351 patients were included, median age 77 (+-11) years; 65.5% were female. The prevalence of caregiver burden was 33.6% overall, increasing from 10.8% in subjective cognitive decline (SCD), to 15% in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 43% in dementia; CBS scores were significantly higher in dementia (p < 0.001). Caregivers with burden were significantly younger (p = 0.045) and were more likely to be adult children (p = 0.007). The CBS weakly correlated with the stage of cognitive impairment (r = 0.16) but had moderate correlation with MoCA (r = -0.54) and Qmci scores (r = -0.60). After adjustment for co-variates, DBRI scores alone independently predicted burden (odds ratio 1.23;1.11-1.35, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Caregiver burden is associated with the stage of cognitive impairment, with higher prevalence proportions in those with dementia compared with MCI and SCD. Only the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms independently predicted caregiver burden in this population and its presence should prompt assessment for burden.
