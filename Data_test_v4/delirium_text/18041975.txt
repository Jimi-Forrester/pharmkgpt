18041975|t|Delirium dichotomy: a review of recent literature.
18041975|a|Delirium remains a commonly occurring problem for older people and staff in acute care settings. The aim of this review of current literature is to find contemporary evidence on which to base practice modalities. Although the literature provides an exposition of the concerns with which practitioners are currently faced and highlights the consistent themes identified, there is little research evidence regarding the effectiveness of treatment protocols for the management of older people with delirium in acute care setting.
