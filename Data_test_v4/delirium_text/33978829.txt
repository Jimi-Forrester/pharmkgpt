33978829|a|PURPOSE: Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) can cause long-term impairment of brain function. Possible pathomechanisms include alterations of the cerebral immune system. This study used positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the translocator protein (TSPO) ligand 18F-GE-180 to evaluate microglial activation in liver-transplanted patients under different regimens of immunosuppression. METHODS: PET was performed in 22 liver-transplanted patients (3 CNI free, 9 with low-dose CNI, 10 with standard-dose CNI immunosuppression) and 9 healthy controls. The total distribution volume (VT) estimated in 12 volumes-of-interest was analyzed regarding TSPO genotype, CNI therapy, and cognitive performance. RESULTS: In controls, VT was about 80% higher in high affinity binders (n = 5) compared to mixed affinity binders (n = 3). Mean VT corrected for TSPO genotype was significantly lower in patients compared to controls, especially in patients in whom CNI dose had been reduced because of nephrotoxic side effect. CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence of chronic suppression of microglial activity in liver-transplanted patients under CNI therapy especially in patients with high sensitivity to CNI toxicity.
