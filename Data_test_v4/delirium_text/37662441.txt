37662441|t|Transition of care from the emergency department to skilled nursing facility: Retrospective case-control study.
37662441|a|Objective: The primary objective of this study is to describe associations between emergency department (ED)-to-skilled nursing facility (SNF) transition and ED length-of-stay (LOS). The secondary objective is to explore how social determinants of health (SDOH) influence ED-to-SNF transition visit parameters. In 2020, The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued the "COVID-19 Emergency Declaration Blanket Waivers for Health Care Providers" eliminating the requirement of a 3-day qualifying hospital stay before SNF placement. The waiver allowed ED patients to be transitioned directly to an SNF from the ED. Methods: We conducted a descriptive retrospective case-control study of adult patients who sought care in the University of North Carolina Hospitals (UNCH) ED between March 1, 2020, and March 1, 2022, lived in a non-SNF residence before their ED visit, and were transitioned directly to an SNF from the ED (n 1 = 27), compared with a group seen in the ED and admitted to hospital for SNF placement (n 2 = 54). Results: The ED-to-SNF group experienced a significantly longer ED LOS compared to the ED-to-Inpatient-to-SNF group: 72.8 hours (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.2-86.4) compared to 14.5 hours (95% CI, 12.1-16.9). We found no significant differences in SDOH between the ED-to-SNF group and the ED-to-Inpatient-to-SNF group. Conclusion: Patients who transition from the ED to an SNF experience long ED stays that may adversely affect health and well-being. Transitioning directly from the ED to an SNF may contribute to ED boarding and overcrowding.
