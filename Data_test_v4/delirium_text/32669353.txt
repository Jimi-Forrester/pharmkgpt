32669353|t|alpha-Synuclein Induces Progressive Changes in Brain Microstructure and Sensory-Evoked Brain Function That Precedes Locomotor Decline.
32669353|a|In vivo functional and structural brain imaging of synucleinopathies in humans have provided a rich new understanding of the affected networks across the cortex and subcortex. Despite this progress, the temporal relationship between alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) pathology and the functional and structural changes occurring in the brain is not well understood. Here, we examine the temporal relationship between locomotor ability, brain microstructure, functional brain activity, and alpha-syn pathology by longitudinally conducting rotarod, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), and sensory-evoked fMRI on 20 mice injected with alpha-syn fibrils and 20 PBS-injected mice at three timepoints (10 males and 10 females per group). Intramuscular injection of alpha-syn fibrils in the hindlimb of M83+/- mice leads to progressive alpha-syn pathology along the spinal cord, brainstem, and midbrain by 16 weeks post-injection. Our results suggest that peripheral injection of alpha-syn has acute systemic effects on the central nervous system such that structural and resting-state functional activity changes occur in the brain by four weeks post-injection, well before alpha-syn pathology reaches the brain. At 12 weeks post-injection, a separate and distinct pattern of structural and sensory-evoked functional brain activity changes was observed that are co-localized with previously reported regions of alpha-syn pathology and immune activation. Microstructural changes in the pons at 12 weeks post-injection were found to predict survival time and preceded measurable locomotor deficits. This study provides preliminary evidence for diffusion and fMRI markers linked to the progression of synuclein pathology and has translational importance for understanding synucleinopathies in humans.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT alpha-Synuclein (alpha-syn) pathology plays a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. The longitudinal effects of alpha-syn pathology on locomotion, brain microstructure, and functional brain activity are not well understood. Using high field imaging, we show preliminary evidence that peripheral injection of alpha-syn fibrils induces unique patterns of functional and structural changes that occur at different temporal stages of alpha-syn pathology progression. Our results challenge existing assumptions that alpha-syn pathology must precede changes in brain structure and function. Additionally, we show preliminary evidence that diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are capable of resolving such changes and thus should be explored further as markers of disease progression.
