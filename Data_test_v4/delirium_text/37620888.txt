37620888|a|BACKGROUND: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a condition associated with high morbidity and mortality, and glia-mediated inflammation is a major contributor to neurological deficits. However, there is currently no proven effective treatment for clinical ICH. Recently, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), a non-invasive method, has shown potential for neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects and potential mechanisms of LIPUS on glia-mediated inflammation in ICH. METHODS: This study used 289 mice to investigate the effects of LIPUS on ICH. ICH was induced by injecting bacterial collagenase (type VII-S; 0.0375 U) into the striatum of the mice. LIPUS was applied noninvasively for 3 days, including a 2-h-delayed intervention to mimic clinical usage. The study evaluated neurological function, histology, brain water content, hemoglobin content, MRI, and protein expression of neurotrophic factors, inflammatory molecules, and apoptosis. In vitro studies investigated glia-mediated inflammation by adding thrombin (10 U/mL) or conditioned media to primary and cell line cultures. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was used to confirm the effects of PI3K/Akt signaling after LIPUS treatment. RESULTS: LIPUS treatment improved neurological deficits and reduced tissue loss, edema, and neurodegeneration after ICH. The protective effects of LIPUS resulted from decreased glia-mediated inflammation by inhibiting PI3K/Akt-NF-kappaB signaling, which reduced cytokine expression and attenuated microglial activation-induced neuronal damage in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: LIPUS treatment improved neurological outcomes and reduced glia-mediated inflammation by inhibiting PI3K/Akt-NF-kappaB signaling after ICH. LIPUS may provide a non-invasive potential management strategy for ICH.
