9875540|a|The Gallyas-Braak silver impregnation method revealed neurons containing well-defined intraneuronal granules in both Alzheimer's disease and normal control brains. The granules were immunostained prominently with the Alz-50 antibody and, to a lesser degree, with the tau-2 antibody, but not with other anti-tau antibodies examined. The areas of distribution of granule-containing neurons detected by the Gallyas-Braak method appeared to overlap with the reported main sites of subcortical distribution of neurofibrillary tangles. They, however, were not observed in the cerebral cortex, including the hippocampal region. The Alz-50 immunoreactive granules showed ultrastructural features similar to those of lysosomes or lipofuscin. These findings suggest that denatured tau might be degraded in lysosomes.
