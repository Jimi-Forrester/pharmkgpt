33984664|a|Amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42) aggregation is considered as an important process in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Astaxanthin (ATX), a xanthophyll carotenoid, has a broad range of biological activities such as neuroprotective one. The present study aimed to elucidate the interaction of ATX with Abeta1-42, as well as its effect on Abeta1-42 aggregates under different conditions. Based on the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) results, ATX possessed a high affinity towards Abeta1-42 and the binding process was spontaneous, endothermic, and entropy-driven. Additionally, the binding affinity of ATX to Abeta1-42 was glucose and insulin concentration-dependent. Hydrophobic interactions may play an important role in the interaction between ATX and Abeta1-42. The results of SPR, thioflavin T (ThT), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses represented the dependency of the anti-amyloid activity of ATX on glucose, insulin, and ATX concentrations. Further, molecular docking results indicated the presence of some same binding sites on Abeta1-42 for ATX and glucose, as well as ATX and insulin, which suggests the possible competition between the molecules for Abeta1-42 binding. Furthermore, the MTT results confirmed that ATX effect on the viability of Abeta1-42-treated PC12 cells was dependent on glucose, insulin, and ATX concentrations. In general, the results provided further insights into the interaction between Abeta1-42 and ATX, as well as the effect of ATX on Abeta1-42 aggregates under various conditions.
