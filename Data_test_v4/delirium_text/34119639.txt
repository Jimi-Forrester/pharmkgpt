34119639|a|PURPOSE: 11C-UCB-J PET imaging, targeting synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), has been shown to be a useful indicator of synaptic density in Alzheimer's disease (AD). For SV2A imaging, a decrease in apparent tracer uptake is often due to the combination of gray-matter (GM) atrophy and SV2A decrease in the remaining tissue. Our aim is to reveal the true SV2A change by performing partial volume correction (PVC). METHODS: We performed two PVC algorithms, Muller-Gartner (MG) and 'iterative Yang' (IY), on 17 AD participants and 11 cognitive normal (CN) participants using the brain-dedicated HRRT scanner. Distribution volume VT, the rate constant K1, binding potential BPND (centrum semiovale as reference region), and tissue volume were compared. RESULTS: In most regions, both PVC algorithms reduced the between-group differences. Alternatively, in hippocampus, IY increased the significance of between-group differences while MG reduced it (VT, BPND and K1 group differences: uncorrected: 20%, 27%, 17%; MG: 18%, 22%, 14%; IY: 22%, 28%, 17%). The group difference in hippocampal volume (10%) was substantially smaller than any PET measures. MG increased GM binding values to a greater extent than IY due to differences in algorithm assumptions. CONCLUSION: 11C-UCB-J binding is significantly reduced in AD hippocampus, but PVC is important to adjust for significant volume reduction. After correction, PET measures are substantially more sensitive to group differences than volumetric MRI measures. Assumptions of each PVC algorithm are important and should be carefully examined and validated. For 11C-UCB-J, the less stringent assumptions of IY support its use as a PVC algorithm over MG.
