35000611|a|There is an increasing prevalence of Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI) worldwide, and several studies have suggested that Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion (CCH) plays a critical role in disease onset and progression. However, there is a limited understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of VCI, especially in relation to CCH. Neuroinflammation is a significant contributor in the progression of VCI as increased systemic levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) has been extensively reported in VCI patients. Recently it has been established that CCH can activate the inflammasome signaling pathways, involving NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes that critically regulate IL-1beta production. Given that neuroinflammation is an early event in VCI, it is important that we understand its molecular and cellular mechanisms to enable development of disease-modifying treatments to reduce the structural brain damage and cognitive deficits that are observed clinically in the elderly. Hence, this review aims to provide a comprehensive insight into the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of CCH-induced inflammasome signaling in VCI.
