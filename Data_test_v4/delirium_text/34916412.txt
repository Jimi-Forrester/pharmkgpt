34916412|a|Protein synthesis is essential for cells to perform life metabolic processes. Pathological alterations of protein content can lead to particular diseases. Cells have an intrinsic array of mechanisms and pathways that are activated when protein misfolding, accumulation, aggregation or mislocalization occur. Some of them (like the unfolded protein response) represent complex interactions between endoplasmic reticulum sensors and elongation factors that tend to increase expression of chaperone proteins and/or repress translation in order to restore protein homeostasis (also known as proteostasis). This is even more important in neurons, as they are very susceptible to harmful effects associated with protein overload and proteostatic mechanisms are less effective with age. Several neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia exhibit a particular molecular signature of distinct, unbalanced protein overload. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, the majority of cases present intracellular inclusions of ubiquitinated transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43). TDP-43 is an RNA binding protein that participates in RNA metabolism, among other functions. Dysregulation of TDP-43 (e.g. aggregation and mislocalization) can dramatically affect neurons, and this has been linked to disease development. Expression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia TDP-43-related mutations in cellular and animal models has been shown to recapitulate key features of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia disease spectrum. These variants can be causative of degeneration onset and progression. Most neurodegenerative diseases (including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia) have no cure at the moment; however, modulating translation has recently emerged as an attractive approach that can be performed at several steps (i.e. regulating activation of initiation and elongation factors, inhibiting unfolded protein response activation or inducing chaperone expression and activity). This review focuses on the features of protein imbalance in neurodegenerative disorders and the relevance of developing therapeutical compounds aiming at restoring proteostasis. We strive to highlight the importance of research on drugs that, not only restore protein imbalance without compromising translational activity of cells, but are also as safe as possible for the patients.
