1961361|t|Comments on review by Swaab--brain aging and Alzheimer's disease. "Wear and tear" versus "use it or lose it".
1961361|a|This review discusses a new hypothesis about cellular ageing in the context of current experimental observations and other well-known ideas, particularly "wear and tear," the relationship between metabolic rate and life span, and "free radical" reactions. However, even though these concepts are frequently used in the literature it is clear from the data discussed by Swaab that there are fundamental disagreements between the theories and experimental observations.
