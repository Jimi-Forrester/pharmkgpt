31493542|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by a progressive impairment of memory and cognition, is a major health problem in both developing and developed countries. Currently, no drugs can reverse the progression of AD. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) is a critical component of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate/protein kinase G (cGMP/PKG) signaling pathway in neurons, the inhibition of which has produced neuroprotective effects, and PDE5 inhibitors have recently been thought to be potential therapeutic agents for AD. In this paper, we summarized the outstanding progress that has been made in PDE5 inhibitors as anti-AD agents with encouraging results in animal studies, clinical trials and the investigations on the underlying mechanisms. The novel PDE5 inhibitors reported recently in the treatment of AD were also reviewed and discussed.
