29618798|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a late-onset disorder primarily affecting motor neurons and leading to progressive and lethal skeletal muscle atrophy. Small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), can serve as important regulators of gene expression and can act both globally and in a tissue-/cell-type-specific manner. In muscle, miRNAs called myomiRs govern important processes and are deregulated in various disorders. Several myomiRs have shown promise for therapeutic use in cellular and animal models of ALS; however, the exact miRNA species differentially expressed in muscle tissue of ALS patients remain unknown. Following small RNA-Seq, we compared the expression of small RNAs in muscle tissue of ALS patients and healthy age-matched controls. The identified snoRNAs, mtRNAs and other small RNAs provide possible molecular links between insulin signaling and ALS. Furthermore, the identified miRNAs are predicted to target proteins that are involved in both normal processes and various muscle disorders and indicate muscle tissue is undergoing active reinnervation/compensatory attempts thus providing targets for further research and therapy development in ALS.
