15810903|a|The intensely studied model organisms Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have been employed to study a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although worms and flies are phylogenetically distant from humans, results of both classic genetic analyses and transgenic manipulation of these invertebrates suggest they are valid models for at least some aspects of AD. This review describes the rationale for AD-relevant studies in worms and flies and discusses both what has been learned from these studies and what may be discovered in the future.
