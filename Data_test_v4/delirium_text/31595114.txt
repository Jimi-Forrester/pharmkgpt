31595114|t|Cerebral Artery Hypoplasia in a Select Adult Kenyan Population.
31595114|a|Background  Hypoplasia of cerebral arteries predisposes to stroke and cerebral aneurysms which have an increased incidence in sub-Saharan Africa. The frequency and pattern of cerebral artery hypoplasia, however, shows population variations, and data from the African population remain scanty. Objectives  This study aimed to determine the percentage of hypoplasia in the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral, anterior and posterior communicating, basilar, and vertebral arteries. Materials and Methods  Sections of the basilar, vertebral, posterior, and anterior communicating arteries and anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries were taken, processed for histology, and examined with a light microscope at x40. The images of the vessels were taken by a photomicroscope and circumference analyzed with the aid of Scion image analyzer. The average diameter of 10 sections was taken to be the diameter of the artery in analysis. Hypoplasia was then defined as internal diameter <=1 mm. Photographs of representative samples of asymmetry were taken, data were analyzed using SPSS, and gender differences were analyzed using the Student's test. Results were presented in tables. Results  Two hundred and eighteen formalin-fixed brains of adult Kenyans at the Department of Human Anatomy, University of Nairobi, were studied. Of the 218, 48 brains (22%) did not have vessels with any form of hypoplasia while 170 (78%) did have vessels. Of these, anterior circulation hypoplasia (anterior cerebral artery and posterior communicating artery) was seen in 100 brains (46%) and posterior circulation hypoplasia (middle and posterior cerebral, basilar, and vertebral arteries) in 69 brains (32%). Conclusion  Cerebral arterial hypoplasia is frequent in the select adult Kenyan population.
