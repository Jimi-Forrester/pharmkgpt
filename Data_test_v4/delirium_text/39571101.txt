39571101|t|Sleep deprivation in dementia comorbidities: focus on cardiovascular disease, diabetes, anxiety/depression and thyroid disorders.
39571101|a|Sleep disturbances are a significant concern in individuals with dementia, affecting their overall health and quality of life, as well as that of their family members and caregivers. Dementia, a progressive neurodegenerative condition marked by cognitive decline, often coexists with various comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, anxiety/depression and thyroid disorders. These comorbidities can further impair cognitive function and complicate the clinical management of dementia, making it essential to address them in a holistic manner. This review critically examines the complex interplay between dementia and its associated comorbidities, with a special focus on the prevalence and impact of sleep disturbances. Sleep problems in dementia patients are not only common but also contribute to a faster progression of cognitive decline and increased burden on caregivers. The article explores the mechanisms by which these comorbidities, including cardiovascular conditions and metabolic disorders, exacerbate sleep disturbances and cognitive impairment in dementia patients. By synthesizing recent research findings, the review highlights the importance of identifying and managing modifiable risk factors for sleep disturbances in dementia. Integrated treatment approaches that address both cognitive and sleep-related challenges are essential for improving patient outcomes. The review also underscores the need for further research to develop targeted interventions that can effectively manage sleep disturbances in dementia, thereby enhancing the quality of life for both patients and caregivers. Understanding the relationship between dementia, comorbidities, and sleep disturbances is crucial for the development of comprehensive care strategies. This review aims to inform healthcare professionals about the current state of knowledge and encourage the implementation of evidence-based practices in dementia care.
