39445691|a|In utero gene editing with mRNA-based therapeutics has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, a critical bottleneck in clinical application has been the lack of mRNA delivery vehicles that can efficiently transfect cells in the brain. In this report, we demonstrate that in utero intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of densely PEGylated lipid nanoparticles (ADP-LNPs) containing an acid-degradable PEG-lipid can safely and effectively deliver mRNA for gene editing enzymes to the fetal mouse brain, resulting in successful transfection and editing of brain cells. ADP-LNPs containing Cre mRNA transfected 30% of the fetal brain cells in Ai9 mice and had no detectable adverse effects on fetal development and postnatal growth. In addition, ADP-LNPs efficiently transfected neural stem and progenitor cells in Ai9 mice with Cre mRNA, which subsequently proliferated and caused over 40% of the cortical neurons and 60% of the hippocampal neurons to be edited in treated mice 10 weeks after birth. Furthermore, using Angelman syndrome, a paradigmatic neurodevelopmental disorder, as a disease model, we demonstrate that ADP-LNPs carrying Cas9 mRNA and gRNA induced indels in 21% of brain cells within 7 days postpartum, underscoring the precision and potential of this approach. These findings demonstrate that LNP/mRNA complexes have the potential to be a transformative tool for in utero treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders and set the stage for a frontier in treating neurodevelopmental disorders that focuses on curing genetic diseases before birth.
