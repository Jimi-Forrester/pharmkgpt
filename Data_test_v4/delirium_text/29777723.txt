29777723|a|Inflammation is an important factor in the development of many diseases of the central nervous system, including Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. Given that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are also currently believed to have anti-inflammatory properties, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, donepezil) on cyclooxygenase activity and expression using the proinflammatory action of fluoride (F-) on cultured macrophages obtained from THP-1 monocytes. COX-1 and COX-2 activity was determined through measurement of the products of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) in cell culture supernatants. Expression of COX-1 and COX-2 proteins was examined immunocytochemically, and mRNA expression was determined by qRT PCR.  Our study confirmed the inhibitory effects of donepezil and rivastigmine on the production of PGE2, TXB2, COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA and protein expression in macrophages. We also demonstrated that the pro-inflammatory effect of fluoride may be reduced by the use of both drugs. The additive effect of these drugs cannot be ruled out, and effects other than those observed in the use of one drug should also be taken into account.
