34371921|a|The study of different natural products can provide a wealth of bioactive compounds, and more interestingly, their combination can exert a new strategy for several neurodegenerative diseases with major public health importance, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigated the synergistic neuroprotective effects of a mixed extract composed of docosahexaenoic acid, Ginkgo biloba, D-pinitol, and ursolic acid in several transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and a senescence-accelerated prone mice 8 (SAMP8) model. First, we found a significantly higher survival percentage in the C. elegans group treated with the natural product mixture compared to the single extract-treated groups. Likewise, we found a significantly increased lifespan in group of C. elegans treated with the natural product mixture compared to the other groups, suggesting synergistic effects. Remarkably, we determined a significant reduction in Abeta plaque accumulation in the group of C. elegans treated with the natural product mixture compared to the other groups, confirming synergy. Finally, we demonstrated better cognitive performance in the group treated with the natural product mixture in both AD models (neuronal Abeta C. elegans strain CL2355 and the SAMP8 mice model), confirming the molecular results and unraveling the synergist effects of this combination. Therefore, our results proved the potential of this new natural product mixture for AD therapeutic strategies.
