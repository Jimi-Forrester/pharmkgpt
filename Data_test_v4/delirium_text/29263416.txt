29263416|t|EGCG-mediated Protection of the Membrane Disruption and Cytotoxicity Caused by the 'Active Oligomer' of alpha-Synuclein.
29263416|a|(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the major component of green tea, has been re-evaluated with alpha-synuclein (alphaS), a pathological constituent of Parkinson's disease, to elaborate its therapeutic value. EGCG has been demonstrated to not only induce the off-pathway 'compact' oligomers of alphaS as suggested previously, but also drastically enhance the amyloid fibril formation of alphaS. Considering that the EGCG-induced amyloid fibrils could be a product of on-pathway SDS-sensitive 'transient' oligomers, the polyphenol effect on the transient 'active' oligomers (AOs) was investigated. By facilitating the fibril formation and thus eliminating the toxic AOs, EGCG was shown to suppress the membrane disrupting radiating amyloid fibril formation on the surface of liposomal membranes and thus protect the cells which could be readily affected by AOs. Taken together, EGCG has been suggested to exhibit its protective effect against the alphaS-mediated cytotoxicity by not only producing the off-pathway 'compact' oligomers, but also facilitating the conversion of 'active' oligomers into amyloid fibrils.
