34348643|a|BACKGROUND: Current research suggests that the glial scar surrounding penetrating brain injuries is instrumental in preserving the surrounding uninjured tissue by limiting the inflammatory response to the injury site. We recently showed that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6), a well-established anti-inflammatory molecule, is present within the glial scar. In the present study we investigated the role of TSG-6 within the glial scar using TSG-6 null and littermate control mice subjected to penetrating brain injuries. RESULTS: Our findings show that mice lacking TSG-6 present a more severe inflammatory response after injury, which was correlated with an enlarged area of astrogliosis beyond the injury site. CONCLUSION: Our data provides evidence that TSG-6 has an anti-inflammatory role within the glial scar.
