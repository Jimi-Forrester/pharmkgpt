26091548|a|Health care providers are challenged by the presentation and management of inpatients experiencing substance withdrawal delirium (SWD) and delirium. The current Delphi study used an expert panel to develop a clinical competency checklist for nurse and physician educator use in teaching health care providers about the initial care of patients with SWD or delirium. The checklist includes categories of patient safety, history and information gathering, physical examination and assessment, treatment plan, and patient/family-centered care.
