36227343|t|Efficacy of Corsi Block Tapping Task training for improving visuospatial skills: a non-randomized two-group study.
36227343|a|Even though impaired visuospatial abilities can negatively affect daily functioning, there are very few training programs that attempt to improve visuospatial abilities. The purpose of this study was to examine if a single training session with a computerized version of the Corsi Block Tapping Task could improve mental rotation skills. Fifty-three young adults were assigned to one of two groups: (1) control group (mean age = 21.4; 10 females), who had 20 min of rest after their baseline assessment, or (2) training group (mean age = 21.5; 17 females), who had 20 min of training on the Corsi Block Tapping Task after their baseline assessment. The primary outcome was reaction time on a computer-based mental rotation task, and it was assessed both before and after the rest or training. There was a significant interaction between time (pre vs. post) and group (control vs. training) on mental rotation performance (p = 0.04), with the training group performing on average 124 ms faster on accurate trials than the control group at post-test. This preliminary study suggested that improving mental rotation may be feasible through targeted cognitive training. Future studies will consider multiple sessions of Corsi Block Tapping Task training to maximize training benefits (i.e., dose-response), as well as longer term retention in cognitively intact and impaired individuals.
