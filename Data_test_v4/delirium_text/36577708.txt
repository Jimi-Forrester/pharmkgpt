36577708|a|AIMS: To explore the lived experiences of emergency department (ED) healthcare professionals regarding visiting restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A qualitative phenomenology study. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were undertaken. Participants consisted of 10 physicians, 20 clinical nurses, and three managers, who were purposefully selected from two EDs in China between April and July 2021. Colaizzi's approach guided data analysis. RESULTS: Four themes arose: (i) burden moral injury, (ii) higher workload to provide and support patient- and family-centered care, (iii) dissatisfied and unsafe healthcare service for patients and families, and (iv) tailoring strategies to provide family-centered care. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This study explored the lived experiences of ED health care professionals regarding visiting restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Noted challenges included communicating with families and ethical decision making. Strategies that support ED clinician welfare, and communication with families are warranted if visiting policy restrictions are continued or re-introduced.
