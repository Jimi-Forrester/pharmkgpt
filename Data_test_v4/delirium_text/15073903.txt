15073903|t|Did knowledge, opinions, background, and health authority advice influence early prescribing of the novel Alzheimer's disease drug donepezil in general practice?--national postal survey.
15073903|a|BACKGROUND: Donepezil was licensed in the UK in February 1997 for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. AIMS: To determine the advice from health authorities about prescribing Alzheimer's disease drugs. To determine whether the first general practitioners who prescribed donepezil in England differed from non-prescribers in terms of knowledge, opinions, background, and the prescribing-advice issued by their health authority. METHODS: National postal survey of pharmaceutical advisors. Structured postal survey of all general practitioners in England who prescribed donepezil to two or more patients within the first 6 months of launch, compared with a random sample of non-prescribers. RESULTS: Pharmaceutical advisors' survey: 75/100 pharmaceutical advisors responded, of whom 83% indicated that general practitioners should not initiate prescribing of Alzheimer's disease drugs and 63% said that they should not prescribe, even under shared care arrangements. General practitioner survey: 311/473 (66%) prescribers and 484/947 (51%) non-prescribers responded after two mailings. Prescribers were similar to non-prescribers in terms of demographic and practice characteristics, knowledge about Alzheimer's disease, diagnostic and initial management strategies, and the prescribing advice from health authorities. Prescribers were significantly more likely than non-prescribers to strongly agree/agree that new drugs should be prescribed for mild (p=0.0008) and moderate (p=0.003) Alzheimer's disease, that they should normally be initiated (p=0.003) and monitored by a general practitioner (p<0.0001), and that financial constraints should not be a consideration (p=0.0001). CONCLUSION: Early prescribers differed from non-prescribers in their opinions about using Alzheimer's disease drugs. Future research should examine methods to promote nationally equitable and rational prescribing of new drugs.
