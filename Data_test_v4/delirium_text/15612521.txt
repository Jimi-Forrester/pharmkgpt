15612521|a|The commonest cause of dementia is the Alzheimer's disease, a progressive degenerative brain disease, that it has become a major public health problem. Neurochemical and neurobiological research has led to advances in understanding causes of this type of dementia but the pathological basis remains unclear. Suggested mechanisme for the disorder include gene polymorphisms, molecular lesions, angiogenesis and, even glutamatergic overstimulation. The progress in our knowledge of Alzheimer's disease, a genetically complex disorder, has set the stage for clinically meaningful advances in diagnosis and treatment, until now in focus only in the enhancement of neurotransmitter function. This review is aimed to physiopathological aspects in this common disease.
