33668976|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. The number of AD cases has been rapidly growing worldwide. Several the related etiological hypotheses include atypical amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition, neurofibrillary tangles of tau proteins inside neurons, disturbed neurotransmission, inflammation, and oxidative stress. During AD progression, aberrations in neurotransmission cause cognitive decline-the main symptom of AD. Here, we review the aberrant neurotransmission systems, including cholinergic, adrenergic, and glutamatergic network, and the interactions among these systems as they pertain to AD. We also discuss the key role of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction in AD-associated cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we summarize the results of recent studies indicating that increasing glutamatergic neurotransmission through the alteration of NMDARs shows potential for treating cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment or early stage AD. Future studies on the long-term efficiency of NMDA-enhancing strategies in the treatment of AD are warranted.
