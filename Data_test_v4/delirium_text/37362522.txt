37362522|t|Cotard's Delusion and Its Relation With Different Psychiatric Diagnoses in a Tertiary Care Hospital.
37362522|a|Background Cotard's delusion/Cotard's syndrome is a series of delusions ranging from a false, fixed, unshakeable belief that one has lost their soul, blood, organs, and body parts to the belief that one is dead. The syndrome was initially thought to be associated with only mood disorders but later was found in other psychiatric illnesses as well. Aim The study aimed to find an association between Cotard's delusion and the psychopathology of different psychiatric diagnoses. Method The clinical study comprised seven patients presenting with symptoms of Cotard syndrome with different presentations, diagnoses, and onset and meeting inclusion criteria. The study was carried out in the Department of Psychiatry, Assam Medical College and Hospital. The patients were hospitalized and, after a detailed history, mental status examination, and laboratory investigations, were treated with pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods. A descriptive statistical analysis was done. Results Denial of the existence of body organs was the most similar complaint encountered in the cases. The duration of illness onset ranged from weeks to months. The symptoms were found to be present in different psychiatric illnesses like schizophrenia, delusional disorder, depression, and intellectual disability. The patient had responded well to pharmacological agents with the exception of three patients who were treated with electroconvulsive therapy. Conclusion The study highlights the different subtypes of Cotard's syndrome and its associated symptoms, which provides a better understanding of the condition. The case series presents a finding of a higher proportion of male patients and adolescent cases than in previous reports. The study also provides valuable insights into its heterogeneity in the diagnosis and treatment of Cotard's syndrome, which may help in the early recognition and management of this rare condition.
