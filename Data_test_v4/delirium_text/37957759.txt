37957759|t|Illness Weakness, Polyneuropathy and Myopathy: Diagnosis, treatment, and long-term outcomes.
37957759|a|BACKGROUND: Severe weakness associated with critical illness (CIW) is common. This narrative review summarizes the latest scientific insights and proposes a guide for clinicians to optimize the diagnosis and management of the CIW during the various stages of the disease from the ICU to the community stage. MAIN BODY: CIW arises as diffuse, symmetrical weakness after ICU admission, which is an important differentiating factor from other diseases causing non-symmetrical muscle weakness or paralysis. In patients with adequate cognitive function, CIW can be easily diagnosed at the bedside using manual muscle testing, which should be routinely conducted until ICU discharge. In patients with delirium or coma or those with prolonged, severe weakness, specific neurophysiological investigations and, in selected cases, muscle biopsy are recommended. With these exams, CIW can be differentiated into critical illness polyneuropathy or myopathy, which often coexist. On the general ward, CIW is seen in patients with prolonged previous ICU treatment, or in those developing a new sepsis. Respiratory muscle weakness can cause neuromuscular respiratory failure, which needs prompt recognition and rapid treatment to avoid life-threatening situations. Active rehabilitation should be reassessed and tailored to the new patient's condition to reduce the risk of disease progression. CIW is associated with long-term physical, cognitive and mental impairments, which emphasizes the need for a multidisciplinary model of care. Follow-up clinics for patients surviving critical illness may serve this purpose by providing direct clinical support to patients, managing referrals to other specialists and general practitioners, and serving as a platform for research to describe the natural history of post-intensive care syndrome and to identify new therapeutic interventions. This surveillance should include an assessment of the activities of daily living, mood, and functional mobility. Finally, nutritional status should be longitudinally assessed in all ICU survivors and incorporated into a patient-centered nutritional approach guided by a dietician. CONCLUSIONS: Early ICU mobilization combined with the best evidence-based ICU practices can effectively reduce short-term weakness. Multi-professional collaborations are needed to guarantee a multi-dimensional evaluation and unitary community care programs for survivors of critical illnesses.
