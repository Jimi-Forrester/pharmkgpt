34678668|a|BACKGROUND: Nurses often lack the knowledge and expertise to work with older people with cognitive impairment, which includes dementia, delirium and depression. This is due in part to deficits in their basic nursing education related to older people and managing the care needs of people with cognitive impairment. We developed an e-learning activity to facilitate student nurses' knowledge of cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVES: To test if the e-learning activity could improve student nurses' knowledge of cognitive impairment and whether they would find the style of learning beneficial. DESIGN: A quasi-experimental pre-post-test design was used to test if the cognitive impairment e-learning activity could improve student nurses' knowledge about assessing and managing the needs of older people who are experiencing cognitive impairment. A 12-item true/false quiz was completed by participants. SETTINGS: One large Western Canadian university. PARTICIPANTS: Second year nursing students in the four-year baccalaureate degree program, second year nursing students in the bilingual four-year baccalaureate degree program, and first year nursing students in the two-year after-degree nursing program were invited to participate. Data from 166 students were included in the analysis (n = 166). RESULTS: Based on the results of a paired t-test (p < 0.001 and an average score increase of 1.12 out of nine), we conclude that students' knowledge about cognitive impairment in older people increased following the e-learning activity. Students also offered qualitative feedback that identified the activity as both helpful and as an enjoyable way to learn and provided suggestions for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: This e-learning activity was effective in helping students learn about how to work with older people experiencing cognitive impairment. This mode of learning might be useful for other difficult-to-teach content areas.
