39033161|a|This review explores the relationship between ovarian aging and senescent cell accumulation, as well as the efficacy of senolytics to improve reproductive longevity. Reproductive longevity is determined by the age-associated decline in ovarian reserve, resulting in reduced fertility and eventually menopause. Cellular senescence is a state of permanent cell cycle arrest and resistance to apoptosis. Senescent cells accumulate in several tissues with advancing age, thereby promoting chronic inflammation and age-related diseases. Ovaries also appear to accumulate senescent cells with age, which might contribute to aging of the reproductive system and whole organism through SASP production. Importantly, senolytic drugs can eliminate senescent cells and may present a potential intervention to mitigate ovarian aging. Herein, we review the current literature related to the efficacy of senolytic drugs for extending the reproductive window in mice.
