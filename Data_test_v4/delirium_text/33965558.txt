33965558|a|BACKGROUND: Hospital-associated complications are associated with adverse outcomes after discharge, and a method to help predict the occurrence of these complications needs to be established. Sarcopenia is thought to be one of the factors associated with hospital-associated complication, but sarcopenia assessment in hospitalized patients is often difficult. Focus has recently been placed on morphological and qualitative evaluation of muscle by ultrasound as an index of sarcopenia. Therefore, in this study, we sought to clarify the association of hospital-associated complication with muscle thickness or echo intensity measured by ultrasound and with commonly used sarcopenia-related parameters. METHODS: This is a prospective observational cohort study with 156 hospitalized older patients recruited over a year. Bilateral thigh muscle thickness of rectus femoris and vastus intermedius, echo intensity and corrected echo intensity of rectus femoris were measured by ultrasound. Also measured were the sarcopenia-related parameters of handgrip strength, skeletal muscle index, and maximum calf circumference. Hospital-associated complication was defined as the occurrence of any of the following complications: delirium, functional decline, incontinence, falls, pressure injuries, and nosocomial infections. RESULTS: Of 156 patients enrolled at admission, hospital-associated complication was observed in 70 (54.3%). With-hospital-associated complication group had a higher prevalence of emergency admission and a higher corrected echo intensity than without-hospital-associated complication group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only higher corrected echo intensity was associated with hospital-associated complication (odds ratio 1.036; 95% confidence interval, 1.001-1.072), while handgrip strength, bilateral thigh muscle thickness, skeletal muscle index, and maximum calf circumference were not. CONCLUSIONS: Corrected echo intensity might be a useful parameter to help predict hospital-associated complication in acute hospitalized older patients and might contribute to establishing a strategy to prevent hospital-associated complication.
