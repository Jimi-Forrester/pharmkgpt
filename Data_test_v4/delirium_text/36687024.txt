36687024|t|Palindrome-Embedded Hairpin Structure and Its Target-Catalyzed Padlock Cyclization for Label-Free MicroRNA-Initiated Rolling Circle Amplification.
36687024|a|Highly sensitive detection of microRNAs (miRNAs) is of great significance in early diagnosis of cancers. Here, we develop a palindrome-embedded hairpin structure and its target-catalyzed padlock cyclization for rolling circle amplification, named PHP-RCA for simplicity, which can be applied in label-free ultrasensitive detection of miRNA. PHP-RCA is a facile system that consists of only an oligonucleotide probe with a palindrome-embedded hairpin structure (PHP). The two ends of PHP were extended as overhangs and designed with the complementary sequences of the target. Hence, the phosphorylated PHP can be cyclized by T4 DNA ligase in the presence of the target that serves as the ligation template. This ligation has formed a palindrome-embedded dumbbell-shaped probe (PDP) that allows phi29 polymerase to perform a typical target-primed RCA on PDP by taking miRNA as a primer, resulting in the production of a lengthy tandem repeat. Benefits from the palindromic sequences and hairpin-shaped structure in padlock double-stranded structures can be infinitely produced during the RCA reaction and provide numerous binding sites for SYBR Green I, a double-stranded dye, achieving a sharp response signal for label-free target detection. We have demonstrated that the proposed system exhibits a good linear range from 0.1 fM to 5 nM with a low detection limit of 0.1 fM, and the non-target miRNA can be clearly distinguished. The advantages of high efficiency, label-free signaling, and the use of only one oligonucleotide component make the PHP-RCA suitable for ultrasensitive, economic, and convenient detection of target miRNAs. This simple and powerful system is expected to provide a promising platform for tumor diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy.
