37060515|t|The Role of Rab GTPases in the development of genetic and malignant diseases.
37060515|a|Small GTPases have been shown to play an important role in several cellular functions, including cytoskeletal remodeling, cell polarity, intracellular trafficking, cell-cycle, progression and lipid transformation. The Ras-associated binding (Rab) family of GTPases constitutes the largest family of GTPases and consists of almost 70 known members of small GTPases in humans, which are known to play an important role in the regulation of intracellular membrane trafficking, membrane identity, vesicle budding, uncoating, motility and fusion of membranes. Mutations in Rab genes can cause a wide range of inherited genetic diseases, ranging from neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) to immune dysregulation/deficiency syndromes, like Griscelli Syndrome Type II (GS-II) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), as well as a variety of cancers. Here, we provide an extended overview of human Rabs, discussing their function and diseases related to Rabs and Rab effectors, as well as focusing on effects of (aberrant) Rab expression. We aim to underline their importance in health and the development of genetic and malignant diseases by assessing their role in cellular structure, regulation, function and biology and discuss the possible use of stem cell gene therapy, as well as targeting of Rabs in order to treat malignancies, but also to monitor recurrence of cancer and metastasis through the use of Rabs as biomarkers. Future research should shed further light on the roles of Rabs in the development of multifactorial diseases, such as diabetes and assess Rabs as a possible treatment target.
