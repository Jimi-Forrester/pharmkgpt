35125890|a|BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to develop a rat model for mechanical allodynia after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to investigate the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using this model. METHODS: A total of 180 rats were randomly allocated into three groups: a control group (group C), a sham-operated group (group S), and a controlled cortical impact induced TBI group (group T), 60 in each group. Von Frey test was performed to evaluate mechanical withdrawal thresholds. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to quantify BDNF level in CSF. RESULTS: The 50% withdrawal thresholds of group T were lower than those of group C and group S at all measuring points except for the preoperative period (P = 0.026, <0.001, and <0.001 for POD1, POD7, and POD14, respectively). The BDNF level of group T was higher than those of group C and group S at POD1 (P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Upregulation of the BDNF expression in CSF was observed in rats who developed mechanical allodynia on the day after TBI. Based on our findings, to elucidate the relationship between TBI-induced neuropathic pain and BDNF expression in CSF, further research should be carried out through a multifaceted approach to a broad spectrum of pain behavior models.
