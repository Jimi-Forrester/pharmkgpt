38921002|a|A large portion of patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) have neurologic sequelae. Those with better-controlled HIV via antiretroviral therapies generally have less severe neurologic symptoms. However, for many patients, antiretrovirals do not adequately resolve symptoms. Since much of the pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS (Autoimmune Deficiency Syndrome) involves oxidative stress either directly, through viral interaction, or indirectly, through inflammatory mechanisms, we have reviewed relevant trials of glutathione supplementation in each of the HIV-associated neurocognitive diseases and have found disease-specific results. For diseases for which trials have not been completed, predicted responses to glutathione supplementation are made based on relevant mechanisms seen in the literature. It is not sufficient to conclude that all HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) will benefit from the antioxidant effects of glutathione supplementation. The potential effects of glutathione supplementation in patients with HAND are likely to differ based on the specific HIV-associated neurocognitive disease.
