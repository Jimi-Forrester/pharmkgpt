36621467|a|Manganese (Mn) is an essential metal that serves as a cofactor for metalloenzymes important in moderating oxidative stress and the glutamate/glutamine cycle. Mn is typically obtained through the diet, but toxic overexposure can occur through other environmental or occupational exposure routes such as inhalation. Mn is known to accumulate in the brain following exposure and may contribute to the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) even in the absence of acute neurotoxicity. In the present study, we used in vitro primary cell culture, ex vivo slice electrophysiology and in vivo behavioral approaches to determine if Mn-induced changes in glutamatergic signaling may be altered by genetic risk factors for AD neuropathology. Primary cortical astrocytes incubated with Mn exhibited early rapid clearance of glutamate compared to saline treated astrocytes but decreased clearance over longer time periods, with no effect of the AD genotype. Further, we found that in vivo exposure to a subcutaneous subacute, high dose of Mn as manganese chloride tetrahydrate (3 x50 mg/kg MnCl2 4(H2O) over 7 days) resulted in increased expression of cortical GLAST protein regardless of genotype, with no changes in GLT-1. Hippocampal long-term potentiation was not altered in APP/PSEN1 mice at this age and neither was it disrupted following Mn exposure. Mn exposure did increase sensitivity to seizure onset following treatment with the excitatory agonist kainic acid, with differing responses between APP/PSEN1 and control mice. These results highlight the sensitivity of the glutamatergic system to Mn exposure. Experiments were performed in young adult APP/PSEN1 mice, prior to cognitive decline or accumulation of hallmark amyloid plaque pathology and following subacute exposure to Mn. The data support a role of Mn in pathophysiology of AD in early stages of the disease and support the need to better understand neurological consequences of Mn exposure in vulnerable populations.
