38435579|a|Background: Artificial intelligence technologies have great potential in classifying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. These technologies can aid in early diagnosis, enhance classification accuracy, and improve patient access to appropriate treatments. For this purpose, we focused on AI-based auto-diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and healthy MRI images. Methods: In the current study, a deep hybrid network based on an ensemble classifier and convolutional neural network was designed. First, a very deep super-resolution neural network was adapted to improve the resolution of MRI images. Low and high-level features were extracted from the images processed with the hybrid deep convolutional neural network. Finally, these deep features are given as input to the k-nearest neighbor (KNN)-based random subspace ensemble classifier. Results: A 3-class dataset containing publicly available MRI images was utilized to test the proposed architecture. In experimental works, the proposed model produced 99.11% accuracy, 98.75% sensitivity, 99.54% specificity, 98.65% precision, and 98.70% F1-score performance values. The results indicate that our AI system has the potential to provide valuable diagnostic assistance in clinical settings.
