36138901|a|The cerebellum is particularly enriched in antigens and represents a vulnerable target to immune attacks. Immune-mediated cerebellar ataxias (IMCAs) have diverse etiologies, such as gluten ataxia (GA), post-infectious cerebellitis (PIC), Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome (OMS), and anti-GAD ataxia. Apart from these well-established entities, cerebellar ataxia (CA) occurs also in association with autoimmunity against ion channels and related proteins, synaptic adhesion/organizing proteins, transmitter receptors, glial cells, as well as the brainstem antigens. Most of these conditions manifest diverse neurological clinical features, with CAs being one of the main clinical phenotypes. The term primary autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (PACA) refers to ataxic conditions suspected to be autoimmune even in the absence of specific well-characterized pathogenic antibody markers. We review advances in the field of IMCAs and propose a clinical approach for the understanding and diagnosis of IMCAs, focusing on rare etiologies which are likely underdiagnosed. The frontiers of PACA are discussed. The identification of rare immune ataxias is of importance since they are potentially treatable and may lead to a severe clinical syndrome in absence of early therapy.
