34473671|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies of racial differences in Alzheimer disease (AD) presentation have not included Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPI). OBJECTIVE: To explore the presentation of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in NHPI. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective review of patient records from Hawaii with a diagnosis of unspecified AD or MCI from September 2000 to September 2019. Variables of interest included age at diagnosis, gender, race, marital status, insurance, comorbidities, and scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). RESULTS: We reviewed the medical records of 598 patients, including 224 Asians, 202 Whites, 87 NHPI, and 85 Other. AD was more dominant than MCI across all of the groups, with the highest percentage in NHPI. Among the mean ages of diagnosis, NHPI were the youngest. Across all groups, a higher proportion of women than men had AD, with the highest female prevalence among NHPI. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes were highest among NHPI compared with the other groups. Of individuals with MMSE/MoCA scores, there were significant variations in scores by racial group. The mean MMSE/MoCA score was highest among Whites and lowest among NHPI. CONCLUSION: Compared with other racial groups, NHPI have a higher proportion of AD than MCI at diagnosis, are diagnosed at a younger age, have a higher female prevalence, have more comorbidities that may contribute to AD/MCI onset, and present with lower MMSE scores.
