22460296|a|Emerging treatment options targeting the pathogenetic mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the need to monitor efficacy during treatment trials necessitate the use of biomarkers, which not only may facilitate early and reliable diagnosis, but may also assist in the stratification of patient populations according to their rate of progression. The objective of the present study is to examine whether demographic and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters at initial evaluation [total tau, tau phosphorylated at threonine-181 and amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta42)] can be used to discriminate between slow and rapid progressors in patients with AD. A total of 74 AD patients were included in the study. Patients recruited were divided into slow and rapid progressors according to their Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score decline before evaluation. Patients with a drop rate of >4/year were considered rapid progressors. Commercially available ELISA kits were used for measuring CSF biomarkers. Comparisons were performed using analysis of covariance. Significantly lower Abeta42 levels in the CSF were found in rapid (mean 392 pg/ml) as compared to slow progressors (mean 453 pg/ml), with a p value of 0.042. The results of the present study suggest that levels of the Abeta42 peptide may be related to the rate of disease progression. Further studies with a prospective design are needed in order to test the possible predictive value of CSF Abeta42 analysis.
