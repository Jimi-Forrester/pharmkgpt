31885505|t|Drug therapy in elderly heart failure patients.
31885505|a|Although heart failure (HF) is considered as a cardiogeriatric syndrome, elderly and very elderly patients are under-represented in the vast majority of clinical trials investigating novel drugs and therapies in this population. The homoeostatic systems of elderly subjects are very fragile, and the management of HF accompanied by numerous comorbidities requires a holistic approach towards the patient, with special emphasis not only on psychosomatic problems but also on the individual (including social) needs of each particular patient, along with the support for the family and/or caregivers. In this article, we summarize current evidence regarding pharmacotherapy of elderly patients with HF and summarize the clinical problems occurring in this population.
