35607703|t|Mechanisms of Mitochondrial Malfunction in Alzheimer's Disease: New Therapeutic Hope.
35607703|a|Mitochondria play a critical role in neuron viability or death as it regulates energy metabolism and cell death pathways. They are essential for cellular energy metabolism, reactive oxygen species production, apoptosis, Ca++ homeostasis, aging, and regeneration. Mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics are thus essential processes in the quality control of mitochondria. Improvements in several fundamental features of mitochondrial biology in susceptible neurons of AD brains and the putative underlying mechanisms of such changes have made significant progress. AD's etiology has been reported by mitochondrial malfunction and oxidative damage. According to several recent articles, a continual fusion and fission balance of mitochondria is vital in their normal function maintenance. As a result, the shape and function of mitochondria are inextricably linked. This study examines evidence suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a significant early impact on AD pathology. Furthermore, the dynamics and roles of mitochondria are discussed with the link between mitochondrial malfunction and autophagy in AD has also been explored. In addition, recent research on mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in AD is also discussed in this review. It also goes into how these flaws affect mitochondrial quality control. Furthermore, advanced therapy techniques and lifestyle adjustments that lead to improved management of the dynamics have been demonstrated, hence improving the conditions that contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD.
