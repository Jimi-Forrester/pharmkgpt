38194484|t|Identifying Stigmatizing Language Used by Israelis and Germans With a Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, Their Relatives, and Caregivers of People With Alzheimer's Disease.
38194484|a|OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to examine and compare the dementia-related discourse and language used by people with mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), their family members, and family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease in Israel and Germany. DESIGN: This secondary qualitative analysis included focus groups and semistructured interviews. Thematic analysis was used to reveal the main discourses and stigmatic language used regarding dementia and people with dementia. SETTING: Israeli and German stakeholders. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-four Israeli and 44 German participants: 28 people with MND, 20 family members of people with MND, and 40 family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: Two main discourses were identified: the tragedy and the biomedical discourse. The tragedy discourse included several subthemes: "Dementia as the worst-case scenario," "Nothing can be done about dementia," and "People with dementia are not human." The biomedical discourse stressed pathologic aspects of the condition. Similarities and differences were found between Israeli and German participants. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that, despite culture and language differences, the use of stigmatic discourse and stigmatizing language is common among people with close exposure to dementia in Israel and Germany. Efforts should be increased to develop a person-centered and dementia-friendly language.
