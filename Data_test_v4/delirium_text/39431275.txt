39431275|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the pathological accumulation of alpha-synuclein, which has driven extensive research into the role of exosomes in disease mechanisms. Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles enriched with proteins, RNA, and lipids that facilitate critical intercellular communication processes. Recent studies have elucidated the role of exosomes in transmitting misfolded proteins among neurons, which significantly impacts the progression of PD. The presence of disease-associated exosomes in cerebrospinal fluid and blood highlights their substantial diagnostic potential for PD. Specifically, exosomes derived from the central nervous system (CNS) have emerged as promising biomarkers because of their ability to accurately reflect pathological states. Furthermore, the isolation of exosomes from distinct brain cell types allows the identification of precise biomarkers, increasing diagnostic specificity and accuracy. In addition to being useful for diagnostics, exosomes hold therapeutic promise given their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and selectively modulate their cargo. These findings suggest that these materials could be used as delivery systems for therapeutic drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. This review comprehensively examines the multifaceted roles of exosomes in PD pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. It also addresses the associated clinical challenges and underscores the urgent need for further research and development to fully leverage exosome-based strategies in PD management.
