24994453|t|Using magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing dementia: a Dutch outpatient memory clinics survey.
24994453|a|BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, dementia syndromes are diagnosed in specialized memory outpatient clinics (MC). Many radiologists are not trained to assess magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with respect to possible radiological changes that may indicate neurodegenerative disease. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study. A survey was sent to all Dutch MC and included questions as to how MRI scans are assessed by radiologists and how these assessments are used in the diagnostic process. RESULTS: In most MC, radiologists report on typical Alzheimer pathology and large vessel disease. Small vessel disease and other anatomical changes signifying neurodegenerative disease frequently are not assessed. In the majority of MC, the radiological assessment is not standardized, and physicians assess MRI for themselves to use this information to discuss the consensus diagnosis subsequently. CONCLUSION: MRI assessment by radiologists in Dutch MC probably underestimates the presence of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disease. The validity of standardized assessment protocols in routine clinical practice deserves further study, as the implementation of standardization outside research settings could improve diagnostic accuracy.
