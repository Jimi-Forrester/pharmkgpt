39857700|t|Blinded by the Mind: Exploring the Hidden Psychiatric Burden in Glaucoma Patients.
39857700|a|Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of permanent vision loss worldwide and has a profound impact on patients' quality of life. Vision impairment is strongly associated with several psychiatric disorders, like depression, anxiety, and sleep problems. These psychiatric issues are often exacerbated by the gradual, irreversible, and typically silent progression of the disease, contributing to increased mental health challenges for affected individuals. A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines across six different databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library) and one gray literature source (Google Scholar), covering the period from 2013 to 2024. Twenty-nine studies involving a total of 13,326,845 subjects were included in the synthesis, highlighting a considerable prevalence of psychiatric disorders among glaucoma patients. Depression and anxiety were the most common conditions identified, with depression rates ranging from 6.6% to 57% and anxiety from 12.11% to 49%. Other less frequent but still significant conditions like sleep disorders, psychosis, dementia, and post-traumatic stress disorder were also observed. The findings also indicated that psychiatric severity was influenced by socio-demographic factors, glaucoma severity, and treatment duration. Given the high occurrence of psychiatric pathologies among individuals with glaucoma, it is essential to develop comprehensive care strategies that address both eye and mental health needs. Multidisciplinary collaboration among ophthalmologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and primary care physicians is crucial for developing personalized treatment plans that effectively manage both the ocular and psychological aspects of the disease.
