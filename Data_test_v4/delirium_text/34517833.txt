34517833|a|BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (aCAS) impairs haemodynamic and cognitive functions; however, the relationship between these changes and brain network connectivity remains largely unknown. This study aimed to determine the relationship between functional connectivity and neurocognition in patients with aCAS. METHODS: We compared functional status in 14 patients with aCAS and 15 healthy controls using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging sequences. The subjects underwent a full range of neuropsychological tests and a graphical theoretical analysis of their brain networks. RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with aCAS showed significant decline in neuropsychological functions, particularly short-term memory (word-memory, p = .046 and picture-memory, p = .014). Brain network connectivity was lower in patients with aCAS than in the controls, and the decline of functional connectivity in aCAS patients was mainly concentrated in the left and right inferior frontal gyri, temporal lobe, left cingulate gyrus, and hippocampus. Decreased connectivity between various brain regions was significantly correlated with impaired short-term memory. Patients with aCAS showed cognitive impairment independent of known vascular risk factors for vascular cognitive impairment. The cognitive defects were mainly manifested in the short-term memory of words and pictures. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first of its kind to identify an association between disruption of functional connections in left carotid stenosis and impairment of short-term memory. The findings suggest that alterations in network connectivity may be an essential mechanism underlying cognitive decline in aCAS patients.
