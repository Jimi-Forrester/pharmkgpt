27877044|a|BACKGROUND: Impaired visual memory seems to be a core feature of depression, while increased microRNA-132 (miR-132) levels have been widely reported in depression patients. The authors aimed to explore the relationship between miR-132 changes and visual memory deficits in unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 62 medication-free MDD patients and 73 matched healthy controls (HCs) were tested for miR-132 expression level in peripheral blood using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We used a computerized neurocognitive task from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) - pattern recognition memory (PRM) task - as a measurement of visual memory. The relationship between visual memory, miR-132 expression level, and clinical symptoms was explored in patients with MDD. RESULTS: Upregulated miR-132 expression levels were seen in MDD patients but not in HCs. Two-sample t-tests showed that MDD patients had decreased visual memory, mainly memory delayed compared to that of HCs. Correlation analyses revealed that in MDD patients, increased miR-132 expression levels were significantly correlated with visual memory as measured by the CANTABPRM. Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety scores were negatively correlated with PRM - number correct (immediate) and PRM - percent correct (immediate). LIMITATIONS: The main limitations were missing data and lack of follow-up studies. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that increased miR-132 expression levels were associated with visual memory deficits, which may underlie the pathophysiology of MDD. In individuals with depression, immediate visual memory defects were positively correlated with anxiety symptoms.
