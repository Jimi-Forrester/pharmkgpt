METHODS: Data from an Italian national survey investigating the role of neurologists in the emergency room conducted in December 2020 were compared with those of the same survey of the previous year. These surveys involved a questionnaire being completed filled in for patients who received a neurological consultation following a visit to the emergency room. Information gathered included demographic characteristics, triage level according to both the emergency physician and neurologist, reason for the consultation, neurological evaluation, and discharge mode. RESULTS: In both years, approximately half of the patients were women, and the median age was 61 years. More patients in 2020 arrived by ambulance and had a greater need for assistance based on triage level than in 2019. During 2020, the proportion of consultancy requests judged by the neurologist was higher than that in 2019 (77% vs. 73%). Moreover, in 2020, fewer patients required consultation for headache, muscle pain, fever, and neurological signs, whereas coma was more prevalent. The diagnosis of ischemic stroke was the most prevalent in both years, followed by transient ischemic attack. In 2020, the status epilepticus increased and discopathy decreased. CONCLUSION: This study showed the significant role played by neurologists in emergency activities, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlighted the differences in patients admitted between the year of the epidemic and the year previous.
