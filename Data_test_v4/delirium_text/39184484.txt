39184484|t|Current Overview on the Use of Nanosized Drug Delivery Systems in the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases.
39184484|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, encompassing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, prion disease, and Huntington's disease, present a growing health concern as human life expectancy increases. Despite this, effective treatments to halt disease progression remain elusive due to various factors, including challenges in drug delivery across physiological barriers like the blood-brain barrier and patient compliance issues leading to treatment discontinuation. In response, innovative treatment approaches leveraging noninvasive techniques with higher patient compliance are emerging as promising alternatives. This Review aims to synthesize current treatment options and the challenges encountered in managing neurodegenerative diseases, while also exploring innovative treatment modalities. Specifically, noninvasive strategies such as intranasal administration and nanosized drug delivery systems are gaining prominence for their potential to enhance treatment efficacy and patient adherence. Nanosized drug delivery systems, including liposomes, polymeric micelles, and nanoparticles, are evaluated within the context of outstanding studies. The advantages and disadvantages of these approaches are discussed, providing insights into their therapeutic potential and limitations. Through this comprehensive examination, this Review contributes to the ongoing discourse surrounding the development of effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.
