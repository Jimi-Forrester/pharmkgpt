32941933|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease mainly associated with aging, oxidative stress and genetic mutations. There are two pathological proteins involved in AD; Amyloid-beta peptide and microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT). The beta- and gamma-secretase enzyme cleaves the Amyloid precursor protein, which results in the formation of extracellular plaques in brain. While, Tau undergoes hyperphosphorylation and other post-translational modifications (PTMs), which eventually generates Tau oligomers, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in neurons. Moreover, the brain-resident glia and infiltrated macrophages elevate the level of CNS inflammation, which trigger the oxidative damage of neuronal circuits by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Nitric oxide (NO). Microglia is the primary immune cell in the CNS, which is continuously surveilling the neuronal synapses and pathogen invasion. Microglia in the resting state is called 'Ramified', which possess long surveilling extensions with a small cell body. But, upon activation, microglia retracts the cellular extensions and transform into round migratory cells, called as 'Amoeboid' state. Activated microglia undergoes actin remodeling by forming lamellipodia and filopodia, which directs the migratory axis while podosomes formed are involved in extracellular matrix degradation for invasion. Protein-aggregates in malfunctioning synapses and in CNS milieu can be detected by microglia, which results in its activation and migration. Subsequently, the phagocytosis of synapses leads to the inflammatory burst and memory loss. The extracellular nucleotides released from damaged neurons and the cytokine-chemokine gradients allow the neighboring microglia and macrophages to migrate-infiltrate at the site of neuronal-damage. The ionotropic (P2XR) and metabotropic (P2YR) purinergic receptor recognize extracellular ATP/ADP, which propagates through the intracellular calcium signaling, chemotaxis, phagocytosis and inflammation. The P2Y receptors give 'find me' or 'eat me' signals to microglia to either migrate or phagocytose cellular debris. Further, the actin cytoskeleton helps microglia to mediate directed chemotaxis and neuronal repair during neurodegeneration. Hence, we aim to emphasize the connection between purinergic signaling and actin-driven mechanical movements of microglia for migration and inflammation in AD.
