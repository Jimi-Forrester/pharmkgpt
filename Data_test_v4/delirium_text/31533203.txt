31533203|t|Cellular Uptake and Clearance of Oxidatively-modified Apolipoprotein E3 by Cerebral Cortex Endothelial Cells.
31533203|a|Apolipoprotein E3 (apoE3) plays a critical role in the metabolism of lipoproteins and lowers plasma lipid levels by serving as a ligand for the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) family of proteins and by promoting macrophage cholesterol efflux. The current study examines the effect of acrolein (an endogenously generated metabolite and an environmental pollutant) modification on the structure and function of apoE3. Acrolein modification was confirmed in Western blots by reactivity with acrolein-lysine-specific antibody and by the presence of oligomeric species due to cross-linking. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed modification of 10 out of 12 lysines in apoE3, with Nepsilon-(3-methylpyridinium)-lysine being the predominant form of modification, and Lys75 being a 'hot spot' in terms of susceptibility to oxidation. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed no major change in overall secondary structure compared to unmodified apoE3. Reconstituted high density lipoprotein (HDL) bearing acrolein modified apoE3 showed loss of binding to soluble LDLr; however, incubation with mouse endothelioma bEnd.3 cells showed that it was internalized. Incubation with excess LDL did not abolish cellular uptake of acrolein modified apoE3, suggesting alternative mechanism(s) not involving LDLr. Incubation with anti-CD36 antibody did not show a decrease in internalization while incubation with anti- lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX1) showed partial internalization. However, incubation with anti-scavenger receptor class B type I (SRB1) antibody abolished internalization of acrolein modified apoE3. Taken together, our studies suggest that acrolein modification of apoE3 at lysine residues leads to increase in net negative charge, and as a consequence, results in clearance by LOX1 and SRB1 on endothelial cells. Overall, oxidative modification of apoE3 likely impairs its role in regulating plasma cholesterol homeostasis, eventually leading to lipid disorders.
