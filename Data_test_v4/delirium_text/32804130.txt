32804130|t|Association Between Lipid Accumulation Product and Mild Cognitive Impairment in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.
32804130|a|BACKGROUND: Diabetes may increase the risk of conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Lipid accumulation product (LAP), an index of visceral obesity, has been shown to be a powerful predictor of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, little attention has been paid to the relationship between LAP and MCI in T2D. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the association between the LAP index and MCI in patients with T2D. METHODS: In total, 220 hospitalized patients with T2D, including 113 MCI patients and 107 patients with normal cognition, were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. We collected demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical data on each subject. The LAP index was calculated according to the following formulas: [waist circumference (WC) (cm) - 65]xtriglyceride (TG) (mmol/L) for males and [WC (cm) - 58] xTG (mmol/L) for females. RESULTS: Compared with patients with normal cognition, MCI patients were older and had a higher LAP index, WC, body mass index, and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c level, as well as a lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment score and education level (p < 0.05). After adjusting for confounding factors, LAP index was associated with MCI (OR = 1.047, 95% CI = 1.031-1.063, p < 0.01). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the LAP index was higher than that for WC and BMI. CONCLUSION: A high LAP index is associated with an increased risk of MCI in T2D patients. The LAP index appears to be a good indicator of risk of MCI in patients with T2D.
