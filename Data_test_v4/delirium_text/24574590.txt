24574590|a|BACKGROUND: Children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are particularly at risk under anesthesia after uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP). This prospective randomized double-blind study focused on the comparison of dexmedetomidine-ketamine and sevoflurane-sufentanil anesthesia on children with respect to safety, feasibility, and clinical effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 children, aged 2-10 years, classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status I and II scheduled for UPPP were prospectively studied. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either dexmedetomidine-ketamine-based anesthesia (group DK, n = 30) or sevoflurane-sufentanil-based anesthesia (group SS, n = 3 0). Heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure during the first 60 min of the procedure, Ramsay sedation score, the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale and a 5-point scale used to evaluate emergence agitation (EA) in postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and postoperative outcomes data were recorded. RESULTS: During the first 60 min of anesthesia, mean HR, and mean diastolic noninvasive arterial blood pressure (NIBP) were not statistically different in the two groups (P > 0.05) Compared with group SS, the patients in group DK had lower rescue tramadol requirement and lower pain score, PAED score, and EA score at 5, 10, 15, and 30 min in PACU; but had a higher Ramsay scale at 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min in PACU and the incidence of SpO2 below 95%, also the time of first bowel movement and ambulation in group DK was shorter. CONCLUSIONS: The dexmedetomidine-ketamine combination was not superior to a sevoflurane-sufentanil combination because of late awake time and a high potential for adverse respiratory events in PACU, the benefit of dexmedetomidine administration being a decreased incidence of EA and a lower recovery time of bowel movement and ambulation.
