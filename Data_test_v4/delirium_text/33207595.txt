33207595|t|Glycation Increases the Risk of Microbial Traversal through an Endothelial Model of the Human Blood-Brain Barrier after Use of Anesthetics.
33207595|a|The function of the human blood-brain barrier (BBB), consisting mainly of the basement membrane and microvascular endothelial cells, is to protect the brain and regulate its metabolism. Dysfunction of the BBB can lead to increased permeability, which can be linked with several pathologies, including meningitis, sepsis, and postoperative delirium. Advanced glycation end products (AGE) are non-enzymatic, posttranslational modifications of proteins, which can affect their function. Increased AGE levels are strongly associated with ageing and degenerative diseases including diabetes. Several studies demonstrated that the formation of AGE interfere with the function of the BBB and may change its permeability for soluble compounds. However, it is still unclear whether AGE can facilitate microbial traversal through the BBB and how small compounds including anesthetics modulate this process. Therefore, we developed a cellular model, which allows for the convenient testing of different factors and compounds with a direct correlation to bacterial traversal through the BBB. Our results demonstrate that both glycation and anesthetics interfere with the function of the BBB and promote microbial traversal. Importantly, we also show that the essential nutrient and antioxidant ascorbic acid, commonly known as vitamin C, can reduce the microbial traversal through the BBB and partly reverse the effects of AGE.
