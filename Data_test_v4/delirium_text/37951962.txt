37951962|t|Protocol: dexmedetomidine on myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery-a multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial.
37951962|a|AIMS: Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) is common in elderly patients and considered as an independent predictor of 30-day mortality after noncardiac surgery. Dexmedetomidine possesses cardiac-protective profile. Previous clinical studies have found that perioperative application of dexmedetomidine is associated with decreased 1-year mortality in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The current study protocol aims to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine on the incidence of MINS, complications, and 30-day mortality in elderly patients subjected to noncardiac surgery. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind, prospective trial is designed to explore cardiac protection of dexmedetomidine in the elderly patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. A total of 960 patients aged over 65 years will be recruited and randomly assigned to dexmedetomidine group (group Dex) and normal saline placebo group (group NS) in a ratio of 1:1. Patients in group Dex will receive a bolus dose of 0.5 mug/kg dexmedetomidine within 10 min before surgical incision, followed by a consistent infusion at the rate of 0.3-0.5 mug/kg/h throughout the operation. Group NS patients will receive the same volume of normal saline. The primary outcome is the incidence of MINS via detecting the hs-TnT level within 3 days after the operation. The secondary outcome includes myocardial ischemic symptoms, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in hospital, length of ICU and postoperative hospital stay, the incidence of inhospital complications, and 30-day all-cause mortality. DISCUSSION: The results of the current study will illustrate the effect of dexmedetomidine on myocardial injury for elderly patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (CHICTR) on Aug 24, 2021 (ChiCTR2100049946, http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=131804 ).
