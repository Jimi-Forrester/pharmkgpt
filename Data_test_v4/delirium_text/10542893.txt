10542893|t|[Piracetam in anesthesia for prevention of postoperative delirium].
10542893|a|Delirium is a serious postoperative complication after general anaesthesia. The incidence is estimated to be about 10-15%. In the case of additional risk factors, such as old age, previously existing cerebral-vasculous and psychic deficiencies, and anaesthesia of long duration the incidence is much higher. Delirium impairs postoperative mobilisation and convalescence of the patient, can lead to a longer hospital stay and is associated with higher mortality rates. In a series of clinical studies it could be shown that the perioperative administration of the nootropic piracetam led to a shorter recovery period after anaesthesia and had a favourable influence on the delirious symptoms. Especially patients with risk factors for postoperative delirium profited from prophylactic application of piracetam. The success of this medication can be explained by a protective influence of the substance on central neurons against hypoxia, ischemia and intoxication, all of which are discussed as possible causes for postoperative delirium. Next to the pathogenetic mechanisms of postoperative delirium, the mode of action of piracetam is shown in a review and a summary of references on the clinical use in anaesthesia is given.
