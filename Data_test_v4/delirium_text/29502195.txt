29502195|t|Effect of Sedation Regimen on Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation in the Intensive Care Unit.
29502195|a|BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit patients undergoing mechanical ventilation have traditionally been sedated to make them comfortable and to avoid pain and anxiety. However, this may lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation and a longer length of stay. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective study was to explore whether different sedation regimens influence the course and duration of the weaning process. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Intubated adult patients (n = 152) from 15 general intensive care units in Sweden were mechanically ventilated for >= 24 h. Patients were divided into three groups according to the sedative(s) received during the weaning period (i.e. from being assessed as 'fit for weaning' until extubation): dexmedetomidine alone (DEX group, n = 32); standard of care with midazolam and/or propofol (SOC group, n = 67); or SOC plus dexmedetomidine (SOCDEX group, n = 53). RESULTS: Patients receiving dexmedetomidine alone were weaned more rapidly than those in the other groups despite spending longer time on mechanical ventilation prior to weaning. Anxiety during weaning was present in 0, 9 and 24% patients in the DEX, SOC and SOCDEX groups, respectively. Anxiety after extubation was present in 41, 20 and 34% in the DEX, SOC and SOCDEX groups, respectively. Delirium during weaning was present in 1, 2 and 1 patient in the DEX, SOC and SOCDEX groups, respectively. Delirium at ICU discharge was present in 1, 0 and 3 patients in the DEX, SOC and SOCDEX groups, respectively. Few patients fulfilled criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine, used as a single sedative, may have contributed to a shorter weaning period than SOC or SOCDEX. Patients who received dexmedetomidine-only sedation tended to report better health-related quality of life than those receiving other forms of sedation.
