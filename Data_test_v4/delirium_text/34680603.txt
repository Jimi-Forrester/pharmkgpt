34680603|t|Overview of Acute Ischemic Stroke Evaluation and Management.
34680603|a|Stroke is a major contributor to death and disability worldwide. Prior to modern therapy, post-stroke mortality was approximately 10% in the acute period, with nearly one-half of the patients developing moderate-to-severe disability. The most fundamental aspect of acute stroke management is "time is brain". In acute ischemic stroke, the primary therapeutic goal of reperfusion therapy, including intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV TPA) and/or endovascular thrombectomy, is the rapid restoration of cerebral blood flow to the salvageable ischemic brain tissue at risk for cerebral infarction. Several landmark endovascular thrombectomy trials were found to be of benefit in select patients with acute stroke caused by occlusion of the proximal anterior circulation, which has led to a paradigm shift in the management of acute ischemic strokes. In this modern era of acute stroke care, more patients will survive with varying degrees of disability post-stroke. A comprehensive stroke rehabilitation program is critical to optimize post-stroke outcomes. Understanding the natural history of stroke recovery, and adapting a multidisciplinary approach, will lead to improved chances for successful rehabilitation. In this article, we provide an overview on the evaluation and the current advances in the management of acute ischemic stroke, starting in the prehospital setting and in the emergency department, followed by post-acute stroke hospital management and rehabilitation.
