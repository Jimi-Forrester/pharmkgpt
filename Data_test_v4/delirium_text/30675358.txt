30675358|t|Fructosuria and recurrent hypoglycemia in a patient with a novel c.1693T>A variant in the 3' untranslated region of the aldolase B gene.
30675358|a|Hereditary fructose intolerance, caused by mutations in the ALDOB gene, is an unusual cause of hypoglycemia. ALDOB encodes the enzyme aldolase B, responsible for the hydrolysis of fructose 1-phosphate in the liver. Here, we report the case of a 33-year-old female patient who consulted due to repetitive episodes of weakness, dizziness and headache after food ingestion. An ambulatory 72-h continuous glucose monitoring revealed multiple short hypoglycemic episodes over the day. After biochemical exclusion of other endocrine causes of hypoglycemia, hereditary fructose intolerance seemed a plausible diagnosis. Repeated measurements of urinary fructose revealed pathologic fructosuria, but genetic testing for the three most common mutations in ALDOB resulted negative. We decided to perform complete Sanger sequencing of the ALDOB gene and encountered a variant consisting of a T>A substitution in position 1963 of the ALDOB transcript (c.1693T>A). This position is located within the 3' untranslated region of exon 9, 515 nucleotides downstream the stop codon. After complete withdrawal of dietary fructose and sucrose, the patient presented no new hypoglycemic episodes.
