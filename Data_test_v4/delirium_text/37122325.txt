37122325|t|Stimulus material selection for the Dutch famous faces test for older adults.
37122325|a|Worldwide, approximately 22% of all individuals aged 50 years and older are currently estimated to fall somewhere on the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, which can be roughly divided into preclinical AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia. While episodic memory loss (among other aspects) is typically required for a diagnosis of AD dementia, MCI is said to have occurred when cognitive impairment (including memory loss) is worse than expected for the person's age but not enough to be classified as dementia. On the other hand, preclinical AD can currently only be detected using biomarkers; clinical symptoms are not apparent using traditional neuropsychological tests. The main aim of the current paper was to explore the possibility of a test which could distinguish preclinical AD from normal aging. Recent scientific evidence suggests that the Famous Faces Test (FFT) could differentiate preclinical AD from normal aging up to 5 years before a clinical AD diagnosis. Problematic with existing FFTs is the selection of stimulus material. Faces famous in a specific country and a specific decade might not be equally famous for individuals in another country or indeed for people of different ages. The current article describes how famous faces were systematically selected and chosen for the Dutch older (60+) population using five steps. The goal was to design and develop short versions of the FFT for Dutch older adults of equivalent mean difficulty. In future work, these nine parallel versions will be necessary for (a) cross-sectional comparison as well as subsequent longitudinal assessment of cognitively normal and clinical groups and (b) creating personalized norms for the normal aged controls that could be used to compare performance within individuals with clinical diagnoses. The field needs a simple, cognitive test which can distinguish the earliest stages of the dementia continuum from normal aging.
