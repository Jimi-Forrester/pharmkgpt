37119833|a|INTRODUCTION: A major health concern among individuals with alcohol use disorder is alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), where individuals with physical dependence on alcohol may experience withdrawal signs and symptoms upon stopping or reducing alcohol use. AWS has a range of severity, with the most severe cases referred to as complicated AWS, presenting as seizure or signs and symptoms indicative of delirium or new onset of hallucinations. In the general community, risk factors or predictors of complicated AWS among hospitalized patients have been described, but there is no literature that examines such risk factors in a correctional population. The Los Angeles County Jail (LACJ) is the nation's largest jail system and manages 10-15 new patients per day for AWS. Here we aim to identify the risk factors associated with alcohol withdrawal-related hospital transfers among incarcerated patients being managed for AWS in the LACJ. METHODS: From January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, data were gathered about LACJ patients who required transfer to an acute care facility for alcohol withdrawal-related concerns while on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol revised (CIWA-Ar) protocol. Log regression analysis was performed to generate an odds ratio for acute care facility transfer for the following variables: race, sex assigned at birth, age, CIWA-Ar scores, highest systolic blood pressure (SBP), and highest heart rate (HR). RESULTS: Out of 15,658 patients on CIWA-Ar protocol during this 2-year timeframe, a total of 269 (1.7%) were transferred to an acute care facility for alcohol withdrawal-related concerns. Of those 269 patients, significant risk factors associated with withdrawal-related hospital transfer included: Other race (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5-5.5), male sex assigned at birth (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.5), age >= 55 years (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.9), CIWA-Ar score 9-14 (OR 4.1, 95% CI 3.1-5.3), CIWA-Ar score >= 15 (OR 21.0, 95% CI 12.0-36.6), highest SBP >= 150 mmHg (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.8-3.0), highest HR >= 110 bpm (OR 2.8, 95% CI 2.2-3.8). CONCLUSION: Among patients studied, the higher CIWA-Ar score was the most significant risk factor associated with alcohol withdrawal-related hospital transfer. Other significant risk factors identified are race other than Hispanic, white, and African American; male sex assigned at birth; age >= 55 years; highest SBP >= 150mmHg; and highest HR >= 110 bpm.
