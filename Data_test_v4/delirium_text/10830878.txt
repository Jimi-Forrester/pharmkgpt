10830878|t|Chemical speciation applied to bio-inorganic chemistry.
10830878|a|The processes of converting new chemistry into new healthcare, environment-friendly, products are considerably facilitated when chemical speciation data are available. These identify causal links between speciation and biological responses based upon specific chemical species rather than total concentrations. The effective roles of bismuth for ulcer treatment, of Ca, Zn, Sn and F in dentifrices, and of zinc species and common cold symptoms are described. A new readily biodegradable ligand for minimising the environmental impact of washing powders, Al and Alzheimer's disease (and the absence of a causal link), and an audit of Cu and Zn flow from wound dressing through wound fluid to healing tissue, are all discussed in detail.
