38379184|t|Associations of Serum Insulin and Related Measures With Neuropathology and Cognition in Older Persons With and Without Diabetes.
38379184|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine associations of serum insulin and related measures with neuropathology and cognition in older persons. METHODS: We studied 192 older persons (96 with diabetes and 96 without, matched by sex and balanced by age-at-death, education, and postmortem interval) from a community-based, clinical-pathologic study of aging, with annual evaluations including neuropsychological testing (summarized into global cognition and 5 cognitive domains) and postmortem autopsy. We assessed serum insulin, glucose, leptin, adiponectin, hemoglobin A1C, advanced glycation-end products (AGEs), and receptors for advanced glycation-end products, and calculated the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and adiponectin-to-leptin ratio. Using adjusted regression analyses, we examined the associations of serum measures with neuropathology of cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease, and with the level of cognition proximate-to-death. RESULTS: Higher HOMA-IR was associated with the presence of brain infarcts and specifically microinfarcts, and higher HOMA-IR and leptin were each associated with subcortical infarcts. Further, higher leptin levels and lower adiponectin-to-leptin ratios were associated with the presence of moderate-to-severe atherosclerosis. Serum insulin and related measures were not associated with the level of Alzheimer's disease pathology, as assessed by global, as well as amyloid burden or tau tangle density scores. Regarding cognitive outcomes, higher insulin and leptin levels, and lower adiponectin and receptors for advanced glycation-end products levels, respectively, were each associated with lower levels of global cognition. INTERPRETATION: Peripheral insulin resistance indicated by HOMA-IR and related serum measures was associated with a greater burden of cerebrovascular neuropathology and lower cognition.
