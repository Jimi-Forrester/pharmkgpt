33305273|a|Studies conducted in the past decade related to the use of natural antioxidants in meat products revealed the prevalent use of plant-based antioxidative materials added as powders, extracts, or dried or raw materials to meat products. The amount of antioxidative materials varied from 7.8 ppm to 19.8%. Extracts and powders were used in small amounts (ppm to grams) and large amounts (grams to >1%), respectively. Antioxidative materials used in meat products are mainly composed of phenolic compounds and flavonoids, which are able to inhibit lipid peroxidation of meat products, thereby preserving meat quality. However, the main ingredients used in processed meat products are the traditional additives, such as sodium erythorbate, sodium hydrosulfite, and synthetic antioxidants, rather than natural antioxidants. This difference could be attributed to changes in the sensory quality or characteristics of meat products using natural antioxidants. Therefore, novel research paradigms to develop meat products are needed, focusing on the multifunctional aspects of natural antioxidants.
