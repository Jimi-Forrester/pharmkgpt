34077732|t|PSD-95 protects synapses from beta-amyloid.
34077732|a|Beta-amyloid (Abeta) depresses excitatory synapses by a poorly understood mechanism requiring NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function. Here, we show that increased PSD-95, a major synaptic scaffolding molecule, blocks the effects of Abeta on synapses. The protective effect persists in tissue lacking the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1, which prevents the confounding synaptic potentiation by increased PSD-95. Abeta modifies the conformation of the NMDAR C-terminal domain (CTD) and its interaction with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), producing synaptic weakening. Higher endogenous levels or overexpression of PSD-95 block Abeta-induced effects on the NMDAR CTD conformation, its interaction with PP1, and synaptic weakening. Our results indicate that increased PSD-95 protects synapses from Abeta toxicity, suggesting that low levels of synaptic PSD-95 may be a molecular sign indicating synapse vulnerability to Abeta. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of its depalmitoylation increases PSD-95 at synapses and rescues deficits caused by Abeta, possibly opening a therapeutic avenue against Alzheimer's disease.
