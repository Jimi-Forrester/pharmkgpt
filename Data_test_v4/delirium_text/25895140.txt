25895140|t|Biomarkers of lipid peroxidation in Alzheimer disease (AD): an update.
25895140|a|Increasing evidence suggests that free radical-mediated oxidation of biological substrates is a key feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. While it has long been established that biomarkers of lipid peroxidation (LPO) are elevated in AD brain as well as ventricular CSF postmortem, more recent studies have demonstrated increased LPO biomarkers in postmortem brain from subjects with mild cognitive impairment, the earliest clinically detectable phase of dementia and preclinical AD, the earliest detectable pathological phase. Furthermore, multiple LPO biomarkers are elevated in readily accessible biological fluids throughout disease progression. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that LPO is an early feature during disease progression and may be considered a key pathway for targeted therapeutics as well as an enhancer of diagnostic accuracy for early detection of subjects during the prodromal phase.
