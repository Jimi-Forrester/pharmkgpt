38786045|t|Glioblastoma Phagocytic Cell Death: Balancing the Opportunities for Therapeutic Manipulation.
38786045|a|Macrophages and microglia are professional phagocytes that sense and migrate toward "eat-me" signals. The role of phagocytic cells is to maintain homeostasis by engulfing senescent or apoptotic cells, debris, and abnormally aggregated macromolecules. Usually, dying cells send out "find-me" signals, facilitating the recruitment of phagocytes. Healthy cells can also promote or inhibit the phagocytosis phenomenon of macrophages and microglia by tuning the balance between "eat-me" and "don't-eat-me" signals at different stages in their lifespan, while the "don't-eat-me" signals are often hijacked by tumor cells as a mechanism of immune evasion. Using a combination of bioinformatic analysis and spatial profiling, we delineate the balance of the "don't-eat-me" CD47/SIRPalpha and "eat-me" CALR/STC1 ligand-receptor interactions to guide therapeutic strategies that are being developed for glioblastoma sequestered in the central nervous system (CNS).
