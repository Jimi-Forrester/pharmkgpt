38792065|a|A previous study reported that the ethanolic extract of the edible fern, Diplazium esculentum (Retz.) Sw. (DE), obtained from a non-optimized extraction condition exhibited anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) properties through the inhibition of a rate-limiting enzyme in amyloid peptide formation, beta-secretase-1 (BACE-1). Nevertheless, a non-optimized or suboptimal extraction may lead to several issues, such as a reduction in extraction efficiency and increased time and plant materials. In this study, extraction of the DE was optimized to obtain appropriate BACE-1 inhibition using a Box-Behnken design (BBD) and response surface methodology (RSM). Data revealed that the optimal extraction condition was 70% (v/v) aqueous ethanol, 50 min extraction time, 30  C extraction temperature, and 1:30 g/mL solid/liquid ratio, giving BACE-1 inhibition at 56.33%. In addition, the extract also exhibited significant antioxidant activities compared to the non-optimized extraction. Metabolomic phytochemical profiles and targeted phytochemical analyses showed that kaempferol, quercetin, and their derivatives as well as rosmarinic acid were abundant in the extract. The optimized DE extract also acted synergistically with donepezil, an AD drug suppressing BACE-1 activities. Data received from Drosophila-expressing human amyloid precursor proteins (APPs) and BACE-1, representing the amyloid hypothesis, showed that the optimized DE extract penetrated the fly brains, suppressed BACE-1 activities, and improved locomotor functions. The extract quenched the expression of glutathione S transferase D1 (GSTD1), inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE-1), and molecular chaperone-binding immunoglobulin (Bip), while donepezil suppressed these genes and other genes involved in antioxidant and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, including superoxide dismutase type 1 (SOD1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF-6), and protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). To sum up, the optimized extraction condition reduced extraction time while resulting in higher phytochemicals, antioxidants, and BACE-1 inhibitors.
