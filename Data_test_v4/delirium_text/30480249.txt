30480249|a|There is evidence demonstrating that 5-mg of fast-release melatonin significantly reduces nocturnal sleep onset in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the physiological mechanism that could promote sleep installation by melatonin in patients with AD is still poorly understood. The present pilot study was designed to analyze the effects of melatonin on cortical activity during the sleep onset period (SOP) in eight mild-to-moderate AD patients treated with 5-mg of fast-release melatonin. Electroencephalographic recordings were obtained from C3-A1, C4-A2, F7-T3, F8-T4, F3-F4, and O1-O2. The relative power (RP), interhemispheric, intrahemispheric, and fronto-posterior correlations of six electroencephalographic bands were calculated and compared between two conditions: placebo and melatonin. Results show that at F7-T3, F3-F4, and C3-A1, melatonin induced an increase of the RP of the delta band. Likewise, in F7-T3, melatonin induced a decrease of the RP in the alpha1 band. Similarly, results show a lower interhemispheric correlation between the F7-T3 and F8-T4 derivations in the alpha1 band compared to the placebo condition. We conclude that the short sleep onset related to melatonin intake in AD patients was associated with a lower RP of the alpha1, a higher RP of the delta band (mainly in the left hemisphere) and a decreased interhemispheric EEG coupling in the alpha1 band. The possible role of the GABAergic neurotransmission as well as of the cascade of neurochemical events that melatonin triggers on sleep onset are discussed.
