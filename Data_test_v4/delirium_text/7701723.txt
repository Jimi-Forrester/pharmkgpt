7701723|a|Extracorporal inclusion of the porcine spleen was used in 180 patients with burns of the III A-B-IV degrees with the square area of burns from 25% to 95% of the body surface. The age of the patients was from 1 to 60 years. Critical trauma was diagnosed in 48 patients, supercritical--in 132 patients. The total amount of procedures was 310. Positive dynamics in the course of the burn disease was observed after biohemosorption; decrease of the body temperature, of intoxication delirium symptoms, of respiratory insufficiency. The state of the burn wounds was improved. It was stated that the liver function became better, indicators of nonspecific factors of defense, cellular and humoral links of immunity were increased, a tendency to normalization of lipid metabolism was noted. Positive results were obtained in 43 of 48 with critical trauma. Recovery took place in 52 of 132 patients with supercritical traumas.
