2057310|t|Normal McCollough effect in Alzheimer's disease and global amnesia.
2057310|a|The McCollough effect (ME), a long-lasting, pattern-contingent aftereffect in normal human vision, was examined in persons with known deficits in memory. We induced MEs in 11 subjects, 5 patients with various severities of Alzheimer's disease (AD), H.M. (a patient who has global amnesia due to bilateral medial temporal lobectomy and who has been studied for 35 years since his operation), and 5 control subjects. H.M. and the AD patients showed MEs of strength and duration comparable to those of the control subjects. These results demonstrate a dissociation between learning mechanisms that mediate recall and recognition versus mechanisms that mediate the ME. Furthermore, knowledge about the sites of neuropathology in H.M. and in AD are consistent with other sources of evidence implicating early visual areas, especially V1, as a critical locus of the ME.
