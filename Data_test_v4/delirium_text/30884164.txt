30884164|a|OBJECTIVE: Inflammation can cause delirium. Soluble fibrinogen-like protein 2 (sFGL2) is a modulator of the immune response and more recently found to be a biomarker for brain injury. This study was designed to discover the predictive capability of serum sFGL2 concentrations for delirium after acute pancreatitis (AP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, serum sFGL2 concentrations were quantified in 184 healthy controls and in 184 AP patients. Disease severity was assessed by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Care Evaluation II score, Ranson score, multiple organ dysfunction score, and sequential organ failure assessment score. Delirium was recorded during hospital stay. Predictors of delirium were identified using multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Serum sFGL2 concentrations were substantially higher in AP patients than in controls. Serum sFGL2 concentrations were intimately correlated with the preceding severity parameters. Serum sFGL2 and the aforementioned severity parameters were independent predictors for delirium. Under receiver operating characteristic curve, the discriminatory ability of serum sFGL2 was equivalent to those of the above-mentioned severity parameters. Moreover, serum sFGL2 dramatically improved the predictive value of the aforementioned severity parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of serum sFGL2 concentrations is strongly associated with the AP severity and has the potential to distinguish delirium after AP.
