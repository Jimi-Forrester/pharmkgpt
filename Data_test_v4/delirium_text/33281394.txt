33281394|a|BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cluster of obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance. The sedentary lifestyle settles on the phenotypical expression of a genetically acquired trait in an obese person. Weight control and a healthy lifestyle remain primary and effective strategies for prevention and management of the MS. The lifestyle modifications mentioned for Santarpanjanya (disorders due to over nutrition) diseases and Arogyavardhini compound that can improve metabolism and reduce weight were selected for a present clinical trial to assess and compare their efficacy in the management of the MS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five patients were registered for the trial and randomly divided into two groups. Patients were treated with lifestyle modification with and without Arogyavardhini compound for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients in each group could complete the course of treatment. Lifestyle modification alone and with Arogyavardhini compound resulted in 1.32% and 3.06% decrease in waist circumference, 5.81% and 18.03% decrease in serum triglycerides, 4.43% and 6.89% decrease in systolic blood pressure, 3.82% increase and 2.48% decrease in fasting blood sugar, 9.13% and 5.56% increase in high-density lipoprotein, respectively. The decrease in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure was statistically significant in the both groups. CONCLUSION: Arogyavardhini compound, along with lifestyle modification was found more effective than lifestyle modification alone in the management of MS.
