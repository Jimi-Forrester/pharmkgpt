37169386|t|Degenerative spinal conditions requiring emergency surgery: an evolving crisis in a publicly funded health care system.
37169386|a|BACKGROUND: Surgery for degenerative spine pathologies is typically performed on a scheduled basis; however, worsening symptoms may warrant emergency surgery. An increasing number of patients requiring emergency surgery has been observed (22.6% in 2006 to 34.8% in 2019). We sought to compare the outcomes of patients who received scheduled surgery and those who required emergency surgery. METHODS: All patients treated between Jan. 1, 2006, and Dec. 31, 2019, were included. Retrospective comparisons were made between patients who were scheduled (elective) for surgery and those requiring emergency surgery, patients who were scheduled for surgery and those who decompensated while on the surgical waitlist and patients who presented as de novo emergencies and those who decompensated while on the surgical waitlist. RESULTS: Among the 6217 patients with degenerative pathologies, 4654 (74.9%) patients were scheduled (elective) for surgery and 1563 (25.1%) were patients requiring emergency surgery. Compared with patients who were scheduled, patients requiring emergency surgery had a longer length of stay (LOS) in hospital (5.1 d, interquartile range [IQR] 2.7-11.2 v. 3.6 d, IQR 1.3-6.4, p < 0.001) and lower rate of home discharge (78.6% v. 94.2%, p < 0.001). Patients requiring emergency surgery were 1.34 times more likely to have any adverse events (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.68, p = 0.01). When compared with patients who were scheduled for surgery, those who decompensated while on the surgical waitlist had longer LOS (7.0 d, IQR 3.3-15.0 v. 3.6 d, IQR 1.3-6.4, p < 0.001), less home discharge (77.6% v. 94.2%, p < 0.001) and were 2.5 times more likely to have any adverse events (95% CI 1.5-4.1, p < 0.001). Patients who decompensated had a 2.1 times higher risk of having any adverse events than patients who presented as de novo emergencies (95% CI 1.2-3.6, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We observed worse perioperative outcomes for patients requiring emergency surgery for degenerative spinal conditions than for patients who were scheduled for surgery. Patients who decompensated while on the surgical waitlist had the worst outcomes.
