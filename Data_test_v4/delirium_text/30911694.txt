30911694|a|Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder which occurs as a result of a spontaneous electrical discharge in the brain. According to recent studies there might be a relationship between specific diet and seizure occurrence. Casein is an important protein of milk which often causes hypersensitivity. It seems the release of inflammatory cytokines during the process of immune system response alter the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity and lead to neuronal inflammation which could constitute on epileptogenic focus. On the other hand, several studies represent full-fat milk or higher fat dairy products as an effective anti-inflammatory factor which elevate seizure threshold. The aim of present study was investigation of acute and chronic effects of dairy products including dough (a yogurt-based beverage), cheese, low and high fat yogurt and milk on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures or electroshock in mice. The results of study indicated that lower fat dairy products reduced seizure threshold in intravenous PTZ-induced seizure as well as reduction in myoclonic and clonic jerk latencies in intraperitoneal PTZ-induced seizure. High fat products or cheese reduced seizure activity in both PTZ-induced models. Meanwhile both acute and chronic administration of dairy products had no effect on an electroshock-induced seizure. Therefore, diet-related seizures may depend upon the method which seizures are provoked.
