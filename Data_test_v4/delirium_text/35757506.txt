35757506|t|Potential Benefits of Music Therapy on Stroke Rehabilitation.
35757506|a|Stroke is associated with a high rate of disability and mortality, and survivors are usually accompanied with dysphagia, aphasia, motor dysfunction, cognitive impairment, depression, and other complications. In the past decades, many studies have been conducted to reveal the pathogenesis and pathological mechanisms of stroke. Furthermore, treatment methods have been developed that contribute to the elevated survival rate of stroke patients. Early rehabilitation poststroke is starting to be recognized as important and has been receiving increasing attention in order to further improve the quality of life of the patients. As an emerging method of poststroke rehabilitation, music therapy can help attenuate dysphagia and aphasia, improve cognition and motor function, alleviate negative moods, and accelerate neurological recovery in stroke patients. This review helps summarize the recent progress that has been made using music therapy in stroke rehabilitation and is aimed at providing clinical evidence for the treatment of stroke patients.
