31792732|t|A transcriptomic analysis of Nsmce1 overexpression in mouse hippocampal neuronal cell by RNA sequencing.
31792732|a|Mouse Nsmce1 gene is the homolog of non-structural maintenance of chromosomes element 1 (NSE1) that is mainly involved in maintenance of genome integrity, DNA damage response, and DNA repair. Defective DNA repair may cause neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). So far, there is no direct evidence for the correlation between Nsmce1 and AD. In order to explore the function of Nsmce1 in the regulation of nervous system, we have overexpressed or knocked down Nsmce1 in the mouse hippocampal neuronal cells (MHNCs) HT-22 and detected its regulation of AD marker genes as well as cell proliferation. The results showed that the expression of App, Bace2, and Mapt could be inhibited by Nsmce1 overexpression and activated by the knockdown of Nsmce1. Moreover, the HT-22 cell proliferation ability could be promoted by Nsmce1 overexpression and inhibited by knockdown of Nsmce1. Furthermore, we performed a transcriptomics study by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to evaluate and quantify the gene expression profiles in response to the overexpression of Nsmce1 in HT-22 cells. As a result, 224 significantly dysregulated genes including 83 upregulated and 141 downregulated genes were identified by the comparison of Nsmce1 /+ to WT cells, which were significantly enriched in several Gene Ontology (GO) terms and pathways. In addition, the complexity of the alternative splicing (AS) landscape was increased by Nsmce1 overexpression in HT-22 cells. Thousands of AS events were identified to be mainly involved in the pathway of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (UMP) as well as 3 neurodegenerative diseases including AD. The protein-protein interaction network was reconstructed to show top 10 essential genes regulated by Nsmce1. Our sequencing data is available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with accession number as GSE113436. These results may provide some evidence of molecular and cellular functions of Nsmce1 in MHNCs.
