36267038|a|BACKGROUND: The aim was to evaluate the causes of death for patients with localized, regional and metastatic penile cancer (PeCa) after diagnosis. METHODS: PeCa patients diagnosed during 2004-2018 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database were identified. Causes of deaths including PeCa, second malignant tumors (SMTs) and non-tumor diseases were analyzed, as well as the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of each cause. RESULTS: For localized PeCa, 800 of 2155 patients died during the follow-up. 24.9% of all deaths were due to PeCa. 18.0% and 57.1% deaths were due to SMTs and non-tumor causes. Main SMTs included cancers of lung and bronchus (n = 40) and skin (n = 11) with significantly increased SMRs of 1.71 (1.22-2.33) and 4.82 (2.41-8.63). Mortality risks of other SMTs were mostly similar with the general populations. Main causes of non-tumor diseases included diseases of heart [n = 172, SMR: 1.66 (1.42-1.93)], COPD and allied cond [n = 38, SMR: 1.63 (1.15-2.24)], and cerebrovascular diseases [n = 33, SMR: 1.71 (1.17-2.4)]. For regional PeCa, 679 of 1310 patients died including 43.5% PeCa, 14.8% SMTs and 26.6% non-tumor causes. The mortality risks of cancers from lung and bronchus [SMR: 2.41 (1.53-3.62)], skin [SMR: 6.41 (2.35-13.95)] and testis [SMR: 149.35 (18.09-539.5)] were significantly increased. Main non-tumor causes of death included diseases of heart [n = 71, SMR: 1.77 (1.38-2.23)], COPD and allied cond [n = 17, SMR: 1.85 (1.08-2.95)] and diabetes mellitus [n = 16, SMR: 3.62 (2.07-5.88)]. For distant diseases, 109 of 132 patients died including 76 (69.7%) died for PeCa itself, 24 (22.0%) died for SMTs and 9 (8.3%) died for non-tumor diseases. The majority of PeCa deaths (67.1%) and SMTs deaths (79.2%) occurred within 1 year after the diagnosis of PeCa. CONCLUSIONS: We firstly analyzed the SMTs and non-tumor causes of death and morality risks of each cause for PeCa patients, which provided valuable information for PeCa patients on disease prevention and health care during their survivorship.
