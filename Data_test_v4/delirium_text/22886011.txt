22886011|a|Epidemiological studies have consistently shown that vascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and lack of physical exercise are associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Neuroradiological and neuropathological studies have confirmed the importance of cerebrovascular lesions in the etiology of late onset dementia. We have reviewed the literature and conclude that up until now randomized controlled clinical trials targeting individual risk factors and assessing cognitive decline or dementia as an outcome have not convincingly shown that treatment of vascular risk factors can actually prevent or postpone cognitive decline and dementia. New studies targeting several vascular risk factors at the same time and using cognitive decline or dementia as primary outcome might answer the question whether cognitive decline can really be postponed or even prevented. The design of such studies is not straightforward and long follow-up is required. In this review we discuss several pertinent methodological issues that need to be addressed to achieve an optimal design of new randomized controlled trials.
