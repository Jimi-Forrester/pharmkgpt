36033291|t|Hypotension following hip fracture surgery in patients aged 80 years or older: A prospective cohort study.
36033291|a|Background: Hip fractures occurring in older patients often result in significant anemia, even hemodynamic disorders and hypoperfusion. The present study aims to investigate the general characteristics of hypotension following hip fracture surgery (HFHFS) and its effect on clinical outcomes. Methods: A total of 168 patients aged >=80 years who underwent hip fracture surgery at a tertiary orthopaedic hospital from January 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020 were enrolled and followed up for one year. Patients were divided into HFHFS and non-HFHFS cohorts according to blood pressure within 24 h after surgery. General difference comparison, univariate and multivariate regression, and survival analysis were applied to investigate the association between HSHSF and in-hospital and one-year clinical outcomes. Results: The incidence of HFHFS was 23.8% (40/168), with a median time to onset of 8.0 (5.0-12.0) hours after surgery. The HFHFS group had more chronic heart disease before injury and experienced more positive fluid balance on the day of surgery (P values were 0.032 and 0.028, respectively). After adjustment for potential confounders, HFHFS was associated with prolonged length of hospital stay (B 2.66, 95% CI 0.22, 5.10; P = 0.033), postoperative cardiac dysfunction (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.05, 8.11; P = 0.039), and postoperative brain dysfunction (OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.50, 8.23; P = 0.004). HFHFS had no effect on one-year modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (B 0.28, 95% CI -0.28, 0.84; P = 0.322) and one-year mortality (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.29, 3.96; P = 0.917). Conclusion: Many older patients develop hypotension several hours after hip fracture surgery, which may be related with preexisting decline in cardiac reserve in addition to postoperative hidden blood loss. Patients who experienced HFHFS were more likely to have postoperative cardiac and brain dysfunction and longer hospital stay. However, HFHFS had no significant effect on mRS and mortality at one year.
