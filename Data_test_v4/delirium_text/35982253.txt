35982253|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta), which is believed to be the very starting event of AD neurodegeneration. In this work, D-Phe, D-Ala, and D-Glu amino acids, which are the non-occurring enantiomeric form in the human body, and also D-Asp and DL-SeMet, have proved to be amyloidogenic regarding Abeta42 aggregation in TEM studies. These amyloidogenic amino acid enantiomers also widened Abeta42 fibrils up to 437% regarding Abeta42 alone, suggesting that Abeta42 aggregation is enantiomerically dependent. To inhibit enantiomeric-induced amyloid aggregation, selenium nanoparticles stabilized with chitosan (Ch-SeNPs) were successfully synthesized and employed. Thus, Ch-SeNPs reduced and even completely inhibited Abeta42 aggregation produced in the presence of some amino acid enantiomers. In addition, through UV-Vis spectroscopy and fluorescence studies, it was deduced that Ch-SeNPs were able to interact differently with amino acids depending on their enantiomeric form. On the other hand, antioxidant properties of amino acid enantiomers were evaluated by DPPH and TBARS assays, with Tyr enantiomers being the only ones showing antioxidant effect. All spectroscopic data were statistically analysed through experimental design and response surface analysis, showing that the interaction between the Ch-SeNPs and the amino acids studied was enantioselective and allowing, in some cases, to establish the concentration ratios in which this interaction is maximum.
