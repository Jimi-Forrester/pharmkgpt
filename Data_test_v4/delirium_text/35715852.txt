35715852|t|Spotlight on therapeutic efficiency of mesenchymal stem cells in viral infections with a focus on COVID-19.
35715852|a|The SARS-COV-2 virus has infected the world at a very high rate by causing COVID-19 disease. Nearly 507 million individuals have been infected with this virus, with approximately 1.2% of these patients being dead, indicating that this virus has been out of control in many countries. While researchers are investigating how to develop efficient drugs and vaccines versus the COVID-19 pandemic, new superseded treatments have the potential to reduce mortality. The recent application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a subgroup of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress has created potential benefits as supportive therapy for this viral contagion in patients with acute conditions and aged patients with severe pneumonia. Consequently, within this overview, we discuss the role and therapeutic potential of MSCs and the challenges ahead in using them to treat viral infections, with highlighting on COVID-19 infection.
