37115336|t|Successful use of extracorporeal life support and hemadsorption in the context of venlafaxine intoxication requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a case report.
37115336|a|Venlafaxine is a serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor prescribed as an antidepressant. Overdose clinically manifests with neurological, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal abnormalities based on, amongst others, serotonin syndrome and can be life-threatening due to cardiovascular collapse. Besides immediate decontamination via gastric lavage and inhibition of enteral absorption through active charcoal, successful hemadsorption with CytoSorb  has been reported. We present the case of a 17-year-old female who required extracorporeal life support (ECLS) for cardiovascular collapse as a result of life-threatening venlafaxine intoxication. Serial serum blood concentrations of venlafaxine/desmethylvenlafaxine on admission at a tertiary hospital (approx. 24 h after ingestion) and subsequently 6 h and 18 h thereafter, as well as on days 2 and 4, were measured. CytoSorb  was initiated 6 h after admission and changed three times over 72 h. The initial blood concentration of venlafaxine/desmethylvenlafaxine was 53.52 micromol/l. After 6 h, it declined to 30.7 micromol/l and CytoSorb  was initiated at this point. After 12 h of hemadsorption, the blood level decreased to 9.6 micromol/l. On day 2, it was down to 7.17 micromol/l and decreased further to 3.74 micromol/l. Additional continuous renal replacement therapy using CVVHD was implemented on day 5. The combination of hemadsorption, besides traditional decontamination strategies along maximal organ supportive therapy with ECLS, resulted in the intact neurological survival of the highest venlafaxine intoxication reported in the literature to date. Hemadsorption with CytoSorb  might help to reduce blood serum levels of venlafaxine. Swift clearance of toxic blood levels may support cardiovascular recovery after life-threatening intoxications.
