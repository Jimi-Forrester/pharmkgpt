29714500|a|The volatile oil (VO), extracted from the stems of Schisandra chinensis Baill. (SCS), was separated and identified by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. The study was devised to investigate the effects of VO on oxidative stress and cognitive deficits induced by amyloid-beta (Abeta(1-42)). Alzheimer's disease (AD) models were established by injecting Abeta(1-42) into the rat hippocampus and the effects of learning and memory were observed by a Morris water maze test, immunohistological alterations, and correlative indicators covering nerve growth (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial-cell-derived trophic factor, and nerve growth factor), interleukin 1beta, tumor necrosis factor, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), malondialdehyde (MDA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and microglial CD11b in AD rats. And activities of SOD, MDA, and GSH-Px were ameliorated by VO. The neurotrophic factors GFAP and microglial CD11b were noticeably improved in histopathologic changes. These data suggested that VO from SCS had potential activities for the prevention and treatment of AD.
