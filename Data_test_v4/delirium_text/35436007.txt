35436007|a|AIM: To evaluate nurses' documented practice when communicating about pain for people with dementia in hospital. DESIGN: Retrospective medical record review. METHOD: Medical records were retrieved from four inpatient units in a district and a tertiary teaching hospital of people aged 65 years and over with documented dementia. Data were extracted on nurses' documented pain assessment and management. Pain frequency and association between patient self-report, pain scores, cognition levels and analgesics used during hospitalization were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Multivariate regression examined patient characteristics, pain characteristics and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: One-hundred patient records met the inclusion criteria between 1 January and 31 August 2017. Sixty-six percent of patients with dementia had pain documented at least once during hospitalization with 58% reported as moderate to severe pain intensity. Patients' pain severity during admission was associated with their length of hospital stay. Ninety-three percent of nurses used a self-reporting pain tool and 7% used an observational pain tool. Pain scores were not associated with patients' cognition level, nurses' pain reports or analgesic management. CONCLUSION: Pain frequently occurs in people with dementia during hospitalization. Fragmented pain reporting influences the translation of pain messages. Disproportionate pain tool application and non-association between pain scores and analgesic management suggest a potential knowledge gap among nurses about the practical use of pain tools and practice gap between pain assessment and management in dementia care. IMPACT: Pain was regularly assessed by nurses and implemented as a fifth vital sign for people with dementia in hospitals. However, the high frequency of pain affects care outcomes. Areas for improvement include nursing practice of pain assessment and management in dementia care in hospitals. Further understanding of the usefulness of pain tools and the efficacy of pain scores when communicating about pain in dementia care in hospitals is required.
