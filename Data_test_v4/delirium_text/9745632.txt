9745632|a|The nervous system is protected from free-radical-induced oxidative damage by a number of antioxidants. These include small-molecular-weight substances such as vitamins C and E as well as the large protein molecules superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and others. These antioxidants are often localized in specific portions of the cell. They also show considerable biological interactions with one another. These factors modulate their antioxidant activity. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some disorders of the brain; hence, antioxidants have become attractive therapeutic agents. Among the antioxidants, vitamin E has shown some promise in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease. No investigations have been conducted to examine whether vitamin E or other nutritional antioxidants can be used prophylactically to prevent the incidence of degeneration or other pathologic processes in the brain.
