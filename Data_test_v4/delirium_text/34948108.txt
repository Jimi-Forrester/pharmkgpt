34948108|t|Crosstalk between Neuron and Glial Cells in Oxidative Injury and Neuroprotection.
34948108|a|To counteract oxidative stress and associated brain diseases, antioxidant systems rescue neuronal cells from oxidative stress by neutralizing reactive oxygen species and preserving gene regulation. It is necessary to understand the communication and interactions between brain cells, including neurons, astrocytes and microglia, to understand oxidative stress and antioxidant mechanisms. Here, the role of glia in the protection of neurons against oxidative injury and glia-neuron crosstalk to maintain antioxidant defense mechanisms and brain protection are reviewed. The first part of this review focuses on the role of glia in the morphological and physiological changes required for brain homeostasis under oxidative stress and antioxidant defense mechanisms. The second part focuses on the essential crosstalk between neurons and glia for redox balance in the brain for protection against oxidative stress.
