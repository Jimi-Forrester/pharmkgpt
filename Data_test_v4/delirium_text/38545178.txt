38545178|t|Value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease.
38545178|a|Background and objectives: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a widely recognized marker of inflammation in peripheral blood. However, its specific role in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) has not been reported. This study aims to investigate the relationship between NIID and NLR. Methods: A multicenter database was collected, including 157 NIID patients from seven hospitals (The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital, Tengzhou Central People's Hospital,The Affiliated Brain Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Liaocheng People's Hospital,The Second Hospital of Shandong University, Inner Mongolia People's Hospital, Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University,The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC), along with 157 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. White blood cell counts (including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils) were obtained, and the NLR was calculated. Additionally, cognitive impairment was assessed using clinical evaluation scores. Results: NIID patients exhibited significantly higher NLR values compared to the healthy control group (p < 0.001). The plasma NLR levels in NIID patients showed a weak positive correlation with disease duration (r = 0.219, p = 0.016). However, no significant correlations were found between NLR and age of onset or cognitive impairment (p > 0.05). Conclusion: There is a significant association between NLR and NIID, suggesting a potential role of peripheral blood inflammation in the pathogenesis of NIID.
