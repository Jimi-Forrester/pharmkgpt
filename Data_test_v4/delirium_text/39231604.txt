39231604|t|Having the conversation: Individualizing RSV vaccination in older patients.
39231604|a|The new vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) reduce the risk of RSV illness, which is common in older people and carries the risk of hospitalization with its attendant risks such as delirium and physical decline leading to loss of function and independence. Individualized discussions regarding vaccination should weigh the risks of vaccination, which are minor, against the preventive benefits. Discussions incorporating these elements may lead to greater vaccine uptake, especially by those at high risk.
