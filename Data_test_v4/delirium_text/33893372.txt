33893372|t|A comprehensive structural, lectin and immunohistochemical characterization of the zebrafish olfactory system.
33893372|a|Fish chemosensory olfactory receptors allow them to detect a wide range of water-soluble chemicals, that mediate fundamental behaviours. Zebrafish possess a well-developed sense of smell which governs reproduction, appetite, and fear responses. The spatial organization of functional properties within the olfactory epithelium and bulb are comparable to those of mammals, making this species suitable for studies of olfactory differentiation and regeneration and neuronal representation of olfactory information. The advent of genomic techniques has been decisive for the discovery of specific olfactory cell types and the identification of cell populations expressing vomeronasal receptors. These advances have marched ahead of morphological and neurochemical studies. This study aims to fill the existing gap in specific histological, lectin-histochemical and immunohistochemical studies on the olfactory rosette and the olfactory bulb of the zebrafish. Tissue dissection and microdissection techniques were employed, followed by histological staining techniques, lectin-histochemical labelling (UEA, LEA, BSI-B4) and immunohistochemistry using antibodies against G proteins subunits alphao and alphai2, growth-associated protein-43, calbindin, calretinin, glial-fibrillary-acidic-protein and luteinizing-hormone-releasing-hormone. The results obtained enrich the available information on the neurochemical patterns of the zebrafish olfactory system, pointing to a greater complexity than the one currently considered, especially when taking into account the peculiarities of the nonsensory epithelium.
