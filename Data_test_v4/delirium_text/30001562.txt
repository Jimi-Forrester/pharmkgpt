30001562|t|Subjective Cognitive Decline Among Adults Aged >=45 Years - United States, 2015-2016.
30001562|a|Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is the self-reported experience of worsening or more frequent confusion or memory loss within the previous 12 months (1,2) and one of the earliest noticeable symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's), a fatal form of dementia (i.e., a decline in mental abilities severe enough to interfere with everyday life) (1). Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, although not all memory loss results from Alzheimer's (3). To examine SCD, CDC analyzed combined data from the 2015 and 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys. Overall, 11.2% of adults aged >=45 years reported having SCD, 50.6% of whom reported SCD-related functional limitations. Among persons living alone aged >=45 years, 13.8% reported SCD; among persons with any chronic disease, 15.2% reported SCD. Adults should discuss confusion or memory loss with a health care professional who can assess cognitive decline and address possible treatments and issues related to chronic disease management, medical care, and caregiving.
