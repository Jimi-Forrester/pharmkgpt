29992704|t|Plasma proteomic signature of age in healthy humans.
29992704|a|To characterize the proteomic signature of chronological age, 1,301 proteins were measured in plasma using the SOMAscan assay (SomaLogic, Boulder, CO, USA) in a population of 240 healthy men and women, 22-93 years old, who were disease- and treatment-free and had no physical and cognitive impairment. Using a p <= 3.83 x 10-5 significance threshold, 197 proteins were positively associated, and 20 proteins were negatively associated with age. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) had the strongest, positive association with age (GDF15; 0.018 +- 0.001, p = 7.49 x 10-56 ). In our sample, GDF15 was not associated with other cardiovascular risk factors such as cholesterol or inflammatory markers. The functional pathways enriched in the 217 age-associated proteins included blood coagulation, chemokine and inflammatory pathways, axon guidance, peptidase activity, and apoptosis. Using elastic net regression models, we created a proteomic signature of age based on relative concentrations of 76 proteins that highly correlated with chronological age (r = 0.94). The generalizability of our findings needs replication in an independent cohort.
