16938688|t|Caregivers' experience of risk in dementia: the LASER-AD study.
16938688|a|The objective was to explore caregivers' experience of and concerns about the safety of care recipients (CRs) with Alzheimer's disease (AD) living at home. We interviewed family caregivers about their concerns regarding CR's safety, occurrence of risk over the last year and safety measures taken to manage risk. A total of 89 family caregiver/CR dyads participated. All had been recruited as part of a larger longitudinal study based in London and South East Region (LASER) of the UK. Caregivers spent a substantial proportion of the day supervising the CR (mean = 15.5 hours). Most caregivers (39; 81.2%) of the 48/89 CRs left alone worried about their safety. Sixty-one (68.5%) caregivers reported at least one incident in which the CR had been at risk within the past year. A majority (71; 79.8%) had taken measures to prevent risk behaviours. Greater impairment in activities of daily living and the caregiver not being the CR's spouse were associated with more measures being taken. Caregivers themselves provide supervision most of the time for the CR, and are worried when they are left alone. This is realistic as despite caregiver's attempts at managing their CR's risks, including direct supervision, dangerous incidents still frequently occur in people with AD.
