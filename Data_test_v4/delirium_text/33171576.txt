33171576|t|Non-Coding RNAs as Sensors of Oxidative Stress in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
33171576|a|Oxidative stress (OS) results from an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species and the cellular antioxidant capacity. OS plays a central role in neurodegenerative diseases, where the progressive accumulation of reactive oxygen species induces mitochondrial dysfunction, protein aggregation and inflammation. Regulatory non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are essential transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression controllers, showing a highly regulated expression in space (cell types), time (developmental and ageing processes) and response to specific stimuli. These dynamic changes shape signaling pathways that are critical for the developmental processes of the nervous system and brain cell homeostasis. Diverse classes of ncRNAs have been involved in the cell response to OS and have been targeted in therapeutic designs. The perturbed expression of ncRNAs has been shown in human neurodegenerative diseases, with these changes contributing to pathogenic mechanisms, including OS and associated toxicity. In the present review, we summarize existing literature linking OS, neurodegeneration and ncRNA function. We provide evidences for the central role of OS in age-related neurodegenerative conditions, recapitulating the main types of regulatory ncRNAs with roles in the normal function of the nervous system and summarizing up-to-date information on ncRNA deregulation with a direct impact on OS associated with major neurodegenerative conditions.
