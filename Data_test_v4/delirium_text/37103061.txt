37103061|t|Recognition of Strokes in the ICU: A Narrative Review.
37103061|a|Despite the remarkable progress in acute treatment for stroke, in-hospital stroke is still devastating. The mortality and neurological sequelae are worse in patients with in-hospital stroke than in those with community-onset stroke. The leading cause of this tragic situation is the delay in emergent treatment. To achieve better outcomes, early stroke recognition and immediate treatment are crucial. In general, in-hospital stroke is initially witnessed by non-neurologists, but it is sometimes challenging for non-neurologists to diagnose a patient's state as a stroke and respond quickly. Therefore, understanding the risk and characteristics of in-hospital stroke would be helpful for early recognition. First, we need to know "the epicenter of in-hospital stroke". Critically ill patients and patients who undergo surgery or procedures are admitted to the intensive care unit, and they are potentially at high risk for stroke. Moreover, since they are often sedated and intubated, evaluating their neurological status concisely is difficult. The limited evidence demonstrated that the intensive care unit is the most common place for in-hospital strokes. This paper presents a review of the literature and clarifies the causes and risks of stroke in the intensive care unit.
