37746665|t|Arachidonic acid metabolism in health and disease.
37746665|a|Arachidonic acid (AA), an n-6 essential fatty acid, is a major component of mammalian cells and can be released by phospholipase A2. Accumulating evidence indicates that AA plays essential biochemical roles, as it is the direct precursor of bioactive lipid metabolites of eicosanoids such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and epoxyeicosatrienoic acid obtained from three distinct enzymatic metabolic pathways: the cyclooxygenase pathway, lipoxygenase pathway, and cytochrome P450 pathway. AA metabolism is involved not only in cell differentiation, tissue development, and organ function but also in the progression of diseases, such as hepatic fibrosis, neurodegeneration, obesity, diabetes, and cancers. These eicosanoids are generally considered proinflammatory molecules, as they can trigger oxidative stress and stimulate the immune response. Therefore, interventions in AA metabolic pathways are effective ways to manage inflammatory-related diseases in the clinic. Currently, inhibitors targeting enzymes related to AA metabolic pathways are an important area of drug discovery. Moreover, many advances have also been made in clinical studies of AA metabolic inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Herein, we review the discovery of AA and focus on AA metabolism in relation to health and diseases. Furthermore, inhibitors targeting AA metabolism are summarized, and potential clinical applications are discussed.
