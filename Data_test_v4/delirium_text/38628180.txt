38628180|t|Exploring the multimodal health-promoting properties of resveratrol: A comprehensive review.
38628180|a|Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol in various plants, has gained significant attention for its potential health-promoting properties. It has been demonstrated, after reviewing various clinical and in vitro studies, that resveratrol possesses potent antioxidant potential. Resveratrol demonstrates cellular component protection by directly neutralizing free radicals (FRs) and enhancing the expression of natural antioxidant enzymes, thereby mitigating oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Clinical trials have shown promising results, indicating that resveratrol supplementation can enhance antioxidant defenses and reduce oxidative damage markers in various populations. In addition to its antioxidant effects, resveratrol exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties. It can modulate key inflammatory pathways, such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), thereby suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Furthermore, resveratrol's multimodal effects extend beyond its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It has been discovered to exert regulatory effects on various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, and immunological responses. The primary aim of this review paper is to provide a thorough overview of the current knowledge on resveratrol, including its chemical composition, bioaccessibility, clinical effectiveness, and utilization in nanotechnology to enhance its bioavailability. From future perspectives, revising the administration methods for certain contexts and understanding the underlying systems responsible for resveratrol's effects will require further inquiry. For the highest potential health results, advanced trial-based research is necessary for combinational nano-delivery of resveratrol.
