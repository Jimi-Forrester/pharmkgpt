34940549|t|Gold Nanoparticles: Biosynthesis and Potential of Biomedical Application.
34940549|a|Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are extremely promising objects for solving a wide range of biomedical problems. The gold nanoparticles production by biological method ("green synthesis") is eco-friendly and allows minimization of the amount of harmful chemical and toxic byproducts. This review is devoted to the AuNPs biosynthesis peculiarities using various living organisms (bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants). The participation of various biomolecules in the AuNPs synthesis and the influence of size, shapes, and capping agents on the functionalities are described. The proposed action mechanisms on target cells are highlighted. The biological activities of "green" AuNPs (antimicrobial, anticancer, antiviral, etc.) and the possibilities of their further biomedical application are also discussed.
