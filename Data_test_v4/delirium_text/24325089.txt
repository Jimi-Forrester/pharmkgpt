It is especially important for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), when decrease of body mass, resulting in malnutrition. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was the assessment of the quality of diet of AD individuals living at homes and in nursing homes, in comparison with a control group MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the study participated 160 individuals with and without AD, living at home or in nursing homes. Assessment of diet of individuals living at homes was based on self-reported data from one-day dietary recall. Assessment of diet of individuals living in nursing homes was based on one-day menu from nursing homes accompanied by information about snacking between meals. The diets were assessed on the basis of qualitative meal classification method of Bieliiska and Kulesza. RESULTS: Individuals living in nursing homes consumed meals more often than living at homes, while AD did not have any impact on it. Individuals consuming fruits and vegetables not often enough were in all the groups, however, in case of individuals living at homes it was serious problem. Consuming animal products to almost all main meals was observed in case of many individuals in all analyzed groups. Composition of majority of main meals and small amount of lunches and afternoon snacks was rational. CONCLUSIONS: Improperly balanced diet following observed not only in a group of AD individuals but also of ones without dementia (both living at homes and in nursing homes), may result in dietary deficiencies.
