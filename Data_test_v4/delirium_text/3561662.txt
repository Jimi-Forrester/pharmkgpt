3561662|t|CSF and serum concentrations of albumin and IgG in Alzheimer's disease.
3561662|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum concentrations of albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were measured in 31 patients with presumptive Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in 14 healthy control subjects. The albumin and IgG quotients, and IgG index were calculated to evaluate the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and the intrathecal production of immunoglobulins. X-ray computerized tomography (CT) of the head was performed to investigate the relation between cerebral atrophy and CSF protein concentrations. The albumin and IgG quotients, and the IgG index did not differ significantly between the AD and control groups. Cerebral atrophy, as measured by CSF volume, was not related to CSF protein concentrations in either group. The results do not support the hypothesized roles of blood-brain barrier disruption or of immunologically-mediated injury of the central nervous system in the pathogenesis of AD.
