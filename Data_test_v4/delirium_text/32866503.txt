32866503|a|The complications of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have made the development of its treatment a challenging task. Several studies have indicated the disruption of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) signaling during the development and progression of AD. The role of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor on hippocampal IRS-1 signaling has not been investigated before. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of alogliptin (DPP-4 inhibitor) on hippocampal insulin resistance and associated AD complications. In the present study, amyloid-beta (1-42) fibrils were produced and administered intrahippocampally for inducing AD in Wistar rats. After 7 days of surgery, rats were treated with 10 and 20 mg/kg of alogliptin for 28 days. Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed in the last week of our experimental study. Post 24 h of final treatment, rats were euthanized and hippocampi were separated for biochemical and histopathological investigations. In-silico analysis revealed that alogliptin has a good binding affinity with Abeta and beta-secretase-1 (BACE-1). Alogliptin significantly restored cognitive functions in Abeta (1-42) fibrils injected rats during the MWM test. Alogliptin also significantly attenuated insulin level, IRS-1pS307 expression, Abeta (1-42) level, GSK-3beta activity, TNF-alpha level and oxidative stress in the hippocampus. The histopathological analysis supported alogliptin mediated neuroprotective and anti-amyloidogenic effect. Immunohistochemical analysis also revealed a reduction in IRS-1pS307 expression after alogliptin treatment. The in-silico, behavioral, biochemical and histopathological analysis supports the protective effect of alogliptin against hippocampal insulin resistance and AD.
