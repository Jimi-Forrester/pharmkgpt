30968171|a|BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients may have a negative impact not only on patients themselves but also on the physical and mental health of their caregivers. Detailed analysis of these issues is lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the association between sleep disturbance in AD patients and the burden on, and health status of, their caregivers in Japan. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional web-based questionnaire survey among caregivers of AD patients with insomnia symptoms in Japan. Demographic data and Sleep Disorders Inventory (SDI) scores for patients, caregiver burden (Burden Index of Caregivers-11 [BIC-11]) and health status, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and 12-Item Short Form Health Survey v2, were collected. Multivariate analysis was used to examine the association between the burden and health status of caregivers and sleep disturbance in their care recipients with AD. RESULTS: A total of 496 caregivers of AD patients with insomnia symptoms were examined in this study. We found that the BIC-11 total score increased as the SDI score increased, indicating a significant positive association, even after adjusting for confounding factors. We also found an association between sleep disturbances of AD patients and health of caregivers (sleep quality, depression, and physical/mental quality of life). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that sleep disturbance in AD patients was associated with an increased burden and poorer health status of caregivers. Our findings highlight the importance of sleep management in AD patients.
