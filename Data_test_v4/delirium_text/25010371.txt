25010371|t|Clinical applications of PET/MRI: current status and future perspectives.
25010371|a|Fully integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners have been available for a few years. Since then, the number of scanner installations and published studies have been growing. While feasibility of integrated PET/MRI has been demonstrated for many clinical and preclinical imaging applications, now those applications where PET/MRI provides a clear benefit in comparison to the established reference standards need to be identified. The current data show that those particular applications demanding multiparametric imaging capabilities, high soft tissue contrast and/or lower radiation dose seem to benefit from this novel hybrid modality. Promising results have been obtained in whole-body cancer staging in non-small cell lung cancer and multiparametric tumor imaging. Furthermore, integrated PET/MRI appears to have added value in oncologic applications requiring high soft tissue contrast such as assessment of liver metastases of neuroendocrine tumors or prostate cancer imaging. Potential benefit of integrated PET/MRI has also been demonstrated for cardiac (i.e., myocardial viability, cardiac sarcoidosis) and brain (i.e., glioma grading, Alzheimer's disease) imaging, where MRI is the predominant modality. The lower radiation dose compared to PET/computed tomography will be particularly valuable in the imaging of young patients with potentially curable diseases.However, further clinical studies and technical innovation on scanner hard- and software are needed. Also, agreements on adequate refunding of PET/MRI examinations need to be reached. Finally, the translation of new PET tracers from preclinical evaluation into clinical applications is expected to foster the entire field of hybrid PET imaging, including PET/MRI.
