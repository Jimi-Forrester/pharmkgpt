10414607|a|Although heavy alcohol intake is known to be one of the most common causative factors of liver disease, pancreatitis, upper gastrointestinal and neurological disorders, the influence of the drinking pattern is largely unknown. The study investigated the relationship of alcohol-related medical disorders in alcoholics and their drinking pattern. Two hundred and forty-one chronic alcoholics were referred consecutively for detoxification and their drinking pattern was sufficient for them to be included in this study. History of alcohol abuse as well as drinking behaviour in the last 6 months were assessed by a semi-structured interview. Findings included intensive clinical examination with abdominal ultrasound in most subjects. Heavy drinking with frequent inebriation was most often found in our sample (44.4%), whereas continuous heavy alcohol consumption without intoxication (33.6%), and an episodic drinking style (22.0%) were less frequent. The heavy drinkers suffered more often from pancreatitis, oesophageal varices, polyneuropathy or erectile dysfunction than episodic drinkers. They also showed more upper gastrointestinal disorders, although the estimated life-time alcohol intake was comparable to continuous drinkers. No difference relating to withdrawal delirium or seizures could be found between the groups of alcoholics. Frequent heavy drinkers showed a trend to more alcohol-related medical disorders than alcoholics with a different drinking pattern, although they were younger and their estimated life-time alcohol intake was comparable to that of continuous drinkers. Thus, the drinking pattern, particularly frequent inebriation, has an influence on the occurrence of alcohol-related disorders.
