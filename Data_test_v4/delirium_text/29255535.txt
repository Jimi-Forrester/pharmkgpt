29255535|a|Acute symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is usually managed by intravenous heparin and oral warfarin. Recently, direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have been introduced for the treatment of acute DVT. DOAC may be useful for very elderly patients who live in rural areas, where medical resources are limited. An 83-year-old woman presented to our clinic with left leg edema. Contrast enhanced computed tomography showed massive deep vein thrombosis in her left internal iliac vein. We diagnosed her with acute deep vein thrombosis. Since she refused to be hospitalized, we treated her with rivaroxaban as an outpatient. She had a good clinical course without hospitalization or an adverse event. DOAC may be useful for very elderly patients in rural areas.
