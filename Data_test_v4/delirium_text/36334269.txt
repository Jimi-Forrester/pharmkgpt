36334269|t|Disease specific and nonspecific metabolic brain networks in behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia.
36334269|a|Behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is common among young-onset dementia patients. While bvFTD-specific multivariate metabolic brain pattern (bFDRP) has been identified previously, little is known about its temporal evolution, internal structure, effect of atrophy, and its relationship with nonspecific resting-state networks such as default mode network (DMN). In this multicenter study, we explored FDG-PET brain scans of 111 bvFTD, 26 Alzheimer's disease, 16 Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, 24 semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (PPA), 18 nonfluent variant PPA and 77 healthy control subjects (HC) from Slovenia, USA, and Germany. bFDRP was identified in a cohort of 20 bvFTD patients and age-matched HC using scaled subprofile model/principle component analysis and validated in three independent cohorts. It was characterized by hypometabolism in frontal cortex, insula, anterior/middle cingulate, caudate, thalamus, and temporal poles. Its expression in bvFTD patients was significantly higher compared to HC and other dementia syndromes (p < .0004), correlated with cognitive decline (p = .0001), and increased over time in longitudinal cohort (p = .0007). Analysis of internal network organization by graph-theory methods revealed prominent network disruption in bvFTD patients. We have further found a specific atrophy-related pattern grossly corresponding to bFDRP; however, its contribution to the metabolic pattern was minimal. Finally, despite the overlap between bFDRP and FDG-PET-derived DMN, we demonstrated a predominant role of the specific bFDRP. Taken together, we validated the bFDRP network as a diagnostic/prognostic biomarker specific for bvFTD, provided a unique insight into its highly reproducible internal structure, and proved that bFDRP is unaffected by structural atrophy and independent of normal resting state networks loss.
