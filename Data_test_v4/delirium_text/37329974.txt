37329974|a|The onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are influenced by a variety of factors. These include oxidative stress, overexpression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), depletion of acetylcholine levels, increased beta-secretase mediated conversion of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) to Amyloid Beta (Abeta), accumulation of Abeta oligomers, decrease in Brain Derived Neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and accelerated neuronal apoptosis due to elevated levels of caspase-3. The currently available therapeutic approaches are inadequate in affecting these pathological processes except maybe the overexpression of AChE (AChE inhibitors like donepezil, rivastigmine). There is an urgent need to develop disease modifying pharmacotherapeutic interventions which have appreciable safety and cost effectiveness. From previously reported in vitro studies and a preliminary assessment of neuroprotective effect in scopolamine induced dementia-like cognitive impairment in mice, vanillin has been used as the compound of interest in the present study. Vanillin, a phytoconstituent, has been used in humans, safely, in the form of a flavouring agent for various foods, beverages, and cosmetics. Owing to its chemical nature i.e. being a phenolic aldehyde, it has an additional antioxidant property that is congruent to the desirable characteristics that are sought in a suitable novel anti-AD agent. In our study, vanillin proved to have a nootropic effect in healthy Swiss albino mice as well as an ameliorative effect in aluminium chloride and D-galactose induced AD model in mice. Apart from tackling oxidative stress, vanillin was found to reduce the levels of AChE, beta secretase, caspase-3, enhance degradation of Abeta plaques and elevate the levels of BDNF, in cortical and hippocampal regions. Vanillin is a promising candidate for being incorporated into the search for safe and effective anti-AD molecules. However, further research might be needed to warrant its application clinically.
