33959452|t|Recurrent Concurrent Diabetic Ketoacidosis and Thyroid Storm.
33959452|a|Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and thyroid storm are serious complications of underlying disease states. Either condition can induce the other, and the co-occurrence of these conditions is uncommon. We present the case of an adolescent patient with type 1 diabetes and autoimmune hypothyroidism who developed recurrent concurrent DKA and thyroid storm twice in an eight-month period. The simultaneous development of DKA and thyroid storm is uncommon with only 28 cases previously reported. Co-presentation of these two life-threatening conditions occurs in people with either preexisting diabetes, thyroid disease, or both. The purported pathophysiology of how DKA and thyroid storm affect the other is discussed.
