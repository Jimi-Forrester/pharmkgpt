38936412|a|BACKGROUND: Frailty is independently associated with adverse patient outcomes after surgery. The current standards of postoperative care rarely consider frailty status. LOCAL PROBLEM: There was no standardized protocol to optimize specialized postoperative care for frail patients at an academic medical center. METHODS: A quasi-experimental pre-/postimplementation study design, using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance implementation framework, was utilized. INTERVENTIONS: A frailty-specific postoperative order set (FPOS) was developed, including tailored nursing care, activity levels, and nutritional goals. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in nurse's self-reported familiarity with frailty (P = .003) and FPOS awareness (P < .001). The number of orders for delirium prevention, elimination, nutrition, sleep promotion, and sensory support increased (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Implementing an FPOS showed improvements in nurse frailty knowledge, awareness, and order set utilization.
