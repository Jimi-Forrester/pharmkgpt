35206883|t|A Survey on Treatment Status of Korean Medicine Doctors for the Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia: Preliminary Data for Guidance of Integrative Care.
35206883|a|Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are major causes of care burden in patients with dementia. Integrative care, including Western medicine (WM) and Korean medicine (KM), can be an attractive option for this condition. To investigate the experience and perceptions of dementia care; experience, knowledge, and perceptions of management for BPSD; the need for guidance of integrative care for BPSD management, KM doctors were surveyed. A total of 137 KM doctors completed the survey. Most institutions where the participants worked were able to provide integrative care services (88.32%). The rate of referral for dementia patients from the WM to KM departments was also highest in the convalescent hospital setting (94.92%), while the rate was lowest in the public health center setting (38.46%). The common purpose of KM treatments for patients with dementia included "psychological symptom treatment" (37.23%); however, the number of referrals from WM to KM departments for BPSD management was relatively few (25.64%). Participants perceived that knowledge about KM or integrative care for BPSD of non-KMD personnel working at the same institution was generally low. Based on these results, facilitating mutual exchange between WM and KM can help establish integrative care for dementia management in Korea.
