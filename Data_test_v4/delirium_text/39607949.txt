39607949|t|Covalent Organic Framework as Selective Fluorescence Sensors for Cancer Inducing Volatile Organic Compounds.
39607949|a|Certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as formaldehyde, acetone, and ethanol, are overexpressed in some terminal diseases like cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, etc. Therefore, high-precision detection and quantification of VOCs is imperative for early diagnosis of such detrimental diseases. Non-invasive and accurate fluorescence-based detection of such analytes has garnered widespread attention. The inherent luminescent properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), resulting from their extensive pi-conjugation, have made them suitable for sensing applications. Structural tunability and strong covalent linkers facilitate sensing by COFs. Appropriate choices of linker and skeletal units of the COF can help detect various biologically important analytes selectively. The most common linkers used in this regard is the imine linker, which can undergo excellent hydrogen bonding with different protic VOCs e.g., ethanol, methanol, etc. Besides imine detection, hydrogen bonding also proved useful for detection of aldehydes. Suitable combinations of donors and acceptors enable the COFs to have specific charge transfer interactions with many electron-rich and electron-poor VOCs. In this review, we have highlighted the syntheses of selective COFs incorporating linkers designed for sensing cancer-inducing VOCs. A detailed discussion of the interaction mechanisms between COFs and these VOCs is provided, along with examples from recent literature in this field.
