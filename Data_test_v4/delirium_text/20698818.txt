20698818|t|Cell death targets and potential modulators in Alzheimer's disease.
20698818|a|Apoptosis is now recognized as a normal feature in the development of the nervous system and may also play a role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Cell surface receptors, caspases, mitochondrial factors or p53 participate in the modulation and execution of cell death. Therefore, the ability to understand and manipulate the cell death machinery is an obvious goal of medical research. Potential therapeutic approaches to modulate disease by regulating apoptosis are being tested, and include the traditional use of small molecules to target specific players in the apoptosis cascade. As our understanding of apoptosis increases, further opportunities will arise for more specific therapies that will result in improved efficacy. This review focuses on molecular mechanisms of apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease and highlights the potential use of small molecule modulators to treat neurodegenerative disorders.
