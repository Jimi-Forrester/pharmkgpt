28912445|t|Cofilin-mediated Neuronal Apoptosis via p53 Translocation and PLD1 Regulation.
28912445|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation is an early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction, tau accumulation, and eventual neuronal death. While the p53 apoptotic pathway has clearly been associated with Abeta deposits and neuronal apoptosis, the critical upstream factors contributing to p53 activation in AD are not well understood. We have previously shown that cofilin activation plays a pivotal role in Abeta-induced mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction. In this study, we show that activated cofilin (S3A) preferentially forms a complex with p53 and promotes its mitochondrial and nuclear localization, resulting in transcription of p53-responsive genes and promotion of apoptosis. Conversely, reduction of endogenous cofilin by knockdown or genetic deficiency inhibits mitochondrial and nuclear translocation of p53 in cultured cells and in APP/PS1 mice. This cofilin-p53 pro-apoptotic pathway is subject to negative regulation by PLD1 thorough cofilin inactivation and inhibition of cofilin/p53 complex formation. Finally, activated cofilin is unable to induce apoptosis in cells genetically lacking p53. These findings taken together indicate that cofilin coopts and requires the nuclear and mitochondrial pro-apoptotic p53 program to induce and execute apoptosis, while PLD1 functions in a regulatory multi-brake capacity in this pathway.
