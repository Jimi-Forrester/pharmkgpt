1922919|t|A quantitative study of the coincidence of blood vessels and A4 protein deposits in Alzheimer's disease.
1922919|a|The spatial relationship between A4 protein deposits and blood vessels in the brains of 6 elderly cases of Alzheimer's disease has been investigated. Sections were taken from medial temporal cortex and were double immunostained for A4 protein and type IV collagen, the latter being employed as a marker of blood vessels. By comparing the observed area of vessel overlying A4 deposit with that predicted from the product of A4 deposit and blood vessel area fractions it is shown that, contrary to expectations, the likelihood of a vessel co-inciding with an A4 deposit is less than would be expected by chance. It would therefore appear that the previously described positive association between A4 deposits and blood vessels reflects the abundance of A4 and the high vascularity of the cortex rather than any specific correlation between the two features.
