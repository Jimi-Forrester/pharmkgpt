36605176|t|Practical Guidance for the Use of Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotics in the Treatment of Schizophrenia.
36605176|a|Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness causing a high degree of disability. First- and second-generation antipsychotics (FGAs and SGAs) represent key resources for its acute and long-term management. Since a poor adherence to oral treatments may negatively impact the course of the disorder, long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) are often used to reduce clinical relapses. Notwithstanding their potential beneficial features, LAIs use in clinical practice remains somewhat hampered by the limited amount of relevant systematic information. This review thus aims at providing a clinical, practical guidance for the use of LAIs in the treatment of schizophrenia. We synthetized main information on indications, dosage, and administration of LAIs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or in EU countries, as well as evidence from the most recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Currently available information, though heterogeneous, shows that LAIs can prevent relapses and rehospitalizations, improving clinical outcomes and favouring sustained remission among people with schizophrenia. The use of SGA LAIs is supported by more robust evidence than FGA LAIs. Along with their positive impact on the prevention of treatment discontinuation, some LAIs might also enhance individual global functioning and quality of life, without additional adverse events or health-care costs, as compared with oral antipsychotics. Although which LAIs can be considered a first-choice option, as well as their superiority over oral antipsychotics, remain unclear issues, this review offers a comprehensive overview of information available on the use of LAIs for people with schizophrenia, providing clinicians with practical guidance in terms of efficacy and acceptability of single agents. Literature gaps and future research needs are also described.
