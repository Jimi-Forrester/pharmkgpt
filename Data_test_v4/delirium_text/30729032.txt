30729032|a|Although conventional genetic modification approaches for protein knockdown work very successfully due to the increasing use of CRISPR/Cas9, effective techniques for achieving protein depletion in adult animals, especially in large animals such as non-human primates, are lacking. Here, we report a chemical approach based on PROTACs technology that efficiently and quickly knocks down FKBP12 (12-kDa FK506-binding) protein globally in vivo. Both intraperitoneal and oral administration led to rapid, robust, and reversible FKBP12 degradation in mice. The efficiency and practicality of this method were successfully demonstrated in both large and small animals (mice, rats, Bama pigs, and rhesus monkeys). Furthermore, we showed this approach can also be applied to effectively knockdown other target proteins such as Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). This chemical protein knockdown strategy provides a powerful research tool for gene function studies in animals, particularly in large animals, for which gene-targeted knockout strategies may remain unfeasible.
