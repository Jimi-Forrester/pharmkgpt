29203867|t|Sensory Stream Adaptation in Chaotic Networks.
29203867|a|Implicit expectations induced by predictable stimuli sequences affect neuronal response to upcoming stimuli at both single cell and neural population levels. Temporally regular sensory streams also phase entrain ongoing low frequency brain oscillations but how and why this happens is unknown. Here we investigate how random recurrent neural networks without plasticity respond to stimuli streams containing oddballs. We found the neuronal correlates of sensory stream adaptation emerge if networks generate chaotic oscillations which can be phase entrained by stimulus streams. The resultant activity patterns are close to critical and support history dependent response on long timescales. Because critical network entrainment is a slow process stimulus response adapts gradually over multiple repetitions. Repeated stimuli generate suppressed responses but oddball responses are large and distinct. Oscillatory mismatch responses persist in population activity for long periods after stimulus offset while individual cell mismatch responses are strongly phasic. These effects are weakened in temporally irregular sensory streams. Thus we show that network phase entrainment provides a biologically plausible mechanism for neural oddball detection. Our results do not depend on specific network characteristics, are consistent with experimental studies and may be relevant for multiple pathologies demonstrating altered mismatch processing such as schizophrenia and depression.
