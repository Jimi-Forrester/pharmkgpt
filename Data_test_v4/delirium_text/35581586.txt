35581586|a|Cancer is a type of malignant affliction threatening human health worldwide; however, the molecular mechanism of cancer pathogenesis remains to be elusive. The oncogenic hedgehog (Hh) pathway is a highly evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway in which the hedgehog-Patched complex is internalized to cellular lysosomes for degradation, resulting in the release of Smoothened inhibition and producing downstream intracellular signals. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) with diversified regulatory functions have the potency of controlling cellular processes. Compelling evidence reveals that Hh pathway, ncRNAs, or their crosstalk play complicated roles in the initiation, metastasis, apoptosis and drug resistance of cancer, allowing ncRNAs related to the Hh pathway to serve as clinical biomarkers for targeted cancer therapy. In this review, we attempt to depict the multiple patterns of ncRNAs in the progression of malignant tumors via interactions with the Hh crucial elements in order to better understand the complex regulatory mechanism, and focus on Hh associated ncRNA therapeutics aimed at boosting their application in the clinical setting.
