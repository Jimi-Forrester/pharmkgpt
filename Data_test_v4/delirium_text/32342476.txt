32342476|a|Various neuropsychiatric conditions, such as depression, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, demonstrate evidence of impaired long-term potentiation, a cellular correlate of episodic memory function. This chapter discusses the mechanistic effects of these neuropsychiatric conditions on long-term potentiation and how exercise may help to attenuate these detrimental effects.
