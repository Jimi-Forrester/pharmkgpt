31767918|t|Mass Spectrometry Imaging of Lipids in Human Skin Disease Model Hidradenitis Suppurativa by Laser Desorption Ionization from Silicon Nanopost Arrays.
31767918|a|Neutral lipids have been implicated in a host of potentially debilitating human diseases, such as heart disease, type-2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), the method-of-choice for mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), has led to remarkable success in imaging several lipid classes from biological tissue sections. However, due to ion suppression by phospholipids, MALDI has limited ability to efficiently ionize and image neutral lipids, such as triglycerides (TGs). To help overcome this obstacle, we have utilized silicon nanopost arrays (NAPA), a matrix-free laser desorption ionization (LDI) platform. Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, recurrent inflammatory skin disease of the apocrine sweat glands. The ability of NAPA to efficiently ionize lipids is exploited in the analysis of human skin samples from sufferers of HS. Ionization by LDI from NAPA allows for the detection and imaging of a number of neutral lipid species, including TGs comprised of shorter, odd-chain fatty acids, which strongly suggests an increased bacterial load within the host tissue, as well as hexosylceramides (HexCers) and galabiosyl-/lactosylceramides that appear to be correlated with the presence of HS. Our results demonstrate that NAPA-LDI-MSI is capable of imaging and potentially differentiating healthy and diseased human skin tissues based on changes in detected neutral lipid composition.
