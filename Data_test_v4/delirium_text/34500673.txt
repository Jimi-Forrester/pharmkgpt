34500673|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disease recognized as the most common form of dementia among elderly people. Due to the fact that the exact pathogenesis of AD still remains to be fully elucidated, the treatment is only symptomatic and available drugs are not able to modify AD progression. Considering the increase in life expectancy worldwide, AD rates are predicted to increase enormously, and thus the search for new AD drugs is urgently needed. Due to their complex nitrogen-containing structures, alkaloids are considered to be promising candidates for use in the treatment of AD. Since the introduction of galanthamine as an antidementia drug in 2001, Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (AAs) and further isoquinoline alkaloids (IAs) have been one of the most studied groups of alkaloids. In the last few years, several compounds of new structure types have been isolated and evaluated for their biological activity connected with AD. The present review aims to comprehensively summarize recent progress on AAs and IAs since 2010 up to June 2021 as potential drugs for the treatment of AD.
