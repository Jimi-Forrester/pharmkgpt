36238138|a|Purpose: To explore the occurrence and risk factors of intraoperative hypotension during children's Marfan syndrome scoliosis surgery and summarize the associated hemodynamic features and handle measures. Methods: Twenty-two Marfan syndrome scoliosis patients who underwent spinal surgery at Beijing Children's Hospital were retrospectively reviewed between January 2001 and January 2020. Intraoperative hypotension is defined as the minimum mean arterial pressure <= 60 mm Hg. The patients were divided into the hypotension group and the control group. Clinical, radiographic, and operative data were compared between the two groups. The risk factors, hemodynamic features, and handle measures for intraoperative hypotension in Marfan syndrome scoliosis surgery were analyzed and summarized. Results: Twenty-two patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 11.4 years at initial surgery. The follow-up period ranged from 24 to 152 months. Intraoperative hypotension occurred in 14 cases, with an incidence of 63.6%. The proportion of pulmonary dysfunction in the hypotension group was higher than in the control group (100.0% vs 50.0%, p < 0.05). The spinal flexibility was significantly lower in the hypotension group (28.3% +- 14.2% vs 46.5% +- 11.5%, p < 0.05). Fourteen patients with intraoperative hypotension had decreased intraoperative systolic blood pressure 21.0%-50.0% compared with baseline. One patient had a transient decrease in the muscle strength of the lower limbs. No complications were observed during the follow-up. Conclusion: The incidence of intraoperative hypotension in Marfan syndrome scoliosis children who underwent surgery was 63.6%. The risk factors included preoperative pulmonary dysfunction and poor spinal flexibility. Comprehensive preoperative evaluation and effective hemodynamic handling measures should be undertaken to prevent further complications in children with Marfan syndrome scoliosis.
