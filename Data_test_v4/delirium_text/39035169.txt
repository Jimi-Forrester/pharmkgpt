39035169|a|Background: Allicin, a bioactive compound derived from garlic (Allium sativum), demonstrates antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria including the most common meningitis pathogens. In order to advocate for allicin as a potential therapeutic candidate for bacterial meningitis, the present study aimed to assess the ability of allicin to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) using an in vitro model. Methods: The cell viability of the human brain endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 after incubation with various concentrations of allicin was investigated using an MTT assay at 3 and 24 h. Additionally, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of allicin-treated hCMEC/D3 cells was examined at 3 h. The concentrations of allicin that were not toxic to the cells, as determined by the MTT assay, and did not significantly increase ROS generation, were then used to investigate allicin's ability to traverse the in vitro BBB model for 3 h. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was utilized to examine the allicin concentration capable of passing the in vitro BBB model. The cellular uptake experiments were subsequently performed to observe the uptake of allicin into hCMEC/D3 cells. The pkCSM online tool was used to predict the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and pharmacokinetic properties of allicin and S-allylmercaptoglutathione (GSSA). Results: The results from MTT assay indicated that the highest non-toxicity concentration of allicin on hCMEC/D3 cells was 5 microg/ml at 3 h and 2 microg/ml at 24 h. Allicin significantly enhanced ROS production of hCMEC/D3 cells at 10 microg/ml at 3 h. After applying the non-toxicity concentrations of allicin (0.5-5 microg/ml) to the in vitro BBB model for 3 h, allicin was not detectable in both apical and basolateral chambers in the presence of hCMEC/D3 cells. On the contrary, allicin was detected in both chambers in the absence of the cells. The results from cellular uptake experiments at 3 h revealed that hCMEC/D3 cells at 1 x 104 cells could uptake allicin at concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2 microg/ml. Moreover, allicin uptake of hCMEC/D3 cells was proportional to the cell number, and the cells at 5 x 104 could completely uptake allicin at a concentration of 5 microg/ml within 0.5 h. The topological polar surface area (TPSA) predicting for allicin was determined to be 62.082 A2, indicating its potential ability to cross the BBB. Additionally, the calculated logBB value surpassing 0.3 suggests that the compound may exhibit ease of penetration through the BBB. Conclusion: The present results suggested that allicin was rapidly taken up by hCMEC/D3 cells in vitro BBB model. The prediction results of allicin's distribution patterns suggested that the compound possesses the capability to enter the brain.
