11940980|a|The indications for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are focused on one or a few treated subpopulations. We retrospectively reviewed all ECT treatment series in 1984 in Aarhus Psychiatric Hospital, Risskov, Denmark. Patients with diagnoses other than endogenous depression were successfully treated with ECT. The diagnoses included mania, manic-depressive mixed states, acute exacerbations in schizophrenia, reactive psychosis and delirium, most of whom were in a very severe condition. This experience is described.
