38659717|t|Alzheimer's disease drug development pipeline: 2024.
38659717|a|INTRODUCTION: New therapies to prevent or delay the onset of symptoms, slow progression, or improve cognitive and behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are needed. METHODS: We interrogated clinicaltrials.gov including all clinical trials assessing pharmaceutical therapies for AD active in on January 1, 2024. We used the Common Alzheimer's Disease Research Ontology (CADRO) to classify the targets of therapies in the pipeline. RESULTS: There are 164 trials assessing 127 drugs across the 2024 AD pipeline. There were 48 trials in Phase 3 testing 32 drugs, 90 trials in Phase 2 assessing 81 drugs, and 26 trials in Phase 1 testing 25 agents. Of the 164 trials, 34% (N = 56) assess disease-modifying biological agents, 41% (N = 68) test disease-modifying small molecule drugs, 10% (N = 17) evaluate cognitive enhancing agents, and 14% (N = 23) test drugs for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms. DISCUSSION: Compared to the 2023 pipeline, there are fewer trials (164 vs. 187), fewer drugs (127 vs. 141), fewer new chemical entities (88 vs. 101), and a similar number of repurposed agents (39 vs. 40). Highlights: In the 2024 Alzheimer's disease drug development pipeline, there are 164 clinical trials assessing 127 drugs.The 2024 Alzheimer's disease drug development pipeline has contracted compared to the 2023 Alzheimer pipeline with fewer trials, fewer drugs, and fewer new chemical entities.Drugs in the Alzheimer's disease drug development pipeline target a wide array of targets; the most common processes targeted include neurotransmitter receptors, inflammation, amyloid, and synaptic plasticity.The total development time for a potential Alzheimer's disease therapy to progress from nonclinical studies to FDA review is approximately 13 years.
