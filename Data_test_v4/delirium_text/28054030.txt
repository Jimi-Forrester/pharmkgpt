28054030|t|Prospective associations of plasma phospholipids and mild cognitive impairment/dementia among African Americans in the ARIC Neurocognitive Study.
28054030|a|INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to investigate whether 10 phospholipids/metabolites previously identified as prospectively predictive of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in whites would also be predictive in a mostly African-American cohort. METHODS: We repeatedly measured 188 phospholipids/metabolites in plasma samples of 221 participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, 97% African American, who were followed between 2004-2006 and 2011-2013. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 7.3 years, 77 were classified as having MCI and 18 as having dementia. Our study failed to replicate previous findings in this mostly African American cohort, in that the 10 phospholipids/metabolites only achieved a C statistic/AUC of 0.609 in predicting development of MCI or dementia (compared to 0.96) and 0.607 in distinguishing normal from MCI or dementia at the follow-up visit. CONCLUSION: A panel of 10 phospholipids/metabolites previously associated with incident dementia was not predictive of MCI or dementia in an independent cohort.
