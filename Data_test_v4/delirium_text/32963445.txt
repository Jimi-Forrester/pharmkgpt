32963445|t|A Unique Case of Arterial Thrombosis and Recurrent CVA in ICU: Unfathomable Presentation of an Occult Malignancy.
32963445|a|INTRODUCTION: Critically ill patients may present with prothrombotic manifestations. Carcinoma cervix with prothrombotic manifestations are not common. Arterial thrombosis in such cases is very rare. We present a case of carcinoma cervix which posed a diagnostic dilemma and difficulty in localizing primary. This patient also had recurrent strokes and cardiac metastasis with metastatic arterial thrombosis. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34-year-old lady presented with a history of acute lower limb ischemia and recurrent strokes. Transthoracic echocardiography showed valvular vegetations. Prothrombotic and infective endocarditis workup were negative. Histopathological examination (HPE) of clot showed metastatic squamous cells. Contrast CT of chest and abdomen only showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with mediastinal lymph node biopsy showed metastatic squamous cells. As the patient gave a history of hysterectomy, Pap smear from the vault was sent, which was suggestive of high grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia. Palliative chemotherapy was started. The patient made a good recovery and was discharged home in a stable condition. CONCLUSION: Arterial thrombosis is an uncommon manifestation of occult malignancy. Carcinoma cervix usually does not metastasize to heart, brain, and arteries, which was the case in our patient. A high index of suspicion and systematic evaluation can clinch the diagnosis even when rare complications of malignancy are presented by critically ill patients. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Any unprovoked thrombotic episodes should be extensively worked up for occult malignancies. We present a case demonstrating challenges faced by critical care physicians and benefits of methodical evaluation when confronted with unusual presentation of a malignancy.
