36081959|a|Introduction Sub-dissociative ketamine has been used increasingly for the treatment of acute pain in a wide variety of settings. While there are studies evaluating its use in the geriatric population, no studies have described its safety in the pre-hospital geriatric trauma patient. The objective of this study was to define the incidence of dissociation with low-dose pre-hospital ketamine in geriatric trauma patients. Methods Using our county emergency medical services database, we identified all trauma patients greater or equal to 65 years of age who received pre-hospital ketamine for pain after the implementation of a low-dose ketamine protocol. We retrospectively reviewed pre-hospital and emergency department records for demographics, traumatic injuries, Glasgow Coma Score, emergency department length of stay and disposition, and hospital length of stay. This group was compared to a similar population of trauma patients, transported prior to the ketamine protocol. The comparison group was chosen by matching the ketamine group to more than double the number of non-ketamine patients. Records were obtained from two separate trauma centers. Our primary outcome was documentation of "ketamine-related dissociation" by either the pre-hospital, emergency department or trauma provider. Secondary outcomes included emergency department length of stay and intensive care unit admission. Results Seventy-nine patients received ketamine with records available for analysis. One hundred ninety-three non-ketamine patients were compared to this group. There were nosignificant differences between the two groups in regards to age, weight, gender, or mechanism of injury. The injury severity score was higher in the ketamine group. Nine patients (11%) had documented dissociation after ketamine, with six of these patients back to baseline mentation by arrival to the emergency department. The emergency department length of stay was shorter in the ketamine group. The rate of intensive care unit admission was the same between both groups. Conclusions Pre-hospital sub-dissociative ketamine in geriatric trauma patients is associated with brief episodes of dissociation in a small minority of patients.
