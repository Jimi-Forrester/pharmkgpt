33252089|a|BACKGROUND: Fluid intelligence (FI) involves abstract problem-solving without prior knowledge. Greater age-related FI decline increases Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, and recent studies suggest that certain dietary regimens may influence rates of decline. However, it is uncertain how long-term food consumption affects FI among adults with or without familial history of AD (FH) or APOE4 (e4). OBJECTIVE: Observe how the total diet is associated with long-term cognition among mid- to late-life populations at-risk and not-at-risk for AD. METHODS: Among 1,787 mid-to-late-aged adult UK Biobank participants, 10-year FI trajectories were modeled and regressed onto the total diet based on self-reported intake of 49 whole foods from a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). RESULTS: Daily cheese intake strongly predicted better FIT scores over time (FH-: beta= 0.207, p < 0.001; e4-: beta= 0.073, p = 0.008; e4+: beta= 0.162, p = 0.001). Alcohol of any type daily also appeared beneficial (e4+: beta= 0.101, p = 0.022) and red wine was sometimes additionally protective (FH+: beta= 0.100, p = 0.014; e4-: beta= 0.59, p = 0.039). Consuming lamb weekly was associated with improved outcomes (FH-: beta= 0.066, p = 0.008; e4+: beta= 0.097, p = 0.044). Among at risk groups, added salt correlated with decreased performance (FH+: beta= -0.114, p = 0.004; e4+: beta= -0.121, p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Modifying meal plans may help minimize cognitive decline. We observed that added salt may put at-risk individuals at greater risk, but did not observe similar interactions among FH- and AD- individuals. Observations further suggest in risk status-dependent manners that adding cheese and red wine to the diet daily, and lamb on a weekly basis, may also improve long-term cognitive outcomes.
