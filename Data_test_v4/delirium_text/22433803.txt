22433803|a|The objective was to study efficacy and safety of ceraxon (citicoline) used perorally in dose 1000 mg daily in the treatment of cognitive disturbances in patients with amnesic type of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Twenty patients, aged from 50 to 90 years, received ceraxon in dose 1000 mg twice a day during 90 days. The state of patients was assessed with a battery of scales and tests with the following statistical data analysis. The significant results on the clinical effect of the drug on cognitive disturbances and good tolerability of ceraxon have been obtained. The authors recommend ceraxon for long-term preventive treatment in high risk populations for Alzheimer's disease.
