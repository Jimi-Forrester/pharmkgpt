37372995|t|Dementia in Diabetes: The Role of Hypoglycemia.
37372995|a|Hypoglycemia, a common consequence of diabetes treatment, is associated with severe morbidity and mortality and has become a major barrier to intensifying antidiabetic therapy. Severe hypoglycemia, defined as abnormally low blood glucose requiring the assistance of another person, is associated with seizures and comas, but even mild hypoglycemia can cause troubling symptoms such as anxiety, palpitations, and confusion. Dementia generally refers to the loss of memory, language, problem-solving, and other cognitive functions, which can interfere with daily life, and there is growing evidence that diabetes is associated with an increased risk of both vascular and non-vascular dementia. Neuroglycopenia resulting from a hypoglycemic episode in diabetic patients can lead to the degeneration of brain cells, with a resultant cognitive decline, leading to dementia. In light of new evidence, a deeper understating of the relationship between hypoglycemia and dementia can help to inform and guide preventative strategies. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of dementia among patients with diabetes, and the emerging mechanisms thought to underlie the association between hypoglycemia and dementia. Furthermore, we discuss the risks of various pharmacological therapies, emerging therapies to combat hypoglycemia-induced dementia, as well as risk minimization strategies.
