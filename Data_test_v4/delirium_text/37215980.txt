37215980|a|Inadequate osteogenesis and excessive adipogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are key factors in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have a higher incidence of osteoporosis than healthy adults, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. Here, we show that brain-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) from adult AD or wild-type mice can cross the blood-brain barrier to reach the distal bone tissue, while only AD brain-derived EVs (AD-B-EVs) significantly promote the shift of the BMSC differentiation fate from osteogenesis to adipogenesis and induce a bone-fat imbalance. MiR-483-5p is highly enriched in AD-B-EVs, brain tissues from AD mice, and plasma-derived EVs from AD patients. This miRNA mediates the anti-osteogenic, pro-adipogenic, and pro-osteoporotic effects of AD-B-EVs by inhibiting Igf2. This study identifies the role of B-EVs as a promoter of osteoporosis in AD by transferring miR-483-5p.
