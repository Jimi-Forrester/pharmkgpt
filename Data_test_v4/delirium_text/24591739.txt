24591739|t|Antioxidant and Anticholinesterase Activities in Various Parts of Sonneratia caseolaris (L.).
24591739|a|Cork tree, (Sonneratia caseolaris L.), family Sonneratiaceae, is a typical plant in mangroves. It is widespread in tropical and subtropical tideland throughout the World. It is reported to possess many medicinal properties. For searching new pharmacological activities of Cork tree, the total phenolic contents, antioxidant activities and the electric eel acetylcholinesterase inhibitions and the kinetics of extracts of various plant parts were determined. The graphs of trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity and ferric reducing antioxidant power of all extracts showed good linearity with P-value of slopes less than 0.05. The methanol extract of calyxs by maceration method and methanol extract of stamen by soxhlet method presented moderate trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity values. For ferric reducing antioxidant power assay, all extracts gave fair to low antioxidant activities. The tacrine, stamen extract and seed extract by maceration using methanol showed noncompetitive inhibition on acetylcholinesterase activity. While, luteolin, luteolin glycoside and calyx extract and seed extract by boiling using water presented partial noncompetitive inhibition on acetylcholinesterase activity.
