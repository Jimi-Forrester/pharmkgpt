30688276|t|Serum and cerebrospinal fluid tau protein level as biomarkers for evaluating acute spinal cord injury severity and motor function outcome.
30688276|a|Tau protein, a microtubule-associated protein, has a high specific expression in neurons and axons. Because traumatic spinal cord injury mainly affects neurons and axons, we speculated that tau protein may be a promising biomarker to reflect the degree of spinal cord injury and prognosis of motor function. In this study, 160 female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a sham group, and mild, moderate, and severe spinal cord injury groups. A laminectomy was performed at the T8 level to expose the spinal cord in all groups. A contusion lesion was made with the NYU-MASCIS impactor by dropping a 10 g rod from heights of 12.5 mm (mild), 25 mm (moderate) and 50 mm (severe) upon the exposed dorsal surface of the spinal cord. Tau protein levels were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples at 1, 6, 12, 24 hours, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after operation. Locomotor function of all rats was assessed using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale. Tau protein concentration in the three spinal cord injury groups (both in serum and cerebrospinal fluid) rapidly increased and peaked at 12 hours after spinal cord injury. Statistically significant positive linear correlations were found between tau protein level and spinal cord injury severity in the three spinal cord injury groups, and between the tau protein level and Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale scores. The tau protein level at 12 hours in the three spinal cord injury groups was negatively correlated with Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor rating scale scores at 28 days (serum: r = -0.94; cerebrospinal fluid: r = -0.95). Our data suggest that tau protein levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid might be a promising biomarker for predicting the severity and functional outcome of traumatic spinal cord injury.
