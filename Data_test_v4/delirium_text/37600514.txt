37600514|t|Current and future therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease: an overview of drug development bottlenecks.
37600514|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common chronic neurodegenerative disease worldwide. It causes cognitive dysfunction, such as aphasia and agnosia, and mental symptoms, such as behavioral abnormalities; all of which place a significant psychological and economic burden on the patients' families. No specific drugs are currently available for the treatment of AD, and the current drugs for AD only delay disease onset and progression. The pathophysiological basis of AD involves abnormal deposition of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta), abnormal tau protein phosphorylation, decreased activity of acetylcholine content, glutamate toxicity, autophagy, inflammatory reactions, mitochondria-targeting, and multi-targets. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved five drugs for clinical use: tacrine, donepezil, carbalatine, galantamine, memantine, and lecanemab. We have focused on the newer drugs that have undergone clinical trials, most of which have not been successful as a result of excessive clinical side effects or poor efficacy. Although aducanumab received rapid approval from the FDA on 7 June 2021, its long-term safety and tolerability require further monitoring and confirmation. In this literature review, we aimed to explore the possible pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the occurrence and development of AD. We focused on anti-Abeta and anti-tau drugs, mitochondria-targeting and multi-targets, commercially available drugs, bottlenecks encountered in drug development, and the possible targets and therapeutic strategies for future drug development. We hope to present new concepts and methods for future drug therapies for AD.
