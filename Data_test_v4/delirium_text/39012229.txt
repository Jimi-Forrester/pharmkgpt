Based on the fact that Alzheimer's disease is a disease with multiple etiologies and complex pathology, a single target is bound to have a limited curative effect, and the synergy of multiple links and multiple targets is expected to achieve a better curative effect. The aim of this study is to investigate the brain targeting of a drug modified by chitosan, based on the new nanodrug delivery system for treating Alzheimer's disease developed by the research group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chitosan with good biocompatibility, biosorption, and degradation products that can protect and promote the regeneration of nerve cells was selected to combine with galantamine, a natural representative cholinesterase inhibitor, to develop a new nano drug delivery system for nasal delivery of anti-Alzheimer's disease with a multi-target synergistic effect. Synchronous analysis was conducted on the blood and brain tissue drug concentrations after intravenous and nasal administration of the original drug solution and system solution. The brain targeting index (DTI) is used to evaluate the brain targeting effect of the nano-drug delivery system after intranasal administration. RESULTS: The blood concentration of galantamine original drug solution and galantamine system solution after intravenous injection and nasal show that in the two administration methods of intravenous injection and nasal administration, under the same administration method, the time point of the system reaching the highest blood drug concentration is much higher than that of the original drug. The content of galantamine in plasma samples and tissue samples indicate that after intravenous administration and intranasal administration of the galantamine system, at the same time point, the drug concentration in brain tissue was far greater than that of the original drug of galantamine, and the duration was also longer. The concentration of drugs in brain tissue decreased gradually in the order of olfactory bulb, olfactory tract, brain, and cerebellum. In the brain tissues of the olfactory bulb, olfactory tract, cerebrum, and cerebellum, the drug concentration of the galantamine system after intravenous injection is lower than that after nasal administration. CONCLUSIONS: This study concludes that compared with the original drug solution, the nano drug delivery system has significant brain targeting for nasal administration, and intravenous injection also has brain targeting. In the olfactory bulb, olfactory tract, brain, and cerebellum, the brain targeting index at the olfactory bulb is the highest, and the targeting is the best.
