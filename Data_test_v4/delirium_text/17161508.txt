17161508|a|Effects of APOE genotype on age-related slopes of cortical thinning was estimated by measuring the thickness of the cerebral cortex on a point-by-point basis across the cortical mantle in 96 healthy non-demented volunteers aged 48-75 years. Fifty nine were APOE epsilon 4- (no epsilon 4 allele) and 37 were epsilon 4+ (1 or 2 epsilon 4 alleles). The genotype groups had similar age, sex and IQ. Two T(1)-weighted MP-RAGE sequences were averaged for each participant to yield images with high signal-to-noise ratio, and quantified using semi-automated analysis tools. epsilon 4 carriers had thicker cortex than non-carriers in several frontal and temporal areas in both hemispheres, but showed a steeper age-related decline in adjacent areas. Upon comparison of the epsilon 4-specific age-related thinning with previously published patterns of thinning in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), we conclude that APOE epsilon 4 may function to accelerate thinning in areas found to decline in aging (medial prefrontal and pericentral cortex), but also to initiate thinning in areas associated with AD and amyloid-beta aggregation (occipitotemporal and basal temporal cortex).
