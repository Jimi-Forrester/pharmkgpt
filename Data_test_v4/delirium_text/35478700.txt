35478700|t|Network Reconfiguration Among Cerebellar Visual, and Motor Regions Affects Movement Function in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3.
35478700|a|Background: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a rare movement disorder characterized with ataxia. Previous studies on movement disorders show that the whole-brain functional network tends to be more regular, and these reconfigurations correlate with genetic and clinical variables. Methods: To test whether the brain network in patients with SCA3 follows a similar reconfiguration course to other movement disorders, we recruited 41 patients with SCA3 (mean age = 40.51 +- 12.13 years; 23 male) and 41 age and sex-matched healthy individuals (age = 40.10 +- 11.56 years; 24 male). In both groups, the whole-brain network topology of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was conducted using graph theory, and the relationships among network topologies, cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats, clinical symptoms, and functional connectivity were explored in SCA3 patients using partial correlation analysis, controlling for age and sex. Results: The brain networks tended to be more regular with a higher clustering coefficient, local efficiency, and modularity in patients with SCA3. Hubs in SCA3 patients were reorganized as the number of hubs increased in motor-related areas and decreased in cognitive areas. At the global level, small-worldness and normalized clustering coefficients were significantly positively correlated with clinical motor symptoms. At the nodal level, the clustering coefficient and local efficiency increased significantly in the visual (bilateral cuneus) and sensorimotor (right cerebellar lobules IV, V, VI) networks and decreased in the cognitive areas (right middle frontal gyrus). The clustering coefficient and local efficiency in the bilateral cuneus gyrus were negatively correlated with clinical motor symptoms. The functional connectivity between right caudate nucleus and bilateral calcarine gyrus were negatively correlated with disease duration, while connectivity between right posterior cingulum gyrus and left cerebellar lobule III, left inferior occipital gyrus and right cerebellar lobule IX was positively correlated. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that a more regular brain network occurred in SCA3 patients, with motor and visual-related regions, such as, cerebellar lobules and cuneus gyrus, both forayed neighbor nodes as "resource predators" to compensate for normal function, with motor and visual function having the higher priority comparing with other high-order functions. This study provides new information about the neurological mechanisms underlying SCA3 network topology impairments in the resting state, which give a potential guideline for future clinical treatments.
