23533873|a|Hypercalcemia is a common medical problem with an estimated prevalence of 15% among hospitalized patients. Multiple myeloma (MM) and primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) are among the most common causes of hypercalcemia but coexistence of both pathologic processes in a patient is an extremely rare phenomenon. In this paper we have discussed a patient presenting with this rare phenomenon. We have also provided a comprehensive review of the scientific literature published on codiagnosis of MM and PHPT.
