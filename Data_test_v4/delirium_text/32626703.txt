32626703|t|Endoplasmic Reticulum-Mitochondria Contact Sites and Neurodegeneration.
32626703|a|Endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCSs) are dynamic contact regions with a distance of 10-30 nm between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites regulate various biological processes, including lipid transfer, calcium homeostasis, autophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics. The dysfunction of ERMCS is closely associated with various neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge of the components and organization of ERMCSs, the methods for monitoring ERMCSs, and the physiological functions of ERMCSs in different model systems. Additionally, we will emphasize the current understanding of the malfunction of ERMCSs and their potential roles in neurodegenerative diseases.
