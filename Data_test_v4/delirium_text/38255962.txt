38255962|t|Tau Protein Alterations Induced by Hypobaric Hypoxia Exposure.
38255962|a|Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases whose central feature is dysfunction of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT). Although the exact etiology of tauopathies is still unknown, it has been hypothesized that their onset may occur up to twenty years before the clear emergence of symptoms, which has led to questions about whether the prognosis of these diseases can be improved by, for instance, targeting the factors that influence tauopathy development. One such factor is hypoxia, which is strongly linked to Alzheimer's disease because of its association with obstructive sleep apnea and has been reported to affect molecular pathways related to the dysfunction and aggregation of tau proteins and other biomarkers of neurological damage. In particular, hypobaric hypoxia exposure increases the activation of several kinases related to the hyperphosphorylation of tau in neuronal cells, such as ERK, GSK3beta, and CDK5. In addition, hypoxia also increases the levels of inflammatory molecules (IL-beta1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha), which are also associated with neurodegeneration. This review discusses the many remaining questions regarding the influence of hypoxia on tauopathies and the contribution of high-altitude exposure to the development of these diseases.
