31731422|t|Macroalgae as a Valuable Source of Naturally Occurring Bioactive Compounds for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
31731422|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition that affects mostly aged individuals. Evidence suggests that pathological mechanisms involved in the development of AD are associated with cholinergic deficit, glutamate excitotoxicity, beta-amyloid aggregation, tau phosphorylation, neuro-inflammation, and oxidative damage to neurons. Currently there is no cure for AD; however, synthetic therapies have been developed to effectively manage some of the symptoms at the early stage of the disease. Natural products from plants and marine organisms have been identified as important sources of bioactive compounds with neuroprotective potentials and less adverse effects compared to synthetic agents. Seaweeds contain several kinds of secondary metabolites such as phlorotannins, carotenoids, sterols, fucoidans, and poly unsaturated fatty acids. However, their neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of action have not been fully explored. This review discusses recent investigations and/or updates on interactions of bioactive compounds from seaweeds with biomarkers involved in the pathogenesis of AD using reports in electronic databases such as Web of science, Scopus, PubMed, Science direct, Scifinder, Taylor and Francis, Wiley, Springer, and Google scholar between 2015 and 2019. Phlorotannins, fucoidans, sterols, and carotenoids showed strong neuroprotective potentials in different experimental models. However, there are no data from human studies and/or clinical trials.
