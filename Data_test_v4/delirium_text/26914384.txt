26914384|a|The American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN) created the Clinical Scene Investigator (CSI) Academy for nurses at the bedside to develop leadership and innovation skills to create and sustain lasting change that positively impacts patient outcomes. In our 2015 three-part series, we explored how to redefine "nonproductive" time, change leadership, and the formation of the Massachusetts CSI Nursing Delirium Collaborative. In this first part of our 2016 series, we share the Duke Raleigh CSI Academy team's journey through change management while creating an early progressive mobility (EPM) initiative.
