36641610|t|Pharmacological Inventions for Alzheimer Treatment in the United States of America: A Revision Patent from 2010 - 2020.
36641610|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. There is currently no cure, and the available pharmacological treatment focuses on treating the symptoms. This study aimed to analyze the pharmacological treatments for AD protected in the US Patent Office. The Matheo Patent software was used to search for patents granted in the 2010-2020 period in the USPTO database. The search strategy <<Alzheimer>> was used in title and abstract and the International Patent Classification (IPC) codes A61P* and A61K*. The selected patents were divided into six categories according to therapeutic target. Complementary information from scientific databases was used to determine the stage of investigation and efficacy of the patented molecules. In the analyzed period, 58 patents were granted: 10 directed to Abeta peptide metabolism and deposition, three to tau, seven to inflammation, nine to cholinergic, two to glutamatergic and 27 to other targets. More than 80.0% belong to holders from the USA, France, and Japan. The molecules Elenbecestat and LY3202626 decreased the burden of Abeta plaques without significant cognitive improvement, Donanemab is in Phase 3 clinical trial, and the FDA has designated it Breakthrough Therapy. CPC-201 and PXT864 demonstrated, in Phase 2, good tolerability and improvement of AD symptoms. Most of the inventions are focused on treating the earliest phase of AD. The most advanced treatments in their research are those focused on treating Abeta accumulation. More studies are needed to prove the efficacy of the patented molecules.
