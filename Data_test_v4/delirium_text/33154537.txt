33154537|a|Sleep disruption is common in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). The aim of the study was to measure sound levels during sleep-protected time in the ICU, determine sources of sound, assess the impact of sound levels and patient-related factors on duration and quality of patients' sleep. The study was performed between 2018 and 2019. A commercially available smartphone application was used to measure ambient sound levels. Sleep duration was measured using the Patient's Sleep Behaviour Observational Tool. Sleep quality was assessed using the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ). The study population comprised 18 (58%) men and 13 (42%) women. There were numerous sources of sound. The median duration of sleep was 5 (IQR 3.5-5.7) hours. The median score on the RCSQ was 49 (IQR 28-71) out of 100 points. Sound levels were negatively correlated with sleep duration. The cut-off peak sound level, above which sleep duration was shorter than mean sleep duration in the cohort, was 57.9 dB. Simple smartphone applications can be useful to estimate sound levels in the ICU. There are numerous sources of sound in the ICU. Individual units should identify and eliminate their own sources of sound. Sources of sound producing peak sound levels above 57.9 dB may lead to shorter sleep and should be eliminated from the ICU environment. The sound levels had no effect on sleep quality.
