14622013|a|To understand the molecular basis and to prevent diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), the targets of the triggering agent have to be elucidated. beta-Amyloid peptide (Abeta) is the major component of extracellular senile plaques characteristic of AD. For a very long time, the aggregated form of the Abeta was supposed to be responsible for the neurodegeneration that occurs in AD. Recently, the attention has been diverted to the monomeric or oligomeric forms of Abeta and their interaction with cellular targets. In our investigation, the physiological and medically important insertion of externally applied Abeta monomers into the bilayer of lipid vesicles is demonstrated. Abeta(25-35) has been localized in the region of the lipid alkyl chain, and it has a severe disordering effect on the lamellar order of the lipid bilayer. Both of these results are of biomedical relevance.
