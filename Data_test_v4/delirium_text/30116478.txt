30116478|t|Isolation and Characterization of NP-POL Nonapeptide for Possible Therapeutic Use in Parkinson's Disease.
30116478|a|Colostrum and milk are the initial mammalian nourishment and rich reservoir of essential nutrients for newborn development. Bioactive peptides isolated from natural sources, such as colostrum, serve as endogenous regulators and can be used as alternative therapeutic agents in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. One example is the previously unknown NP-POL nonapeptide isolated from Colostrinin. In the present study, we investigated a method of NP-POL nonapeptide isolation using Bio-Gel P2 molecular sieve chromatography. We showed the protective effect of NP-POL on 6-hydroxydopamine- (6-OHDA-) induced neurotoxicity using rat adrenal pheochromocytoma (PC12 Tet On) cells. Treatment of PC12 cells with NP-POL nonapeptide reduced 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis and caused transient phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK 1/2), which were shown to promote cell survival. NP-POL nonapeptide also protected neuronal cells against oxidative injury induced by 6-OHDA. These results showed a potential use of NP-POL in the therapy of Parkinson's disease.
