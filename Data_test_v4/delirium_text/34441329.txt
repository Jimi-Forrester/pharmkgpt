34441329|t|Local Pattern Transformation Based Feature Extraction for Recognition of Parkinson's Disease Based on Gait Signals.
34441329|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neuro-degenerative disorder primarily triggered due to the deterioration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra of the human brain. The early detection of Parkinson's disease can assist in preventing deteriorating health. This paper analyzes human gait signals using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) techniques during feature extraction before classification. Supplementary to the LBP techniques, Local Gradient Pattern (LGP), Local Neighbour Descriptive Pattern (LNDP), and Local Neighbour Gradient Pattern (LNGP) were utilized to extract features from gait signals. The statistical features were derived and analyzed, and the statistical Kruskal-Wallis test was carried out for the selection of an optimal feature set. The classification was then carried out by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the identified feature set. The proposed Symmetrically Weighted Local Neighbour Gradient Pattern (SWLNGP) method achieves a better performance, with 96.28% accuracy, 96.57% sensitivity, and 95.94% specificity. This study suggests that SWLNGP could be an effective feature extraction technique for the recognition of Parkinsonian gait.
