36479019|a|Introduction: Fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3) is a biomarker of neuronal membrane disruption, associated with lipid dyshomeostasis-a notable Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiological change. We assessed the association of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FABP3 levels with brain amyloidosis and the likelihood/risk of developing amyloidopathy in cognitively healthy individuals. Methods: FABP3 levels were measured in CSF samples of cognitively healthy participants, > 60 years of age (n = 142), from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL). Results: FABP3 levels were positively associated with baseline brain amyloid beta (Abeta) load as measured by standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR, standardized beta = 0.22, P = .009) and predicted the change in brain Abeta load (standardized beta = 0.32, P = .004). Higher levels of CSF FABP3 (above median) were associated with a likelihood of amyloidopathy (odds ratio [OR] 2.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12 to 4.65, P = .023). Discussion: These results support inclusion of CSF FABP3 as a biomarker in risk-prediction models of AD.
