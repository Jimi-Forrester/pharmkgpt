21359901|a|BACKGROUND: Boerhaave's syndrome has a high mortality rate (14-40%). Surgical treatment varies from a minimal approach consisting of adequate debridement with drainage of the mediastinum and pleural cavity to esophageal resection. This study compared the results between a previously preferred open minimal approach and a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure currently considered the method of choice. METHODS: In this study, 12 consecutive patients treated with a historical nonresectional drainage approach (1985-2001) were compared with 12 consecutive patients treated prospectively after the introduction of VATS during the period 2002-2009. Baseline characteristics were equally distributed between the two groups. RESULTS: In the prospective group, 2 of the 12 patients had the VATS procedure converted to an open thoracotomy, and 2 additional patients were treated by open surgery. In the prospective group, 8 patients experienced postoperative complications compared with all 12 patients in the historical control group. Four patients (17%), two in each group, underwent reoperation. Six patients, three in each group, were readmitted to the hospital. The overall in-hospital mortality was 8% (1 patient in each group), which compares favorably with other reports (7-27%) based on drainage alone. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate surgical debridement with drainage of the mediastinum and pleural cavity resulted in a low mortality rate. The results for VATS in this relatively small series were comparable with those for an open thoracotomy.
