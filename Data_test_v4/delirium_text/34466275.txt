34466275|a|With an increasing focus on health in contemporary society, interest in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases has grown rapidly. Accordingly, the demand for biosensors for the early diagnosis of disease is increasing. However, the measurement range of existing electrochemical sensors is relatively high, which is not suitable for early disease diagnosis, requiring the detection of small amounts of biocomponents. Various attempts have been made to overcome this and amplify the signal, including binding with various labeling molecules, such as DNA, enzymes, nanoparticles, and carbon materials. Efforts are also being made to increase the sensitivity of electrochemical sensors, and the combination of nanomaterials, materials, and biotechnology offers the potential to increase sensitivity in a variety of ways. Recent studies suggest that electrochemical sensors can be a powerful tool in providing comprehensive insights into the targeting and detection of disease-associated biomarkers. Significant advances in nanomaterial and biomolecule approaches for improved sensitivity have resulted in the development of electrochemical biosensors capable of detecting multiple biomarkers in real time in clinically relevant samples. In this review, we have discussed the recent studies on electrochemical sensors for detection of diseases such as diabetes, degenerative diseases, and cancer. Further, we have highlighted new technologies to improve sensitivity using various materials, including DNA, enzymes, nanoparticles, and carbon materials.
