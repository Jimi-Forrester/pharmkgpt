31727894|t|Transplanted interneurons improve memory precision after traumatic brain injury.
31727894|a|Repair of the traumatically injured brain has been envisioned for decades, but regenerating new neurons at the site of brain injury has been challenging. We show GABAergic progenitors, derived from the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence, migrate long distances following transplantation into the hippocampus of adult mice with traumatic brain injury, functionally integrate as mature inhibitory interneurons and restore post-traumatic decreases in synaptic inhibition. Grafted animals had improvements in memory precision that were reversed by chemogenetic silencing of the transplanted neurons and a long-lasting reduction in spontaneous seizures. Our results reveal a striking ability of transplanted interneurons for incorporating into injured brain circuits, and this approach is a powerful therapeutic strategy for correcting post-traumatic memory and seizure disorders.
