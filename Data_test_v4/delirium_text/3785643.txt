3785643|t|Alzheimer's disease and serotonin: a review.
3785643|a|Data from post-mortem brain, cerebrospinal fluid and serotonin (5-HT) synapse studies indicate serious impairment of the serotoninergic system in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Decreased levels of the 5-HT metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid have also been linked with aggressive behaviour--which may further complicate management of these patients. So far, results of treatment aimed at influencing the 5-HT deficit have proved generally disappointing. Present intensive research may eventually result in a multi-therapy approach to treatment of the many neurotransmitter abnormalities involved.
