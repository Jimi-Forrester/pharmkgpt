35924543|t|Medical Complications of Lung Transplantation.
35924543|a|Lung transplantation (LT) is now considered as an effective treatment option for end-stage lung diseases that improves the short and long-term survival rates and quality of life. As increasingly many LT procedures are being performed, the medical complications of LT are also increasing in frequency and emerging as a very important issue for transplant clinicians. Although chronic lung allograft dysfunction and infection are major causes of death after LT, many medical complications, several of which result from immunosuppressive treatment, contribute to increased mortality and morbidity. This article reviews the most frequent and important medical complications of LT, accompanied by a review of the literature and studies from South Korea, including lung allograft rejection, infection, and non-allograft organ systemic complications.
