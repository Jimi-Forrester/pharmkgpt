37025706|a|OBJECTIVE: In this study, our aim was to evaluate the results obtained by conservative treatment of femoral neck fracture in patients with untreated Crowe type 4 coxarthrosis with high dislocation. METHODS: This was was a retrospective study done at the Orthopaedics and Traumatology Clinic in a secondary care public hospital between 2002 and 2022, in Turkiye. Femur neck fractures were evaluated in six patients who had untreated Crowe type 4 coxarthrosis with high dislocation. RESULTS:  In the study, we had six patients with undiagnosed developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) who suffered femoral neck fractures. The youngest among these patients was 76 years old. Conservative treatment (bed rest, analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and, if needed, opiates and low molecular weight heparin for antiembolic treatment) was found to reduce Harris Hip Score (HHS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores significantly (p<0,05). Stage 1 sacral decubitus ulcer occurred in two (33.3%) patients. Patients acquired daily activity capacity similar to their situations before fracture within five to six months. None of the patients suffered embolisms and there was no union in the fracture line of the patients.  Conclusion: Based on our data, we think that conservative treatment is a remarkable option for these patients, as the complication risks are low and positive results can be obtained. Thus, we may conclude that conservative treatment can be considered in femoral neck fractures of elderly patients with DDH.
