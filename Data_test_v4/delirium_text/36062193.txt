36062193|t|Sepsis-Induced Brain Dysfunction: Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Treatment.
36062193|a|Dysregulated host response to infection, which cause life-threatening organ dysfunction, was defined as sepsis. Sepsis can cause acute and long-term brain dysfunction, namely, sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) and cognitive impairment. SAE refers to changes in consciousness without direct evidence of central nervous system infection. It is highly prevalent and may cause poor outcomes in sepsis patients. Cognitive impairment seriously affects the life quality of sepsis patients and increases the medical burden. The pathogenesis of sepsis-induced brain dysfunction is mainly characterized by the interaction of systemic inflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, neuroinflammation, microcirculation dysfunction, and brain dysfunction. Currently, the diagnosis of sepsis-induced brain dysfunction is based on clinical manifestation of altered consciousness along with neuropathological examination, and the treatment is mainly involves controlling sepsis. Although treatments for sepsis-induced brain dysfunction have been tested in animals, clinical treat sepsis-induced brain dysfunction is still difficult. Therefore, we review the underlying mechanisms of sepsis-induced brain injury, which mainly focus on the influence of systemic inflammation on BBB, neuroinflammation, brain microcirculation, and the brain function, which want to bring new mechanism-based directions for future basic and clinical research aimed at preventing or ameliorating brain dysfunction.
