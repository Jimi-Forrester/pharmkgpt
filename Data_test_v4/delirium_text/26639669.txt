26639669|a|INTRODUCTION: Neuroleptics are known to induce Parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia and their long-term use was associated with increased risk of hip fractures and impaired cognitive function and even death. METHODS: The primary objective of Neurodem study was to determine the IAI of patients with Alzheimer's disease in French NH. RESULTS: 1022 patients were enrolled. The IAI was 24.8 %. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that having a severe form of dementia, resident without MMS evaluation the last 12 months and having a prescription for an anxiolytic drug were associated with a higher risk of having a prescription for an antipsychotic drug. CONCLUSION: The results from our study show that the percentage of patients receiving an antipsychotic drug (24.8 %) was higher than the national average (18 %). Effective educational activities about appropriate use of antipsychotic drugs in patients with Alzheimer's disease are needed.
