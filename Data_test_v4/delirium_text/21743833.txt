21743833|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease which begins with insidious deterioration of higher cognition and progresses to severe dementia. Clinical symptoms typically involve impairment of memory and at least one other cognitive domain. Because of the exponential increase in the incidence of AD with age, the aging population across the world has seen a congruous increase AD, emphasizing the importance of disease altering therapy. Current therapeutics on the market, including cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, provide symptomatic relief but do not alter progression of the disease. Therefore, progress in the areas of prevention and disease modification may be of critical interest. In this review, we summarize novel AD therapeutics that are currently being explored, and also mechanisms of action of specific drugs within the context of current knowledge of AD pathologic pathways.
