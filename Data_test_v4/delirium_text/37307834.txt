37307834|t|Amyloid Precursor Protein: A Regulatory Hub in Alzheimer's Disease.
37307834|a|Decades of research have demonstrated an incontrovertible role of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the overemphasis on the pathological impacts of Abeta may obscure the role of its metabolic precursor, amyloid precursor protein (APP), as a significant hub in the occurrence and progression of AD. The complicated enzymatic processing, ubiquitous receptor-like properties, and abundant expression of APP in the brain, as well as its close links with systemic metabolism, mitochondrial function and neuroinflammation, imply that APP plays multifaceted roles in AD. In this review, we briefly describe the evolutionarily conserved biological characteristics of APP, including its structure, functions and enzymatic processing. We also discuss the possible involvement of APP and its enzymatic metabolites in AD, both detrimental and beneficial. Finally, we describe pharmacological agents or genetic approaches with the capability to reduce APP expression or inhibit its cellular internalization, which can ameliorate multiple aspects of AD pathologies and halt disease progression. These approaches provide a basis for further drug development to combat this terrible disease.
