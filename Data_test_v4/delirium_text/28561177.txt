28561177|t|[Risk Factors for Postoperative Delirium after Cardiac Surgery].
28561177|a|Background Delirium is a common psychiatric disorder after cardiac surgery and predisposes patients to increased mortality and morbidity. Its prevention requires knowledge of the risk factors involved. Objective What are preoperative risk factors for postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery? Methods Prospective longitudinal study of 241 elective cardiac surgical patients with preoperative assessment of potential risk factors and delirium assessment twice daily over five postoperative days. Results 13 % of the patients experienced delirium. Reduced cognitive performance (OR: 3.80; 95 % CI: 1.66 - 8.66), higher comorbidity (OR: 1.36; 95 % CI: 1.07 - 1.7) and higher age (OR: 1.08; 95 % CI: 1.02 - 1.13) increased the risk of delirium. Conclusion Delirium after cardiac surgery is common. It occurs in particular in patients with low cognitive performance, higher comorbidity and higher age.
