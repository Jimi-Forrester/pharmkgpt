39410533|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Rhomboid intercostal block (RIB) is a new interfascial plane block. RIB is a simple and clinically effective technique. Paravertebral block (PVB) is offered as a first-line regional anesthesia technique for thoracoscopic surgeries. In this study, we aim to compare the analgesic efficacy of RIB to PVB in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgeries (VATSs). METHODS: This is a prospective randomized study with 84 patients aged 18-75 and ASA I-III, undergoing VATS for primary lung cancer. The study was approved by an ethical committee and registered under clinicaltrials.org. With informed consent, patients were randomized to receive ultrasound-guided RIB or PVB at T5-level with 20 mL of %0.25 bupivacaine preoperatively. Surgeries were performed under general anesthesia. Postoperatively, patient-controlled IV fentanyl analgesia was prescribed, delivering 10 mug boluses upon request with 10 min of a lock-out period. Patients received paracetamol 1 g IV three times a day and tramadol 50 mg IV for breakthrough pain. The postoperative Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pain, total opioid consumption, and rescue analgesic requirements were recorded postoperatively at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in 24 h total opioid consumption between the RIB and PVB groups [PVB: 48.5 (39.5-55) mcg; RIB: 48.6 (40.2-65) mcg; p = 0.258], nor in rescue analgesic requirements [PVB: seven patients (20%); RIB: seven patients (17.1%); p = 0.570]. NRS pain scores were also similar between the groups, with no significant difference in overall pain control efficacy (p = 0.833). CONCLUSIONS: RIB is comparable to PVB in analgesic efficacy for VATS and can be considered as an alternative analgesic modality.
