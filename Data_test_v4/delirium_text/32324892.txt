32324892|t|Use of Direct In-Person Observation in the Care of Hospitalized Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review.
32324892|a|Hospitalized older adults with cognitive impairment (CI) due to dementia and/or delirium may require individualized care strategies such as direct observation to mitigate safety concerns and manage behavioral symptoms. Despite common use of direct observation as a strategy, little is known about its practice and outcomes. A systematic review was conducted to identify, appraise, and synthesize literature on direct observation among hospitalized older adults with CI. The search yielded 16 eligible studies, with four describing current practices, nine reporting quality improvement efforts to broaden direct observation, and three focusing on direct observation reduction. Strength of evidence across studies was weak, limited in scope, and lacking clarity in definitions, indications for use and discontinuation, and documentation. Overall, findings highlight differing views on direct observation and the need for future, rigorous evaluation of approaches (e.g., nursing autonomy in initiating and discontinuing observation) to better align direct observation with patient needs.
