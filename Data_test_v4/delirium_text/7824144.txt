7824144|t|Apolipoprotein E genotype and Lewy body disease.
7824144|a|To determine whether apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype affects neuropathology in Lewy body disease (LBD), we examined 18 cases of LBD that did not have concurrent Alzheimer's disease by the CERAD criteria. We obtained APOE genotypes, determined diffuse beta-amyloid plaque (A beta P) and Lewy body densities in multiple brain regions, and graded the intensity of CA2-3 ubiquitin-positive neurites, vacuolar change, nigral pathology, amyloid angiopathy, and subpial amyloid deposition. The APOE allele frequencies were as follows: epsilon 2, 0.14 +/- 0.07; epsilon 3, 0.64 +/- 0.08; and epsilon 4, 0.22 +/- 0.03. The mean A beta P density was lower in APOE epsilon 3/3 cases (14.5 A beta Ps per mm2) than in the groups with the APOE epsilon 2 (67.0) or APOE epsilon 4 (46.6) alleles. This difference was due largely to the difference between A beta P density in the APOE epsilon 2 group and the APOE epsilon 3/3 group (F = 5.525, p < 0.02). CA2-3 neuritic degeneration was greater in those with the APOE epsilon 4 allele than in those with the APOE epsilon 3/3 genotype (grade = 1.9 +/- 1.3 versus 0.938 +/- 0.9; Kruskal-Wallis test statistic = 6.962, p < 0.05). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that APOE genotype may affect neuropathology in LBD.
