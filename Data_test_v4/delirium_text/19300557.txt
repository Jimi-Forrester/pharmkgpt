19300557|t|Memantine: efficacy and safety in mild-to-severe Alzheimer's disease.
19300557|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 25 million cases worldwide. Until recently, the pharmacotherapy of AD was limited to the use of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) that are approved only for the mild to moderate stages of the illness. Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist has been found to be effective, both as monotherapy and in combination with donepezil, in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe stage AD. More recent studies have examined the role of memantine in the treatment of the mild to moderate stages of the disease, although the collective results of these studies remain inconclusive. Available pharmacoeconomic data indicate that treatment with memantine is cost-effective when compared with no treatment in patients with moderate to severe AD. Memantine treatment is predicted to be associated with lower costs of care, longer time to dependence and institutionalization, and gains in quality-adjusted life-years. In this article, we review the evidence for the use of memantine in patients with AD, ranging from the mild to severe stages of disease.
