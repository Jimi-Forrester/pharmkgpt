38733108|t|Drug Burden Index Is a Modifiable Predictor of 30-Day Hospitalization in Community-Dwelling Older Adults With Complex Care Needs: Machine Learning Analysis of InterRAI Data.
38733108|a|BACKGROUND: Older adults (>=65 years) account for a disproportionately high proportion of hospitalization and in-hospital mortality, some of which may be avoidable. Although machine learning (ML) models have already been built and validated for predicting hospitalization and mortality, there remains a significant need to optimize ML models further. Accurately predicting hospitalization may tremendously affect the clinical care of older adults as preventative measures can be implemented to improve clinical outcomes for the patient. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, a data set of 14 198 community-dwelling older adults (>=65 years) with complex care needs from the International Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care database was used to develop and optimize 3 ML models to predict 30-day hospitalization. The models developed and optimized were Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and Logistic Regression (LR). Variable importance plots were generated for all 3 models to identify key predictors of 30-day hospitalization. RESULTS: The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve for the RF, XGB, and LR models were 0.97, 0.90, and 0.72, respectively. Variable importance plots identified the Drug Burden Index and alcohol consumption as important, immediately potentially modifiable variables in predicting 30-day hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying immediately potentially modifiable risk factors such as the Drug Burden Index and alcohol consumption is of high clinical relevance. If clinicians can influence these variables, they could proactively lower the risk of 30-day hospitalization. ML holds promise to improve the clinical care of older adults. It is crucial that these models undergo extensive validation through large-scale clinical studies before being utilized in the clinical setting.
