32564247|t|Is Porphyromonas gingivalis involved in Parkinson's disease?
32564247|a|Porphyromonas gingivalis, a major subgingival plaque bacterium in periodontitis, has recently attracted much attention as a possible microbial driver in Alzheimer's disease. In the present paper, another common neuroinflammatory disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), is discussed. A recent study found major virulence factors of P. gingivalis such as gingipain R1 (RgpA) and lipopolysaccharide in the blood circulation of a PD population. The current review reveals how features such as systemic inflammation, hypercoagulation, presence of amyloid fibrin(ogen) in plasma, and marked ultrastructural changes in platelets, probably induced by P. gingivalis, may affect the development of PD. Several other clinical studies have also demonstrated an association between periodontitis and PD. Even if the risk of periodontal diseases causing neurological disorders needs to be better substantiated, that should not keep us from trying to prevent them by performing careful daily dental hygiene.
