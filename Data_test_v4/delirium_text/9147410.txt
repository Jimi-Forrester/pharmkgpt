9147410|t|The possible place of cathepsins and cystatins in the puzzle of Alzheimer disease: a review.
9147410|a|Lysosomal proteinases (cathepsins) and their endogenous inhibitors (cystatins) have been found to be closely associated with senile plaques, cerebrovascular amyloid deposits, and neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease (AD). Further, profound changes in the lysosomal system seem to be an early event in "at-risk" neurons of AD brains. There is an ongoing controversy as to whether lysosome-associated proteolytic mechanisms are causally related to the development and/or further progression of the disease. The present article deals with some arguments "pro" and "contra" an involvement of the endosomal/lysosomal pathway in amyloidogenesis as a cardinal process in AD. Other putative targets of acidic proteinases and their natural inhibitors in the pathogenesis of AD (such as formation of neurofibrillary tangles and regulation of apolipoprotein E) are also discussed.
