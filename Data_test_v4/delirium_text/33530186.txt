33530186|t|A randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical study of the "improved sitting Wuqinxi" intervention for mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit.
33530186|a|INTRODUCTION: Mechanical ventilation is a powerful tool for the treatment of various critical emergencies. However, surviving critically ill patients often have poor psychological and physiological outcomes. Prevention of various complications and adverse outcomes of mechanical ventilation is a priority and a challenge in the intensive care unit (ICU). Early intervention is the key to reducing complications and improving outcomes of mechanical ventilation in the ICU. As an auxiliary rehabilitation treatment, the improved sitting Wuqinxi intervention has recognized unique advantages. It has achieved beneficial therapeutic effects during early intervention in clinical practice. It can reduce the incidence of delirium, shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation, and prevent complications and secondary damages related to mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Therefore, the purpose of this study will be to explore the effect of improved sitting Wuqinxi on the clinical outcomes of mechanically ventilated ICU patients. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, randomized, single-blinded, parallel controlled clinical study will involve 160 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The patients will be randomly divided into the experimental and control groups. Both groups will be given standardized comprehensive western medicine treatment (including mechanical ventilation) and routine care in the ICU. Management of the experimental group will also include "improved sitting Wuqinxi," with the treatment objective to observe the effect of the improved sitting Wuqinxi intervention on the clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. The outcome measures will include the incidence of complications, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and cost of hospitalization. In addition, the effect of the improved sitting Wuqinxi intervention on the safety indexes of mechanically ventilated ICU patients will be assessed and the clinical effects of the improved sitting Wuqinxi intervention will be comprehensively evaluated. DISCUSSION: The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the effect of the improved sitting Wuqinxi intervention on the incidence of complications, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, cost of hospitalization, and safety indicators. If successful, it will provide a reliable, simple, and feasible auxiliary rehabilitation treatment scheme for mechanically ventilated ICU patients.
