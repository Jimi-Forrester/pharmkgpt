36731264|t|Family functioning of families experiencing intensive care and the specific impact of the COVID-19 pandemic: A grounded theory study.
36731264|a|OBJECTIVES: In order to provide a deeper understanding of family functioning, the aim of this study was to identify, describe and conceptualise the family functioning of families where a formerly critically ill family member had stayed at the intensive care unit, with the impact of a pandemic. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY/DESIGN: The study has a grounded theory design including interviews with eight families. SETTING: Former adult intensive care patients cared for Covid-19 infection and their family. Eight patients and twelve family members from three different intensive care units. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The results presented are grounded in data and identified in the core category "Existential issues" and the categories "Value considerateness; Anxiety and insecurity in life; Insight into the unpredictability of life." FINDINGS: The core category could be found in all data and its relationship and impact on the categories and each other. The core is a theoretical construction, whereas the family functioning of families where a formerly critically ill family member had stayed at the intensive care unit was identified, described, and conceptualised. Being able to talk repeatedly about existential issues and the anxiety and insecurity in life, with people that have similar experiences helps the patient and their family to consider and gain insight into the unpredictability of life, and thereby better cope with changes in life. CONCLUSION: There is awareness about the love that exists within the family. A willing to supporting each other in the family even if the critical illness made the family anxious and afraid. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Even if the pandemic Covid-19 led to restrictions inhibiting family focused nursing, it is important to confirm the family as a part of the caring of the ICU patient. The patients are not alone, their family are fighting together for the future.
