37298103|a|The main aim of the study was to assess the acetylcholinesterase-inhibitory potential of triterpenoid saponins (astragalosides) found in the roots of Astragalus mongholicus. For this purpose, the TLC bioautography method was applied and then the IC50 values were calculated for astragalosides II, III and IV (5.9 muM; 4.2 muM, and 4.0 muM, respectively). Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations were carried outto assess the affinity of the tested compounds for POPC and POPG-containing lipid bilayers, which in this case are the models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). All determined free energy profiles confirmed that astragalosides exhibit great affinity for the lipid bilayer. A good correlation was obtained when comparing the logarithm of n-octanol/water partition coefficient (logPow) lipophilicity descriptor values with the smallest values of free energy of the determined 1D profiles. The affinity for the lipid bilayers changes in the same order as the corresponding logPow values, i.e.,: I > II > III~IV. All compounds exhibit a high and also relatively similar magnitude of binding energies, varying from ca. -55 to -51 kJ/mol. Apositive correlation between the experimentally-determined IC50 values and the theoretically-predicted binding energies expressed by the correlation coefficient value equal 0.956 was observed.
