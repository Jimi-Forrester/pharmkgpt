35675065|t|Association Between Implementation of a Geriatric Trauma Clinical Pathway and Changes in Rates of Delirium in Older Adults With Traumatic Injury.
35675065|a|Importance: Older adults (age >=65 years) are at risk for high rates of delirium and poor outcomes; however, how to improve outcomes is still being explored. Objective: To assess whether implementation of a geriatric trauma clinical pathway was associated with reduced rates of delirium in older adults with traumatic injury. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective case-control study of electronic health records of patients aged 65 years or older with traumatic injury from 2018 to 2020 was conducted at a single level I trauma center. Eligible patients were age 65 years or older admitted to the trauma service and who did not undergo an operation. Intervention: The implementation of a clinical pathway based on geriatric best practices, which included order sets, guidelines, automated consultations, and escalation pathways executed by a multidisciplinary team. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was delirium. The secondary outcome was hospital length of stay. Process measures for pathway compliance were also assessed. Results: Of the 859 eligible patients, 712 patients were included in the analysis (442 [62.1%] in the baseline group; 270 [37.9%] in the postimplementation group; mean [SD] age: 81.4 [9.1] years; 394 [55.3%] were female). The mechanism of injury was not different between groups, with 247 in the baseline group (55.9%) and 162 in the postimplementation group (60.0%) (P = .43) experiencing a fall. Injuries were minor or moderate in both groups (261 in baseline group [59.0%] and 168 in postimplementation group [62.2%]; P = .87). The adjusted odds ratio for delirium in the postimplementation cohort was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.37-0.80; P < .001). Goals of care documentation improved significantly in the postimplementation cohort vs the baseline cohort with regard to documented goals of care notes (53.7% in the postimplementation cohort [145 of 270] vs 16.7% in the baseline cohort [74 of 442]; P < .001) and a shortened time to discussion from presenting to the emergency department (36 hours in the postimplementation cohort vs 50 hours in the baseline cohort; P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, implementation of a multidisciplinary clinical pathway for injured older adults at a single level I trauma center was associated with improved care and clinical outcomes. Interventions such as these may have utility in this vulnerable population, and findings should be confirmed across multiple centers.
