16221505|t|Tau is central in the genetic Alzheimer-frontotemporal dementia spectrum.
16221505|a|In contrast to the common and genetically complex senile form of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the molecular genetic dissection of inherited presenile dementias has given important mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of degenerative brain disease. Here, we focus on recent genotype-phenotype correlative studies in presenile AD and the frontotemporal dementia (FTD) complex of disorders. Together, these studies suggest that AD and FTD are linked in a genetic spectrum of presenile degenerative brain disorders in which tau appears to be the central player.
