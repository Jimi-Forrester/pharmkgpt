37838728|a|The pathological features of Alzheimer's disease are the formation of amyloid plaques and entanglement of nerve fibers. Studies have shown that Cu may be involved in the formation of amyloid plaques. However, their role has been controversial. The aim of this study was to explore the role of Cu in AD. We applied the "R" software for our differential analysis. Differentially expressed genes were screened using the limma package. Copper metabolism-related genes and the intersection set of differential genes with GSE5281 were searched; functional annotation was performed. The protein-protein interaction network was constructed using several modules to analyse the most significant hub genes. The hub genes were then qualified, and a database was used to screen for small-molecule AD drugs. We identified 87 DEGs. gene ontology analysis focused on homeostatic processes, response to toxic substances, positive regulation of transport, and secretion. The enriched molecular functions are mainly related to copper ion binding, molecular function regulators, protein-containing complex binding, identical protein binding and signalling receptor binding. The KEGG database is mainly involved in central carbon metabolism in various cancers, Parkinson's disease and melanoma. We identified five hub genes, FGF2, B2M, PTPRC, CD44 and SPP1, and identified the corresponding small molecule drugs. Our study identified key genes possibly related to energy metabolism in the pathological mechanism of AD and explored potential targets for AD treatment by establishing interaction networks.
