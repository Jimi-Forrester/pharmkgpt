38443347|a|Evidence for the involvement of N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) modification in the etiology and progression of liver fibrosis has emerged and holds promise as a therapeutic target. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) is a newly identified m6A-binding protein that functions to enhance mRNA stability and translation. However, its role as an m6A-binding protein in liver fibrosis remains elusive. Here, we observed that IGF2BP2 is highly expressed in liver fibrosis and activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and inhibition of IGF2BP2 protects against HSCs activation and liver fibrogenesis. Mechanistically, as an m6A-binding protein, IGF2BP2 regulates the expression of Aldolase A (ALDOA), a key target in the glycolytic metabolic pathway, which in turn regulates HSCs activation. Furthermore, we observed that active glycolytic metabolism in activated HSCs generates large amounts of lactate as a substrate for histone lactylation. Importantly, histone lactylation transforms the activation phenotype of HSCs. In conclusion, our findings reveal the essential role of IGF2BP2 in liver fibrosis by regulating glycolytic metabolism and highlight the potential of targeting IGF2BP2 as a therapeutic for liver fibrosis.
