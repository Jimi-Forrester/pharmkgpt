9359932|t|Benztropine abuse and overdose--case report and review.
9359932|a|The abuse and overdose of anti-cholinergic agents such as benztropine is well reported in the psychiatric and emergency medicine journals. However, despite almost 40 years since the first modern report, physicians in general remain poorly aware of anti-cholinergic abuse. A case report of recreational overdose of benztropine in a 19 year old schizophrenic patient is presented. Delirium and anti-cholinergic manifestations persisted for five days necessitating prolonged hospitalization. The literature on benztropine abuse and overdose is reviewed.
