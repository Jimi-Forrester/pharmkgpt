34300256|t|Circulating MicroRNAs and Novel Proteins as Potential Biomarkers of Neurological Complications after Heart Bypass Surgery.
34300256|a|Postoperative recovery can be impaired by many conditions, some of which are difficult to diagnose clinically. These include type 2 neurological complications such as hypoactive subtype of postoperative delirium (PD) and early postoperative cognitive dysfunction (ePOCD). Hope for their timely detection may lie with novel biomarkers. Plasma concentrations of microRNA-1-3p, microRNA-21-5p, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuroserpin (NSP), phosphorylated axonal neurofilament subunit H (pNfH) and visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1) were investigated in 30 patients undergoing elective off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Blood samples were collected at the start and end of a surgery as well as 24 h postoperatively. Associations between the studied biomarkers' perioperative expression and type 2 neurological complications were analyzed. PD was associated with postoperative expression of GFAP; ePOCD was associated with postoperative expression of microRNA-21-5p and GFAP as well as intraoperative expression of NSP. The predictive accuracy of these molecules was found acceptable, with all their areas under the curve (AUC) values above 0.7. Multivariable regression indicated that microRNA-21-5p, GFAP and NSP were the only significant predictors of ePOCD. Evaluation of a multi-marker model including these three molecules revealed its outstanding predictive accuracy for ePOCD (AUC = 0.95). The use of microRNA-21-5p, GFAP and NSP for monitoring postoperative recovery warrants further research considering their potential to predict PD and ePOCD.
