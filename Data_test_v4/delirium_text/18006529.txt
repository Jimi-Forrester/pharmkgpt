18006529|t|Gabapentin: a multimodal perioperative drug?
18006529|a|Gabapentin is a second generation anticonvulsant that is effective in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain. It was not, until recently, thought to be useful in acute perioperative conditions. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that perioperative administration is efficacious for postoperative analgesia, preoperative anxiolysis, attenuation of the haemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation, and preventing chronic post-surgical pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and delirium. This article reviews the clinical trial data describing the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in the setting of perioperative anaesthetic management.
