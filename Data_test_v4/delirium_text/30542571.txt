30542571|t|New self-assembling peptide nanotubes of large diameter using delta-amino acids.
30542571|a|Here we show that 4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid is a rigid stretcher building block for the preparation of cyclic peptides that self-assemble to form peptide nanotubes with large diameter and hydrophobic pores. The hydrophobic properties of the resulting nanotubes provided by the two methylene groups per delta-residue allow the encapsulation of C60 moieties forming a new type of bionanopeapod structure.
