31270248|t|JNK and cardiometabolic dysfunction.
31270248|a|Cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS) describes the cluster of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases that are generally characterized by impaired glucose tolerance, intra-abdominal adiposity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. CMS currently affects more than 25% of the world's population and the rates of diseases are rapidly rising. These CMS conditions represent critical risk factors for cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Therefore, it is imperative to elucidate the underlying signaling involved in disease onset and progression. The c-Jun N-terminal Kinases (JNKs) are a family of stress signaling kinases that have been recently indicated in CMS. The purpose of this review is to examine the in vivo implications of JNK as a potential therapeutic target for CMS. As the constellation of diseases associated with CMS are complex and involve multiple tissues and environmental triggers, carefully examining what is known about the JNK pathway will be important for specificity in treatment strategies.
