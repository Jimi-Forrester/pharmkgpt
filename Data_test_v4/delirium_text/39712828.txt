39712828|t|Advancements in the Management of Fragility Fractures in Orthopaedic Patients.
39712828|a|Osteoporosis is a major risk factor for fragility fractures. The British Orthopaedics Association Standards for Trauma and Orthopaedics (BOAST) and Getting it Right First Time (GIRFT) guidelines on fragility fracture management highlight the need to initiate prompt, coordinated multidisciplinary care with a focus on early mobilisation to improve patient outcomes. Medical management of fragility fractures focuses on the prevention of progressive frailty. Advancements in medical therapy include romosozumab, recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance in patients with imminent fracture risk, which improves overall bone mineral density. Regional nerve blocks are an increasingly common form of perioperative anaesthesia with fewer side effects than opioids and rates of postoperative delirium. Surgical management of osteoporotic fractures poses unique challenges, such as complex fracture patterns and increased risk of implant failure. The surgical approach to fragility fractures has undergone major advancements over the past 20 years, with developments such as polyaxial locking and far cortical locking systems that achieve secondary bone healing, as well as cement augmented screw fixation to provide stable fixation in osteoporotic bone. The development of minimally invasive surgical approaches has led to improved periosteal blood flow around a fracture site, as well as reduced operating time, hospital stay, and time to pain-free weight-bearing. In the future, we are likely to see a focus on minimally invasive surgical techniques for vertebral and pelvic fragility fractures to improve patients' mobility and independence before discharge, subsequently improving quality of life and preventing progressive frailty.
