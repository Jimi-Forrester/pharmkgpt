36224189|t|A systematic review of brain morphometry related to deep brain stimulation outcome in Parkinson's disease.
36224189|a|While the efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) is well-established in Parkinson's Disease (PD), the benefit of DBS varies across patients. Using imaging features for outcome prediction offers potential in improving effectiveness, whereas the value of presurgical brain morphometry, derived from the routinely used imaging modality in surgical planning, remains under-explored. This review provides a comprehensive investigation of links between DBS outcomes and brain morphometry features in PD. We systematically searched PubMed and Embase databases and retrieved 793 articles, of which 25 met inclusion criteria and were reviewed in detail. A majority of studies (24/25), including 1253 of 1316 patients, focused on the outcome of DBS targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN), while five studies included 57 patients receiving globus pallidus internus (GPi) DBS. Accumulated evidence showed that the atrophy of motor cortex and thalamus were associated with poor motor improvement, other structures such as the lateral-occipital cortex and anterior cingulate were also reported to correlated with motor outcome. Regarding non-motor outcomes, decreased volume of the hippocampus was reported to correlate with poor cognitive outcomes. Structures such as the thalamus, nucleus accumbens, and nucleus of basalis of Meynert were also reported to correlate with cognitive functions. Caudal middle frontal cortex was reported to have an impact on postsurgical psychiatric changes. Collectively, the findings of this review emphasize the utility of brain morphometry in outcome prediction of DBS for PD. Future efforts are needed to validate the findings and demonstrate the feasibility of brain morphometry in larger cohorts.
