39075863|t|Spring coil displacement after interventional embolization of severe pelvic fracture: a case report.
39075863|a|Haemorrhagic shock, which arises as a complication of pelvic fracture subsequent to severe trauma, represents a perilous state. The utilization of interventional endovascular haemostasis assumes a pivotal role in the management of patients with vascular injury following pelvic fracture. This article reports the treatment of a patient with pelvic fracture caused by a serious work-related vehicle accident. Despite the implementation of timely blood and fluid transfusion to combat shock, the application of aortic balloon obstruction, and interventional iliac artery embolization for haemostasis, the patient's condition failed to display any discernible improvement. Repeat angiography further revealed a displacement of the interventional embolization material, and the patient subsequently died of multiple organ failure. The occurrence of spring coil displacement is infrequent, but the consequences thereof are considered grave, necessitating meticulous discernment in the selection of haemostatic materials for this type of patient. The diagnostic and therapeutic processes encompassing the particular case described here were analysed and are discussed with the objective of augmenting the efficacy and success rate of treatment modalities for patients in similar circumstances.
