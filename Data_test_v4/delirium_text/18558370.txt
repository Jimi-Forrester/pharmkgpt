18558370|t|Immunotherapy and naturally occurring autoantibodies in neurodegenerative disorders.
18558370|a|Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders share a common pathologic pathway with aggregation and deposition of misfolded proteins causing a disruption of particular neuronal networks. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the down-stream events following deposition of misfolded proteins including failure of cellular defenses among many others. Recently, naturally occurring autoantibodies against ss-amyloid and alpha-synuclein have been detected in healthy persons and altered levels in patients were associated with particular neurodegenerative disorders. In this review the current knowledge on the role of naturally occurring autoantibodies is discussed in respect to neurodegenerative disorders.
