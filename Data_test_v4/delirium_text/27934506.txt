27934506|t|Synthesis of Verubecestat, a BACE1 Inhibitor for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
27934506|a|Verubecestat is an inhibitor of beta-secretase being evaluated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The first-generation route relies on an amide coupling with a functionalized aniline, the preparation of which introduces synthetic inefficiencies. The second-generation route replaces this with a copper-catalyzed C-N coupling, allowing for more direct access to the target. Other features of the new route include a diastereoselective Mannich-type addition into an Ellman sulfinyl ketimine and a late-stage guanidinylation.
