34536825|t|Genes related to SNPs identified by Genome-wide association studies of age-related hearing loss show restriction to specific cell types in the adult mouse cochlea.
34536825|a|ARHL has been thought to result from disordered hair cell function and their loss. ARHL has a significant genetic component. We sought to determine the expression in the cochlea of genes associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to ARHL. We find widespread and varying expression of genes associated with these SNPs in subtypes of cells in the cochlea identified by single-cell RNA sequencing. Genes associated with SNPs with the highest significance were preferentially expressed highly in hair cells, while genes associated with SNPs with a lower significance were expressed more universally. In addition, we find significant overlap with genesets associated with Alzheimer's disease suggesting shared mechanisms, and genesets enriched for apical cell polarity and vesicle recycling suggesting mechanisms of cell death/ dysfunction with ageing.
