19689239|a|The purpose of the paper is to describe common psychological and caregiving issues that can cause stress in family members of persons with mild cognitive impairment (PwMCI) in order to assist family members in providing care and support to the PwMCI while also caring for themselves over long periods of time. Because PwMCI and their family members have time to prepare for the future should the PwMCI no longer be able to participate in their own care, it is important that clinicians offer support, education, and referrals for services and interventions when needed. The results of a review and synthesis of the caregiving literature found that much information exists from educational and intervention programs designed to help caregivers of Alzheimer disease however little empirical information is available for clinicians to assist PwMCI and their family members. This paper provides valuable and practical information for clinicians and other care providers to assist family members of PwMCI to cope with the uncertainty of the diagnosis, prepare for the future, and manage their stress over the long-term.
