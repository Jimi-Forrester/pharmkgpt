39674108|t|Unlocking the neuroprotective potential of Ziziphora clinopodioides flavonoids in combating neurodegenerative diseases and other brain injuries.
39674108|a|Ziziphora clinopodioides Lam. (Z. clinopodioides) is a traditional Chinese and ethnic medicine in Xinjiang, China with various therapeutic effects. It is primarily used for conditions such as heart disease, fever with chills, palpitations, and insomnia. Flavonoids are the main medicinal components of Z. clinopodioides, Interestingly, current research has increasingly focused on its neuroprotective effects. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the potential therapeutic applications of Z. clinopodioides and its constituents in central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. At present, about 25 flavonoids have been isolated and identified from various organs of Z. clinopodioides, including linarin, acacetin, hyperoside, quercetin, apigenin, luteolin, chrysin, kaempferol, baicalein, rutin and others. Modern pharmacological studies have revealed that Z. clinopodioides and its constituents exhibits neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo, and the mechanism of action is related to anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress and so on. Currently, there is limited research on the extracts of Z. clinopodioides and their potential mechanisms of action in these neurological disorders. It is also important to prioritize research on biosynthetic pathways and chemical modification approaches to fully explore and improve the neuroprotective potential of Z. clinopodioides and its flavonoids and establish a strong foundation for its clinical applications.
