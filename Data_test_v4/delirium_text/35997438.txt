35997438|t|Proteomic Discovery and Validation of Novel Fluid Biomarkers for Improved Patient Selection and Prediction of Clinical Outcomes in Alzheimer's Disease Patient Cohorts.
35997438|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline. The two cardinal neuropathological hallmarks of AD include the buildup of cerebral beta amyloid (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau. The current disease-modifying treatments are still not effective enough to lower the rate of cognitive decline. There is an urgent need to identify early detection and disease progression biomarkers that can facilitate AD drug development. The current established readouts based on the expression levels of amyloid beta, tau, and phospho-tau have shown many discrepancies in patient samples when linked to disease progression. There is an urgent need to identify diagnostic and disease progression biomarkers from blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or other biofluids that can facilitate the early detection of the disease and provide pharmacodynamic readouts for new drugs being tested in clinical trials. Advances in proteomic approaches using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry are now being increasingly applied to study AD disease mechanisms and identify drug targets and novel disease biomarkers. In this report, we describe the application of quantitative proteomic approaches for understanding AD pathophysiology, summarize the current knowledge gained from proteomic investigations of AD, and discuss the development and validation of new predictive and diagnostic disease biomarkers.
