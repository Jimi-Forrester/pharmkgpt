33806175|t|Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia-Current Strategies for Enhanced Recovery after Cardiac Surgery.
33806175|a|With the advent of fast-track pathways after cardiac surgery, there has been a renewed interest in regional anesthesia due to its opioid-sparing effect. This paradigm shift, looking to improve resource allocation efficiency and hasten postoperative extubation and mobilization, has been pursued by nearly every specialty area in surgery. Safety concerns regarding the use of classical neuraxial techniques in anticoagulated patients have tempered the application of regional anesthesia in cardiac surgery. Recently described ultrasound-guided thoracic wall blocks have emerged as valuable alternatives to epidurals and landmark-driven paravertebral and intercostal blocks. These novel procedures enable safe, effective, opioid-free pain control. Although experience within this field is still at an early stage, available evidence indicates that their use is poised to grow and may become integral to enhanced recovery pathways for cardiac surgery patients.
