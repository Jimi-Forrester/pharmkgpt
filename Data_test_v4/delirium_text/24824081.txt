24824081|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the long-term viability of innominate artery resection and tracheotomy for a patient at high risk of developing a tracheoinnominate fistula (TIF) in the setting of subglottic stenosis and a high-riding innominate artery. METHODS: Chart review with 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: A 45-year-old diabetic man with obstructive sleep apnea and multiple admissions for coma and delirium tremens associated with alcohol abuse developed subglottic stenosis. He was found to have a palpable supraclavicular pulse during preoperative examination for a tracheotomy. Computed tomography examination revealed a high-riding innominate artery at the level of stenosis along with granulation tissue and disruption of the cartilaginous trachea, suggesting a high risk of impending TIF. The patient underwent a sternotomy-approach resection of the innominate artery with closure of the distal stump with a sternohyoid muscle flap. Intraoperatively, a plane of adhesions between the posterior innominate artery and trachea was dissected. The anterior tracheal wall appeared calcified but without evidence of erosion of either the trachea or the artery. Six weeks later, a tracheotomy was performed. Follow-up at 27 months did not identify complications from the innominate artery resection. CONCLUSION: Resection of the innominate artery is an option for some patients either to address the warning signs of TIF or to permit a tracheotomy to be performed in the presence of a high innominate artery.
