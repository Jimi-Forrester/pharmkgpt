39071775|a|Background: Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 14 loci associated with frailty index (FI) susceptibility, the underlying causative genes and biological mechanisms remain elusive. Methods: A cross-tissue transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was conducted utilizing the Unified Test for Molecular Markers (UTMOST), which integrates GWAS summary statistics from 164,610 individuals of European ancestry and 10,616 Swedish participants, alongside gene expression matrices from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. Validation of the significant genes was performed through three distinct methods: FUSION, FOCUS, and Multiple Marker Analysis of Genome-wide Annotation (MAGMA). Exploration of tissue and functional enrichment for FI-associated SNPs was conducted using MAGMA. Conditional and joint analyses, along with fine mapping, were employed to enhance our understanding of FI's genetic architecture. Mendelian randomization was employed to ascertain causal relationships between significant genes and FI, and co-localization analysis was utilized to investigate shared SNPs between significant genes and FI. Results: In this study, two novel susceptibility genes associated with the risk of FI were identified through the application of four TWAS methods. Mendelian randomization demonstrated that HTT may elevate the risk of developing frailty, whereas LRPPRC could offer protection against the onset of frailty. Additionally, co-localization analysis identified a shared SNP between LRPPRC and FI. Tissue enrichment analyses revealed that genomic regions linked to SNPs associated with frailty were predominantly enriched in various brain regions, including the frontal cortex, cerebral cortex, and cerebellar hemispheres. Conditional, combined analyses, and fine mapping collectively identified two genetic regions associated with frailty: 2p21 and 4q16.3. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that the pathways associated with frailty were primarily related to the MHC complex, PD-1 signaling, cognition, inflammatory response to antigenic stimuli, and the production of second messenger molecules. Conclusion: This investigation uncovers two newly identified genes with forecasted expression levels associated with the risk of FI, offering new perspectives on the genetic architecture underlying FI.
