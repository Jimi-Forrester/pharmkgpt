11831416|t|Slowly progressive aphasia with striatal involvement.
11831416|a|We have described four patients with slowly progressive aphasia with striatal involvement occurring at different stages in the course of the illness. There were two males and two females, and their ages ranged from 68 to 76 (mean: 72) years. The extrapyramidal signs included tremors, bradykinesia, rigidity, and focal dystonia, and one had weakness resembling stroke. There is a heterogeniety among patients with slowly progressive aphasia and the clinical features correspond to the functional anatomy of the areas involved rather than to the pathology.
