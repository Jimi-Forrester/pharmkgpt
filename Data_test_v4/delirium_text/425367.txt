425367|t|[Micromethod of preparing and purifying labeled 4-methyl-5-beta-hydroxyethylthiazole].
425367|a|A micromethod is developed for production and purification of small amounts (50-60 microgram) of 35S-4-methyl-5beta-hydroxyethyl thiazole(hemineurine)--a neurotropic agent, which is promising for treatment of delirium tremens. 35S-hemineurine was obtained as follows: sulfite separation of it from pyrimidine residues and other reagents py paper electrophoresis and the subsequent elution of labelled 4-methyl-5beta-hydroxyethyl thiazole from electrophoregramms. The purity of the preparation obtained was controlled by chromatographic, chemical and spectrophotometric analysis (using pure unlabelled preparation).
