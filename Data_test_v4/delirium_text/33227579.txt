33227579|t|Association Between Small Vessel Disease Markers, Medial Temporal Lobe Atrophy and Cognitive Impairment After Stroke: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
33227579|a|OBJECTIVES: Two-thirds of stroke survivors suffer from cognitive impairment, and up to one-third of them progress to dementia. However, the underlying pathogenesis is complex and controversial. Recent evidence has found that cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) markers and the Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuroimaging marker medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTLA), alone or in combination, contribute to the pathogenesis of poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we synthesized proof for these neuroimaging risk factors among stroke patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies investigating imaging predictors of cognitive impairment or dementia following stroke. Meta-analysis was conducted to compute the odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: Thirteen studies were enrolled in the present study, and only ten of them, comprising 2713 stroke patients, were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. MTLA was significantly correlated with PSCI (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.48-2.62, I2 = 0.0%). In addition, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), as a neuroimaging marker of SVD, were associated with PSCI (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.12-1.22, I2 = 0.0%). However, the presence of lacunar infarcts and enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) were not associated with the risk of PSCI. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that MTLA and WMH were associated with an increased risk of PSCI.
