36735675|t|Photocatalysis and Kinetic Resolution by Lithiation to Give Enantioenriched 2-Arylpiperazines.
36735675|a|Piperazines are important heterocycles in drug compounds. We report the asymmetric synthesis of arylpiperazines by photocatalytic decarboxylative arylation (metallaphotoredox catalysis) then kinetic resolution using n-BuLi/(+)-sparteine. This gave a range of piperazines with very high enantioselectivities. Further functionalizations gave enantioenriched 2,2-disubstituted piperazines, and either N-substituent can be removed selectively. Late-stage functionalizations of enantioenriched piperazine derivatives were demonstrated, including synthesis of a drug compound with glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta inhibitor activity with potential for treating Alzheimer's disease.
