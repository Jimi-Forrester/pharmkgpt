30030961|a|Background This study was designed to evaluate the free radical scavenging property of chloroform extract of the bark of Stereospermum chelonoides (SCBC) and to investigate its potential in Alzheimer's disease and inflammation, two oxidative stress related disorders. Methods Preliminary phytochemical analysis and in vitro antioxidant potential of SCBC were evaluated using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay, cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) and total antioxidant capacity determination assay. Total phenol and total flavonoid contents were also determined. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) based cytotoxicity and cyto-protective assays were performed on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Thioflavin-T assay and caspase activation measurement assay were carried out to elucidate the mechanism of cytoprotection of SCBC observed here. In vivo anti-inflammatory potential was measured using croton oil and xylene induced ear edema tests. Results Phytochemical screening of SCBC revealed the presence of various phytoconstituents. Dose-dependent in vitro antioxidant activity was observed. The extract was enriched in flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds too. SCBC was found to inhibit amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta42) induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Encouraged by the cyto-protective effect, its effects on Abeta42 fibrillogenesis and caspase-3 activated apoptosis were observed. SCBC significantly slowed down the Abeta42 fibrillogenesis and caspase-3 activation in a concentration-dependent manner indicating its probable mechanism of rendering cyto-protection. SCBC has been able to reduce inflammation significantly in croton oil induced ear edema in both doses. Conclusions Thus, this study could form the basis for further study for the potential use of SCBC in oxidative stress associated cell death and inflammation.
