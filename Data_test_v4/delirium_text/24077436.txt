24077436|t|Amyloid-beta alters the DNA methylation status of cell-fate genes in an Alzheimer's disease model.
24077436|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid-beta plaques (Abeta). Despite ongoing research, some ambiguity remains surrounding the role of Abeta in the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disease. While several studies have focused on the mutations associated with AD, our understanding of the epigenetic contributions to the disease remains less clear. To that end, we determined the changes in DNA methylation in differentiated human neurons with and without Abeta treatment. DNA was isolated from neurons treated with Abeta or vehicle, and the two samples were digested with either a methylation-sensitive (HpaII) or a methylation-insensitive (MspI) restriction endonuclease. The fragments were amplified and co-hybridized to a commercial promoter microarray. Data analysis revealed a subset of genomic loci that shows a significant change in DNA methylation following Abeta treatment in comparison to the control group. After mapping these loci to nearby genes, we discovered high enrichment for cell-fate genes that control apoptosis and neuronal differentiation. Finally, we incorporated three of those genes in a possible model suggesting the means by which Abeta contributes to the brain shrinkage and memory loss seen in AD.
