38637853|a|BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine plays a pivotal role in mitigating postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction while enhancing the overall quality of life among surgical patients. Nevertheless, the influence of dexmedetomidine on such complications in various anaesthesia techniques remains inadequately explored. As such, in the present study, a meta-analysis was conducted to comprehensively evaluate its effects on postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: A number of databases were searched for randomised controlled trials comparing intravenous dexmedetomidine to other interventions in preventing postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction in non-cardiac and non-neurosurgical patients. These databases included PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Statistical analysis and graphing were performed using Review Manager, STATA, the second version of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised controlled trials, and GRADE profiler. MAIN RESULTS: This meta-analysis comprised a total of 24 randomised controlled trials, including 20 trials assessing postoperative delirium and 6 trials assessing postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Across these 24 studies, a statistically significant positive association was observed between intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine and a reduced incidence of postoperative delirium (RR: 0.55; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.64, p < 0.00001, I2 = 2%) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (RR: 0.60; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.96, p = 0.03, I2 = 60%). Subgroup analysis did not reveal a significant difference in the incidence of postoperative delirium between the general anaesthesia and non-general anaesthesia groups, but a significant difference was observed in the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Nonetheless, when the data were pooled, it was evident that the utilisation of dexmedetomidine was associated with an increased incidence of hypotension (RR: 1.42; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.86, p = 0.01, I2 = 0%) and bradycardia (RR: 1.66; 95% CI 1.23 to 2.26, p = 0.001, I2 = 0%) compared with other interventions. However, there was no significantly higher occurrence of hypertension in the DEX groups (RR = 1.35, 95% CI 0.81-2.24, p = 0.25, I2 = 0%). CONCLUSION: Compared with other interventions, intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion during non-cardiac and non-neurosurgical procedures may significantly reduce the risk of postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction. The results of subgroup analysis reveal a consistent preventive effect on postoperative delirium in both general and non-general anaesthesia groups. Meanwhile, continuous infusion during general anaesthesia was more effective in reducing the risk of cognitive dysfunction. Despite such findings, hypotension and bradycardia were more frequent in patients who received dexmedetomidine during surgery.
