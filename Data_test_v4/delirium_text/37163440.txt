37163440|t|Investigating Causality and Shared Genetic Architecture between Neurodegenerative Disorders and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
37163440|a|Published observational studies have revealed the connection between neurodegenerative disorders and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), whereas the causal association remains largely unclear. Our study aims to assess the causality and identify the shared genetic architecture between neurodegenerative disorders and IBD. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were performed to assess the causality between IBD and neurodegenerative disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS], Alzheimer's disease [AD], Parkinson's disease [PD], and multiple sclerosis [MS]). Shared genetic loci, functional interpretation, and transcriptomic profiles were further investigated in ALS and IBD. We identified that genetic predisposition to IBD was suggestively associated with lower odds of ALS (odds ratio [OR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 0.99). In contrast, IBD was not genetically associated with an increased risk of AD, PD, or MS (and vice versa). Two shared genetic loci (rs6571361 and rs7154847) were derived, and SCFD1, G2E3, and HEATR5A were further identified as novel risk genes with enriched functions related to membrane trafficking. G2E3 was differentially expressed and significantly correlated with SCFD1 in patients with ALS or IBD. Our study reveals the suggestively protective role of IBD on ALS, and does not support the causality of AD, PD, or MS on IBD (and vice versa). Our findings indicate possible shared genetic architecture and pathways between ALS and IBD. These results provide insights into the pathogenesis and therapeutics of IBD and neurodegenerative disorders.
