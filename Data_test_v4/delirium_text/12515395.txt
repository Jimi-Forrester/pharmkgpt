12515395|t|Evaluation of a Apo-1/Fas promoter polymorphism in Korean stroke patients.
12515395|a|Apoptosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Apo-1/Fas gene is one of the mediators of apoptosis in stroke. Mval polymorphism is the first polymorphic marker identified in the Apo-1/Fas gene promoter, which was typed by PCR and followed by Mval digestion and gel electrophoresis. DNA isolated from peripheral blood collected from 91 stroke patients and 103 healthy blood donors was used for genotypes of GG, GA and AA by sequence specific primer PCR. Mval polymorphism was examined based on Fas gene promotor region by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The Fas-GG genotype was the least frequent in patients with stroke and healthy controls (P = 0.57). In normal Korean controls the Mval polymorphism GA, AA and GG were 48.6%, 34.9% and 16.5%. In stroke patients were 56.2%, 29.6% and 14.2% respectively. And the allelic frequencies of Mval*2 (G) allele were less frequent than Mval*1 (A) allele in patients with stroke and healthy controls (P = 0.76). In normal Korean controls Mval*1 (A) and Mval*2 (G) alleles were 59.2% and 40.8%. In stroke patients were 57.6% and 42.4%, respectively. Our results, pending confirmation in a larger study, indicate that the Fas genotype may not appear to be a risk factor for stroke in Korean stroke patients.
