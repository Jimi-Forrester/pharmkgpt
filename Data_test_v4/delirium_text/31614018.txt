31614018|a|OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease and related neuropathologies contribute to the association between hospitalization and cognitive decline in old age. METHODS: As part of a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study, 526 older persons (mean age at death = 90.9 years, 71% female) without dementia at baseline completed annual cognitive testing and were autopsied at death. Hospitalization information was obtained from linked Medicare claims records. Neuropathologic examination assessed beta-amyloid burden, tau tangle density, neocortical Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, chronic gross and microscopic cerebral infarcts, and transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa. RESULTS: Over a mean of 5.1 years, a total of 1,383 hospitalizations occurred, and the mean annual rate of hospitalization was 0.5 (standard deviation = 0.6, median = 0.4). Higher rate of hospitalization was not directly related to higher burden for any of the neuropathologic markers. Higher rate of hospitalization was associated with more rapid cognitive decline (estimate = -0.042, standard error [SE] = 0.012, p < 0.001), and after controlling for all 7 neuropathologic markers, the association was essentially the same (estimate = -0.040, SE = 0.013, p = 0.002). In a multivariable model with 3-way interactions of neuropathologic markers with hospitalization rate and time, the association between hospitalization rate and faster cognitive decline was greater in persons with more tangle pathology (estimate for interaction = -0.007, SE = 0.002, p = 0.002) and in persons with neocortical Lewy bodies (estimate for interaction = -0.117, SE = 0.042, p = 0.005). INTERPRETATION: Older persons with more hospitalizations experienced faster rates of cognitive decline, and this association was more pronounced in persons with more tau tangle density and with neocortical Lewy body pathologies.
