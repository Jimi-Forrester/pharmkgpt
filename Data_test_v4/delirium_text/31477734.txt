31477734|t|Acetyl-CoA flux regulates the proteome and acetyl-proteome to maintain intracellular metabolic crosstalk.
31477734|a|AT-1/SLC33A1 is a key member of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) acetylation machinery, transporting acetyl-CoA from the cytosol into the ER lumen where acetyl-CoA serves as the acetyl-group donor for Nepsilon-lysine acetylation. Dysfunctional ER acetylation, as caused by heterozygous or homozygous mutations as well as gene duplication events of AT-1/SLC33A1, has been linked to both developmental and degenerative diseases. Here, we investigate two models of AT-1 dysregulation and altered acetyl-CoA flux: AT-1S113R/+ mice, a model of AT-1 haploinsufficiency, and AT-1 sTg mice, a model of AT-1 overexpression. The animals display distinct metabolic adaptation across intracellular compartments, including reprogramming of lipid metabolism and mitochondria bioenergetics. Mechanistically, the perturbations to AT-1-dependent acetyl-CoA flux result in global and specific changes in both the proteome and the acetyl-proteome (protein acetylation). Collectively, our results suggest that AT-1 acts as an important metabolic regulator that maintains acetyl-CoA homeostasis by promoting functional crosstalk between different intracellular organelles.
