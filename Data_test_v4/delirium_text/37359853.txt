37359853|t|Neural basis of the attention bias during addiction stroop task in methamphetamine-dependent patients with and without a history of psychosis: an ERP study.
37359853|a|Background: Attentional bias plays an important role in sustaining various types of drug addiction. No prior studies examined methamphetamine (MA)-associated psychosis (MAP) relationships between ERP time course and performance on an addiction Stroop task in MA abusers. The aim of the present study was to determine whether MA abusers with (MAP+) or without (MAP-) psychosis exhibit alterations of the ERP during the addiction Stroop task. Methods: Thirty-one healthy controls (CTRL), 14 MAP-, and 24 MAP+ participants were recruited and completed the addiction Stroop task during EEG recording using 32 electrodes. Group variations were compared on measures of behavioral task performance and event-related potentials (ERP) of performance monitoring (N200, P300, N450). The Barratt impulsiveness scores were analyzed to investigate correlations with ERP changes. Results: MA-related word stimulus elicited a more negative N200 amplitude over left-anterior electrodes in MAP- abusers; furthermore, a positive association between the N200 amplitude and Barratt attentional scores and non-planning scores was observed, while no such differences were found in MAP+ abusers. There were no significant differences in reaction time (RT) and error rate between each group. Conclusion: This is the first study to examine psychosis relationships between ERP time course and performance on an addiction Stroop task in MA abusers with or without psychosis. These findings support the association between attentional bias measured by the MA addiction Stroop task and N200 component as well as indicate the possibility of using this cognitive task in combination with ERP technology to detect psychosis factors among abstinent MA abusers.
