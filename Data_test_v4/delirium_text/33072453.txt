33072453|a|Cognitive decline is a common issue seen in older adults in the primary care setting. Assessment of cognitive decline in primary care includes a detailed history, physical examination, labs, imaging, and a formal cognitive assessment. Various tools are available for cognitive assessments. However, a short screening tool is more practical for cognitive evaluation. A decline in cognition should be correlated with the broader clinical picture, and a detailed cognitive assessment should be performed.
