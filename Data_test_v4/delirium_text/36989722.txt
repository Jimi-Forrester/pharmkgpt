36989722|a|N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a ubiquitous mRNA modification in eukaryotes. m6A occurs through the action of methyltransferases, demethylases, and methylation-binding proteins. m6A methylation of RNA is associated with various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), depression, cerebral apoplexy, brain injury, epilepsy, cerebral arteriovenous malformations, and glioma. Furthermore, recent studies report that m6A-related drugs have attracted considerable concerns in the therapeutic areas of neurological disorders. Here, we mainly summarized the role of m6A modification in neurological diseases and the therapeutic potential of m6A-related drugs. The aim of this review is expected to be useful to systematically assess m6A as a new potential biomarker and develop innovative modulators of m6A for the amelioration and treatment of neurological disorders.
