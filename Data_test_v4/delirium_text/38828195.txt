38828195|t|Brain Targeting Nanomedicines: Pitfalls and Promise.
38828195|a|Brain diseases are the most devastating problem among the world's increasingly aging population, and the number of patients with neurological diseases is expected to increase in the future. Although methods for delivering drugs to the brain have advanced significantly, none of these approaches provide satisfactory results for the treatment of brain diseases. This remains a challenge due to the unique anatomy and physiology of the brain, including tight regulation and limited access of substances across the blood-brain barrier. Nanoparticles are considered an ideal drug delivery system to hard-to-reach organs such as the brain. The development of new drugs and new nanomaterial-based brain treatments has opened various opportunities for scientists to develop brain-specific delivery systems that could improve treatment outcomes for patients with brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke and brain tumors. In this review, we discuss noteworthy literature that examines recent developments in brain-targeted nanomedicines used in the treatment of neurological diseases.
