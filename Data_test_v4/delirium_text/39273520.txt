39273520|t|Body Composition and Alzheimer's Disease: A Holistic Review.
39273520|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a significant global health challenge and affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. This overview of published reviews provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate correlations between AD and body composition, focusing particularly on obesity. We used a systematic approach to collect and analyze relevant reviews on the topic of obesity and Alzheimer's disease. A comprehensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, was conducted. We searched keywords such as "Alzheimer's disease", "body composition", "lean mass", "bone mass", and "fat mass". We considered only reviews written within the past 5 years and in English. Fifty-six relevant reviews were identified that shed light on the multiple connections between AD and body composition. The review involves several aspects, including the impact of lean mass, bone mass, and endocrinological factors related to obesity, as well as inflammation, neuroinflammation, and molecular/genetic factors. The findings highlight the complex interplay of these elements in the development of AD, underscoring the need for holistic approaches to reduce the risk of AD and to explore innovative strategies for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.
