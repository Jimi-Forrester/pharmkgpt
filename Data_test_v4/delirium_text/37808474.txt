37808474|a|Recent studies promote new interest in the intersectionality between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Alzheimer's Disease. We have reported high levels of Amyloid-beta Precursor Protein (APP) and secreted APP-alpha (sAPPa) and low levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides 1-40 and 1-42 (Abeta40, Abeta42) in plasma and brain tissue from children with ASD. A higher incidence of microcephaly (head circumference less than the 3rd percentile) associates with ASD compared to head size in individuals with typical development. The role of Abeta peptides as contributors to acquired microcephaly in ASD is proposed. Abeta may lead to microcephaly via disruption of neurogenesis, elongation of the G1/S cell cycle, and arrested cell cycle promoting apoptosis. As the APP gene exists on Chromosome 21, excess Abeta peptides occur in Trisomy 21-T21 (Down's Syndrome). Microcephaly and some forms of ASD associate with T21, and therefore potential mechanisms underlying these associations will be examined in this review. Abeta peptides' role in other neurodevelopmental disorders that feature ASD and acquired microcephaly are reviewed, including dup 15q11.2-q13, Angelman and Rett syndrome.
