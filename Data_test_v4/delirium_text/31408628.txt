31408628|a|Growing evidences demonstrate that chemokines and chemokine receptors are up-regulated in resident central nervous system cells during Alzheimer's disease contributing to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Prokineticin 2 belongs to a new family of chemokines which recently emerged as a critical player in immune system and inflammatory diseases. Since pharmacological blockade in vitro of the prokineticin system is able to antagonize Amyloid beta-induced neurotoxicity, the aim of the present study was to investigate in vivo effects of prokineticin receptor antagonist PC1 on memory impairment in a rodent model of Alzheimer's disease. Rats were intracerebroventricular infused with Abeta1-42 and behavioral responses as well as the expression profile in hippocampus of prokineticin 2 and its receptors were investigated. Results demonstrated that Abeta1-42-infused rats developed significant memory impairments together with a marked up-regulation of both prokineticin 2 and its receptors in hippocampal neurons and astrocytes. Treatment with PC1 significantly improved learning capability of Abeta1-42-infused rats restoring the balance of prokineticin system. This study pointed to a neuroprotective role of PC1 on Abeta1-42-induced memory deficits that could be ascribed to the ability of PC1 to modulate rat hippocampal prokineticin system and to recover the impaired Abeta1-42-induced neurogenesis. This suggests that prokineticin system antagonism could be considered as a new approach for the study of AD etiopathology.
