35469048|a|Growth hormone (GH) transgenesis can be used to manipulate the growth performance of fish and mammals. In this study, homozygous and hemizygous GH-transgenic amago salmon (Oncorhynchus masou ishikawae) derived from a single female exhibited hypoglycemia. Proteomic and signal network analyses using iTRAQ indicated a decreased NAD+/NADH ratio in transgenic fish, indicative of reduced mitochondrial ND1 function and ROS levels. Mitochondrial DNA sequencing revealed that approximately 28% of the deletion mutations in the GH homozygous- and hemizygous-female-derived mitochondrial DNA occurred in ND1. These fish also displayed decreased ROS levels. Our results indicate that GH transgenesis in amago salmon may induce specific deletion mutations that are maternally inherited over generations and alter energy production.
