35843408|t|Therapeutic and palliative role of a Unani herbal decoction in COVID-19 and similar respiratory viral illnesses: Phytochemical & pharmacological perspective.
35843408|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Outbreaks of respiratory viral infections like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome, and Coronavirus Disease-2019 have been a regular occurrence in the past 100 years. A significant proportion of the morbidity and mortality in influenza is attributed to the co-morbidities and complications induced by the disease, involving the vital organs and physiological functions. In this context, traditional medicines offer effective protective, palliative, and therapeutic benefits, as observed in several studies on various types of influenza, including COVID-19. The Unani herbal decoction comprising of 'Unnab (Ziziphus jujuba Mill. fruit), Sapistan (Cordia dichotoma G. Forst. fruit), and Behidana (Cydonia oblonga Mill. seed) was originally prescribed by Hakim Ajmal Khan (1868-1927 AD) for various respiratory ailments as a bronchodilator, anti-inflammatory, and for clearing the respiratory tract. During COVID-19, the decoction was prescribed by the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy (AYUSH), Government of India, for mild patients in home isolation, and also as a self-care drink for healthy people. Preliminary studies are of the view that the decoction could reduce COVID-19 incidence and prevent severe disease in the population where it was administered. AIMS OF THE STUDY: We intend to review the pharmacological activity of the Unani decoction ingredients, i.e., Z. jujuba, C. dichotoma, and C. oblonga, in context with respiratory viral infections and their co-morbidities, to develop an understanding of its action mechanism. METHODOLOGY: We reviewed Unani classical textbooks for information on the therapeutic activity of the decoction ingredients. Scientific studies published in English from the year 2000 onwards on leading scientific websites (PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Springer) were searched for information regarding the efficacy of the drugs in influenza and its common complications. Non-English language articles, or those published prior to 2000, and those which included plant parts other than those traditionally included in the decoction were excluded. OBSERVATIONS: A wide range of therapeutic and palliative effects have been observed in the three herbs included in the Unani decoction, including anti-viral, anti-bacterial, immuno-modulatory, anti-inflammatory, hepato-, and nephroprotective, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-tussive, broncho-dilatory, and regulation of gut microbiota. Together, these effects can help to mitigate and prevent most of the complications caused as a result of respiratory viral infections. CONCLUSION: The combined effects of ingredients in this Unani herbal decoction can potentially help to mitigate most of the pathological changes and complications caused by influenza viruses. With further clinical research, the decoction may be potentially utilized as a prophylactic and therapeutic against viral influenza.
