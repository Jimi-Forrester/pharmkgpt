36368654|a|PURPOSE: The mean perfusion pressure (MPP) was recently proposed to personalized management tissue perfusion pressure in critically ill patients. Increased MPP variability (MPPV) may be associated with organ injuries. Our objective was to determine if increased MPPV was associated with subsequent deterioration of renal function in critically ill patients. METHODS: We analyzed data stored in the eICU-CRD and MIMIC-IV databases. The exposure was MPPV, measured as the coefficient of variation (CV) using the MPP data of the first 24 h after first ICU admission. The primary endpoint was deterioration of renal function, defined as new-onset or progress of acute kidney injury between 24 and 72 h after ICU admission. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 8,590 patients from eICU-CRD and 6,723 patients from MIMIC-IV database. A total of 28.4% and 30.2% of the study population experienced deteriorated renal function, respectively. Patients with deteriorated renal function had significantly higher median MPP-CV compared with those without (12.2% vs 11.5% and 12.8% vs 12.5%, p < .001). In fully adjusted multivariate logistic models, higher MPP-CV (adjusted OR per 1-SD, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13 and adjusted OR per 1-SD, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.00-1.12, respectively) was significantly associated with greater risk of primary endpoint. The pooled analyses showed heterogeneity in patients with cardiac surgery, medical sepsis and others. CONCLUSION: Increased MPPV was associated with an increased risk of subsequent deterioration of renal function in critically ill patients with central venous pressure monitoring. Maintaining stable MPP may reduce the risk of renal function deterioration.
