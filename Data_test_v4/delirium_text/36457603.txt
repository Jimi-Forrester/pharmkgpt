36457603|t|A Bitter Experience That Enlightens the Future: COVID-19 Neurological Affection and Perspectives on the Orexigenic System.
36457603|a|The history of coronaviruses revealed that these viruses caused multiple outbreaks in the past, including a previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. In 2019, a novel SARS virus, SARS-CoV-2, started a drastic pandemic that, up till now, keeps peaking in successive waves owing to the mutational ability of the virus versus the short-term immunity against it. Although the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the gate through which the virus gets access to human cells, yet ACE2 is deemed protective in lung injury yielding vasodilator, anti-fibrotic, and anti-inflammatory peptides. The viral-provoked ACE2 downregulation aggravated a subsequent potentially lethal cytokine storm. Both the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) receptor (TNFR), activated by the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-alpha, released during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and ACE2 are cleaved by tumor necrosis convertase enzyme (TACE) to render respective soluble decoy mediators. Several risk factors were linked to COVID-19 morbidity and neurological affection, including obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM), attributed to ACE2 overexpression in obesity, a low-grade inflammatory state with both obesity and DM, and defective lung reparative machinery, added to low tissue-to-lung ACE2 expression in DM. The ACE2 shedding by SARS-CoV-2 upon its entry into the brain, together with the inflammatory cytokines invading the brain, predispose to such neurological affection. However, ACE2 was not sufficient to justify the occurrence of neurological disorders with COVID-19, owing to its lower brain expression, relative to other tissues. Other mediators should have contributed to such neurological disorders, of which, orexins (OXs) are discussed, owing to multiple functional similarities to ACE2. Eventually, this review highlights such similarities selected according to their possible relevance to COVID-19 symptomatology and pathology. Both ACE2 and OXs confer anti-inflammatory benefits, reduce cerebral endothelial dysfunction, promote neuronal survival and neurogenesis, and add to their therapeutic potentiality in sepsis. Both ACE2 and OXs assist in moderating the stress responses and the stress-activated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Both ACE2 and OXs are affected by obesity and DM. The loss of ACE2 and OXs signaling was suggested in neuro-inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Of interest is the abundance of OXs in the dissemination routes to the brain, namely, the peripheral olfactory and the enteric systems. The presumptive role of OXs as analgesics and antipyretics might add to their favorable profile. Advantageously, the availability of OXs agonists and antagonists makes it applicable to corroborate or abrogate the future utility of targeting the orexigenic system in terms of COVID-19 neurological affection. Elaborative work, exploring in vitro and in vivo models, is recommended to identify or deny such perspective involvement.
