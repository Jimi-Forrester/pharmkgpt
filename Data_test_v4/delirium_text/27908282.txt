27908282|t|Role of geriatric intervention in the treatment of older patients with cancer: rationale and design of a phase III multicenter trial.
27908282|a|BACKGROUND: In the general geriatric population, programs linking geriatric evaluation with interventions are effective for improving functional status and survival of the patients. Whether or not these interventions improve health related quality of life (HRQoL) or overall survival (OS) in older patients with cancer is not yet clear. Indeed, randomized data on the effect of such interventions on survival and HRQoL are rare and conflicting. We describe the rationale and design of a phase III multicenter trial aimed at assessing the efficacy of geriatric intervention in the management of elderly patients with cancer. METHODS/DESIGN: Approximately 1200 patients, 70 years and older, considered in need of a geriatric intervention based on the G8 screening tool will be randomized into two intervention arms. The 'Usual-care' arm involves standard oncological care based on pre-defined oncological protocols. In addition to the standard oncological care, the 'Case-management' arm involves a multidimensional geriatric assessment and interventions tailored for the patient. Efficacy will be assessed using a co-primary endpoint encompassing OS and HRQoL. DISCUSSION: This trial has been designed to assess whether focused geriatric case management can either improve OS or HRQoL in elderly cancer patients considered in need of geriatric assessment.
