35625794|t|Cellular Stress Induces Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Deficits Independent of Stress Granules.
35625794|a|Stress granules are non-membrane bound granules temporarily forming in the cytoplasm in response to stress. Proteins of the nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery were found in these stress granules and it was suggested that stress granules contribute to the nucleocytoplasmic transport defects in several neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a causal link between stress granule formation and nucleocytoplasmic transport deficits. Therefore, we uncoupled stress granule formation from cellular stress while studying nuclear import. This was carried out by preventing cells from assembling stress granules despite being subjected to cellular stress either by knocking down both G3BP1 and G3BP2 or by pharmacologically inhibiting stress granule formation. Conversely, we induced stress granules by overexpressing G3BP1 in the absence of cellular stress. In both conditions, nuclear import was not affected demonstrating that stress granule formation is not a direct cause of stress-induced nucleocytoplasmic transport deficits.
