36219258|t|Development of immunohistochemistry for detecting fluvoxamine in rat tissues using newly prepared monoclonal antibody: its precise localization in small intestine, kidney, and liver of rats.
36219258|a|A monoclonal antibody (mAb) was produced against a fluvoxamine (FLV)-bovine serum albumin conjugate that was specific to both the conjugate and free form of FLV. The mAb enabled us to develop an immunohistochemistry (IHC) method for pharmacokinetic analysis of FLV at the cell and tissue levels. We demonstrated that IHC can be used to detect the localization of FLV in the small intestine, kidney, and liver 1 h after drug administration at the cell and tissue levels. Protease digestion is an important factor for obtaining appropriate IHC staining results for localization of drugs. In this study, precise FLV localization could be determined with only 1 h of protease digestion in the kidneys, but in the small intestine and liver, the staining results with two digestive conditions had to be merged. IHC provided new findings, such as (1) nerve cells are likely to uptake more FLV than other cells and tissues; (2) the ability of reabsorption and secretion in the kidney varies depending on the site, and the amount of FLV in the primary urine is regulated downstream of the proximal tubule S3 segment; and (3) some of the FLV is excreted in the bile.
