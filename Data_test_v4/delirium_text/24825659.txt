24825659|a|Secondary structural transitions from alpha-helix to beta-sheet conformations are observed in several misfolding diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Determining factors contributing favorably to the formation of each of these secondary structures is therefore essential to better understand these disease states. beta-hairpin peptides form basic components of anti-parallel beta-sheets and are suitable model systems for characterizing the fundamental forces stabilizing beta-sheets in fibrillar structures. In this study, we explore the free energy landscape of the model beta-hairpin peptide GB1 and its E2 isoform that preferentially adopts alpha-helical conformations at ambient conditions. Umbrella sampling simulations using all-atom models and explicit solvent are performed over a large range of end-to-end distances. Our results show the strong preference of GB1 and the E2 isoform for beta-hairpin and alpha-helical conformations, respectively, consistent with previous studies. We show that the unfolded states of GB1 are largely populated by misfolded beta-hairpin structures which differ from each other in the position of the beta-turn. We discuss the energetic factors contributing favorably to the formation of alpha-helix and beta-hairpin conformations in these peptides and highlight the energetic role of hydrogen bonds and non-bonded interactions.
