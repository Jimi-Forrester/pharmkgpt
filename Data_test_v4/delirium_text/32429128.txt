32429128|a|The hippocampus is central for higher cognition and emotions. In patients suffering from neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative diseases, hippocampal signaling is altered causing cognitive defects. Thus, therapeutic approaches aim at improving cognition by targeting the hippocampus. Enhanced physical activity (EPA) improves cognition in rodents and humans. A systematic screen, however, for expression changes in the hippocampus along the dorso-ventral axis is missing, which is a prerequisite for understanding molecular mechanisms. Here, we exploited label free mass spectrometry to detect proteomic changes in the hippocampus of male mice upon voluntary wheel running. To identify regional differences, we examined dorsal and ventral CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus hippocampal subregions. We found metabolic enzymes and actin binding proteins, such as RhoA, being upregulated in the hippocampus upon EPA suggesting a coordination between metabolism and cytoskeleton remodeling; two pathways essential for synaptic plasticity. Strikingly, dorsal and ventral hippocampal subregions respond differentially to EPA. Together, our results provide new insight into proteomic adaptations driven by physical activity in mice. In addition, our results suggest that dorsal and ventral hippocampus, as well as hippocampal subregions themselves, contribute differently to this process. Our study therefore provides an important resource for studying hippocampal subregion diversity in response to EPA.
