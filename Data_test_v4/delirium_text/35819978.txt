In phase 1, one of the combinations was administered intramuscularly to miniature pigs. The KMXS protocol combined 10 mg kg-1 ketamine, 0.5 mg kg-1 midazolam, and 2 mg kg-1 xylazine with 2 mug kg-1 sufentanil. The TZX protocol combined 2.2 mg kg-1 tiletamine, 2.2 mg kg-1 zolazepam, and 1.4 mg kg-1 xylazine. After treatment, the mean arterial pressure, systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, peripheral hemoglobin oxygen saturation, rectal temperature, and anesthesia quality were recorded. In phase 2, the feasibility of KMXS and TZX as general anesthetics were evaluated for pig castration. In phase 1, both drug combinations provided smooth induction with similar anesthetic effects. The KMXS protocol provided moderate anesthesia for 60-70 minutes in pigs, while the TZX protocol provided 30-45 minutes. In phase 2, castration was completed smoothly in all pigs with little fluctuation in physiological variables. The KMXS protocol is better for medium-term anesthesia, while the TZX protocol is preferable for short-term anesthesia in pigs.
