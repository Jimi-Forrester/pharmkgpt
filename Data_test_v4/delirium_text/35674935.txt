35674935|a|We evaluated whether biomarkers of age-related neuronal injury and amyloid metabolism are associated with neurocognitive impairment (NCI) in people with and without HIV (PWH, PWoH). This was a cross-sectional study of virally suppressed PWH and PWoH. NCI was assessed using a validated test battery; global deficit scores (GDS) quantified overall performance. Biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were quantified by immunoassay: neurofilament light (NFL), total Tau (tTau), phosphorylated Tau 181 (pTau181), amyloid beta (Abeta)42, and Abeta40. Factor analysis was used to reduce biomarker dimensionality. Participants were 256 virally suppressed PWH and 42 PWoH, 20.2% female, 17.1% Black, 7.1% Hispanic, 60.2% non-Hispanic White, and 15.6% other race/ethnicities, mean (SD) age 56.7 (6.45) years. Among PWH, the best regression model for CSF showed that higher tTau (beta = 0.723, p = 3.79e-5) together with lower pTau181 (beta = -0.510, p = 0.0236) best-predicted poor neurocognitive performance. In univariable analysis, only higher tTau was significantly correlated with poor neurocognitive performance (tTau r = 0.214, p = 0.0006; pTau181 r = 0.00248, p = 0.969). Among PWoH, no CSF biomarkers were significantly associated with worse NCI. Predicted residual error sum of squares (PRESS) analysis showed no evidence of overfitting. Poorer neurocognitive performance in aging PWH was associated with higher CSF tTau, a marker of age-related neuronal injury, but not with biomarkers of amyloid metabolism. The findings suggest that HIV might interact with age-related neurodegeneration to contribute to cognitive decline in PWH.
