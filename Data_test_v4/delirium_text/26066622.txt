26066622|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Memantine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the effect of memantine on patients with mild-to-moderate AD is unclear. METHODS: This study is a post hoc analysis of a double-blind clinical trial. Donepezil was used as the standard control treatment. Outcomes included score changes from baseline to week 24 on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog), a modified 20-item Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADL), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as well as the score of the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-Plus). RESULTS: One hundred sixty-seven AD patients with an MMSE score of 10-24 were analyzed. No significant differences in the score changes from baseline to week 24 on all outcomes or the four subscales of the ADAS-cog were observed between the two treatment groups. Donepezil resulted in an improved score for naming ability on the ADAS-cog compared to memantine (p = 0.036), whereas memantine more effectively reduced agitation as measured by the NPI compared to donepezil (p = 0.039). CONCLUSION: These findings support the efficacy of memantine for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD, especially in patients with agitation.
