27012954|a|BACKGROUND: At present, much attention has been focused on the beneficial effects of natural products on the human health due to their high efficacy and low adverse effects. Among them, polyphenolic compounds are known as one of the most important and common classes of natural products, which possess multiple range of health-promotion effects including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. A plethora of scientific evidence has shown that polyphenolic compounds possess beneficial effects on the central nervous system. METHODS: Data were collected from Web of Science (ISI Web of Knowledge), Medline, Pubmed, Scopus, Embase, and BIOSIS Previews (from 1950 to 2015), through searching of these keywords: "chlorogenic acid and mental diseases" and "chlorogenic acid and neuroprotection". RESULTS: Chlorogenic acid is known as one of the most common polyphenolic compounds, and is found in different types of fruits and vegetables, spices, wine, olive oil, as well as coffee. The potential neuroprotective effects of chlorogenic acid have been highlighted in several in vitro and in vivo studies. This review critically analyses the available scientific evidence regarding the neuroprotective effects of chlorogenic acid, and its neuropharmacological mechanisms of action. In addition, we also discuss its biosynthesis, sources, bioavailability and metabolism, to provide a broad perspective of the therapeutic implications of this compound in brain health and disease. CONCLUSION: The present review showed that chlorogenic acid possesses neuroprotective effects under the both in vitro and in vivo models.
