33488579|a|Bacterial DNAs are constantly detected in atherosclerotic plaques (APs), suggesting that a combination of chronic infection and inflammation may have roles in AP formation. A series of studies suggested that certain Gram-negative bacteria were able to interact with dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin [DC-SIGN; cluster of differentiation (CD) 209] or langerin (CD207), thereby resulting in deposition of CD209s at infection sites. We wondered if Proteus mirabilis (a member of Proteobacteria family) could interact with APs through CD209/CD207. In this study, we first demonstrated that CD209/CD207 were also receptors for P. mirabilis that mediated adherence and phagocytosis by macrophages. P. mirabilis interacted with fresh and CD209s/CD207-expressing APs cut from human coronary arteries, rather than in healthy and smooth arteries. These interactions were inhibited by addition of a ligand-mimic oligosaccharide and the coverage of the ligand, as well as by anti-CD209 antibody. Finally, the hearts from an atherosclerotic mouse model contained higher numbers of P. mirabilis than that of control mice during infection-challenging. We therefore concluded that the P. mirabilis interacts with APs in human coronary arteries via CD209s/CD207. It may be possible to slow down the progress of atherosclerosis by blocking the interactions between CD209s/CD207 and certain atherosclerosis-involved bacteria with ligand-mimic oligosaccharides.
