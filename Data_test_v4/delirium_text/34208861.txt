34208861|t|Acute Toxic and Genotoxic Effects of Aluminum and Manganese Using In Vitro Models.
34208861|a|The objective of this study was to use the same concentrations of aluminum (Al) and manganese (Mn) detected previously in groundwater above those permitted by Brazilian law and assess their cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in hamster ovary cell lines and their mutagenic effects through the Salmonella microsome assay. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and CHO-XRS5 cells were treated with different concentrations of Al and Mn (0.2 to 2.0 mg/L and 0.1 to 3.0 mg/L, respectively). The Ames test was used to analyze the concentrations of Al and Mn ranging from 0.025 to 1.0 mg/L and 0.0125 to 1.5 mg/L, respectively. Both metals showed cytotoxic effects on both cell lines and two bacterial strains (TA98 and TA100). The genotoxic effects of the highest concentrations of Al and Mn in cell lines showed nuclear buds, micronuclei, and DNA damage; however, none of the concentrations showed a positive mutagenic response in the Ames test. This is one of the few studies to demonstrate the cytotoxic effects of Al and Mn through the Ames test. In addition, the metals caused genomic instability in cell lines. Therefore, this study may help hasten the review of established regulatory standards for human consumption of groundwater.
