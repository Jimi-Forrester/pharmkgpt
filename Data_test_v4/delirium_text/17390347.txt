17390347|t|Gradient-echo and CRAZED imaging for minute detection of Alzheimer plaques in an APPV717I x ADAM10-dn mouse model.
17390347|a|Different strategies to visualize amyloid plaques with MRI at 17.6 Tesla were investigated in a novel mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Large iron-containing plaques were observed in the thalamus, but cortical plaques did not show iron deposits. Plaques in the thalamus were visualized in vivo with the use of low-resolution, 3D gradient-echo (GRE) imaging in 82 s, and with 94-microm resolution in 34 min. The feasibility of obtaining bright contrast from plaques using the COSY revamped with asymmetric z-GRE detection (CRAZED) technique was investigated in experiments on fixed brains. The original CRAZED approach provided reduced signal near the plaques (similarly to GRE imaging) and additionally emphasized small structures in the brain. In CRAZED images acquired with mismatched gradients, elevated signal near the plaques was obtained, while background signal was suppressed almost to the noise level. Bright-contrast images were acquired in 2.6 min with the use of a 2D GRE sequence with slightly mismatched slice refocusing gradients. For future detection of plaques in patients, such bright-contrast visualization protocols may be of particular value when contrast agents that allow labeling of early plaques with iron oxide nanoparticles become available.
