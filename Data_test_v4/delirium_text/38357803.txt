38357803|a|Neuronal death, decreased activity or dysfunction of neurotransmitters are some of the pathophysiological reasons for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis. Also, there is evidence for the role of infections and infectious agents in neurodegenerative diseases and the effect of some metabolites in microorganisms in the pathophysiology of these diseases. In this study, we intend to evaluate the existing studies on the role of infectious agents and their metabolites on the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science search engines were searched. Some infectious agents have been observed in neurodegenerative diseases. Also, isolations of some fungi and microalgae have an improving effect on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.
