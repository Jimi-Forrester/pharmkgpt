36613586|t|Updates on the Role of Probiotics against Different Health Issues: Focus on Lactobacillus.
36613586|a|This review article is built on the beneficial effects of Lactobacillus against different diseases, and a special focus has been made on its effects against neurological disorders, such as depression, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Probiotics are live microbes, which are found in fermented foods, beverages, and cultured milk and, when administered in an adequate dose, confer health benefits to the host. They are known as "health-friendly bacteria", normally residing in the human gut and involved in maintaining homeostatic conditions. Imbalance in gut microbiota results in the pathophysiology of several diseases entailing the GIT tract, skin, immune system, inflammation, and gut-brain axis. Recently, the use of probiotics has gained tremendous interest, because of their profound effects on the management of these disease conditions. Recent findings suggest that probiotics enrichment in different human and mouse disease models showed promising beneficial effects and results in the amelioration of disease symptoms. Thus, this review focuses on the current probiotics-based products, different disease models, variable markers measured during trials, and evidence obtained from past studies on the use of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of different diseases, covering the skin to the central nervous system diseases.
