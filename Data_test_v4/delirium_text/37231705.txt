37231705|t|Caregiving for Older Adults With Dementia During the Time of COVID-19: A Multi-State Exploratory Qualitative Study.
37231705|a|This qualitative semi-structured interview study explores how 64 family caregivers for older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias across eight states experienced and executed caregiving decisions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, caregivers experienced challenges communicating with loved ones and healthcare workers in all care settings. Second, caregivers displayed resilient coping strategies in adapting to pandemic restrictions, finding novel strategies to balance risks while preserving communication, oversight, and safety. Third, many caregivers modified care arrangements, with some avoiding and others embracing institutional care. Finally, caregivers reflected on the benefits and challenges of pandemic-related innovations. Certain policy changes reduced caregiver burden and could improve care access if made permanent. Telemedicine's increasing use highlights the need for reliable internet access and accommodations for individuals with cognitive deficits. Public policies must pay greater attention to challenges faced by family caregivers, whose labor is both essential and undervalued.
