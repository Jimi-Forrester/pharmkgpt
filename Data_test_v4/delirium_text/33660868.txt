33660868|a|INTRODUCTION: Nusinersen was approved as the first treatment for all types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), including adults with SMA types 2 and 3. Robust biomarkers of treatment response in SMA adults are lacking. Our aim was to examine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta40 (Abeta40) and amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42) peptides as biomarkers of treatment response. METHODS: Eight patients with SMA types 2 and 3 were recruited consecutively in a single-center study. CSF was sampled at baseline, after a loading dose, and after three maintenance doses. Levels of Abeta42 and Abeta40 were evaluated for each CSF sampling. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used to detect longitudinal changes. RESULTS: CSF levels of Abeta42 increased from baseline to day 420 (95% confidence interval, P = .018), with a significant increase at days 180 and 420 compared with days 0 and 300, respectively (95% confidence interval, P = .012 and P = .018). DISCUSSION: The maintenance and promotion of wellness of residual motor neurons mediated by the restored level of SMN protein due to nusinersen could result in an increased level of amyloid peptides.
