39498227|a|Background: Inpatients are at higher risk of Drug Therapy Related Problems (DTRPs), and early identification and management of these DTRPs is crucial for optimal treatment outcomes and ensuring rational drug therapy. Objective: This study aims to assess DTRPs in a general medicine ward of a tertiary care hospital in eastern Nepal. Methods: A three-month prospective observational study was conducted on inpatients admitted to the general medicine ward of the hospital. Pharmacists routinely performed patient drug therapy reviews, by which suspected DTRPs were identified and recorded as per the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe Association (PCNE) v.9.1 guidelines. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine the influence of predictor variables on the occurrence of DTRPs. Results: A total of 301 inpatients were enrolled, out of which 233 (77.4%) had one or more DTRPs. Altogether, 528 DTRPs with an average of 2.27 +- 0.92 DTRPs per patient were identified. The primary causes of the DTRPs were drug selection (40.47%), treatment duration (16.71%), dispensing (15.75%), and dose selection (13.12%). Antimicrobials were involved in 55.18% of the DTRPs. DTRPs were more prevalent in elderly, comorbid patients, patients with longer hospital stay days, and polypharmacy, which was statistically significant (p<0.05). Furthermore, multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that geriatric patients had a higher risk of experiencing DTRPs, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.832 (1.021-3.286) at p-value < 0.05. Conclusion: DTRPs are frequently prevalent in hospital wards, emphasizing the crucial role of clinical pharmacists in identifying, resolving, and preventing DTRPs in inpatient settings for optimal treatment outcomes.
