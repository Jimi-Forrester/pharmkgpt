Many recent studies have found that uric acid plays an important role in cognitive impairment, although the effects of uric acid on MCI are not clear. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between uric acid and MCI. METHODS: Using a random sampling method, this study investigated 58 patients with MCI and 57 healthy elderly from January 2016 to November 2016. Demographic information was collected, the subjects were evaluated using the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), and uric acid was measured in fasting venous blood. RESULTS: A total of 57 (49.6%) participants are healthy and 58 (50.4%) participants had MCI. The uric acid level was significantly lower in the patients with MCI (292.28+-63.71 mumol/L) than in the normal controls (322.49+-78.70 mumol/L; P<0.05). There were significant positive correlations between the MMSE scores, for each dimension and the total score, and uric acid level (all P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression models illustrated that uric acid was a protective factor for MCI (odds ratio =0.999, 95% CI =0.987-0.999). CONCLUSION: A low uric acid level is a risk factor for MCI, and an appropriate increase in uric acid can be used to slow down the occurrence and development of MCI.
