38749544|a|Calcium signaling is integral for neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. We demonstrate that the calcium response generated by different sources modulates neuronal activity-mediated protein synthesis, another process essential for synaptic plasticity. Stimulation of NMDARs generates a protein synthesis response involving three phases-increased translation inhibition, followed by a decrease in translation inhibition, and increased translation activation. We show that these phases are linked to NMDAR-mediated calcium response. Calcium influx through NMDARs elicits increased translation inhibition, which is necessary for the successive phases. Calcium through L-VGCCs acts as a switch from translation inhibition to the activation phase. NMDAR-mediated translation activation requires the contribution of L-VGCCs, RyRs, and SOCE. Furthermore, we show that IP3-mediated calcium release and SOCE are essential for mGluR-mediated translation up-regulation. Finally, we signify the relevance of our findings in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Using neurons derived from human fAD iPSCs and transgenic AD mice, we demonstrate the dysregulation of NMDAR-mediated calcium and translation response. Our study highlights the complex interplay between calcium signaling and protein synthesis, and its implications in neurodegeneration.
