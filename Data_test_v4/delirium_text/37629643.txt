37629643|t|Role of Functional Neuroimaging with 123I-MIBG and 123I-FP-CIT in De Novo Parkinson's Disease: A Multicenter Study.
37629643|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, with incidence and prevalence rates of 8-18 per 100,000 people per year and 0.3-1%, respectively. As parkinsonian symptoms do not appear until approximately 50-60% of the nigral DA-releasing neurons have been lost, the impact of routine structural imaging findings is minimal at early stages, making Parkinson's disease an ideal condition for the application of functional imaging techniques. The aim of this multicenter study is to assess whether 123I-FP-CIT (DAT-SPECT), 123I-MIBG (mIBG-scintigraphy) or an association of both exams presents the highest diagnostic accuracy in de novo PD patients. METHODS: 288 consecutive patients with suspected diagnoses of Parkinson's disease or non- Parkinson's disease syndromes were analyzed in the present Italian multicenter retrospective study. All subjects were de novo, drug-naive patients and met the inclusion criteria of having undergone both DAT-SPECT and mIBG-scintigraphy within one month of each other. RESULTS: The univariate analysis including age and both mIBG-SPECT and DAT-SPECT parameters showed that the only significant values for predicting Parkinson's disease in our population were eH/M, lH/M, ESS and LSS obtained from mIBG-scintigraphy (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: mIBG-scintigraphy shows higher diagnostic accuracy in de novo Parkinson's disease patients than DAT-SPECT, so given the superiority of the MIBG study, the combined use of both exams does not appear to be mandatory in the early phase of Parkinson's disease.
