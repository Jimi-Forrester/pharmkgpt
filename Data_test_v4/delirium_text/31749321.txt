31749321|t|Evaluation of QT Liability for PF-05251749 in the Presence of Potential Circadian Rhythm Modification.
31749321|a|PF-05251749 is a dual inhibitor of casein kinase 1 delta/epsilon, key regulators of circadian rhythm. As a result of its mechanism of action, PF-05251749 may also change the heart rate corrected QT (QTc) circadian rhythm, which may confound detection of drug-induced QTc prolongation. In this analysis, a nonlinear mixed effect model including a multioscillator function was developed in addition to fitting the prespecified linear mixed effect concentration-QTc model, to identify QTc liability of PF-05251749 in the presence of potential circadian rhythm change. The modeling results suggested lack of clinically meaningful QTc prolongation (upper bound of 90% confidence interval for   QTc < 10 milliseconds) and that the drug-induced QTc circadian rhythm change was not present. However, simulation results indicated that inference of drug-induced QTc prolongation could be misleading if the drug effect on QTc circadian rhythm is not properly addressed. The modeling and simulation results suggest that prespecification of the concentration-QTc model should be reconsidered for drugs with circadian rhythm modulation potential.
