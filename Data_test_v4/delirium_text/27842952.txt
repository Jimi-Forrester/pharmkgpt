27842952|a|INTRODUCTION: Hyperhomocysteinemia is a biological marker that could be identified in the venous thrombotic events and rarely during acute arterial thrombotic events. The consequences can be serious. Effective diagnostic strategy is needed to optimize the management. CASE REPORT: Following bariatric surgery, a 40-year-old patient was admitted with an acute encephalopathy associated with peripheral lower limb arterial ischemia. The diagnostic work-up identified a major hyperhomocysteinemia whose causes were several. Surgical treatment and anticoagulation was associated with vitamins and trace elements supplementation. Correcting deficiencies allowed delirium and hyperhomocysteinemia improvement. Once treatment established, the patient did not present a recurrent thrombotic episode. CONCLUSION: Major hyperhomocysteinemia seems to be associated with an increased risk of acute arterial thrombosis. This marker might be considered in nutritional deficiency situations with appropriate support on the vascular, metabolic and nutrition level.
