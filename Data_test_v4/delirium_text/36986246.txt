36986246|a|Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Since the establishment of the "lipid hypothesis", according to which, cholesterol level is directly correlated to the risk of CVD, many different lipid-lowering agents have been introduced in clinical practice. A majority of these drugs, in addition to their lipid-lowering properties, may also exhibit some anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. This hypothesis was based on the observation that a decrease in lipid levels occurs along with a decrease in inflammation. Insufficient reduction in the inflammation during treatment with lipid-lowering drugs could be one of the explanations for treatment failure and recurrent CVD events. Thus, the aim of this narrative review was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory properties of currently available lipid-lowering medications including statins, ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants (BAS), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, and niacin, as well as dietary supplements and novel drugs used in modern times.
