37330310|t|Volatile versus intravenous anaesthesia and perioperative neurocognitive disorders: anything to see here?
37330310|a|There is a potential differential effect of sevoflurane compared with propofol on postoperative delirium and other perioperative neurocognitive disorders. More generally, there are perhaps differences between volatile and intravenous anaesthetic agents in their possible impact on perioperative neurocognitive disorders. Strengths and limitations of a recent study in this journal and its contribution to our understanding of the impact of anaesthetic technique on perioperative neurocognitive disorders are discussed.
