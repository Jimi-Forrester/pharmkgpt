36101827|a|Symptoms of Wilson disease (WD) vary and additional factors such as autoimmunity may play an important role in WD pathogenesis. The presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, neuronal surface antibodies, and onconeural antibodies in WD was investigated using standardized indirect immunofluorescence assays and Western Blot analysis. The presence of all studied autoantibodies was higher in WD patients in comparison to healthy subjects, but there was no statistically significant difference in autoantibodies frequency according to disease manifestation. D-penicillamine treatment was associated with a higher presence of ANA than zinc sulfate but without an increase in autoimmune diseases rate.
