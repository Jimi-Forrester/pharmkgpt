28279898|a|OBJECTIVE: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or dementia is important so that patients can express treatment preferences, subsequently allowing caregivers to make decisions consistent with their wishes. This study explored the relationship between people's concern about developing AD/dementia, likelihood to be screened/tested, if experiencing changes in cognitive status or functioning, and concerns about sharing the diagnostic information with others. METHOD: A descriptive study was conducted using Porter Novelli's SummerStyles 2013 online survey data. Of the 6105 panelists aged 18+ who received the survey, 4033 adults responded (response rate: 66%). Chi squares were used with case-level weighting applied. RESULTS: Almost 13% of respondents reported being very worried or worried about getting AD/dementia, with women more worried than men (p<.001), and AD/dementia caregivers more worried than other types of caregivers (p=.04). Women were also more likely than men to agree to be screened/tested if experiencing changes in memory and/or thinking (p<.001). The greater the worry, the more likely respondents would agree to be screened/tested (p<.001). Nearly 66% of respondents were concerned that sharing a diagnosis would change the way others think/feel about them, with women reporting greater concern than men (p=.003). CONCLUSION: Findings demonstrate that level of worry about AD/dementia is associated with the reported likelihood that individuals agree to be screened/tested. This information will be useful in developing communication strategies to address public concern about AD/dementia that may increase the likelihood of screening and early detection.
