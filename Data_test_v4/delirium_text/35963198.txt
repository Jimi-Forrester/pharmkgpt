35963198|a|BACKGROUND: Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 affects respiratory centres in the brainstem may help to preclude assisted ventilation for patients in intensive care setting. Viral invasion appears unlikely, although autoimmunity has been implicated, the responsible antigens remain unknown. We previously predicted the involvement of three epitopes within distinct brainstem proteins: disabled homolog 1 (DAB1), apoptosis-inducing-factor-1 (AIFM1), and surfeit-locus-protein-1 (SURF1). METHODS: Here, we used microarrays to screen serum from COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care and compared those with controls who experienced mild course of the disease. FINDINGS: The results confirm the occurrence of IgG and IgM antibodies against the hypothesised epitopes in COVID-19 patients. Importantly, while IgM levels were similar in both groups, IgG levels were significantly elevated in severely ill patients compared to controls, suggesting a pathogenic role of IgG. INTERPRETATION: The newly discovered anti-neuronal antibodies might be promising markers of severe disease and the targeted peptide epitopes might be used for targeted immunomodulation. Further work is needed to determine whether these antibodies may play a role in long-COVID.
