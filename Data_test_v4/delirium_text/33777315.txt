33777315|t|Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Potential of NADPH Oxidases in Ischemic Stroke-Induced Oxidative Stress.
33777315|a|Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in humans. The excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important contributor to oxidative stress and secondary brain damage after stroke. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, an enzyme complex consisting of membrane subunits and cytoplasmic subunits, regulates neuronal maturation and cerebrovascular homeostasis. However, NADPH oxidase overproduction contributes to neurotoxicity and cerebrovascular disease. NADPH oxidase has been implicated as the principal source of ROS in the brain, and numerous studies have shown that the knockout of NADPH exerts a protective effect in the model of ischemic stroke. In this review, we summarize the mechanism of activation of the NADPH oxidase family members, the pathophysiological effects of NADPH oxidase isoforms in ischemic stroke, and the studies of NADPH oxidase inhibitors to explore potential clinical applications.
