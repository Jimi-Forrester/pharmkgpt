37723956|t|Intracerebroventricular Injection of MHY1485 Blocked the Beneficial Effect of Adiponectin on Aversive Memory in the STZ Model of Dementia.
37723956|a|BACKGROUND: The most prominent adipokine, adiponectin (APN), has an adverse relationship with the malfunction of adipose tissue. Obesity causes a decrease in plasma APN levels, which eventually results in insulin resistance and diabetes. In this study, we assessed how the effects of APN on memory are influenced by the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. METHODS: Streptozotocin (STZ) 3 mg/kg intracerebroventricular injections on days 1 and 3 following cannulation were used to create an animal model of Alzheimer's disease. The acquisition phase was preceded by injections of MHY and adiponectin. For the passive avoidance task, the stepthrough latency and total duration in the dark compartment were recorded and evaluated, and the preference index was calculated for the novel object identification test. IRS-1 protein expression in the hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. RESULTS: STZ reduced the step-through latency (STL), which rose significantly (P<=0.001) in the APN+STZ group. The memory-improving effects of APN were reversed when MHY was administered first (P<=0.001). The STZ and APN+STZ+MHY groups both had a substantial decline in the preference index (P<=0.01). Compared to the control group, the STZ group's expression of the IRS- 1 protein was dramatically reduced (P<=0.0001). In contrast to the APN+STZ group, the MHYtreated group likewise showed decreased IRS-1 protein expression (P<=0.0001), but APN+STZ was able to enhance IRS-1 expression rate (P<=0.0001). CONCLUSION: In a rat model of AD, we found that adiponectin improved aversive and cognitive memory, which is at least partially mediated by the mTOR signaling cascade.
