36553381|t|Brain-Directed Care: Why Neuroscience Principles Direct PICU Management beyond the ABCs.
36553381|a|Major advances in pediatric intensive care (PICU) have led to increased child survival. However, the long-term outcomes among these children following PICU discharge are a concern. Most children admitted to PICU are under five years of age, and the stressors of critical illness and necessary interventions can affect their ability to meet crucial developmental milestones. Understanding the neuroscience of brain development and vulnerability can inform PICU clinicians of new ways to enhance and support the care of these most vulnerable children and families. This review paper first explores the evidence-based neuroscience principles of brain development and vulnerability and the impact of illness and care on children's brains and ultimately wellbeing. Implications for clinical practice and training are further discussed to help optimize brain health in children who are experiencing and surviving a critical illness or injury.
