36159362|t|Therapeutic Application of Lithium in Bipolar Disorders: A Brief Review.
36159362|a|Bipolar affective disorder includes Bipolar Disease (BD) and Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (BSD). The prevalence of BSD, BD-I, BD-II, and subthreshold BD globally is estimated to be about 3.1%, 1.5%,0.03%, and 1.6%, respectively. BD is a multidimensional disease that exhibits a range of moods of mania, hypomania, and depression. The disease is chronic, complex, and fatal, with a high possibility of reappearance, infirmity, social incompetence, and felo-de-se. Managing emotional disruption, negative neuropsychology, physiology, and immunology is a challenge. This review focuses on therapeutic benefits, adverse drug reactions, and pharmacological intervention for BD and BSD, in particular lithium. Long-term management of BD with a single medication is ineffective and therefore, not recommended. It is advised to use multiple agents for treatment instead. Medications include mood stabilizers (lithium and anticonvulsants), atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants. Along with medication provision, psychotherapy is of great significance for BD patients. The review was conducted on recent available scientific literature through the electronic database like Embase, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and PubMed using keywords like 'Bipolar Disease,' 'Bipolar Disease Therapeutics,' 'Bipolar Disease and Psychotherapy' to highlight the possible effective means of management of this disease of mood instability.
