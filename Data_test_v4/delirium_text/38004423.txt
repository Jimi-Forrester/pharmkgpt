38004423|t|Sarcosine May Induce EGF Production or Inhibit the Decline in EGF Concentrations in Patients with Chronic Schizophrenia (Results of the PULSAR Study).
38004423|a|Sarcosine (N-methylglycine), a glutamatergic modulator, reduces the primary negative symptoms of schizophrenia. These beneficial changes might be mediated by trophic factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF). We assessed associations between initial serum EGF levels or changes in serum EGF levels and symptom severity during the addition of sarcosine to stable antipsychotic treatment and thereby evaluated the associations between glutamatergic modulation, clinical changes and peripheral EGF concentrations. Fifty-eight subjects with a diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia with dominant negative symptoms, stably treated with antipsychotics, completed a prospective 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects received orally 2 g of sarcosine (n = 28) or placebo (n = 30) daily. Serum EGF levels and symptom severity (using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS)) were assessed at baseline, 6-week and 6-month follow-up. Augmentation antipsychotic treatment with sarcosine had no effect on EGF serum levels at any time points. Only the sarcosine group showed a significant improvement in negative symptoms, general psychopathology subscales and the overall PANSS score. We found a reduction in serum EGF levels in the placebo group, but levels in the sarcosine remained stable during the study. Our data indicate that improvement in negative symptoms due to sarcosine augmentation is not directly mediated by EGF, but effective treatment may induce the production or block the decrease in EGF concentrations, which indicates the neuroprotective effect of treatment and confirms the relationship between neuroprotection and EGF levels.
