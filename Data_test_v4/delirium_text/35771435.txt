35771435|t|Assessment of Mitochondrial Complex II and III Activity in Brain Sections: A Histoenzymological Technique.
35771435|a|Mitochondrial impairment stands to be a major factor which contributes to the onset and pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, of which Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) are among the notable ones. Extensive researches suggest the probable role of mitochondrial complex II and III dysfunction as underlying players in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, and HD. Present scenario of the world in occurrence of neurodegenerative disorders demands more research and development in this field. The development of enzyme histochemistry as an analytical technique has eased the assessment of mitochondrial complex activity at both qualitative and quantitative levels. Based on the principle of redox reactions of chromogenic substrates catalyzed by the enzymes in question, this histochemical analysis has been applied by researchers worldwide and has proved to be reliable. The present chapter hereby discusses the methods followed in performing histoenzymology of mitochondrial complex II and III activity. The chapter also puts light on the precautions which should be followed while performing histoenzymology in order to yield significant results.
