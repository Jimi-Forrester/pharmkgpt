25383082|a|The aim of this study was to investigate and assess the effects of propolis flavonoids liposome imposed on the immune system by comparing it to propolis flavonoids and blank liposome. In vitro, the effects of the above drugs on macrophages were assessed by measuring the phagocytic function and cytokine production. In vivo, the immunological adjuvant activity of propolis flavonoids liposome was compared with those of propolis flavonoids and blank liposome. The results showed that in vitro propolis flavonoids liposome can significantly enhance the phagocytic function of macrophages and the release of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IFN-gamma. In addition, subcutaneous administration of propolis flavonoids liposome with ovalbumin to mice could effectively activate the cellular and humoral immune response, including inducing higher level concentrations of IgG, IL-4, and IFN-gamma in serum and the proliferation rates of splenic lymphocytes. These findings provided valuable information regarding the immune modulatory function of propolis flavonoids liposome and indicated the possibility of use of propolis flavonoids liposome as a potential adjuvant.
