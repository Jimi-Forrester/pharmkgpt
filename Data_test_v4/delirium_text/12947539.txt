12947539|a|Even though the clinical effectiveness of the presently used pharmaceutical therapy of sporadic Alzheimer Disease seems to be proven sufficient, their effective mechanisms are much less known or are disregarded in the evaluation of the clinical effects. However, it seems to be inevitable to know both clinical effect and effective mechanisms of pharmaceutics in order to be able to judge their adversity and benefit. In reference to the pharmaceutics implemented on sporadic AD in Germany, total different effective mechanisms are shown. In consideration of the shown pathomechanisms which have been recognized for sporadic AD, therapeutic rationales on application of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) and Memantine are evident. The application of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, often looked on as agent of choice, is to be considered critically because of the danger of the occurrence of myopathological dysfunction, resp. the Gulf War Syndrome. Sophisticated and hastily advertised therapy strategies with statins or vaccination against beta A4 should not be used because of a lack of sufficient evidence based on the pathophysiological pattern of damage as known in sporadic AD. Future development must take in account that with sporadic AD aging influences cannot or can hardly be influenced. Therapeutic goals should consist to improve the cellular energy status and the membrane functioning.
