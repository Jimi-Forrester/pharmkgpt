34991502|t|Factors associated with 90-day acute ischemic stroke in patients >=70 years old with total hip arthroplasty for hip fracture.
34991502|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative ischemic stroke is a devastating complication following total hip arthroplasty (THA). The purpose of the current study was to investigate the incidence of postoperative acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in patients >=70 years old with THA for hip fracture after 90 days and independent risk factors associated with 90-day AIS. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study was conducted, patients >=70 years old with THA for hip fracture under general anesthesia were included from February 2017 to March 2020. Patients with AIS within 90 days after THA were identified as AIS group; patients with no AIS were identified as no AIS group. The baseline characteristics and risk factors were collected, multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors of 90-dayAIS. RESULTS: 2517 patients (mean age 76.18 +- 6.01) were eligible for inclusion in the study. 2.50% (63/2517) of patients had 90-day AIS. Compared with no AIS, older age, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation (AF) and higher D-dimer value were more likely in patients with AIS (P < 0.05), and anticoagulant use was fewer in patients with AIS. ROC curve analysis showed that the optimal cut point of D-dimer for AIS was D-dimer>=4.12 mug/ml. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that D-dimer>=4.12 mug/ml [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 4.44; confidence interval (CI), 2.50-7.72; P < 0.001], older age (aOR, 1.08; 95%CI, 1.03-1.12; P < 0.001), hyperlipidemia (aOR, 2.28; 95%CI, 1.25-4.16; P = 0.007), atrial fibrillation (aOR, 5.84; 95% CI, 1.08-15.68; P = 0.001), and diabetes (aOR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.56-4.39; P < 0.001) were associated with increased risk of 90-day AIS after THA. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we found that the incidence of 90-day AIS in patients>=70 years old with THA for hip fracture was 2.5%. Older age, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, AF and higher D-dimer value were independent risk factors for 90-day AIS in patients>=70 years old with THA for hip fracture.
