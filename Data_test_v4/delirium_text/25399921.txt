25399921|a|The abnormal deposition of amyloids by amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aged rodents rarely develop the characteristic lesions of the disease, which is different from the case in humans. Rodent Abeta (rAbeta) differs from human Abeta (hAbeta) only in the three substitutions of Arg to Gly, Tyr to Phe, and His to Arg at positions 5, 10, and 13, respectively. Understanding the reason why rodent Abeta does not form amyloids is important to revealing factors that cause the abnormal aggregation of Abeta under pathologic conditions. We have proposed that the binding of Abeta to membranes with ganglioside clusters plays an important role in the abnormal aggregation of Abeta. In this study, we compared hAbeta and rAbeta in terms of aggregation on neuronal cells, on raftlike model membranes, and in buffer. We found that rAbeta formed amyloid fibrils similar to those of hAbeta in buffer solution. In contrast, on cell membranes and raftlike membranes, hAbeta formed toxic, mature amyloid fibrils, whereas rAbeta produced less toxic protofibrils that were not stained by the amyloid-specific dye Congo red. Thus, our ganglioside cluster-mediated amyloidogenesis hypothesis explains the immunity of rodents from cerebral Abeta amyloid deposition, strengthening the importance of ganglioside clusters as a platform of abnormal Abeta deposition in the pathology of AD.
