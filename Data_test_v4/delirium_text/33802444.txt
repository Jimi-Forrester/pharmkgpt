33802444|t|Hemodialysis as a Risk Factor for Lower Right Internal Jugular Stenosis in Cardiac Surgery Patients: A Retrospective Single-Center Study.
33802444|a|Lower right internal jugular vein (RIJ) stenosis has been reported as a common cause of RIJ catheterization failure. However, the risk factors for lower RIJ stenosis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is unclear. We reviewed the electronic medical records of all adult patients who had undergone cardiac operations in a single tertiary university hospital from January 2014 to January 2016. Patients were excluded if they were lack of preoperative contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) studies. Lower RIJ stenosis was defined as a ratio of cross-sectional area at the smallest level to cross-sectional area at the largest level less than 25%. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the risk factors for lower RIJ stenosis. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted using a cross-sectional area ratio of under 20%. The analysis included 889 patients, and the incidence of lower RIJ stenosis was 3.9%. The multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that hemodialysis was an independent risk factor for lower RIJ stenosis (OR, 3.54; 95% CI, 1.472-8.514). Sensitivity analysis provided that hemodialysis (OR, 10.842; 95% CI, 3.589-32.75) was a significant predictor of cross-sectional area ratio <20%. Preoperative hemodialysis are significantly associated with an increased risk of lower RIJ stenosis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Extra care is needed during central venous catheterization in hemodialysis patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
