26237026|t|NLRP3 Inflammasome and Pathobiology in AMD.
26237026|a|Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of central vision loss and blindness in the elderly. It is characterized by a progressive loss of photoreceptors in the macula due to damage to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Clinically, it is manifested by drusen deposition between the RPE and underlying choroid and accumulation of lipofuscin in the RPE. End-stage disease is characterized by geographic atrophy (dry AMD) or choroidal neovascularization (wet AMD). The NLRP3 inflammasome has recently been implicated in the disease pathology. Here we review the current knowledge on the involvement of this multiprotein complex and its effector cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-18 in AMD progression. We also describe cell death mechanisms that have been proposed to underlie RPE degeneration in AMD and discuss the role of autophagy in the regulation of disease progression.
