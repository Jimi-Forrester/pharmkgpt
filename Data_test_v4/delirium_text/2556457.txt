2556457|t|Distribution of beta-nerve growth factor receptors in the human basal forebrain.
2556457|a|The distribution of neurons expressing the receptor for beta-nerve growth factor has been examined immunohistochemically in serial coronal sections of basal forebrain from aged normal human subjects. Neurons expressing the receptor were observed in the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca and in the anterior, the intermediate, and the posterior portions of the nucleus basalis of Meynert. Neurons could also be seen in the medial septal nucleus and embedded in myelinated fibre tracts such as those of the external capsule, cingulum, medullary laminae of the globus pallidus, ansa penduncularis, ansa lenticularis, and anterior commissure. In situ hybridization with a 35S cDNA probe to the human beta-nerve growth factor receptor confirms a neuronal location as the site of synthesis of beta-nerve growth factor receptors in the nucleus basalis of Meynert in a fifth brain. A high percentage of Nissl-stained hyperchromic magnocellular neurons expressed the receptor for beta-nerve growth factor, suggesting that most neurons in the human cholinergic magnocellular basal forebrain system express these receptors. Recent data suggest that beta-nerve growth factor functions as a neurotrophic factor in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. In Alzheimer's disease there is known to be a reduction in cholinergic function and an apparent loss of neurons in the cholinergic nucleus basalis of Meynert. For this reason we have examined the distribution of receptors for beta-nerve growth factor in the normal human basal forebrain in order to form a basis for comparison to those with Alzheimer's disease.
