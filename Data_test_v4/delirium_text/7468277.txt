7468277|a|Is tiapride an effective and safe medication for general practitioners or psychiatrists to prescribe for the detoxication of alcoholics who refuse to be hospitalised or who have other ailments which require treatment? A 28-day survey was made at the Henri Chapelle Clinic on 30 alcoholics aged between 24 and 56 years, who were treated with tiapride I.M. for 3 days, then per os with 3 tablets per day, biological and medical tests being carried out on the first and last days. In the 8 serve cases with delirium tremens or pre-delirium, symptoms almost disappeared during the second week, with no complications. There were 2 cases of epileptic convulsions for which diazepam or phenobarbital was prescribed. One patient has spasmodic and hypertonia of the upper limbs (neuroleptic properties of tiapride). The other 22 patients were deprived of alcohol on admittance, but there was no delirium, and most psychiatric, neurological and digestive disorders disappeared during the first days of treatment. On the whole, since there was no somnolence and the desire for alcohol lessened, tiapride may be regarded as suitable for the above indications, although anti-epileptic medication may be required, and psycho-relaxant drugs may be necessary to relieve anxiety, irritability and sleep problems.
