1776746|a|Concentrations of essential fatty acids (EFAs) in plasma and red blood cell phospholipids were found to be abnormal in patients with Alzheimer's disease. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with EFAs plus appropriate antioxidants was carried out in 36 patients with Alzheimer's disease. After 20 weeks both the EFA and placebo groups had improved, but the degree of improvement was consistently greater in the EFA group.
