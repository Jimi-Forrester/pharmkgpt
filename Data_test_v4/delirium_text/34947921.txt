34947921|t|From Life in the Sea to the Clinic: The Marine Drugs Approved and under Clinical Trial.
34947921|a|In the last decades Blue Growth policy in european and non-european countries produced a great impulse in applied marine sciences, comprehending the research of new bioactive molecules in marine organisms. These organisms are a great source of natural compounds with unique features resulting from the huge variability of marine habitats and species living in them. Most of the marine compounds in use and in clinical trials are drugs for cancer therapy and many of them are conjugated to antibody to form antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Severe pain, viral infections, hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, Alzheimer's and other CNS diseases are further target conditions for these pharmaceuticals. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art marine drugs focusing on the most successful results in the fast expanding field of marine pharmacology.
