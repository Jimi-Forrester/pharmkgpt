39000249|t|Role of Kynurenine and Its Derivatives in the Neuroimmune System.
39000249|a|In recent years, there has been a growing realization of intricate interactions between the nervous and immune systems, characterized by shared humoral factors and receptors. This interplay forms the basis of the neuroimmune system, the understanding of which will provide insights into the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, in which the involvement of the immune system has been overlooked. Kynurenine and its derivatives derived from tryptophan have long been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases. Recent studies have revealed their close association not only with neurological disorders but also with sepsis-related deaths. This review provides an overview of the biochemistry of kynurenine and its derivatives, followed by a discussion of their role via the modulation of the neuroimmune system in various diseases.
