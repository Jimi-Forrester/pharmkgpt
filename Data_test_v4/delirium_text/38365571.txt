38365571|a|BACKGROUND: Frailty is proposed as a predictor of outcomes in patients undergoing major surgeries, although data on the association of frailty and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are lacking. We assessed the association between frailty and cognitive and clinical complications following CABG. METHODS: This prospective study included patients aged over 60 years undergoing elective CABG at Tehran Heart Center from 2020 to 2022. Baseline and three-month follow-up data on frailty using the Frail scale and clinical Frail scale, functional status using the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL), cognitive function by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and depression by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were obtained. The incidence of adverse outcomes was investigated at the three-month follow-up. Outcomes between frail and non-frail groups were compared utilizing T-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests, as appropriate. RESULTS: We included 170 patients with a median age of 66 +- 4 years (75.3% male). Of these, 58 cases were classified as frail, and 112 individuals were non-frail, preoperatively. Frail patients demonstrated significantly worse baseline MOCA scores (21.08 vs. 22.41, P = 0.045), GDS (2.00 vs. 1.00, P = 0.009), and Lawton IADL (8.00 vs. 6.00, P < 0.001) compared to non-frail. According to 3-month follow-up data, postoperative MOCA and GDS scores were comparable between the two groups, while Lawton IADL (8.00 vs. 6.00, P < 0.001) was significantly lower in frail cases. A significantly higher rate of readmission (1.8% vs. 12.1%), sepsis (7.1% vs. 19.0%), as well as a higher Euroscore (1.5 vs. 1.9), was observed in the frail group. A mildly significantly more extended ICU stay (6.00 vs. 5.00, p = 0.051) was shown in the frail patient. CONCLUSION: Frailty showed a significant association with a worse preoperative independence level, cognitive function, and depression status, as well as increased postoperative complications.
