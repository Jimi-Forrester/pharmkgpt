29485791|t|Thoracic Epidural Versus Intravenous Patient-Controlled Analgesia after Open Colorectal Cancer Surgery.
29485791|a|The aim of the study was to compare thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) and intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) after open colorectal cancer surgery. This prospective study included sixty patients scheduled for elective open colorectal surgery and randomized to either postoperative IV-PCA with morphine (n=30) or TEA with a mixture of levobupivacaine, fentanyl and adrenaline (n=30). Th e primary outcome was return of bowel function. The secondary outcome was quality of postoperative analgesia at rest, on coughing and during mobilization. Intermediate outcomes included patient satisfaction, time out of bed, rate of side effects and postoperative complications, and time of discharge. Recovery of postoperative ileus occurred sooner (p<0.001) and resumption of dietary intake was achieved earlier (p<0.001) in TEA group. Intensity of pain during the first 3 postoperative days was significantly lower at rest, on coughing and during mobilization (p<0.001), and mobilization was much more effi cient (p<0.005) in TEA than in IV-PCA group. Satisfaction scores were better in TEA group (p<0.001). Nausea, sedation and postoperative delirium occurred less frequently in TEA group (p<0.05, p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively). TEA demonstrated significantly better effectiveness than IV-PCA after open colorectal cancer surgery and had a positive impact on bowel function, dietary intake, patient satisfaction and early mobilization. The results of this study demonstrated the importance of implementation of TEA as a preferred method for postoperative pain control after major open colorectal surgery.
