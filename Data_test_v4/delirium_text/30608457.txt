30608457|a|This retrospective study investigated the application of the sedation-agitation scale (SAS) in pediatric bronchoscopy by observing its effects on sedative dosages and adverse reactions.Children who underwent sedation before bronchoscopy, during the period from January 2014 to June 2017, were divided into control and SAS groups. Patients in the control group were administered a single dose of 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg midazolam, based on physicians' clinical experience. The initial dose of midazolam in the SAS group was 0.1 mg/kg, and was adjusted based on the SAS score, as evaluated by physicians. Between-group comparisons were made of midazolam dose; adverse reactions of midazolam, such as agitation, delirium, excessive sedation, and respiratory depression; operating time of bronchoscopy; and number of participants.No statistically significant differences in gender, age distribution, weight, or disease composition were observed between the groups. The midazolam dose, operating time, and number of participants at different ages were all lower in the SAS group than in the control group. Fewer adverse drug reactions, such as intraoperative agitation and delirium, were noted in the SAS group. Moreover, the overall number of participants was reduced, and the overall operating time was less than that in the control group.Application of SAS for assessment of sedation during pediatric bronchoscopy can guide individualized administration of midazolam, reduce midazolam dose while achieving an ideal sedative effect, reduce adverse reactions, and improve operator experience. Hence, its use should be promoted for pediatric patients undergoing bronchoscopy under local anesthesia and conscious sedation.
