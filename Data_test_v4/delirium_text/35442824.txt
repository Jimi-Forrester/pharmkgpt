35442824|a|STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy of lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) combined with posterior spinal fusion (PSF) with that of conventional PSF in the treatment of adult spinal deformity (ASD). METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed for relevant studies in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Spinopelvic parameters, surgical data, complications, and clinical outcomes at the last follow-up were compared between patients with ASD who underwent LLIF combined with PSF (LLIF+PSF group) and those who underwent conventional PSF (only-PSF group). RESULTS: Ten studies, comprising 621 patients with ASD (313 in the LLIF+PSF group and 308 in the only-PSF group), were included. The level of evidence was III for 7 studies and IV for 3 studies. There was no significant difference in the improvement in the visual analog scale score, systemic complication rate, and revision rate between groups. In the LLIF+PSF group, we noted a superior restoration of lumbar lordosis (weighted mean difference [WMD], 9.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.10 to 12.44, P < .001), pelvic tilt (WMD, -2.50; 95% CI -4.25 to -.75, P = .005), sagittal vertical axis (WMD, -21.92; 95% CI -30.73 to -13.11, P < .001), and C7 plumb line-center sacral vertical line (WMD, -4.03; 95% CI -7.52 to -.54, P = .024); a lower estimated blood loss (WMD, -719.99; 95% CI -1105.02 to -334.96, P < .001) while a prolonged operating time (WMD, 104.89; 95% CI 49.36 to 160.43, P < .001); lower incidence of pseudarthrosis (risk ratio [RR], .26; 95% CI .08 to .79, P = .017) while higher incidence of neurologic deficits (RR, 2.04; 95% CI 1.27 to 3.25, P = .003); and a better improvement in Oswestry Disability Index score (WMD, -7.04; 95% CI -10.155 to -3.93, P < .001) and Scoliosis Research Society-22 total score (WMD, .27; 95% CI .11 to .42, P = .001). The level of evidence in this systematic review and meta-analysis was II. CONCLUSION: Compared with conventional PSF, LLIF combined with PSF was associated with superior restoration of sagittal and coronal alignment, lower incidence of pseudarthrosis, better improvement in quality of life, and less surgical invasiveness in the treatment of ASD, albeit at the cost of prolonged surgical times and substantially high incidence of lower extremity symptoms. Surgeons should weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this procedure, and inform patients about its side effects.
