36827058|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is one of the most common geriatric syndromes in older patients, accounting for 25% of hospitalized older patients, 31 to 35% of patients in the intensive care unit, and 8% to 17% of older patients in the emergency department (ED). A number of articles have been published in the literature regarding delirium. However, it is unclear about article citations evolving in the field. This study proposed a temporal heatmap (THM) that can be applied to all bibliographical studies for a better understanding of cited articles worth reading. METHODS: As of November 25, 2022, 11,668 abstracts published on delirium since 2013 were retrieved from the Web of Science core collection. Research achievements were measured using the CJAL score. Social network analysis was applied to examine clusters of keywords associated with core concepts of research. A THM was proposed to detect articles worth reading based on recent citations that are increasing. The 100 top-cited articles related to delirium were displayed on an impact beam plot (IBP). RESULTS: The results indicate that the US (12474), Vanderbilt University (US) (634), Anesthesiology (2168), and Alessandro Morandi (Italy) (116) had the highest CJAL scores in countries, institutes, departments, and authors, respectively. Articles worthy of reading were highlighted on a THM and an IBP when an increasing trend of citations over the last 4 years was observed. CONCLUSION: The THM and IBP were proposed to highlight articles worth reading, and we recommend that more future bibliographical studies utilize the 2 visualizations and not restrict them solely to delirium-related articles in the future.
