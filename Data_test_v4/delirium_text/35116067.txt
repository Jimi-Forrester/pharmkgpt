35116067|t|The Effect of Guilingji Capsules on Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Trial.
35116067|a|Guilingji capsules (GLJC) have been shown to have antiaging effects and improve cognitive function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of GLJC for the treatment of vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI). A total of 96 patients with VaMCI (aged 60-85 years) were enrolled in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. The patients were randomly assigned to a GLJC group (n = 48) or a Ginkgo group (n = 48). Patients in the GLJC group were treated using GLJC, whereas those in the Ginkgo group received Ginkgo extract tablets. We evaluated the participants at baseline and after a 12- and 24-week treatment period using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), and Chinese Medicine Symptom Scale (CM-SS). The serum acetylcholine (Ach), acetylcholinesterase (AchE), homocysteine (Hcy), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) serum levels of the patients were measured before and after 24-week treatment. Analysis of the results of both groups showed that both interventions significantly increased the MoCA and MMSE scores of the patients and decreased their ADAS-Cog and CM-SS scores (P < 0.05). The GLJC group showed greater improvement in MoCA, MMSE, and CM-SS scores than the Ginkgo group (P < 0.05). However, both groups showed a significant increase in serum Ach and a decrease in serum AchE, Hcy, and hs-CRP levels (P < 0.05). Furthermore, serum Ach increased and Hcy decreased more significantly in the GLJC group than in the Ginkgo group (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that GLJC can improve the cognitive function, cholinergic system, and inflammatory cytokine levels of patients with VaMCI. Furthermore, this treatment can improve symptoms of syndromes diagnosed according to traditional Chinese medicine practice in patients with VaMCI.
