38371988|a|The objective of this study was to undertake a comprehensive review of the evidence published, with a focus on understanding the experiences of the elderly in leveraging Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for their healthcare needs during the COVID-19 period. In compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, this review scrutinized all peer-reviewed articles in English sourced from PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science, targeting studies that focused exclusively on the elderly within the COVID-19 timeframe, incorporated ICT-based technology as intervention, and were associated with the assessment of the process of employing ICT for healthcare needs. The search strategy identified 1752 records, of which 34 studies met the inclusion criteria. The functionality of ICT was categorized, types of barriers were identified, and the subsequent changes that the elderly population underwent were synthesized and deliberated. This review offers valuable insights into the elderly's subjective experiences in utilizing ICT, which may offer guidance for future ICT development geared towards enhancing the well-being of the elderly. Future research should incorporate the perspectives of relevant healthcare providers in evaluating the effectiveness of ICT usage. Further studies are also needed on underserved elderly groups to provide a more holistic view.
