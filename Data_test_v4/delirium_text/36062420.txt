36062420|t|Are we ready to manage an opioid epidemic in the intensive care unit?
36062420|a|The current opioid epidemic has had a massive impact on the critical care sector. This is due to an increase in the number of acute opioid overdose-related admissions and the number of opioid-dependent and opioid-tolerant patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). This review discusses the challenges that intensive care physicians face when caring for patients suffering from opioid-related disorders and analyses existing solutions. Preference for non-opioid analgesics, treatment of acute pain in the ICUs to avoid chronic pain syndrome, and education of patients and caregivers are critical to preventing this pandemic.
