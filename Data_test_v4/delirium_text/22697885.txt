22697885|a|BACKGROUND: The 5-lipoxygenase enzyme is widely distributed within the central nervous system and its activity is regulated by the presence and availability of another protein, called 5-lipoxygenase activating protein. While previous works have shown that 5-lipoxygenase is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, no data are available on the role that 5-lipoxygenase activating protein plays in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: In the present paper, we studied the effect of pharmacologic inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase activating protein on the amyloidotic phenotype of Tg2576 mice. RESULTS: Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) deposition in the brains of mice receiving MK-591, a selective and specific 5-lipoxygenase activating protein inhibitor, was significantly reduced when compared with controls. This reduction was associated with a similar decrease in brain Abeta peptides levels. MK-591 treatment did not induce any change in the steady-state levels of amyloid-beta precursor protein, beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 or disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10. By contrast, it resulted in a significant reduction of the gamma-secretase complex, at the protein and message level. Furthermore, in vitro studies confirmed that MK-591 prevents Abeta formation by modulating gamma-secretase complex levels without affecting Notch signaling. CONCLUSIONS: These data establish a novel functional role for 5-lipoxygenase activating protein in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease-like amyloidosis, and suggest that its pharmacological inhibition could provide a novel therapeutic opportunity for Alzheimer's disease.
