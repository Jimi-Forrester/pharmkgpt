37621577|t|Persistent dysexecutive syndrome after pneumococcal meningitis complicated by recurrent ischemic strokes: A case report.
37621577|a|BACKGROUND: Meningitis is a possible complication of pneumococcal infection concerning acute otitis media and sinusitis. It might compromise cognitive function, both for the infection itself and the vascular events that sometimes follow the acute phase. CASE SUMMARY: Here we describe the case of a 32-year-old female patient admitted to the emergency room due to extensive pneumococcal meningitis as a consequence of sinus outbreak. She presented with extensive laminar ischemic damage in the acute phase, resulting in severe cognitive and behavioural impairment. Four years of follow-up, through neuropsychological assessments and neuroradiological investigations, demonstrated the presence of subsequent vascular events, 3 months and 2 years after onset. CONCLUSION: The case is discussed in light of scientific knowledge of the long-term outcomes of this pathology in order to potentially improve diagnosis and promote better outcomes.
