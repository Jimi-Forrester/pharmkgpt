16405247|t|The cost benefit to health plans of pharmacotherapy for Alzheimer's disease.
16405247|a|Treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health issue, with the potential for significant impact on MCOs. As the number of people affected with AD continues to rise, the importance of this problem will grow as well. This article reviews patient and caregiver outcomes associated with reduced health care costs and their implications for MCOs. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are effective in treating cognitive, functional, and behavioral symptoms for patients with mild to moderate and moderate to severe AD. Treatment with memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been shown to benefit patients with moderate to severe AD. Pharmacoeconomic studies indicate that donepezil and memantine treatment may reduce total costs of care for AD patients and their caregivers, with potential economic benefits to MCOs.
