34381166|a|A better understanding of the secondary injury mechanisms that occur after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is essential for the development of novel neuroprotective strategies linked to the restoration of metabolic deficits. We and others have shown that Ketogenic diet (KD), a high fat, moderate in proteins and low in carbohydrates is neuroprotective and improves behavioural outcomes in rats with acute SCI. Ketones are alternative fuels for mitochondrial ATP generation, and can modulate signaling pathways via targeting specific receptors. Here, we demonstrate that ad libitum administration of KD for 7 days after SCI rescued mitochondrial respiratory capacity, increased parameters of mitochondrial biogenesis, affected the regulation of mitochondrial-related genes, and activated the NRF2-dependent antioxidant pathway. This study demonstrates that KD improves post-SCI metabolism by rescuing mitochondrial function and supports the potential of KD for treatment of acute SCI in humans.
