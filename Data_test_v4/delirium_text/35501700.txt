35501700|a|INTRODUCTION: This study aims to examine the sleep pattern and predictors of daily vs. as-needed use of hypnotics in middle-aged and older adults with insomnia. METHODS: Patients aged 50-75 who use hypnotics for insomnia were identified via electronic medical records and were recruited. Data about sociodemographics, mood and cognitive screening measures, and questions related to sleep patterns were collected through an interview conducted over the phone. RESULTS: A sample of 66 participants was recruited, of which 69.7% were females. Three quarters (49/66, 74.2%) used hypnotics daily, with 43% (21/49) of daily hypnotics users sleeping more than 8 h per night. Two-fifths (26/66, 39.4%) of participants still had clinically significant insomnia even after taking hypnotics. After adjusting for age, years of hypnotics use, sleeping hours per night, PHQ-2 score, and frequency of pain at night, the logistic regression model showed that younger age (p = 0.023) and longer sleeping hours per night (p = 0.025) were significantly associated with daily hypnotics use when compared to as needed hypnotics use. CONCLUSION: Many hypnotic users still have clinically significant insomnia and poor quality of sleep as reflected by perceived longer sleep duration and more daytime napping which could be related to drug-related residual sedation. Hypnotic use may not be the best solution for insomnia treatment in an older population, and physicians should regularly reassess the use of hypnotics.
