37821052|a|In this study, 50 SD adult male mice were used to create an Alzheimer's disease model. The mice's learning and memory abilities were evaluated using an eight-arm radial maze experiment, and changes in body weight and food intake were noted. This helped to better validate the improvement of Alzheimer's disease caused by pine nut peptide-zinc chelate (Korean pine). For a more thorough investigation, mice's brains were dissected, Endogenous mercaptan antioxidants (enzymes), which are markers of brain tissue, were assessed, and mouse gut flora was analyzed. The findings demonstrated that pine nut peptide-zinc chelate (Korean pine) can improve learning and memory, stop brain aging and damage, and control gut flora in mice. It may exert its effects by ameliorating decreased AChE levels and increased ChAT levels in the central cholinergic system, endogenous thiol antioxidants (enzymes) in the cerebral cortex, and by controlling the bacterial flora in the gut.
