36769575|t|Quality of Life, Neurosensory Disorders and Co-Occurring Medical Conditions in Individuals on the Spectrum, with a Special Focus on Females Diagnosed with Autism: A Systematic Review.
36769575|a|Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that has a high prevalence and a significant economic impact. Our knowledge regarding neurosensory disorders and co-occurring medical conditions in the ASD population is limited, particularly for autistic women. Most of the studies include male participants or do not make comparisons with their female counterparts. The objective of this systematic review article is to explore the quality of life as well as the prevalence of neurosensory disorders and co-occurring medical conditions in individuals on the spectrum, with a special focus on autistic females. The literature search was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. A protocol of this systematic review was designed a priori and was registered in the PROSPERO database (registration number: CRD42022330368). We concluded that numerous medical areas were of concern. Autistic females are more likely than their male counterparts with ASD to suffer from psychiatric conditions such as post-traumatic stress syndrome, depression, and eating disorders. They are also more likely to report GI-related disturbances and chronic pain. Further investigations are warranted to determine quality of life, as well as the prevalence and severity of neurosensory disorders in individuals with ASD, specifically studies comparing autistic females with their male counterparts. The information derived from these studies will help develop better support systems for individuals with autism, particularly females on the spectrum, in pursuit of improving their quality of life.
