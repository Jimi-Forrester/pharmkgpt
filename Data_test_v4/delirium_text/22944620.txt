22944620|t|[Apathy neural bases in neurodegenerative disorders].
22944620|a|Apathy is widely recognized as a lack of motivation, which expresses through the cognitive, behavioral and emotional dimensions of living. It is described within several neuropsychiatric syndromes such as degenerative disorder and is associated with poorer outcomes. In order to better understand the underpinnings of apathy and to develop specific treatment strategies, much research has been conducted to define its neural bases. In the present review, perfusion, metabolic, pathologic and functional results of apathy neural bases in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are displayed. Methods and strategies to control for confounding factors such as depression, cognitive impairments and other behavioral disorders are described. Results are not strictly identical between disorders and even within disorders. Variation of methods employed on assessment tools and control for confounding factors such as cognitive disorders, depression, other behavioral disorders and medical treatment is thought to be the main reason for this discrepancy. However, it seems that the inferior prefrontal cortex, especially the orbitofrontal cortex, the lateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate are of particular interest. The second part of the review discusses the literature in these three areas in conditional learning essentially via the reward characteristic encoding, auto-initiated and perseverance behaviors and emotional experience and its regulation.
