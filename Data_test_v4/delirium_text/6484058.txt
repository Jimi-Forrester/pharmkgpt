6484058|t|[Morbidity rate in delirium tremens].
6484058|a|On evaluating an analysis of 105 cases of delirium tremens over a period of five years in a psychiatric base-unit, the following findings were obtained: Delirium tremens, particularly in conjunction with secondary diseases, constitutes a life-endangering medical emergency and requires intensive medical treatment. Letality was 8,57%. The morbidity-rate and the relapse-rate showed a clearly marked increase; the age of contracting the disease had its frequency peak between 30 and forty, i. e. earlier than in many other statistical surveys. Epileptic attacks as symptoms starting off or accompanying delirium occurred in almost one third of our delirium patients. The impact which these attacks have on the development in the course of process-like alcoholism was discussed.
