29886524|a|The formation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) oligomers at the cellular membrane is considered a crucial process that underlies neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To obtain structural information on this type of oligomers, we were inspired by membrane protein approaches used to stabilize, characterize, and analyze the function of such proteins. Using these approaches, we developed conditions under which Abeta42, the Abeta variant most strongly linked to the aetiology of AD, assembles into an oligomer that inserts into lipid bilayers as a well-defined pore and adopts a specific structure with characteristics of a beta-barrel arrangement. We named this oligomer beta-barrel Pore-Forming Abeta42 Oligomer (betaPFOAbeta42). Here, we describe detailed protocols for its preparation and characterization. We expect betaPFOAbeta42 to be useful in establishing the involvement of membrane-associated Abeta oligomers in AD.
