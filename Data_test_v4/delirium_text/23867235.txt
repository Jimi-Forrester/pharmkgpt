23867235|a|Abnormal oxidative stress is an established feature of Alzheimer's disease, but clinical trials aiming to reduce oxidative stress have not yet proven an effective therapy for dementia patients. The purpose of this review is to systematically analyze available data describing markers of oxidative stress and antioxidants in blood from subjects with Alzheimer's disease or those with mild cognitive impairment to highlight potential interactions between peripheral redox changes and central nervous system pathology and contribute to the design of future clinical study. PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science were systematically queried to collect studies which have evaluated markers of oxidative stress, levels of antioxidants, copper, transferrin and ceruloplasmin levels in blood from subjects with Alzheimer's disease and matched controls. After application of quality measures, results were aggregated in a random effects analysis. We found that markers of lipid peroxidation are elevated in blood in Alzheimer's disease and in mild cognitive impairment, copper metabolism is dysregulated and total antioxidant capacity is decreased. While surprisingly none of the major antioxidative enzymes are significantly decreased, non-enzymatic antioxidants in blood (particularly uric acid, vitamins A, E and C, alpha- and beta-carotene) are significantly decreased. There is significant oxidative damage in peripheral blood early in the process of neurodegeneration. We propose that clinical studies assessing cognitive outcomes after antioxidant therapy tailor interventions to individual patients' deficiencies and confirm an improvement in an appropriate serological marker of oxidative stress. This strategy may be most effectively applied in a clinical trial of primary prevention.
