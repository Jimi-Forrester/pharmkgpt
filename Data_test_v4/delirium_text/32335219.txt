32335219|a|Hyperthyroidism may cause cognitive decline and increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the major form of dementia; however, the underlying mechanism of this relationship is unclear. AD is associated with increased serum levels of tau. In this study, we investigated the relationship between serum thyroid hormones (THs) and tau. Fifty participants diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and fifty euthyroid counterparts were included and received clinical examinations. Serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3) and tau protein were assessed. The total tau protein level was significantly higher in hyperthyroidism participants than in their euthyroid counterparts. The level of circulating total tau had a significant positive association with the serum concentrations of FT3 and FT4. Total tau level was increased in the low TSH group and the serum THs decreased with the increase of age. These findings reveal that peripheral THs are associated with the serum concentration of tau, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD, suggesting a potential therapeutic target of AD via hyperthyroidism therapy.
