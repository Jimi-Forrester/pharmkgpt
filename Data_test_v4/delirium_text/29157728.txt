29157728|a|We describe here a simple method for the synthesis of 6-arylselanylpurines with antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities, and memory improvement effect. This class of compounds was synthesized in good yields by a reaction of 6-chloropurine with diaryl diselenides using NaBH4 as reducing agent and PEG-400 as solvent. Furthermore, the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor activities. The best AChE inhibitor was assessed on the in vivo memory improvement. Our results demonstrated that the 6-((4-chlorophenyl)selanyl)-9H-purine and 6-(p-tolylselanyl)-9H-purine presented in vitro antioxidant effect. In addition, 6-((4-fluorophenyl)selanyl)-9H-purine inhibited the AChE activity and improved memory, being a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
