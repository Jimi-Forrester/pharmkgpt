38736693|a|Integrative analysis of multi-omics data has the potential to yield valuable and comprehensive insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. However, a number of analytical challenges complicate multi-omics data integration. For instance, -omics data are usually high-dimensional, and sample sizes in multi-omics studies tend to be modest. Furthermore, when genes in an important pathway have relatively weak signal, it can be difficult to detect them individually. There is a growing body of literature on knowledge-guided learning methods that can address these challenges by incorporating biological knowledge such as functional genomics and functional proteomics into multi-omics data analysis. These methods have been shown to outperform their counterparts that do not utilize biological knowledge in tasks including prediction, feature selection, clustering, and dimension reduction. In this review, we survey recently developed methods and applications of knowledge-guided multi-omics data integration methods and discuss future research directions.
