11965428|a|The Ekbom's syndrome, also known as delirium of parasitic infestation, acarophobia, delusional parasitosis, psychogenic parasitosis, is a disease of rare occurrence. Generally it is characterized by the firm conviction of the patients to be infected by worms that come out of the skin, usually from the scalp or even from the mouth, from the eyes or from the genital region. Most of the patients are elderly and female, and with frequent social isolation. Some cases are associated with organic diseases as hyperthyroidism, diabetes, cortical lesion, intoxication by medicines. To our knowledge the association between delusional parasitosis with spasmodic torticollis was not described in literature. We report the case of a 72-year-old-woman with delusional parasitosis associated with spasmodic torticollis.
