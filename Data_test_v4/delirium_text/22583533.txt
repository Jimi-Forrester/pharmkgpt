22583533|a|Sphingolipids represent a major class of lipids in which selected family members act as bioactive molecules that control diverse cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, growth, senescence, migration and apoptosis. Emerging evidence reveals that sphingomyelinase/ceramide pathway plays a pivotal role in neurodegenerative diseases that involve mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Minocycline, a semi-synthetic second-generation tetracycline derivative in clinical use for infection control, is also considered an effective protective agent in various neurodegenerative diseases in pre-clinical studies. Acting via multiple mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects, minocycline is a desirable candidate for clinical trials in both acute brain injury as well as chronic neurodegenerative disorders. This review is focused on the anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative mechanisms of minocycline against neurotoxicity induced by sphingomyelinase/ceramide in relation to neurodegeneration, particularly Alzheimer's disease and cerebral ischemia.
