28731449|t|Cerebrospinal Fluid Neurogranin as a Biomarker of Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Cross-Sectional Study.
28731449|a|We investigated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of the postsynaptic biomarker neurogranin at baseline in cognitively healthy controls (HC) compared to individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, and patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). CSF neurogranin was quantified using an in-house immunoassay in a cross-sectional multicenter study of 108 participants [AD dementia (n = 35), FTD (n = 9), MCI (n = 41), cognitively HC (n = 23)]. CSF neurogranin concentrations were significantly higher in AD patients compared with both HC subjects and FTD patients, suggesting that increased CSF neurogranin concentrations may indicate AD-related pathophysiology. CSF neurogranin was independently associated with both total tau and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, whereas a non-significant correlation with the 42-amino acid-long amyloid-beta peptide was evident. CSF neurogranin, however, was not superior to core AD biomarkers in differentiating HC from the three diagnostic groups, and it did not improve their diagnostic accuracy. We conclude that further classification and longitudinal studies are required to shed more light into the potential role of neurogranin as a pathophysiological biomarker of neurodegenerative diseases.
