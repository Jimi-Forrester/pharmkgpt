36258952|a|Worldwide elderly people are being affected by diabetes mellitus (DM) and dementia. The risk for the development of dementia is higher in people with DM. DM causes a marked cognitive reduction and increases the risk of dementia, most commonly vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. People affected by DM and dementia seem to be at higher risk for intense hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia, the complication of DM treatment, is believed as an independent risk factor for dementia in people with DM. Both Alzheimer's disease and DM are linked with decreased insulin secretion, reduced uptake of glucose, raised oxidative stress, angiopathy, activation of the apoptotic pathway, aging, abnormal peroxidation of lipids, increased production of advanced glycation end products and tau phosphorylation, brain atrophy, and decreased fat metabolism. In this paper, we will review the association between Alzheimer's disease and DM. In addition, we will discuss the agents that enhance the risk for dementia in elderly people with DM and how to prevent the development of cognitive dysfunction in DM.
