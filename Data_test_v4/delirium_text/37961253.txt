37961253|a|Background Cathepsin D (CatD) is a lysosomal protease that degrades both the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) and the microtubule-associated protein, tau, which accumulate pathognomonically in Alzheimer disease (AD), but few studies have examined the role of CatD in the development of Abeta pathology and tauopathy in vivo. Methods CatD knockout (KO) mice were crossed to human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice, and amyloid burden was quantified by ELISA and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Tauopathy in CatD-KO mice, as initially suggested by Gallyas silver staining, was further characterized by extensive IHC and biochemical analyses. Controls included human tau transgenic mice (JNPL3) and another mouse model characterized by pronounced lysosomal dysfunction (Krabbe A). Additional experiments examined the effects of CatD inhibition on tau catabolism in vitro and in cultured neuroblastoma cells with inducible expression of human tau. Results Deletion of CatD in hAPP transgenic mice triggers large increases in cerebral Abeta, manifesting as intense, exclusively intracellular aggregates; extracellular Abeta deposition, by contrast, is neither triggered by CatD deletion, nor affected in older, haploinsufficient mice. Unexpectedly, CatDKO mice were found to develop prominent tauopathy by just ~ 3 weeks of age, accumulating sarkosyl-insoluble, hyperphosphorylated tau exceeding the pathology in aged JNPL3 mice. CatDKO mice exhibit pronounced perinuclear Gallyas silver staining reminiscent of mature neurofibrillary tangles in human AD, together with widespread phospho-tau immunoreactivity. Striking increases in sarkosyl-insoluble phospho-tau (~ 1250%) are present in CatD-KO mice, but notably absent from Krabbe A mice collected at an identical antemortem interval. In vitro and in cultured cells, we show that tau catabolism is slowed by blockade of CatD proteolytic activity, including via competitive inhibition by Abeta42. Conclusions Our findings support a major role for CatD in the proteostasis of both Abeta and tau in vivo. To our knowledge, CatD-KO mice are the only model to develop detectable Abeta acumulation and profound tauopathy in the absence of overexpression of hAPP or human tau with disease-associated mutations. Given that tauopathy emerges from disruption of CatD, which can itself be potently inhibited by Abeta42, our findings suggest that impaired CatD activity may represent a key mechanism linking amyloid accumulation and tauopathy in AD.
