37422929|a|The multifaceted microbiota characterizing our gut plays a crucial role in maintaining immune, metabolic and tissue homeostasis of the intestine as well as of distal organs, including the central nervous system. Microbial dysbiosis is reported in several inflammatory intestinal diseases characterized by the impairment of the gut epithelial and vascular barriers, defined as leaky gut, and it is reported as a potential danger condition associated with the development of metabolic, inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, we pointed out the strict connection between the gut and the brain via a novel vascular axis. Here we want to deepen our knowledge on the gut-brain axis, with particular emphasis on the connection between microbial dysbiosis, leaky gut, cerebral and gut vascular barriers, and neurodegenerative diseases. The firm association between microbial dysbiosis and impairment of the vascular gut-brain axis will be summarized in the context of protection, amelioration or boosting of Alzheimer, Parkinson, Major depressive and Anxiety disorders. Understanding the relationship between disease pathophysiology, mucosal barrier function and host-microbe interaction will foster the use of the microbiome as biomarker for health and disease as well as a target for therapeutic and nutritional advances.
