38140006|a|Curcumin is known for its anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and antioxidant properties, but its use in biological applications is hindered by its sensitivity to light, oxygen, and temperature. Furthermore, due to its low water solubility, curcumin has a poor pharmacokinetic profile and bioavailability. In this study, we evaluated the potential application of curcumin as a neuroprotective agent encapsulated in RGD peptide-PEGylated nanoliposomes developed from salmon-derived lecithin. Salmon lecithin, rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, was used to formulate empty or curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes. Transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and nanoparticle tracking analysis characterizations indicated that the marine-derived peptide-PEGylated nanoliposomes were spherical in shape, nanometric in size, and with an overall negative charge. Cytotoxicity tests of curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes revealed an improved tolerance of neurons to curcumin as compared to free curcumin. Wild-type SH-SY5Y were treated for 24 h with curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes, followed by 24 h incubation with conditioned media of SH-SY5Y expressing the Swedish mutation of APP containing a high ratio of Abeta40/42 peptides. Our results revealed significantly lower Abeta-induced cell toxicity in cells pre-treated with RGD peptide-PEGylated curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes, as compared to controls. Thus, our data highlight the potential use of salmon lecithin-derived RGD peptide PEGylated nanoliposomes for the efficient drug delivery of curcumin as a neuroprotective agent.
