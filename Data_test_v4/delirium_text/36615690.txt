36615690|a|A high adherence to the Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) has been associated with better cognition and a lower risk of dementia in some but not all studies. We measured adherence to MIND and its association with cognitive health in the UK Biobank (UKB). A MIND score was derived from 24 h diet recall questionnaires for 120,661 participants who completed at least one of seven self-administered cognitive function tests. In a subset of 78,663 participants aged 55+, diagnosis of dementia was determined by linked hospital and death records. Multivariable regression and Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) models were used to examine associations of MIND with cognitive ability and incident dementia. Higher adherence to MIND was associated with a small but significant worsening in performance on five of seven cognitive tests (p < 0.002). Associations were strongest among highly educated participants (p < 0.002 for MIND x education interaction). After a mean follow-up time of 10.5 years, 842 participants developed dementia. Overall, MIND adherence was not associated with incident dementia. An inverse association was observed among females (HR = 0.87 per score standard deviation (SD), p = 0.008) but not males (HR = 1.09, p = 0.11) (p = 0.008 for MIND x sex interaction). Similar associations with cognitive ability and dementia were observed for the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010) dietary pattern. Associations were not modified by genetic susceptibility. In UKB, the MIND diet was not associated with better cognitive test scores and only with lower dementia risk in women.
