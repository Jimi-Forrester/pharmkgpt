15822823|t|Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis from urinary bladder adenocarcinoma: a clinicopathological case study.
15822823|a|We report a 73-year-old male patient with leptomeningeal metastasis from urinary bladder adenocarcinoma. He was presented with prominent hyperactive delirium during the course of the disease. Meningeal carcinomatosis was detected 5 days before his death, but the primary site of the malignant tumor could not be determined. Necropsy revealed leptomeningeal infiltration of many adenocarcinoma cells that covered the cerebrum. The leptomeninges of the right middle frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, precentral gyrus and inferior parietal lobe were most severely affected by tumor cell infiltration. Cerebral edema was found to extensively cover the basal part of the temporal lobe. In the cerebrum, tumor cells were clustered in the perivascular spaces and had invaded localized areas of the frontal lobe. Vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 expression was detected in the small vessels of the cerebral upper cortical layers and of temporal subcortical u-fibers. Numerous astrocytes positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 were found in the frontal and temporal lobes. Meningeal carcinomatosis from urinary bladder adenocarcinoma is extremely rare and up-regulation of the adhesion molecules in the meningeal adenocarcinoma was confirmed.
