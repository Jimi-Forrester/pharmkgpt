35847494|a|Discovery of drugs rapidly and effectively is an important aspect for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, a novel high-throughput screening (HTS) method aims at screening the small-molecules with amyloid-beta (Abeta) binding affinity from natural medicines, based on the combinational use of biolayer interferometry (BLI) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode-array detector and quadrupole/time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-DAD-Q/TOF-MS/MS) has been firstly developed. Briefly, the components in natural medicines disassociated from biotinylated Abeta were collected to analyze their potential Abeta binding affinity by UHPLC-DAD-Q/TOF-MS/MS. Here, baicalein was confirmed to exhibit the highest binding affinity with Abeta in Scutellaria baicalensis. Moreover, polyporenic acid C (PPAC), dehydrotumulosic acid (DTA), and tumulosic acid (TA) in Kai-Xin-San (KXS) were also identified as potent Abeta inhibitors. Further bioactivity validations indicated that these compounds could inhibit Abeta fibrillation, improve the viability in Abeta-induced PC-12 cells, and decrease the Abeta content and improve the behavioral ability in Caenorhabditis elegans. The molecular docking results confirmed that PPAC, DTA, and TA possessed good binding properties with Abeta. Collectively, the present study has provided a novel and effective HTS method for the identification of natural inhibitors on Abeta fibrillation, which may accelerate the process on anti-AD drugs discovery and development.
