38151823|t|Nursing diagnoses as factors associated with delirium among intensive care unit patients with sepsis: A retrospective correlational study.
38151823|a|AIMS: To examine whether nursing diagnoses were associated with delirium in patients with sepsis. BACKGROUND: Nursing diagnosis is a nurse's clinical judgement about clients' current or potential health conditions. Delirium is regarded as an important nurse-sensitive outcome. Nonetheless, nursing diagnoses associated with delirium have not yet been identified. DESIGN: Retrospective correlational study. METHODS: This study was carried out from December 2021 to January 2023. We analysed electronic health records of patients with sepsis admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of a tertiary hospital in Seoul, South Korea. Delirium was defined based on the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist score. Nursing diagnoses established within 24 h of admission to the ICU were included and were based on the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association diagnostic classification. The data were analysed using logistic regression. Demographics, comorbidities, procedures and physiological measures were adjusted. Regression model was evaluated via receiver operating characteristic curve, Nagelkerke R2 , accuracy and F1 score. RESULTS: The prevalence of delirium in patients with sepsis was 51.8%. Ineffective breathing patterns, decreased cardiac output and impaired skin integrity were significant nursing diagnoses related to delirium. Age >= 65 years, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, physical restraint and comatose state were also associated with delirium in patients with sepsis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.806. CONCLUSION: Ineffective breathing patterns, decreased cardiac output and impaired skin integrity could manifest as prodromal symptoms of delirium among patients with sepsis. IMPACT: The prodromal symptoms of delirium revealed through nursing diagnoses can be efficiently used to identify high-risk groups for delirium. The use of nursing diagnosis system should be recommended in clinical practice caring for sepsis patients. REPORTING METHODS: STROBE checklist. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No patient or public involvement.
