35965941|t|An unwell patient with Parkinson's disease: Hyperpyrexia syndrome in a heatwave.
35965941|a|Hyperpyrexia syndrome in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a medical emergency requiring prompt action. This can be precipitated by numerous provoking factors, in particular withdrawal of dopaminergic medication. We report a case of a patient with PD presenting with confusion, dramatic worsening of PD symptoms and pyrexia in the context of a heatwave, potentially mediating its effect through dehydration and impaired medication absorption. Precipitous cooling and conversion of dopaminergic medication to a rotigotine patch due to drowsiness led to her rapid improvement. The possibility of infection was covered however no source of infection or evidence of inflammatory response was found, but remained an important differential. This case highlights the importance of recognising and managing hyperpyrexia syndrome in PD and the possibility of uncharacteristically hot weather being a cause.
