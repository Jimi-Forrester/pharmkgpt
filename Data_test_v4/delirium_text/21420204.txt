21420204|t|Studying synergism of methyl linked cyclohexyl thiophenes with triazole: synthesis and their cdk5/p25 inhibition activity.
21420204|a|A novel clubbed triazolyl thiophene series of cdk5/p25 inhibitors, potentially useful for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, is disclosed. Evaluation of the SAR of substitution within these series has allowed the identification of a range of compounds which significantly reduce brain cdk5/p25 and thus have potential as possible treatments for Alzheimer's disease.
