35160359|a|Esca is a grapevine disease known for centuries which pertains to the group of so-called vine trunk diseases. Phaeomoniella chlamydospora (P. chlamydospora) and Phaeoacremonium aleophilum (P. aleophilum) are the two main fungal pathogens associated with esca. Novel fibrous materials with antifungal properties based on poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and 5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline (clioquinol, CQ) were developed. One-pot electrospinning ("in" strategy) or electrospinning in conjunction with electrospraying ("on" strategy) were applied to obtain the materials. The materials' morphology and their surface chemical composition were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). CQ incorporated in the bulk of the fibers or in PVP particles deposited on the fibers was in the amorphous phase, which was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The in vitro release of CQ depended on the composition of the electrospun materials and on their design. The performed microbiological screening revealed that, unlike the non-loaded mats, the fibrous mats loaded with CQ were effective in inhibiting the growth of the pathogenic P. chlamydospora and P. aleophilum fungi. Therefore, the created materials are promising as active dressings for grapevine protection against esca.
