31896362|t|The other side of the coin: Semantic dementia as a lesion model for understanding recollection and familiarity.

By considering the integrative memory model through the lens of semantic dementia, we propose a number of important extensions to the framework, to help clarify the complex neurocognitive mechanisms underlying recollection and familiarity.
