16192726|a|This study investigated the contribution that white matter changes (WMCs) make to clinical and cognitive features in Alzheimer's disease (AD), independently of possible confounders such as cortical atrophy and the apolipoprotein E genotype as well as their relationship to vascular risk factors. We semiquantitatively assessed the degree and location of WMCs (global, periventricular and deep white matter), lacunes and global atrophy on brain MRI scans of 86 AD cases, extensively evaluated from a clinical and neuropsychological point of view. Multivariate logistic and linear regression analysis showed that age was the only significant predictor of all WMC measures and revealed a significant association of periventricular WMCs with performance on executive function tasks as well as of deep WMCs with history of mood depression. Our results underline the significance of WMC location over size in the occurrence of specific cognitive deficits in AD.
