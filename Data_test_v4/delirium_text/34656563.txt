34656563|t|Flipping the switch: How cysteine oxidation directs tau amyloid conformations.
34656563|a|Tau can adopt distinct fibril conformations in different human neurodegenerative diseases, which may invoke distinct pathological mechanisms. In a recent issue, Weismiller et al. showed that intramolecular disulfide links between cys291 and cys322 for a specific tau isoform containing four microtubule-binding repeats direct the formation of a structurally distinct amyloid polymorph. These findings have implications in how oxidative stress can flip switches of tau polymorphism in these diseases.
