29626319|t|Clearance of Amyloid Beta and Tau in Alzheimer's Disease: from Mechanisms to Therapy.
29626319|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Pathological proteins of AD mainly contain amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau. Their deposition will lead to neuron damage by a series of pathways, and then induce memory and cognitive impairment. Thus, it is pivotal to understand the clearance pathways of Abeta and tau in order to delay or even halt AD. Abeta clearance mechanisms include ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy-lysosome, proteases, microglial phagocytosis, and transport from the brain to the blood via the blood-brain barrier (BBB), arachnoid villi and blood-CSF barrier, which can be named blood circulatory clearance. Recently, lymphatic clearance has been demonstrated to play a key role in transport of Abeta into cervical lymph nodes. The discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels is another direct evidence for lymphatic clearance in the brain. Furthermore, periphery clearance also contributes to Abeta clearance. Tau clearance is almost the same as Abeta clearance. In this review, we will mainly introduce the clearance mechanisms of Abeta and tau proteins, and summarize corresponding targeted drug therapies for AD.
