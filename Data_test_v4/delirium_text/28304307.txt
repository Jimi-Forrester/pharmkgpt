28304307|t|Logopenic Aphasia due to a Strategic Stroke: New Evidence from a Single Case.
28304307|a|Among primary progressive aphasias (PPAs), logopenic variant PPA (lv-PPA) is usually related to Alzheimer's disease. Although it has been widely clinically and pathologically evaluated, the topography in LPA is still controversial. We report a patient presenting with a logopenic syndrome due to a strategic lesion located in the superior and middle temporal gyrus and compare our findings with those of a PiB-PET positive lv-PPA patient matched by age, gender, and education. We consider that our study provides new anatomical clues to better understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the logopenic syndrome.
