26413562|a|INTRODUCTION: Plasma levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) do not correlate well with different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in cross-sectional studies. Measuring the changes in Abeta plasma levels with an acute intervention may be more sensitive to distinguishing individuals in earlier stages of AD (mild cognitive impairment; MCI) from normal controls. METHODS: 57 participants (18 with AD/MCI and 39 cognitively normal controls) underwent oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT). Blood samples were obtained over a 2 hour time period. Changes in plasma Abeta40 and42 levels were measured from either baseline or 5 minutes to the 10 minute time point. RESULTS: Compared to normal controls, subjects with AD/MCI had significantly less change (Delta) in plasma levels for both Abeta40(-3.13(40.93)pg/ml vs. 41.34(57.16)pg/ml;p=0.002) and Abeta42(-0.15(3.77)pg/ml vs. 5.64(10.65)pg/ml; p=0.004). DISCUSSION: OGTT combined with measures of plasma Abeta40 and 42 is potentially useful in distinguishing aging individuals who are in different stages of AD.
