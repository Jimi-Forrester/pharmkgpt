37627240|t|The Role of Oxidative Stress in Manganese Neurotoxicity: A Literature Review Focused on Contributions Made by Professor Michael Aschner.
37627240|a|This literature review focuses on the evidence implicating oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of manganese neurotoxicity. This review is not intended to be a systematic review of the relevant toxicologic literature. Instead, in keeping with the spirit of this special journal issue, this review highlights contributions made by Professor Michael Aschner's laboratory in this field of study. Over the past two decades, his laboratory has made significant contributions to our scientific understanding of cellular responses that occur both in vitro and in vivo following manganese exposure. These studies have identified molecular targets of manganese toxicity and their respective roles in mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and cytotoxicity. Other studies have focused on the critical role astrocytes play in manganese neurotoxicity. Recent studies from his laboratory have used C. elegans to discover new facets of manganese-induced neurotoxicity. Collectively, his body of work has dramatically advanced the field and presents broader implications beyond metal toxicology.
