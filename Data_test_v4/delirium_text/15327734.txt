15327734|t|Factor structure of the CERAD neuropsychological battery.
15327734|a|The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuropsychological battery was developed to evaluate cognitive impairments associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies have suggested that the battery is multi-dimensional, represented by either 3 or 5 dimensions. In this study a principal factor analysis was conducted using contemporary quantitative methods for determining the number of factors. Exploratory factor analysis of the CERAD battery and MMSE was conducted using one-half of the CERAD database (total N = 969). Glorfeld's modification of Horn's parallel analysis method suggested that there was 1 common factor in the variable matrix. Characterization of patterns of deficits in AD requires supplementation of measures derived from the CERAD and MMSE with other tests.
