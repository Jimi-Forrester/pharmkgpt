39068671|t|mTORC1 activation in presumed classical monocytes: observed correlation with human size variation and neuropsychiatric disease.
39068671|a|BACKGROUND: Gain of function disturbances in nutrient sensing are likely the largest component in human age-related disease. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity affects health span and longevity. The drugs ketamine and rapamycin are effective against chronic pain and depression, and both affect mTORC1 activity. Our objective was to measure phosphorylated p70S6K, a marker for mTORC1 activity, in individuals with psychiatric disease to determine whether phosphorylated p70S6K could predict medication response. METHODS: Twenty-seven females provided blood samples in which p70S6K and phosphorylated p70S6K were analyzed. Chart review gathered biometric measurements, clinical phenotypes, and medication response. Questionnaires assessed anxiety, depression, autism traits, and mitochondrial dysfunction, to determine neuropsychiatric disease profiles. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to identify predictors of medication response. RESULTS: mTORC1 activity correlated highly with both classical biometrics (height, macrocephaly, pupil distance) and specific neuropsychiatric disease profiles (anxiety and autism). Across all cases, phosphorylated p70S6K was the best predictor for ketamine response, and also the best predictor for rapamycin response in a single instance. CONCLUSIONS: The data illustrate the importance of mTORC1 activity in both observable body structure and medication response. This report suggests that a simple assay may allow cost-effective prediction of medication response.
