29758942|t|Lost in Translation? Finding Our Way To Effective Alzheimer's Disease Therapies.
29758942|a|Efforts over the past two decades to develop effective disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease have been disappointing, while parallel efforts in another chronic neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis, have been remarkably productive. In an effort to advance development of therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease, these two fields are contrasted in terms of the utility of animal models, definition of study populations, and utility of biomarkers. Possible solutions are suggested, and the review concludes with description of some active peer-reviewed, publicly funded clinical studies which address some of the identified weaknesses in past clinical trials for age-related dementia.
