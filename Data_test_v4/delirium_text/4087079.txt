4087079|t|LSD: the varieties of psychotic experience.
4087079|a|The varieties of psychotic LSD experiences are many. A very few may resemble a delirium, some are quite reminiscent of schizophrenia and others have an idiosyncratic quality not seen in the naturally occurring psychoses. The psychotic response to LSD is better understood than transcendent experiences because its neurochemistry and phenomenology have been worked out. Additionally, there is greater familiarity with the endogenous psychoses than the endogenous cosmic experiences. The LSD condition, especially the unsane state, is indeed an experience in search of an explanation. It is doubtful that an animal model for it will be found. It is even possible that not all humans are capable of achieving that state by means of the hallucinogenic drugs. The LSD state remains an area of enormous interest that requires exploration and research.
