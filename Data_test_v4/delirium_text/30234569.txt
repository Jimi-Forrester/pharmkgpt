30234569|t|Incidence and Prevalence of Delirium Subtypes in an Adult ICU: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
30234569|a|OBJECTIVES: Use systematic review and meta-analytic methodology to estimate the pooled incidence, prevalence, and proportion of delirium cases for each delirium subtype (hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed) in an adult ICU population. DATA SOURCES: We conducted a search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses standards from database inception until October 22, 2017, with no restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: We included original research conducted in adults admitted to any medical, surgical, or speciality ICU that reported incidence or prevalence estimates of delirium according to delirium subtype. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted on sample size, population demographics, condition information, and reported delirium estimates. DATA SYNTHESIS: Forty-eight studies (27,342 patients; 4,550 with delirium) with an overall pooled prevalence of 31% (95% CI, 24-41; I = 99%) met inclusion criteria. The pooled incidence (n = 18 studies) of delirium subtypes were hyperactive (4% [95% CI, 2-6]; I = 92%]), hypoactive (11% [95% CI, 8-17; I = 97%]), and mixed (7% [95% CI, 4-11; I = 97%]). The pooled prevalence (n = 31 studies) of delirium subtypes were hyperactive (4% [95% CI, 3-6; I = 94%]), hypoactive (17% [95% CI, 13-22; I = 97%]), and mixed (10% [95% CI, 6-16; I = 99%]). The pooled prevalence of hypoactive delirium in study populations with a similarly high severity of illness or mechanically ventilated was higher (severity of illness: 29% [95% CI, 18-46%; I = 95%], 100% mechanically ventilated: 35% [95% CI, 23-55%; I = 93%]) compared with the pooled prevalence of hypoactive delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant heterogeneity between studies, these data show the majority of delirious ICU patients to have hypoactive delirium, a finding with potential monitoring, management, and prognostic implications. The prevalence of hypoactive delirium varies between-study populations and is higher in patients with greater severity of illness.
