32403392|a|BACKGROUND: Human herpesviruses (HHV)-6A, HHV-6B and HHV-7 are considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, a common neurological disorder. The objective of this study was to determine the association of roseoloviruses infection with epilepsy. METHODS: 53 epilepsy patients and 104 ordinary blood donors were analyzed to determine presence of virus-specific antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA), genomic sequences, viral load and gene expression by polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) and restriction analysis, HHV-6 protein expression by IFA and level of cytokines by ELISA. RESULTS: Roseoloviruses genomic sequences in DNA samples from whole blood were found in 86.8% of patients versus 54.8% of controls and active infection was revealed only in patients with epilepsy (19.6% of roseolovirus-positive patients). Significantly higher viral load and more frequent gene expression was detected in patients compared to the controls. HHV-6-encoded protein expression was demonstrated in 53.3% of patients with previously detected HHV-6 DNA. Changes in level of cytokines were determined in patients with elevated viral load compared to the patients without elevated viral loads and to the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Results on frequent active HHV-6 and HHV-7 infection in epilepsy patient' peripheral blood indicate on possible involvement of these viruses in the disease development.
