7924055|a|We compared the incidence of risk factors (such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hematocrit, atrial fibrillation) and local cerebral blood flow between patients with lacunar infarction associated with leukoaraiosis (LA) in the centrum semiovale (LACS) and those with periventricular white matter lesions (PVWMLs) on magnetic resonance imagings (MRI). Only atrial fibrillation was more frequently seen in LACS (p < 0.05), but the incidence of other risk factors for cerebrovascular disease was not different between the two patient groups. Demented patients were older than those with preserved intelligence in both groups. Local cerebral blood flow was compared between patients with and without dementia by single photon emission computed tomography using N-isopropyl-p-123I iodoamphetamine (IMP). The cerebral: cerebellar IMP uptake ratio (%) was used as a measure of relative cerebral perfusion. Compared with normal controls the demented patients with PVWMLs showed a significant reduction in local cerebral blood flow in the parietal area (p < 0.05) and the basal gray region (p < 0.05), and those with LACS in the frontal area (p < 0.05) and the basal gray region (p < 0.05). A significant positive correlation was found between local cerebral blood flow and dementia rating scales in the temporal and parietal areas in PVWMLs, and in the frontal area in LACS. These results suggest that most patients with LACS may represent vascular dementia of Binswanger type, and some demented patients with PVWMLs may have Alzheimer type dementia.
