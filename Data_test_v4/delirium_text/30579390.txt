30579390|a|BACKGROUND: Perioperative studies of patients following hip fracture have large heterogeneity within their reported outcomes. This study aimed to develop a core outcome set for use in perioperative studies comparing the types of anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery. METHODS: The consensus process consisted of a systematic review of the literature, three rounds of a Delphi survey, two consensus webinars, and face-to-face patient meetings. RESULTS: The Delphi participants represented nine stakeholder groups. The numbers of participants completing Rounds 1-3 were 242, 186, and 169, respectively. Seventeen outcomes that met the predefined consensus criteria were considered at two consensus meetings. A final set of 10 core outcomes was agreed: mortality, time from injury to surgery, acute coronary syndrome, hypotension, acute kidney injury, delirium, pneumonia, orthogeriatric input, being out of bed at day 1, and pain. CONCLUSIONS: We generated a consensus-based set of core outcomes recommended for use in all perioperative trials evaluating the effects of anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery. An important next step is developing consensus-based consistency on how they should be measured. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://www.comet-initiative.org/studies/details/757.
