35034675|t|Postoperative delirium and its relationship with biomarkers for dementia: a meta-analysis.
35034675|a|OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to identify Alzheimer's and related dementias (ADRD) biomarkers associated with postoperative delirium (POD) via meta-analysis. DESIGN: A comprehensive search was conducted. Studies met the following inclusion criteria: >18 years of age, identified POD with standardized assessment, and biomarker measured in the AT(N)-X (A = amyloid, T = tau, (N)=neurodegeneration, X-Other) framework. Exclusion criteria: focus on prediction of delirium, delirium superimposed on dementia, other neurologic or psychiatric disorders, or terminal delirium. Reviewers extracted and synthesized data for the meta-analysis. SETTING: Meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with POD. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome: association between POD and ATN-X biomarkers. Secondary outcomes involved sample heterogeneity. RESULTS: 28 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Studies focused on inflammatory and neuronal injury biomarkers; there were an insufficient number of studies for amyloid and tau biomarker analysis. Two inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, and CRP) showed a significant relationship with POD (IL-6 n = 10, standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.53, 95% CI: 0.36-0.70; CRP n = 14, SMD: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.33-0.74). Two neuronal injury biomarkers (blood-based S100B and NfL) were positively associated with POD (S100B n = 5, SMD: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.11-0.69; NFL n = 2, SMD: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.28-1.57). Of note, many analyses were impacted by significant study heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis identified an association between certain inflammatory and neuronal injury biomarkers and POD. Future studies will need to corroborate these relationships and include amyloid and tau biomarkers in order to better understand the relationship between POD and ADRD.
