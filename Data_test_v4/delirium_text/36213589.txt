36213589|a|Chronically ill patients with superimposed acute illness requiring hospitalization are more likely to develop an extended length of stay, hospital-acquired infections, and adverse events throughout their hospitalization. An excellent alternative to managing this population of patients in the traditional bricks-and-mortal (BAM) hospital is the hospital-at-home (HaH) model. The Advanced Care at Home (ACH) program is Mayo Clinic's HaH model that provides acute and postacute care to high-acuity patients in their homes rather than in the traditional hospital and skilled nursing facility. We report a case of postoperative care through the ACH program of a patient suffering from short gut syndrome, high-output ileostomy, and severe protein-calorie malnutrition in the setting of previously diagnosed triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the right breast complicated by lung and brain metastasis. The patient had multiple complications that required repeated scare escalations directed by a multidisciplinary virtual care. Despite these complications, the ACH model of care was able to keep the patient in the home setting the majority of the time, limiting BAM hospital days, and eliminating the need to use the emergency department for acute escalation for 3 months. The patient was able to recover during this time period and proceed to successful take-down of the ileostomy. This case highlights the benefits of the ACH program by offering high-acuity hospital-level care to severely ill patients in the comfort of their homes. Highly qualified providers paired with curated technology in the home allowed for prompt identification of patient decompensation and timely initiation of treatment while avoiding institutionalization.
