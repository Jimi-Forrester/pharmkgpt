32386043|t|Regulation of exosome for Alzheimer's disease derived from mesenchymal stem cells.
32386043|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia in the elderly, accounting for about 75% of all dementia patients. The pathological feature of AD is the deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) with strong neurotoxicity in brain tissue, while the hyperphosphorylation of tau in many neuronal cells forms neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). The combination of the two conditions leads to a large number of neuronal necrosis, disordered function of the brain, and serious cognitive dysfunction. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of adult stem cells, which can produce a large number of polyvesicular body secreted to the extracellular to form exosomes. Exosomes vary in size, with a diameter of about 30-150 nm, and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Exosomes can carry a large number of small miRNA and protein molecules to the brain to play a role. Exosomes derived from MSCs play regulatory roles on AD.
