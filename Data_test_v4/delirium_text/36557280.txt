36557280|t|Metabolites of Moringa oleifera Activate Physio-Biochemical Pathways for an Accelerated Functional Recovery after Sciatic Nerve Crush Injury in Mice.
36557280|a|In this study, the functional metabolites of Moringa oleifera (MO) were screened to evaluate their possible role in accelerated functional retrieval after peripheral nerve injury (PNI). MO leaves were used for extract preparation using solvents of different polarities. Each dry extract was uniformly mixed in rodents' chow and supplemented daily at a dose rate of 2 g/kg body weight from the day of nerve crush until the completion of the trial. The sciatic functional index (SFI) and muscle grip strength were performed to assess the recovery of motor functions, whereas the hotplate test was performed to measure the regain of sensory functions. An optimal level of oxidative stress and a controlled glycemic level mediates a number of physio-biochemical pathways for the smooth progression of the regeneration process. Therefore, total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and glycemic levels were analyzed in metabolite-enriched extract-treated groups compared to the control. The supplementation of polar extracts demonstrated a significantly high potential to induce the retrieval of sensory and motor functions. Further, they were highly effective in controlling oxidative stress, facilitating accelerated nerve generation. This study has highlighted MO as a sustainable source of nutritive metabolites and a valuable target for drug development.
