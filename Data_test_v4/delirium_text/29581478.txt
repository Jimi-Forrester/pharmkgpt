29581478|t|Heparanase attenuates axon degeneration following sciatic nerve transection.
29581478|a|Axon degeneration underlies many nervous system diseases; therefore understanding the regulatory signalling pathways is fundamental to identifying potential therapeutics. Previously, we demonstrated heparan sulphates (HS) as a potentially new target for promoting CNS repair. HS modulate cell signalling by both acting as cofactors in the formation of ligand-receptor complexes and in sequestering ligands in the extracellular matrix. The enzyme heparanase (Hpse) negatively regulates these processes by cleaving HS and releasing the attached proteins, thereby attenuating their ligand-receptor interaction. To explore a comparative role for HS in PNS axon injury/repair we data mined published microarrays from distal sciatic nerve injury. We identified Hpse as a previously unexplored candidate, being up-regulated following injury. We confirmed these results and demonstrated inhibition of Hpse led to an acceleration of axonal degeneration, accompanied by an increase in beta-catenin. Inhibition of beta-catenin and the addition of Heparinase I both attenuated axonal degeneration. Furthermore the inhibition of Hpse positively regulates transcription of genes associated with peripheral neuropathies and Schwann cell de-differentiation. Thus, we propose Hpse participates in the regulation of the Schwann cell injury response and axo-glia support, in part via the regulation of Schwann cell de-differentiation and is a potential therapeutic that warrants further investigation.
