33804997|t|Graphene-Based Sensors for the Detection of Bioactive Compounds: A Review.
33804997|a|Over the last years, different nanomaterials have been investigated to design highly selective and sensitive sensors, reaching nano/picomolar concentrations of biomolecules, which is crucial for medical sciences and the healthcare industry in order to assess physiological and metabolic parameters. The discovery of graphene (G) has unexpectedly impulsed research on developing cost-effective electrode materials owed to its unique physical and chemical properties, including high specific surface area, elevated carrier mobility, exceptional electrical and thermal conductivity, strong stiffness and strength combined with flexibility and optical transparency. G and its derivatives, including graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), are becoming an important class of nanomaterials in the area of optical and electrochemical sensors. The presence of oxygenated functional groups makes GO nanosheets amphiphilic, facilitating chemical functionalization. G-based nanomaterials can be easily combined with different types of inorganic nanoparticles, including metals and metal oxides, quantum dots, organic polymers, and biomolecules, to yield a wide range of nanocomposites with enhanced sensitivity for sensor applications. This review provides an overview of recent research on G-based nanocomposites for the detection of bioactive compounds, providing insights on the unique advantages offered by G and its derivatives. Their synthesis process, functionalization routes, and main properties are summarized, and the main challenges are also discussed. The antioxidants selected for this review are melatonin, gallic acid, tannic acid, resveratrol, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, and curcumin. They were chosen owed to their beneficial properties for human health, including antibiotic, antiviral, cardiovascular protector, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective, neuroprotective, antiageing, antidegenerative, and antiallergic capacity. The sensitivity and selectivity of G-based electrochemical and fluorescent sensors are also examined. Finally, the future outlook for the development of G-based sensors for this type of biocompounds is outlined.
