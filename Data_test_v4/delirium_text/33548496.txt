33548496|a|The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is raising global anxiety and fear of both real and perceived health threat from the virus. Overwhelming evidence shows infected patients experiencing neuropsychiatric complications, suggesting that the "psychoneuroimmunity" model might be beneficial in understanding the impact of the virus. Therefore, this Special Issue on "Immunopsychiatry of COVID-19 Pandemic" was launched immediately after the pandemic was declared, with the first paper accepted on the March 25th, 2020. A total of ninety-three papers were accepted, the last one was on the July 10th, 2020 when the initial acute phase started declining. The papers of this Special Issue have illuminated the social impact, psychopathology, neurological manifestation, immunity responses, and potential treatments and prevention on COVID-19. For example, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and suicidal ideation are most common psychiatric manifestations. COVID-19 infection can have central and/or peripheral nervous system symptoms, including headache, sleep disorders, encephalopathy, and loss of taste and smell. A "three-steps" Neuro-COVID infection model (neuro-invasion, clearance and immune response) was established. The current therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 include supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and plasma transfusion. Psychological support should be implemented, improving the psychological wellbeing, as well as to enhance psychoneuroimmunity against COVID-19.
