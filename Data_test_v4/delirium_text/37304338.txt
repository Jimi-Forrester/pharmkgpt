37304338|t|Factors Associated with Increased Length of Stay in Post Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Patients: A Scoping Review.
37304338|a|Several studies identify factors affecting increased length of stay (LOS) in patients with post-primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, there has not been a review study that synthesizes these results. This study aimed to describe the duration of LOS and factors associated with increased LOS among patients with STEMI after PPCI. This study used scoping review using EBSCO-host Academic Search Complete, PubMed, Scopus, Taylor & Francis, and Google Scholar databases. The keywords used in English were "adults OR middle-aged" AND "length of stay OR hospital stay" AND "primary percutaneous coronary intervention OR PPCI" AND "myocardial infarction OR coronary infarction OR cardiovascular disease". The inclusion criteria for articles were: the article was a full-text in English; the sample was STEMI patients who had undergone a PPCI procedure; and the article discussed the LOS. We found 13 articles discussing the duration and factors affecting LOS in patients post-PPCI. The duration of LOS was the fastest 48 hours, and the longest of LOS was 10.2 days. Factors influencing LOS are categorized into three predictors: low, moderate, and high. Post-procedure complications after PPCI was the most influential factors in increasing the LOS duration. Professional health workers, especially nurses, can identify various factors that can be modified to prevent complications and worsen disease prognosis to increase LOS efficiency.
