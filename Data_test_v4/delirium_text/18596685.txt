18596685|a|Studies have recently suggested that blockade of 5-HT6 receptors (5-HT6R) improves memory processes. As episodic memory alteration is one of the first deficits observed during normal aging and in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders (Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia), the present study sought to characterize the effects of 5-HT6R blockade on spatial recognition memory, which can be considered as 'episodic-like' memory, in rodents. We quantified the effects of the selective 5-HT6R antagonist SB-271046 (10 mg/kg, i.p.), using the two-trial place recognition task in the Y-maze, on acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of spatial recognition memory in young adult mice (6-week-old; intertrial intervals (ITIs) 30, 60, 120, 240, and 360 min) and on the consolidation of spatial recognition memory in aged mice (3-, 12-, 18-, and 21-month-old; ITI 60 and 240 min). SB-271046-treated young adult mice explored the new arm more after a 240-min (pre-acquisition) and 360-min (post-acquisition) ITI, whereas vehicle-treated animals failed to discriminate the new arm when the ITI exceeded 120 min (pre-acquisition) or 240 min (post-acquisition). Aged mice, which expressed spatial memory deficits, explored the new arm more after a 60-min ITI (21-month-old) and a 240-min ITI (18- and 21-month-old) when treated with SB-271046. Consequently, 5-HT6R blockade improves spatial recognition memory in adult mice and reverses age-related consolidation deficits of episodic-like memory. This study provides further support for the use of 5-HT6R antagonists in the treatment of episodic memory disorders related to aging as well as neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.
