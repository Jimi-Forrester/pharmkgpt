33277510|a|Patients with Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) have a considerably higher risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. The initial symptoms are very insidious at onset. We investigated the alterations in spontaneous brain activity and network connectivity through regional homogeneity (ReHo) and graph theoretical network analyses, respectively, of resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) in T2DM patients with and without MCI, so as to facilitate early diagnose. Twenty-five T2DM patients with MCI (DM-MCI), 25 T2DM patients with normal cognition (DM-NC), 27 healthy controls were enrolled. Whole-brain ReHo values were calculated and topological properties of functional networks were analyzed. The DM-MCI group exhibited decreased ReHo in the left inferior/middle occipital gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus, and increased ReHo in frontal gyrus compared to the DM-NCs. Significant correlations were found between ReHo values and clinical measurements. The DM-MCI group illustrated greater clustering coefficient/local efficiency and altered nodal characteristics (efficiency, degree and betweenness), which increased in certain occipital, temporal and parietal regions but decreased in the right inferior temporal gyrus, compared to the DM-NCs. The altered ReHo and impaired network organization may underlie the impaired cognitive functions in T2DM and suggesting a compensation mechanism. These rs-fMRI measures have the potential as biomarkers of disease progression in diabetic encephalopathy.
