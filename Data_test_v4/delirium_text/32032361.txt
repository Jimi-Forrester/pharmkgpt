32032361|t|Effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on post-stroke cognitive impairment and vascular dementia: A meta-analysis.
32032361|a|Cognitive impairment is a common complication observed after a stroke. Currently there are no definitively proven pharmacologic therapies for recovery from post-stroke cognitive impairment and vascular dementia. In this meta-analysis, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of cholinesterase inhibitors in their improvement of cognition in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment and vascular dementia. We conducted a meta-analysis using seven eligible studies from 305 published articles. We investigated the differences in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores, before and after cholinergic augmentation in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment and vascular dementia. MMSE and ADAS-cog scores were also compared during the subsequent follow-up periods. MMSE score of patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment was increased after cholinergic augmentation throughout the 24 weeks with mean differences [MD] of 3.000, 1.732, 1.578 1.516, and 1.222, at 4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-18, and 18-24 weeks, respectively. In addition, ADAS-cog scores decreased at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks by pharmaceutical augmentation, but not with placebo with mean differences [MD] of -2.333, -2.913, -2.767, -2.416, and -1.859, respectively. This meta-analysis shows that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors maintain a stable pattern of improved cognitive function in patients with post stroke cognitive impairment and vascular dementia without the increased risk of side effects.
