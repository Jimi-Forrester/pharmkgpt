33074225|t|Reduction of Dendritic Inhibition in CA1 Pyramidal Neurons in Amyloidosis Models of Early Alzheimer's Disease.
33074225|a|BACKGROUND: In an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), before the formation of amyloid plaques, neuronal network hyperactivity has been reported in both patients and animal models. This suggests an underlying disturbance of the balance between excitation and inhibition. Several studies have highlighted the role of somatic inhibition in early AD, while less is known about dendritic inhibition. OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated how inhibitory synaptic currents are affected by elevated Abeta levels. METHODS: We performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures after treatment with Abeta-oligomers and in hippocampal brain slices from AppNL-F-G mice (APP-KI). RESULTS: We found a reduction of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons in organotypic slices after 24 h Abeta treatment. sIPSCs with slow rise times were reduced, suggesting a specific loss of dendritic inhibitory inputs. As miniature IPSCs and synaptic density were unaffected, these results suggest a decrease in activity-dependent transmission after Abeta treatment. We observed a similar, although weaker, reduction in sIPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons from APP-KI mice compared to control. When separated by sex, the strongest reduction in sIPSC frequency was found in slices from male APP-KI mice. Consistent with hyperexcitability in pyramidal cells, dendritically targeting interneurons received slightly more excitatory input. GABAergic action potentials had faster kinetics in APP-KI slices. CONCLUSION: Our results show that Abeta affects dendritic inhibition via impaired action potential driven release, possibly due to altered kinetics of GABAergic action potentials. Reduced dendritic inhibition may contribute to neuronal hyperactivity in early AD.
