37511713|a|Pupillary light reflex (PLR) assessment is a crucial examination for evaluating brainstem function, particularly in patients with acute brain injury and neurosurgical conditions. The PLR is controlled by neural pathways modulated by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Altered PLR is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes after traumatic and ischemic brain injuries. However, the assessment of PLR needs to take many factors into account since it can be modulated by various medications, alcohol consumption, and neurodegenerative diseases. The development of devices capable of measuring pupil size and assessing PLR quantitatively has revolutionized the non-invasive neurological examination. Automated pupillometry, which is more accurate and precise, is widely used in diverse clinical situations. This review presents our current understanding of the anatomical and physiological basis of the PLR and the application of automated pupillometry in managing neurocritical patients. We also discuss new technologies that are being developed, such as smartphone-based pupillometry devices, which are particularly beneficial in low-resource settings.
