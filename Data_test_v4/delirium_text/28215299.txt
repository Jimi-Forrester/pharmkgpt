28215299|t|Zinc Interactions With Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Related Peptide Fragments.
28215299|a|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin essential for neuronal development and survival, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function. Dysregulation of BDNF signaling is involved in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Alteration of metal ion homeostasis is observed both in normal aging and in many neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, there is a significant overlap between brain areas characterized by metal ion dyshomeostasis and those where BDNF exerts its biological activity. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that metal ions, especially zinc, can modulate the activity of BDNF. The synthesis of BDNF peptidomimetic can be helpful both to understand the molecular interaction of BDNF with metal ions and to develop new drugs for neurodegenerative diseases.
