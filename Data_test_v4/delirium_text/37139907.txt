37139907|a|Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators play key functions in the resolution of the acute inflammatory response. Herein, we elucidate the stereochemical structure of the new 4S,5R-RCTR1, a cysteinyl-resolvin, recently uncovered in human leukocytes incubated with a 4S,5S-epoxy-resolvin intermediate, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and ultra-violet (UV) spectrophotometry. With this approach, the physical properties of the new mediator prepared by total organic synthesis were matched to enzymatically produced biogenic material. In addition, we confirmed the potent biological actions of 4S,5R-RCTR1 with human M2-like macrophage phagocytosis of live bacteria, efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, and erythrophagocytosis of senescent human red blood cells in a concentration-dependent manner from 0.1 to 10 nM. Taken together, these results establish the complete stereochemistry of 4S,5R-RCTR1 as 5R-glutathionyl-4S,17S-dihydroxy-6E,8E,10Z,13Z,15E,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid and give evidence of its novel bioactivities in human phagocyte responses. Moreover, they confirm and extend the stereoselective functions of the 4S,5R-RCTR1 with isolated human phagocytes of interest in the resolution of inflammation.
