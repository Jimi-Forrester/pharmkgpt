36831264|t|TDP-43 Proteinopathy Specific Biomarker Development.
36831264|a|TDP-43 is the primary or secondary pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, half of frontotemporal dementia cases, and limbic age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy, which clinically resembles Alzheimer's dementia. In such diseases, a biomarker that can detect TDP-43 proteinopathy in life would help to stratify patients according to their definite diagnosis of pathology, rather than in clinical subgroups of uncertain pathology. For therapies developed to target pathological proteins that cause the disease a biomarker to detect and track the underlying pathology would greatly enhance such undertakings. This article reviews the latest developments and outlooks of deriving TDP-43-specific biomarkers from the pathophysiological processes involved in the development of TDP-43 proteinopathy and studies using biosamples from clinical entities associated with TDP-43 pathology to investigate biomarker candidates.
