39037968|a|INTRODUCTION: Minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting (MICS CABG) offers a new paradigm in coronary revascularization. This study aims to compare the outcomes of MICS CABG with those of conventional median sternotomy CABG (MS CABG) within a growing minimally invasive cardiac surgical program in Singapore. METHODS: Propensity matching produced 111 patient pairs who underwent MICS CABG or MS CABG between January 2009 and February 2020 at the National University Heart Centre, Singapore. Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery patients were matched to single- or double-graft MS CABG patients (Group 1). Multivessel MICS CABG patients were matched to MS CABG patients with equal number of grafts (Group 2). RESULTS: Overall, MICS CABG patients experienced shorter postoperative length of stay (P<0.071). In Group 2, procedural duration (P<0.001) was longer among MICS CABG patients, but it did not translate to adverse postoperative events. Postoperative outcomes, including 30-day mortality, reopening for bleeding, new onset atrial fibrillation as well as neurological, pulmonary, renal, and infectious complications were comparable between MICS and MS CABG groups. CONCLUSION: MICS CABG is a safe and effective approach for surgical revascularization of coronary artery disease and trends toward a reduction in hospital stay.
