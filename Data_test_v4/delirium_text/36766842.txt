36766842|t|Beyond Pellagra-Research Models and Strategies Addressing the Enduring Clinical Relevance of NAD Deficiency in Aging and Disease.
36766842|a|Research into the functions of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) has intensified in recent years due to the insight that abnormally low levels of NAD are involved in many human pathologies including metabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, reproductive dysfunction, cancer, and aging. Consequently, the development and validation of novel NAD-boosting strategies has been of central interest, along with the development of models that accurately represent the complexity of human NAD dynamics and deficiency levels. In this review, we discuss pioneering research and show how modern researchers have long since moved past believing that pellagra is the overt and most dramatic clinical presentation of NAD deficiency. The current research is centered on common human health conditions associated with moderate, but clinically relevant, NAD deficiency. In vitro and in vivo research models that have been developed specifically to study NAD deficiency are reviewed here, along with emerging strategies to increase the intracellular NAD concentrations.
