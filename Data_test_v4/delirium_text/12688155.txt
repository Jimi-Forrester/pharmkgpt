12688155|t|[Determination of advanced glycation end products].
12688155|a|Advanced glycation end products--AGEs take part in the pathogenesis of many diseases and their complications--e.g. diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease. Their determination could be of importance for follow up of progression of these diseases. Determination of AGEs is very difficult due to the heterogeneity of this group of substances, lack of standards, long analytical procedures and necessity of equipment. There are several methods for determination of advanced glycation end products: immunochemical method--ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) with the use of either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, fluorimetry using the characteristic fluorescence spectrum of AGEs, HPLC--high performance liquid chromatography, and MS--mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry is the best and most precise method. When coupled with other methods, mass spectrometry is a unique research method, which can be used mainly for characterization of new AGEs. HPLC is very precise as well, but its drawback is time-consuming sample preparation. Fluorimetry and ELISA could be in the future used for the special diagnostic of complications of chronic diseases.
