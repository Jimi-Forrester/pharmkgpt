36686403|a|The rapid increase in global population and shrinkage of agricultural land necessitates the use of cost-effective renewable sources as alternative to excessive resource-demanding agricultural crops. Microalgae seem to be a potential substitute as it rapidly produces large biomass that can serve as a good source of various functional ingredients that are not produced/synthesized inside the human body and high-value nonessential bioactive compounds. Microalgae-derived bioactive metabolites possess various bioactivities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-carcinogenic, anti-hypertensive, anti-lipidemic, and anti-diabetic activities, thereof rapidly elevating their demand as interesting option in pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and functional foods industries for developing new products. However, their utilization in these sectors has been limited. This demands more research to explore the functionality of microalgae derived functional ingredients. Therefore, in this review, we intended to furnish up-to-date knowledge on prospects of bioactive metabolites from microalgae, their bioactivities related to health, the process of microalgae cultivation and harvesting, extraction and purification of bioactive metabolites, role as dietary supplements or functional food, their commercial applications in nutritional and pharmaceutical industries and the challenges in this area of research.
