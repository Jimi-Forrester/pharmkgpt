30102884|a|The new National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association Research Framework for Alzheimer's disease has been developed to accelerate drug discovery and offer a common structure and language to construct new Alzheimer's disease conceptual models. However, as a "complex" disease, a model based on systems-level understanding is needed to accommodate the complex, interacting etiologic pathways and the system-level changes associated with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and interventions that are currently known and which will be identified in the future. To accomplish this, the evolution of the structure of the research framework itself should be encouraged.
