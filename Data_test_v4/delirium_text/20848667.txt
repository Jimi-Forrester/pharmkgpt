20848667|a|BACKGROUND: Coriandrum sativum L., commonly known as coriander and belonging to the family Apiaceae (Umbelliferae), is cultivated throughout the world for its nutritional value. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of fresh Coriandrum sativum leaves (CSL) on cognitive functions, total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice. In this study, CSL (5, 10 and 15% w/w of diet) was fed orally with a specially prepared diet for 45 days consecutively to experimental animals. Elevated plus-maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory. Diazepam, scopolamine and ageing-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models. RESULTS: CSL (5, 10 and 15% w/w of diet) produced a dose-dependent improvement in memory scores of young as well as aged mice. CSL also reversed successfully the memory deficits induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg kg(-1), i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg kg(-1), i.p.). Interestingly, brain cholinesterase activity and serum total cholesterol levels were considerably reduced by CSL administration in daily diets concomitantly for 45 days. CONCLUSION: CSL may be a useful remedy in the management of Alzheimer's disease on account of its multifarious effects such as, memory-improving property, cholesterol-lowering property and anticholinesterase activity.
