38783365|t|Quality of health care for patients with coronary heart disease and comorbid mental disorders: a prospective cohort study.
38783365|a|BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is often associated with mental disorders (MDs). Comorbid MDs reduce the quality of life and increase cardiac morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, there is little and inconsistent research on the management of MDs in CHD patients. To bridge this gap, this study aims to gain insight into the long-term course of MD-related health care for patients with CHD, in order to identify opportunities for care improvement. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we investigated whether CHD patients with or without expert-rated MD at baseline (N = 364) received different MD-related health care from either their general practitioner (GP) or cardiologist at follow-up, M = 2.7 [2.0-4.0] years later. In the follow-up assessment, N = 131 CHD patients participated and received questionnaires capturing sociodemographic, mental health, and MD-related health care characteristics. Descriptive statistics, t-tests and chi-squared tests were used for analyses. RESULTS: We found significant differences in MD-related health care. CHD patients with MD were more likely to be examined psychologically/psychiatrically (MD 55.9%, non-MD 16.7%, p = < .001) and diagnosed with MD (MD 55.9%, non-MD 13.5%, p = .020) by their GP or cardiologist. Recommendations for and responses to requests for psychotherapy were more likely in MD patients compared to non-MD patients (MD 38.7%, non-MD 11.8%, p = .012 and MD 38.5%, non-MD 11.8%, p = .031, respectively). No significant differences were found concerning physicians' active demand for patients' mental health, referral to a specialist for additional diagnostics, provision of information about the diagnosed MD and further treatment options, response to the patients' request for psychopharmacotherapy, help received in finding psychotherapy or psychopharmacotherapy, and actual receipt of these treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate differences in MD-related health care of CHD patients with and without comorbid MD. However, they still highlight the need to further encourage primary care physicians treating CHD to adequately address MDs, provide further diagnostics, support, and information to affected patients. To address this, physicians may benefit from awareness training on the association between CHD and MDs and on appropriate communication with MD patients.
