38436788|t|Advances in using ultrasound to regulate the nervous system.
38436788|a|Ultrasound is a mechanical vibration with a frequency greater than 20 kHz. Due to its high spatial resolution, good directionality, and convenient operation in neural regulation, it has recently received increasing attention from scientists. However, the mechanism by which ultrasound regulates the nervous system is still unclear. This article mainly explores the possible mechanisms of ultrasound's mechanical effects, cavitation effects, thermal effects, and the rise of sonogenetics. In addition, the essence of action potential and its relationship with ultrasound were also discussed. Traditional theory treats nerve impulses as pure electrical signals, similar to cable theory. However, this theory cannot explain the phenomenon of inductance and cell membrane bulging out during the propagation of action potential. Therefore, the flexoelectric effect of cell membrane and soliton model reveal that action potential may also be a mechanical wave. Finally, we also elaborated the therapeutic effect of ultrasound on nervous system disease such as epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.
