37332910|t|TRP channels: Role in neurodegenerative diseases and therapeutic targets.
37332910|a|TRP (Transient receptor potential) channels are integral membrane proteins consisting of a superfamily of cation channels that allow permeability of both monovalent and divalent cations. TRP channels are subdivided into six subfamilies: TRPC, TRPV, TRPM, TRPP, TRPML, and TRPA, and are expressed in almost every cell and tissue. TRPs play an instrumental role in the regulation of various physiological processes. TRP channels are extensively represented in brain tissues and are present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, exhibiting responses to several mechanisms, including physical, chemical, and thermal stimuli. TRP channels are involved in the perturbation of Ca2+ homeostasis in intracellular calcium stores, both in neuronal and non-neuronal cells, and its discrepancy leads to several neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). TRPs participate in neurite outgrowth, receptor signaling, and excitotoxic cell death in the central nervous system. Understanding the mechanism of TRP channels in neurodegenerative diseases may extend to developing novel therapies. Thus, this review articulates TRP channels' physiological and pathological role in exploring new therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases.
