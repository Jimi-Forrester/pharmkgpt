20483541|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate mental disorders among acute hospitalized burn patients. METHOD: Consecutive acute adult burn patients (n=107) admitted to Helsinki Burn Centre were interviewed by an experienced psychiatrist with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR for Axis I and II mental disorders assessed in three time frames (lifetime, the month prior to burn, and in acute care). Information on clinical features, psychiatric symptoms, personality traits, and burn severity (total body surface area, TBSA) was gathered. RESULTS: The mean TBSA was 9%. Most (61%) acute burn patients had at least one lifetime Axis I or II mental disorder. Prevalences of lifetime substance-related disorders (47%), psychotic disorders (10%), and Axis II personality disorders (23%) were high. The overall prevalence of Axis I mental disorders increased significantly (Q=6.40, df=1, p=0.011) from the month prior to burn (40%) to acute care (48%). The prevalence of delirium for this period was significantly higher (0.9% vs. 13%; Q=13.00, df=1, p<0.001) in acute care. CONCLUSIONS: Mental disorders, particularly substance use disorders, psychotic disorders, and personality disorders are common among acute burn patients before injury. These disorders may predispose to burns. Burn itself may also predispose to mental disorders, particularly delirium.
