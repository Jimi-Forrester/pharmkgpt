37868375|t|Acute Psychotic Episode Precipitated by Opioid Withdrawal in a Case of Bipolar I Disorder.
37868375|a|Psychosis is a state of mind where an individual loses touch with reality and cannot differentiate between their perceptions and the real world. They experience one or more of the following: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech or catatonic behavior. While it can have a sporadic onset, drug-induced psychosis is also very common. When a person consuming large quantities of a particular drug, such as opioids, stops consuming the drug and enters the rehabilitation stage, this is a vulnerable time due to abrupt chemical changes. It can predispose the individual to psychosis due to withdrawal from the drug. Here, we present a 30-year-old Caucasian female who underwent rehabilitation and was treated successfully with buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) for eight months. However, due to a comorbid psychiatric condition, mania, she was not able to adhere to her medication regimen, which led to an abrupt discontinuation of her maintenance medication, and this led to psychotic symptoms, including agitation, hallucinations, delusions, and bizarre behavior surrounding her family and individual health. Later, she restarted on buprenorphine/naloxone, which led to a gradual recovery and disappearance of her psychotic symptoms.
