36320228|a|Red emissive carbon dots (R-CDs) have received great attention in biological fields due to their deep tissue penetrability, great bioimaging capability, low interference from auto-fluorescence, and potential for optoelectronic applications. Herein, excitation-independent, highly acid-sensitive R-CDs were successfully obtained via one-step microwave treatment of o-phenylenediamine (o-PD) and phosphoric acid and carefully purified by column chromatography. The relationship between the fluorescence emission and surface groups of the R-CDs was studied in detail using XPS, NMR, and fluorescence spectroscopy, and the different mechanisms of action of the R-CDs and acid in H2O and ethanol were determined. The excellent anti-interference ability and biocompatibility of the R-CDs were confirmed, and the probes were successfully used for imaging A549 and Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells in extreme acidity. Finally, based on their relatively high quantum yield and long wavelength emission, the application potential of the R-CDs in the fabrication of red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) was investigated.
