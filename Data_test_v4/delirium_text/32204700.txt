32204700|a|BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of delirium is very important for prevention and treatment. Present study was designed to validate the 3-Minute Diagnostic Interview for CAM-defined Delirium Chinese version (3D-CAM-CN) in surgical ICU patients. METHODS: In this prospective diagnostic study, the 3D-CAM was translated into Chinese with culture adaption. Two interviewers (Roles A and B) independently administrated 3D-CAM-CN assessment in adult patients from postoperative days 1 to day 3. At the meantime, a panel of psychiatrists diagnosed delirium according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-fifth edition as the reference standard. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated to analyze the diagnostic character of the 3D-CAM-CN. Kappa coefficient was used to evaluate interrater reliability. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-five adult patients were assessed for at least 2 days, resulting a total of 647 paired-assessments. When compared with the reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the 3D-CAM-CN assessment were 87.2 and 96.7%, respectively, by Role A and 84.6 and 97.4%, respectively, by Role B, with good interrater reliability (Kappa coefficient = 0.82, P < 0.001). It also performed well in patients with mild cognitive impairment, with the sensitivity from 85.7 to 100% and the specificity from 95.7 to 96.4%. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the 3D-CAM-CN can be used as a reliable and accurate instrument for delirium assessment in surgical patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trail was approved by the Clinical Research Ethic Committee of Peking University First Hospital (No. 2017-1321) and registered on Chinese clinical trial registry on July 6, 2017 (ChiCTR-OOC-17011887).
