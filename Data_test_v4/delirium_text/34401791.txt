34401791|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate outcomes of single sternum access for right subclavian artery cannulation without infraclavicular incision in surgery of the thoracic aorta. METHODS: Between January 2015 and December 2019, 44 consecutive patients underwent surgery of the thoracic aorta with cannulation of the right subclavian artery, after sternotomy and before pericardiotomy, through a direct percutaneous cannula with a single access without additional infraclavicular skin incision. The indication for surgery was type A acute aortic dissection in 29 patients (65.9%), proximal aortic aneurysm in 11 (25%), and aneurysm of the aortic arch in 4 (9%). Operative procedures were replacement of the ascending aorta in 23 patients, Bentall procedure in 10, hemiarch replacement in 6, and total arch replacement in 5. The mean cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cross-clamp times were 185 +- 62 minutes and 138 +- 41 minutes, respectively. RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality rate was 6.8%. Permanent neurologic dysfunction occurred in 3 patients (6.8%) and temporary neurologic dysfunction occurred in 4 patients (9.0%). There were no vascular complications related to this technique. No lesions to the vagus and recurrent laryngeal nerves have been reported. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, a single sternum access for right subclavian artery cannulation avoids the risk and complications of an infraclavicular incision required for axillary artery cannulation. This technique is safe and represent a valid option for CBP and antegrade cerebral perfusion during surgery of the thoracic aorta.
