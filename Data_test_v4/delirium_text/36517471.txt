36517471|t|Association of circadian rhythms with brain disorder incidents: a prospective cohort study of 72242 participants.
36517471|a|Circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) is a shared characteristic of various brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and major depression disorder (MDD). Disruption of circadian rhythm might be a risk factor for brain disorder incidents. From 7-day accelerometry data of 72,242 participants in UK Biobank, we derived a circadian relative amplitude variable, which to some extent reflected the degree of circadian rhythm disruption. Records of brain disorder incidents were obtained from a wide range of health outcomes across self-report, primary care, hospital inpatient data, and death data. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazard ratio regression, we created two models adjusting for different covariates. Then, linear correlations between relative amplitude and several brain morphometric measures were examined in participants with brain MRI data. After a median follow-up of around 6.1 years, 72,242 participants were included in the current study (female 54.9%; mean age 62.1 years). Individuals with reduced relative amplitude had increasing risk of all-cause dementia (Hazard ratio 1.23 [95% CI 1.15 to 1.31]), PD (1.33 [1.25 to 1.41]), stroke (1.13 [1.06 to 1.22]), MDD (1.18 [1.13 to 1.23]), and anxiety disorder (1.14 [1.09 to 1.20]) in fully adjusted models. Additionally, significant correlations were found between several cortical regions and white matter tracts and relative amplitude that have been linked to dementia and psychiatric disorders. We confirm CRD to be a risk factor for various brain disorders. Interventions for regulating circadian rhythm may have clinical relevance to reducing the risk of various brain disorders.
