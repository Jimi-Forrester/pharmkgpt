37670828|t|Association between serum globulin and cognitive impairment in older American adults.
37670828|a|Background and aims: Cognitive impairment is on the rise around the world, with profound economic and social consequences. Serum globulin, a marker of liver function, may also play a role in cognitive function. Unfortunately, no consistent conclusion exists regarding the association between serum globulin and cognitive function. Methods: Data from the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to assess the association between serum globulin and cognitive impairment. Cognitive function was assessed by three tests: Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD), Animal Fluency (AF), and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Furthermore, the breakthrough point of cognitive impairment correlated with CERAD < 5, AF < 14, and DSST < 34. A weighted multiple logistics regression model was used to verify the association between serum globulin and cognitive impairment. Generalized additive models (GAMs) and a smooth curve fit (penalty spline method) were used to determine a non-linear relationship between serum globulin and cognitive impairment. Finally, subgroup analysis and interaction tests were conducted to further verify the association between serum globulin and cognitive impairment. Results: Data from 2,768 participants aged >=60 (in accordance with the study design) were collected for the final analysis. Data suggested that serum globulin levels were associated with an elevated cognitive impairment based on the AF [full adjustment, OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.08] and DSST [full adjustment, OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02-1.10] tests. Eventually, the GAM and smooth curve fit model was conducted to confirm that the association between serum globulin and cognitive impairment was non-linear. Moreover, the inflection point was 27 g/L serum globulin based on the CERAD test and 35 g/L serum globulin based on the AF test. Finally, the interaction term between serum globulin and cognitive impairment based on the AF test indicated no significant interactions among all variables (all p for interaction >0.05). Conclusion: The association between serum globulin levels and cognitive impairment is non-linear. A threshold effect exists between serum globulin and cognitive impairment. Large-scale prospective clinical trials are needed to validate our findings.
