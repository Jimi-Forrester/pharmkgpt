33628687|t|Large Aerodigestive Tract Foreign Body Extraction Complicated by End-Stage Dementia.
33628687|a|A foreign body in the upper aerodigestive tract can be life-threatening. It is especially challenging for surgeons and anesthesiologists working in a limited shared workspace. A case is presented of an 83-year-old woman with end-stage dementia afflicted with oral fixation as defined as overeating or putting objects in the mouth other than food. She appeared asymptomatic although she had altered baseline mentation and was found to have ingested a large foreign object. This case provides an opportunity to discuss the unique challenges of performing anesthesia on patients undergoing the extraction of a large upper aerodigestive tract foreign body, complicated by end-stage dementia.
