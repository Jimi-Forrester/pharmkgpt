32220012|a|GABAA receptors are composed of five subunits arranged around a central chloride channel. Their subunits originate from different genes or gene families. The majority of GABAA receptors in the mammalian brain consist of two alpha-, two beta- and one gamma- or delta-subunit. This subunit organization crucially determines the physiological and pharmacological properties of the GABAA receptors. Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of 10 GABAA receptor subunits (alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha4, alpha5, beta1, beta2, beta3, gamma2, and delta) in the fore brain of three female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Within the cerebral cortex, subunits alpha1, alpha5, beta2, beta3, and gamma2 were found in all layers, alpha2, alpha3, and beta1 were more concentrated in the inner and outer layers. The caudate/putamen was rich in alpha1, alpha2, alpha5, all three beta-subunits, gamma2, and delta. Subunits alpha3 and alpha5 were more concentrated in the caudate than in the putamen. In contrast, alpha1, alpha2, beta1, beta2, gamma2, and delta were highest in the pallidum. Most dorsal thalamic nuclei contained subunits alpha1, alpha2, alpha4, beta2, beta3, and gamma2, whereas alpha1, alpha3, beta1, and gamma2 were most abundant in the reticular nucleus. Within the amygdala, subunits alpha1, alpha2, alpha5, beta1, beta3, gamma2, and delta were concentrated in the cortical nucleus, whereas in the lateral and basolateral amygdala alpha1, alpha2, alpha5, beta1, beta3, and delta, and in the central amygdala alpha1, alpha2, beta3, and gamma2 were most abundant. Interestingly, subunit alpha3-IR outlined the intercalated nuclei of the amygdala. In the hippocampus, subunits alpha1, alpha2, alpha5, beta2, beta3, gamma2, and delta were highly expressed in the dentate molecular layer, whereas alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha5, beta1, beta2, beta3, and gamma2 were concentrated in sector CA1 and the subiculum. The distribution of GABAA receptor subunits in the rhesus monkey was highly heterogeneous indicating a high number of differently assembled receptors. In most areas investigated, notably in the striatum/pallidum, amygdaloid nuclei and in the hippocampus it was more diverse than in the rat and mouse indicating a more heterogeneous and less defined receptor assembly in the monkey than in rodent brain.
