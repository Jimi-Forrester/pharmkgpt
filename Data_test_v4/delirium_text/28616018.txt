28616018|t|Collapsin response mediator protein-2 plays a major protective role in acute axonal degeneration.
28616018|a|Axonal degeneration is a key pathological feature in many neurological diseases. It often leads to persistent deficits due to the inability of axons to regenerate in the central nervous system. Therefore therapeutic approaches should optimally both attenuate axonal degeneration and foster axonal regeneration. Compelling evidence suggests that collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2) might be a molecular target fulfilling these requirements. In this mini-review, we give a compact overview of the known functions of CRMP2 and its molecular interactors in neurite outgrowth and in neurodegenerative conditions. Moreover, we discuss in detail our recent findings on the role of CRMP2 in acute axonal degeneration in the optic nerve. We found that the calcium influx induced by the lesion activates the protease calpain which cleaves CRMP2, leading to impairment of axonal transport. Both calpain inhibition and CRMP2 overexpression effectively protected the proximal axons against acute axonal degeneration. Taken together, CRMP2 is further characterized as a central molecular player in acute axonal degeneration and thus evolves as a promising therapeutic target to both counteract axonal degeneration and foster axonal regeneration in neurodegenerative and neurotraumatic diseases.
