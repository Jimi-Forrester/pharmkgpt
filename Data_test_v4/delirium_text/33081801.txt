33081801|a|BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain (NeuP) is a chronic and challenging clinical problem, with little effective treatment. Resveratrol has shown neuroprotection by inhibiting inflammatory response in NeuP. Recently, the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) expressed by microglia was identified as a critical factor of inflammation in nervous system diseases. In this study, we explored whether resveratrol could ameliorate neuroinflammation and produce anti-mechanical allodynia effects via regulating TREM2 in spared nerve injury rats, as well as investigated the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: A spared nerve injury (SNI) rat model was performed to investigate whether resveratrol could exert anti-mechanical allodynia effects via inhibiting neuroinflammation. To evaluate the role of TREM2 in anti-neuroinflammatory function of resveratrol, lentivirus coding TREM2 was intrathecally injected into SNI rats to activate TREM2, and the pain behavior was detected by the von Frey test. Furthermore, 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor) was applied to study the molecular mechanisms of resveratrol-mediated anti-neuroinflammation using Western blot, qPCR, and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: The TREM2 expression and number of the microglial cells were significantly increased in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn after SNI. We found that intrathecal administration of resveratrol (300ug/day) alleviated mechanical allodynia; obviously enhanced autophagy; and markedly reduced the levels of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn after SNI. Moreover, the number of Iba-1+ microglial cells and TREM2 expression were downregulated after resveratrol treatment. Intrathecal administration of lentivirus coding TREM2 and/or 3-MA in those rats induced deficiencies in resveratrol-mediated anti-inflammation, leading to mechanical allodynia that could be rescued via administration of Res. Furthermore, 3-MA treatment contributed to TREM2-mediated mechanical allodynia. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data reveal that resveratrol relieves neuropathic pain through suppressing microglia-mediated neuroinflammation via regulating the TREM2-autophagy axis in SNI rats.
