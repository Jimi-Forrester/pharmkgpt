31538538|a|Recent investigations suggest that soluble oligomeric amyloid beta (Abeta) species may be involved in early onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using systematic proline replacement, solid-state NMR, and ESR, we identified a toxic turn at position 22 and 23 of Abeta42, the most potent neurotoxic Abeta species. Through radicalization, the toxic turn can induce formation of the C-terminal hydrophobic core to obtain putative Abeta42 dimers and trimers. Synthesized dimer and trimer models showed that the C-terminal hydrophobic core plays a critical role in the formation of high molecular weight oligomers with neurotoxicity. Accordingly, an anti-toxic turn antibody (24B3) that selectively recognizes a toxic dimer model of E22P-Abeta42 was developed. Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with 24B3 and 82E1 detected a significantly higher ratio of Abeta42 with a toxic turn to total Abeta42 in cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients compared with controls, suggesting that 24B3 could be useful for early onset of AD diagnosis.
