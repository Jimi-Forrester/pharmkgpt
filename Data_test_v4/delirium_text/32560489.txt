32560489|t|Identification of Prion Disease-Related Somatic Mutations in the Prion Protein Gene (PRNP) in Cancer Patients.
32560489|a|Prion diseases are caused by misfolded prion protein (PrPSc) and are accompanied by spongiform vacuolation of brain lesions. Approximately three centuries have passed since prion diseases were first discovered around the world; however, the exact role of certain factors affecting the causative agent of prion diseases is still debatable. In recent studies, somatic mutations were assumed to be cause of several diseases. Thus, we postulated that genetically unstable cancer tissue may cause somatic mutations in the prion protein gene (PRNP), which could trigger the onset of prion diseases. To identify somatic mutations in the PRNP gene in cancer tissues, we analyzed somatic mutations in the PRNP gene in cancer patients using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In addition, to evaluate whether the somatic mutations in the PRNP gene in cancer patients had a damaging effect, we performed in silico analysis using PolyPhen-2, PANTHER, PROVEAN, and AMYCO. We identified a total of 48 somatic mutations in the PRNP gene, including 8 somatic mutations that are known pathogenic mutations of prion diseases. We identified significantly different distributions among the types of cancer, the mutation counts, and the ages of diagnosis between the total cancer patient population and cancer patients carrying somatic mutations in the PRNP gene. Strikingly, although invasive breast carcinoma and glioblastoma accounted for a high percentage of the total cancer patient population (9.9% and 5.4%, respectively), somatic mutations in the PRNP gene have not been identified in these two cancer types. We suggested the possibility that somatic mutations of the PRNP gene in glioblastoma can be masked by a diagnosis of prion disease. In addition, we found four aggregation-prone somatic mutations, these being L125F, E146Q, R151C, and K204N. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first specific analysis of the somatic mutations in the PRNP gene in cancer patients.
