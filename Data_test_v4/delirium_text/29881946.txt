29881946|t|Neuronal and Glial Differentiation of Human Neural Stem Cells Is Regulated by Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) Levels.
29881946|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is implicated in neural development as well as in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, its biological function still remains unclear. It has been reported that APP stimulates the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs), while other studies suggest an important effect enhancing gliogenesis in NSCs. As expected, APP protein/mRNA is detected in hNS1 cells, a model cell line of human NSCs, both under proliferation and throughout the differentiation period. To investigate the potential function that APP plays in cell fate specification and differentiation of hNS1 cells, we transiently increased human APP levels in these cells and analyzed its cell intrinsic effects. Our data indicate that increased levels of APP induce early cell cycle exit and instructively direct hNS1 cell fate towards a glial phenotype, while decreasing neuronal differentiation. Since elevated APP levels also enhanced APP intracellular domain (AICD)-immunoreactivity, these effects could be, in part, mediated by the APP/AICD system. The AICD domain can play a potential role in signal transduction by its molecular interaction with different target genes such as GSK3B, whose expression was also increased in APP-overexpressing cells that, in turn, may contribute to promoting gliogenesis and inhibiting neurogenesis in NSCs. These data suggest an important action of APP in modulating hNSCs differentiation (probably in an AICD-GSK-3beta-dependent manner) and may thus be important for the future development of stem cell therapy strategies for the diseased mammalian brain.
