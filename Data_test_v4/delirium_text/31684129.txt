31684129|t|Automated Stopped-Flow Fluorimetric Sensor for Biologically Active Adamantane Derivatives Based on Zone Fluidics.
31684129|a|A zone-fluidics (ZF) based automated fluorimetric sensor for the determination of pharmaceutically active adamantine derivatives, i.e., amantadine (AMA), memantine (MEM) and rimantadine (RIM) is reported. Discrete zones of the analytes and reagents (o-phthalaldehyde and N-acetylcysteine) mix and react under stopped-flow conditions to yield fluorescent iso-indole derivatives (lambdaex/ lambdaem = 340/455 nm). The proposed ZF sensor was developed and validated to prove suitable for quality control tests (assay and content uniformity) of commercially available formulations purchased from the Greek market (EU licensed) and from non-EU web-pharmacies at a sampling rate of 16 h-1. Interestingly, a formulation obtained through the internet and produced in a third-non-EU-country (AMA capsules, 100 mg per cap), was found to be out of specifications (mean assay of 85.3%); a validated HPLC method was also applied for confirmatory purposes.
