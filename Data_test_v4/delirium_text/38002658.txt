38002658|t|Early Stabilization Does Not Increase Complication Rates in Acetabular Fractures of the Elderly: A Retrospective Analysis from the German Pelvis Registry.
38002658|a|Background: The incidence of acetabular fractures in geriatric patients has increased. Although there are strong data supporting the early operative treatment of hip fractures in geriatric patients, the optimal timing for acetabular fractures remains unclear and for several reasons, delayed treatment after trauma is common. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the German Pelvis Registry between 2008 and 2017 was performed. Ultimately, 665 patients with fractures of the anterior column or anterior column and posterior hemitransverse were enrolled. Patients above and below 65 years of age with these fracture types were analyzed regarding surgery day (within 48 hours, between 2 and 4 days, after 4 days), complication rate, reduction quality, and hospital stay. Results: The complication rate of the geriatric group was twice as high as that of younger patients; however, this finding was independent of the timing of surgery. Reduction quality and hospital stay were independent of surgical timing. Conclusions: In contrast to other fracture types, such as proximal femur fractures, the timing of surgery for acetabular fractures does not have a significant impact on the patient's outcome. The optimal time for surgery cannot be determined using the current data. However, as expected, there is a significantly higher risk for postoperative complications in the geriatric population.
