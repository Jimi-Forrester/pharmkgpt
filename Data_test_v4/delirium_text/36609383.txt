36609383|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the early outcomes of the new semi-constrained revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) system by performing subgroup analysis according to the revision cause. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From August 2019 to July 2020, 83 revision TKAs using the fixed-bearing Attune  revision knee system with a minimum follow-up of 2 years were retrospectively reviewed. Clinically, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, and range of motion (ROM) were evaluated. The incidence of systemic and specific postoperative complications was investigated. Each cohort was divided into septic (group A, 34 patients) and aseptic mode (group B, 41 patients), and compared to assess the outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age at the time of revision was 73.3 years (range 59.0 to 84.0 years), and the follow-up duration was 36.1 months (range 30.0 to 40.0 months). Clinical outcomes and ROM significantly improved at last follow-up (p < 0.001). Group A showed statistically inferior clinical outcomes in the last follow-up compared to group B. Four knees (5.3%) had a postoperative femoral joint line elevation of more than 5 mm. There were no serious systemic complications. One patient underwent re-revision TKA due to recurrence of infection. No stem tip impingement or cortical erosion was observed in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Revision TKAs using a new semi-constrained revision system showed favorable short-term follow-up outcomes, with improvement in clinical scores and ROM. Moreover, by using stem offsets, no postoperative stem tip impingement or cortical erosion was found. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, Retrospective Case Series.
