22719732|t|Using Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation to Treat Depression in HIV-Infected Persons: The Outcomes of a Feasibility Study.
22719732|a|UNLABELLED: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel non-invasive neuromodulatory method that influences neuronal firing rates and excitability of neuronal circuits in the brain. tDCS has been shown to relieve Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in the general population, suggesting its potential for other vulnerable populations with high MDD prevalence. AIMS: This study evaluated the feasibility, safety, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of a 2-week tDCS antidepressant treatment in HIV-MDD co-diagnosed patients, and the feasibility of collecting serum and saliva for analysis of immunity biomarkers. METHODS: Ten enrolled patients underwent baseline evaluation and started the tDCS treatment (Monday-Friday for 2 weeks) delivered with Phoresor II 850 PM for 20 min at 2 mA at each visit, using two saline-soaked sponge electrodes placed over the F3 position of EEG 10-20 system and the contralateral supraorbital region. Outcome measures were collected at baseline, after the last tDCS and 2 weeks later. A quantitative microarray (Ray Bio Tech Inc.) for TH1/TH2 cytokines was used for saliva and plasma analysis. RESULTS: Analyzable outcome-data were obtained from eight subjects. Depression scores significantly decreased (p < 0.0005) after the treatment. No serious adverse events occurred. Several transient minor AEs and occasional changes of blood pressure and heart rate were noted. Mini-mental state examination scores remained unchanged or increased after the treatment. All subjects were highly satisfied with the protocol and treatment results and described the desire to find new treatments for HIV-MDD as motivating participation. CONCLUSION: Findings support feasibility and clinical potential of tDCS for HIV-MDD patients, and justify larger-sample, sham-controlled trials.
