25337178|t|Transoesophageal echocardiography reduces invasiveness of cavoatrial tumour thrombectomy.
25337178|a|The traditional approach to cavoatrial thrombus excision requires median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass with or without hypothermia and circulatory arrest and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We describe a transoesophageal echocardiography guided balloon catheter assisted technique for cavoatrial thrombectomy that avoids thoracotomy, extracorporeal circulation and circulatory arrest as an alternative to traditional methods. A 74-year-old man presented with a right solid renal mass confined to the kidney with thrombus extension through the right renal vein and the inferior vena cava into the right atrium. A right radical nephrectomy with cavoatrial thrombectomy under transoesophageal echocardiography guidance was successfully achieved using a balloon catheter-assisted technique with minimal intra-and postoperative morbidity. Cavoatrial tumour thrombectomy can be successfully performed without cardiopulmonary bypass, hypothermia and circulatory arrest.
