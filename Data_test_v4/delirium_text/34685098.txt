34685098|a|Quercetin is a flavonol present in many vegetables and fruits. Generally, quercetin can be found in aglycone and glycoside forms, mainly in leaves. The absorption of this compound occurs in the large and small intestine, where it suffers glucuronidation, sulfidation, and methylation to improve hydrophilicity. After metabolization, which occurs mainly in the gut, it is distributed throughout the whole organism and is excreted by feces, urine, and exhalation of carbon dioxide. Despite its in vitro cytotoxicity effects, in vivo studies with animal models ensure its safety. This compound can protect against cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegenerative diseases due to its radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its poor bioavailability dampens the potential beneficial effects of this flavonoid. In that sense, many types of nanocarriers have been developed to improve quercetin solubility, as well as to design tissue-specific delivery systems. All these studies manage to improve the bioavailability of quercetin, allowing it to increase its concentration in the desired places. Collectively, quercetin can become a promising compound if nanotechnology is employed as a tool to enhance its therapeutic efficacy.
