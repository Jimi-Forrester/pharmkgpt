33214645|a|Sex differences are considered predictive factors in the development of several neurological diseases, which are also known to coincide with impaired phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway activity, an essential signaling cascade involved in the control of several cellular functions such as autophagy and apoptosis. Here, under physiological conditions, we show important sex differences in the underlying balancing mechanisms that lead to similar AKT activity levels and autophagy and apoptosis processes in the two sexes. We demonstrate inverse sex-based expression of PTEN and Klotho, two important proteins that are known to negatively regulate the AKT pathway, and inverse sex-dependent levels of mTOR and FoxO3a activity. Taken together, our findings indicate that inverse sex-based regulation may be one of the underlying balancing mechanisms that differ between the sexes and a possible cause of sex-based autophagic and apoptotic responses to triggering situations that can lead to a sex-based predisposition to some neurological diseases.
