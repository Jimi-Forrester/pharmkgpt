37609925|a|BACKGROUND: Symptoms of acute alcohol withdrawal like tremors, seizures and delirium are commonly treated with benzodiazepines and vitamins. When complaints are not reacting to this treatment, an alternative diagnosis must be considered. Although hypomagnesemia is present in at least 30 percent of the patients with alcohol dependence, it can provoke and maintain these complaints. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a 43-year-old man with alcohol dependence, who shows neurological, muscular, and cardiac consequences of an undiagnosed hypomagnesemia. CONCLUSION: In daily clinical practice there is not enough attention for magnesium deficits, especially in patients with alcohol dependence. Serious complications can be prevented by recognizing and treating magnesium deficiency more adequately.
