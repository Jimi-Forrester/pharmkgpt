36768907|t|Coenzyme Q10 Metabolism: A Review of Unresolved Issues.
36768907|a|The variable success in the outcome of randomised controlled trials supplementing coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) may in turn be associated with a number of currently unresolved issues relating to CoQ10 metabolism. In this article, we have reviewed what is currently known about these factors and where gaps in knowledge exist that need to be further elucidated. Issues addressed include (i) whether the bioavailability of CoQ10 could be improved; (ii) whether CoQ10 could be administered intravenously; (iii) whether CoQ10 could be administered via alternative routes; (iv) whether CoQ10 can cross the blood-brain barrier; (v) how CoQ10 is transported into and within target cells; (vi) why some clinical trials supplementing CoQ10 may have been unsuccessful; and (vii) which is the most appropriate tissue for the clinical assessment of CoQ10 status.
