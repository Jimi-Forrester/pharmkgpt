8927896|a|Between 1991 and 1995, 334 persons from the city of Zurich have been investigated at the gerontologic counselling facility of the memory clinic of the nursing home Entlisberg near Zurich. 49 (14.7%) of these persons suffered from a treatable disease (16 from depression, 13 from chronic intoxication, 20 from other treatable diseases), 10 from other disturbances (debility or postapoplectic state), and 275 from dementia. In 45% of the cases dementia was moderate, in 47% moderate to severe, and in 8% severe. In most cases dementia was of Alzheimer's type (60.7%), others were of multi-infarct type (17.5%), of mixed type (13.1%), or other types (8.7%). Until march 1996, 64 (19.4%) of these 334 on the average 74-year-old persons treated in the memory clinic have been admitted to a city nursing home. They have compared to a random sample, including 312 demented persons of similar ages and similar date of admittance to the same institutions. The proportion of demented persons cared before admittance by a spouse was about 28% in both groups. On an average, the mini mental state (Zurich variant) at admittance to a nursing home was 10.95 points in patients from the memory clinic, compared to 13.43 points in the control group. Thus, patients that have formerly been advised and trained entered the nursing home in a state of dementia more advanced by 2.48 points. Based on an average yearly demelioration by about 2.4 points, this means admittance to a nursing home is delayed by 376 days. Patients for whom admittance to a nursing home could be avoided completely by the treatment proposed by the counselling were not considered in this calculation.
