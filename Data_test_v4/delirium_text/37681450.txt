37681450|t|Phase 1b safety and pharmacokinetics of intravenous and oral fosmanogepix in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and neutropenia.
37681450|a|OBJECTIVES: Fosmanogepix (APX001), a first-in-class, intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) antifungal prodrug, is being developed to treat invasive fungal diseases (IFDs). Manogepix (APX001A; active moiety) targets fungal glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell wall transfer protein 1, inhibiting cell wall synthesis causing loss of viability. This open-label, multicentre, Phase 1b study in patients with AML and neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <500 cells/muL; >10 days) undergoing chemotherapy aimed to assess tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of IV and PO fosmanogepix. METHODS: Of 21 adult AML patients undergoing remission induction chemotherapy, 10 received IV fosmanogepix (600 mg; q24h) and 11 received oral fosmanogepix (500 mg; q24h) over 14 days, with a 28 day follow-up. Patients also received remission induction chemotherapy [sequential high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone (S-HAM) or 7 + 3 regimen] for AML and IFD prophylaxis (posaconazole). A two-compartmental PK model from previous studies in healthy volunteers was fitted to manogepix plasma data. RESULTS: Of 26 fosmanogepix-related adverse events (AEs; IV: 14; PO: 12) in 9 (42.9%) patients [IV: 5 (50%); PO: 4 (36.4%)], none were serious or resulted in fosmanogepix discontinuation. Most frequently occurring fosmanogepix-related AEs were Grade 1/2 nausea [four events in three patients (14.3%)]; vomiting, ALT increase, and delirium [two events; two patients (9.5%) each]. One patient experienced fosmanogepix-related Grade 3 hypertension. Dose-corrected geometric mean ratio of AUC (PO-to-IV) was 95%. Elimination half-lives (~2 days) were consistent with prior studies in healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: Fosmanogepix was safe and well tolerated in AML patients with neutropenia receiving remission induction chemotherapy. Safety and PK profiles were comparable to healthy volunteers.
