34033708|t|Can Emerging Therapies Resolve Unmet Needs With Current Treatment in Early-Stage Alzheimer Disease?
34033708|a|While no current medications for Alzheimer disease (AD) can modify the disease, the agents do slow symptom progression. The earlier the medications are started for patients diagnosed with AD, the greater the potential benefit. Clinical trials are in progress on drugs with a variety of mechanisms that may modulate the disease course: neuronal protection; protein synthesis or aggregation inhibition; immunologic priming with antibodies; vaccines; and secretase inhibition. Early diagnosis, whether in the primary care setting or the specialty setting, continues to be critical to give patients their best chance at managing their illness. Although current treatments cannot give patients back what they have already lost, in the near future, drugs may be able to slow or even halt their cognitive and functional decline if clinicians identify AD early enough in the disease process.
