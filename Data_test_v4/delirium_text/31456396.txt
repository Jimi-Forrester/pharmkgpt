31456396|t|The Mitochondrial Peptide Humanin Targets but Does Not Denature Amyloid Oligomers in Type II Diabetes.
31456396|a|Mitochondrially derived peptides (MDPs) such as humanin (HN) have shown a remarkable ability to modulate neurological amyloids and apoptosis-associated proteins in cells and animal models. Recently, we found that humanin-like peptides also inhibit amyloid formation outside of neural environments in islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) fibrils and plaques, which are hallmarks of Type II diabetes. However, the biochemical basis for regulating amyloids through endogenous MDPs remains elusive. One hypothesis is that MDPs stabilize intermediate amyloid oligomers and discourage the formation of insoluble fibrils. To test this hypothesis, we carried out simulations and experiments to extract the dominant interactions between the S14G-HN mutant (HNG) and a diverse set of IAPP structures. Replica-exchange molecular dynamics suggests that MDPs cap the growth of amyloid oligomers. Simulations also indicate that HNG-IAPP heterodimers are 10 times more stable than IAPP homodimers, which explains the substoichiometric ability of HNG to inhibit amyloid growth. Despite this strong attraction, HNG does not denature IAPP. Instead, HNG binds IAPP near the disordered NFGAIL motif, wedging itself between amyloidogenic fragments. Shielding of NFGAIL-flanking fragments reduces the formation of parallel IAPP beta-sheets and subsequent nucleation of mature amyloid fibrils. From ThT spectroscopy and electron microscopy, we found that HNG does not deconstruct mature IAPP fibrils and oligomers, consistent with the simulations and our proposed hypothesis. Taken together, this work provides new mechanistic insight into how endogenous MDPs regulate pathological amyloid growth at the molecular level and in highly substoichiometric quantities, which can be exploited through peptidomimetics in diabetes or Alzheimer's disease.
