24913070|t|Dexmedetomidine: a review of applications for cardiac surgery during perioperative period.
24913070|a|Cardiac surgery is associated with a high incidence of cardiovascular and other complications during the perioperative period that translate into increased mortality and prolonged hospital stays. Safe comprehensive perioperative management is required to eliminate these adverse events. Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist that has been described as an ideal medication in the perioperative period of cardiac surgery. The major clinical effects of dexmedetomidine in this perioperative period can be summarized as attenuating the hemodynamic response, cardioprotective effects, antiarrhythmic effects, sedation in the ICU setting, treatment of delirium, and procedural sedation. Although there are some side effects of dexmedetomidine, it is emerging as an effective therapeutic agent in the management of a wide range of clinical conditions with an efficacious, safe profile. The present review serves as an overview update in the diverse applications of dexmedetomidine for cardiac surgery during the perioperative period.
