29864740|t|Posterior cortical atrophy variant of Alzheimer's dementia-A case report.
29864740|a|Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the commonest type of dementia presenting with initial episodic memory decline followed by involvement of other cognitive domains. Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is one of the variants of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) characterized by the atypical presentation of relatively persevered memory in the initial stage. PCA is an uncommon early onset dementia affecting adults between 50 and 65 years. It presents predominantly with visuo-spatial and visuo-perceptual deficits. PCA is a phenotype with varied etiology most common being Alzheimer's disease. The complex and atypical presentation with preserved memory and insight in patients with PCA poses challenge to clinicians in diagnosing at initial stages. There is also paucity of research on prevalence, course, prognosis and management of PCA. In this article we describe a middle aged gentlemen presenting with clinical features suggestive of PCA. We also discussed relevant literature.
