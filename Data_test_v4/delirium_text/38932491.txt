38932491|t|NF1+/ex42del miniswine model the cellular disruptions and behavioral presentations of NF1-associated cognitive and motor impairment.
38932491|a|Cognitive or motor impairment is common among individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an autosomal dominant tumor-predisposition disorder. As many as 70% of children with NF1 report difficulties with spatial/working memory, attention, executive function, and fine motor movements. In contrast to the utilization of various Nf1 mouse models, here we employ an NF1+/ex42del miniswine model to evaluate the mechanisms and characteristics of these presentations, taking advantage of a large animal species more like human anatomy and physiology. The prefrontal lobe, anterior cingulate, and hippocampus from NF1+/ex42del and wild-type miniswine were examined longitudinally, revealing abnormalities in mature oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, and microglial activation over time. Imbalances in GABA: Glutamate ratios and GAD67 expression were observed in the hippocampus and motor cortex, supporting the role of disruption in inhibitory neurotransmission in NF1 cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction. Moreover, NF1+/ex42del miniswine demonstrated slower and shorter steps, indicative of a balance-preserving response commonly observed in NF1 patients, and progressive memory and learning impairments. Collectively, our findings affirm the effectiveness of NF1+/ex42del miniswine as a valuable resource for assessing cognitive and motor impairments associated with NF1, investigating the involvement of specific neural circuits and glia in these processes, and evaluating potential therapeutic interventions.
