37367676|t|1-O-alkyl-glycerols from Squid Berryteuthis magister Reduce Inflammation and Modify Fatty Acid and Plasmalogen Metabolism in Asthma Associated with Obesity.
37367676|a|Asthma associated with obesity is considered the most severe phenotype and can be challenging to manage with standard medications. Marine-derived 1-O-alkyl-glycerols (AGs), as precursors for plasmalogen synthesis, have high biological activity, making them a promising substance for pharmacology. This study aimed to investigate the effect of AGs from squid Berryteuthis magister on lung function, fatty acid and plasmalogen levels, and cytokine and adipokine production in obese patients with asthma. The investigational trial included 19 patients with mild asthma associated with obesity who received 0.4 g of AGs daily for three months in addition to their standard treatment. The effects of AGs were evaluated at one and three months of treatment. The results of the study demonstrated that intake of AGs increased the FEV1 and FEV1/VC ratios, and significantly decreased the ACQ score in 17 of the 19 patients after three months of treatment. The intake of AGs increased concentration of plasmalogen and n-3 PUFA in plasma, and modified leptin/adiponectin production by adipose tissue. The supplementation of AGs decreased the plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-4, and IL-17a), and oxylipins (TXB2 and LTB4), suggesting an anti-inflammatory property of AGs. In conclusion, 1-O-alkyl-glycerols could be a promising dietary supplement for improving pulmonary function and reducing inflammation in obese asthma patients, and a natural source for plasmalogen synthesis. The study highlighted that the beneficial effects of AG consumption can be observed after one month of treatment, with gradual improvement after three months of supplementation.
