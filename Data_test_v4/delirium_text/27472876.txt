27472876|t|Biofunctionalized Silica Nanoparticles: Standards in Amyloid-beta Oligomer-Based Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.
27472876|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers represent a promising biomarker for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, state-of-the-art methods for immunodetection of Abeta oligomers in body fluids show a large variability and lack a reliable and stable standard that enables the reproducible quantitation of Abeta oligomers. At present, the only available standard applied in these assays is based on a random aggregation process of synthetic Abeta and has neither a defined size nor a known number of epitopes. In this report, we generated a highly stable standard in the size range of native Abeta oligomers that exposes a defined number of epitopes. The standard consists of a silica nanoparticle (SiNaP), which is functionalized with Abeta peptides on its surface (Abeta-SiNaP). The different steps of Abeta-SiNaP synthesis were followed by microscopic, spectroscopic and biochemical analyses. To investigate the performance of Abeta-SiNaPs as an appropriate standard in Abeta oligomer immunodetection, Abeta-SiNaPs were diluted in cerebrospinal fluid and quantified down to a concentration of 10 fM in the sFIDA (surface-based fluorescence intensity distribution analysis) assay. This detection limit corresponds to an Abeta concentration of 1.9 ng l-1 and lies in the sensitivity range of currently applied diagnostic tools based on Abeta oligomer quantitation. Thus, we developed a highly stable and well-characterized standard for the application in Abeta oligomer immunodetection assays that finally allows the reproducible quantitation of Abeta oligomers down to single molecule level and provides a fundamental improvement for the worldwide standardization process of diagnostic methods in AD research.
