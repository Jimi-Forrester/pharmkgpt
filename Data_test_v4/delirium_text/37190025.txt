37190025|a|Background: The continuously increasing association of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with increased mortality rates indicates an unmet medical need and the critical need for establishing novel molecular targets for therapeutic potential. Agonists for peroxisomal proliferator activating receptors (PPAR) are known to regulate energy in the body and have shown positive effects against Alzheimer's disease. There are three members of this class (delta, gamma, and alpha), with PPAR-gamma being the most studied, as these pharmaceutical agonists offer promise for AD because they reduce amyloid beta and tau pathologies, display anti-inflammatory properties, and improve cognition. However, they display poor brain bioavailability and are associated with several adverse side effects on human health, thus limiting their clinical application. Methods: We have developed a novel series of PPAR-delta and PPAR-gamma agonists in silico with AU9 as our lead compound that displays selective amino acid interactions focused upon avoiding the Tyr-473 epitope in the PPAR-gamma AF2 ligand binding domain. Results: This design helps to avoid the unwanted side effects of current PPAR-gamma agonists and improve behavioral deficits and synaptic plasticity while reducing amyloid-beta levels and inflammation in 3xTgAD animals. Conclusions: Our innovative in silico design of PPAR-delta/gamma agonists may offer new perspectives for this class of agonists for AD.
