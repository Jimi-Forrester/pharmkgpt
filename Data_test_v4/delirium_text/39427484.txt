39427484|t|Integrating Ayurvedic philosophy with modern technologies for drug research and development: A critical need of mechanistic insights for wider acceptability.
39427484|a|Ayurveda is a holistic science emphasizing healing and maintaining harmony and balance in the body. Medicines from natural resources and in pre-defined dosage forms are integral parts of successful Ayurvedic treatment in various diseases including complex ailments, such as cancer. Ayurvedic medicines are cocktails of several active phyto-compounds and/or natural resources and no isolated/purified molecules are used in the treatment. However, various unique methods employed using natural media, such as water, lipids, buttermilk, and lemon juice, just to name a few, lead to the elimination of unwanted constituents/impurities and enhance the bioavailability and efficacy of the drug. Such plausible alterations, selection, and/or retention of signature phytocompounds in the raw materials, during the process, and in the final drug need to be studied for precise product identification and analysis. Critical standardization of the manufacturing procedures is, therefore, mandatory for quality fidelity, assurance, and optimum efficacy. Moreover, the simultaneous multi-level and/or multi-targeted actions of Ayurvedic medicines against various dysfunctions due to their complex nature makes it extremely challenging to understand the mechanistic aspects during pre-clinical and clinical studies. The present article focuses on probable challenges and ideal roadmaps for standardization and characterization of such herbal as well as metallic-mineral Ayurvedic medicines being used for various simple and complex diseases like cancer and their treatments. It is emphasized that Ayurvedic manufacturing procedures should be followed meticulously and the finished product be characterized thoroughly using advanced pharmaceutical and analytical techniques. It is also accentuated that detailed monographs or dossiers including shelf-life studies need to be officially published for knowledge dissemination and worldwide acceptance. Finally, safety and efficacy studies as per modern pharmacology ought to be conducted in suitable animal models for the judicious use of these medicines. Mainstream or adjuvant treatment of dreadful diseases such as cancer with Ayurvedic medicines will only be fruitful through rational experimentation and ethical reporting.
