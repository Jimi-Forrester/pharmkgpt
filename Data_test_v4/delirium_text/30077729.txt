30077729|t|Reduction of amyloid beta by Abeta3-10-KLH vaccine also decreases tau pathology in 3xTg-AD mice.
30077729|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formation and synaptic alterations. Active immunotherapy is regarded as one of the most promising strategies for AD prevention and treatment. In this research, we used APPswe/PS1M146 V/TauP301 L triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice, in which the pathological changes are the most similar to those in AD patients. The Abeta 3-10 -keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) vaccine was administered to mice at 1 month, and no AD-associated changes were detected at that time. The vaccine effectively mitigated AD-like pathology and cognitive dysfunction in the 3xTg-AD mice. Both soluble and insoluble Abeta and tau protein in the brain tissues of the 3xTg-AD mice were significantly decreased after the administration of Abeta 3-10 -KLH. In addition, the level of phosphorylated tau also decreased following removal of the Abeta pathological changes.
