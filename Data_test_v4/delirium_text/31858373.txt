31858373|t|Selective Estrogen Receptor beta Agonists: a Therapeutic Approach for HIV-1 Associated Neurocognitive Disorders.
31858373|a|The persistence of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in the post-cART era, afflicting between 40 and 70% of HIV-1 seropositive individuals, supports a critical need for the development of adjunctive therapeutic treatments. Selective estrogen receptor beta agonists, including S-Equol (SE), have been implicated as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurocognitive disorders. In the present study, the therapeutic efficacy of 0.2 mg SE for the treatment of HAND was assessed to address two key questions in the HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) rat. First, does SE exhibit robust therapeutic efficacy when treatment is initiated relatively early (i.e., between 2 and 3 months of age) in the course of viral protein exposure? Second, does the therapeutic utility of SE generalize across multiple neurocognitive domains? Treatment with SE enhanced preattentive processes and stimulus-response learning to the level of controls in all (i.e., 100%) HIV-1 Tg animals. For sustained and selective attention, statistically significant effects were not observed in the overall analyses (Control: Placebo, n = 10, SE, n = 10; HIV-1 Tg: Placebo, n = 10, SE, n = 10). However, given our a priori hypothesis, subsequent analyses were conducted, revealing enhanced sustained and selective attention, approximating controls, in a subset (i.e., 50%, n = 5 and 80%, n = 8, respectively) of HIV-1 Tg animals treated with SE. Thus, the therapeutic efficacy of SE is greater when treatment is initiated relatively early in the course of viral protein exposure and generalizes across neurocognitive domains, supporting an adjunctive therapeutic for HAND in the post-cART era. Graphical Abstract HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) and control animals were treated with either 0.2 mg S-Equol (SE) or placebo between 2 and 3 months of age (Control: Placebo, n = 10, SE, n = 10; HIV-1 Tg: Placebo, n = 10, SE, n = 10). Neurocognitive assessments, tapping preattentive processes, stimulus response learning, sustained attention and selective attention, were conducted to evaluate the utility of SE as a therapeutic for HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Planned comparisons between HIV-1 Tg and control animals treated with placebo were utilized to establish a genotype effect, revealing prominent neurocognitive impairments (NCI) in the HIV-1 Tg rat across all domains. Furthermore, to establish the utility of SE, HIV-1 Tg animals treated with SE were compared to control animals treated with placebo. Treatment with 0.2 mg SE ameliorated NCI, to levels that were indistinguishable from controls, in at least a subset (i.e., 50-100%) of HIV-1 Tg animals. Thus, SE supports an efficacious, adjunctive therapeutic for HAND.
