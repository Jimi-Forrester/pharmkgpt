30040721|t|Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Are Associated with Amyloid-beta42 Burden in Alzheimer's Disease.
30040721|a|This study was designed to determine whether the levels of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of Angiotensin (Ang) II, Ang-(1-7), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2, Amyloid-beta (Abeta)40, Abeta42, total tau (hTau), and phospho-tau (pTau) were measured in 18 patients with AD and 10 controls. Patients with AD presented decreased levels of ACE when compared with controls. We found a significant positive correlation between ACE and Abeta42 levels among patients. Our results strengthen the hypothesis that ACE is associated with Abeta pathology in AD.
