38412549|a|Alzheimer's disease is the main cause of aging-associated dementia, for which there is no effective treatment. In this work, we reanalyze the information of a previous Genome Wide Association Study, using a new pipeline design to identify novel potential drugs. With this approach, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase gene (RRM2B) emerged as a candidate target and its inhibitor, 2', 2'-difluoro 2'deoxycytidine (Gemcitabine), as a potential pharmaceutical drug against Alzheimer's disease. We functionally verified the effect of inhibiting the RRM2B homologue, rnr-2, in an Alzheimer's model of Caenorhabditis elegans, which accumulates human Abeta1-42 peptide to an irreversible paralysis. RNA interference against rnr-2 and also treatment with 200 ng/ml of Gemcitabine, showed animprovement of the phenotype. Gemcitabine treatment increased the intracellular ATP level 3.03 times, which may point to its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine has been extensively used in humans for cancer treatment but at higher concentration. The 200 ng/ml concentration did not exert a significant effect over cell cycle, or affected cell viability when assayed in microglia N13 cell line. Thus, inhibitory drug of the RRM2B activity could be of potential use to treat Alzheimer's disease and particularly Gemcitabine might be considered as a promising candidate to be repurposed for its treatment.
