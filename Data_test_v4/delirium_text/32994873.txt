32994873|a|BACKGROUND: High viscosity glass ionomer cement (HVGIC) and resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC) have recently been clinically preferred thanks to their numerous advantages. However, initial moisture contamination has a negative effect on the mechanical and physical properties of these cements. The aim of this study was in vitro of HVGICs and RMGICs, with and without surface protection, on water sorption, solubility and release of aluminum. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, as HVGICs; Equia Forte, IonoStar Plus, Riva Self Cure; as RMCIS, Ionolux and Riva Light Cure; and as control, Z250 universal composite was used. Equia coat, Voco varnish and Riva coat were chosen as surface protective. Water sorption and solubility levels of the samples were measured according to ISO 4049:2009. Al levels released from samples were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) for 7, 14 and 21 days. Statistical evaluation of the results was made using one-way variance analysis (ANOVA) and Tukey post-hoc test (p<0.05). RESULTS: RMGICs from restorative materials showed more water absorption than HVGICs, but no differences in solubility. Among the materials tested, the water absorption values of the HVGIC and RMGIC materials without surface protection were higher than those with the surface protection (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: It was determined that the Al release of HVGIC and RMGIC groups with the surface protection were lower in all time periods than the groups without surface protection (p<0.001). The application of surface protection effectively reduced water sorption and Al release from HVGICs and RMGICs.
