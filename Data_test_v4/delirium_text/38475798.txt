38475798|t|Long-term outcome in new onset refractory status epilepticus: a retrospective study.
38475798|a|BACKGROUND: New onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) is a neurologic emergency without an immediately identifiable cause. The complicated and long ICU stay of the patients can lead to perceiving a prolongation of therapies as futile. However, a recovery is possible even in severe cases. This retrospective study investigates ICU treatments, short- and long-term outcome and ethical decisions of a case series of patients with NORSE. METHODS: Overall, 283 adults were admitted with status epilepticus (SE) to the Neurocritical Care Unit of the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, between 01.2010 and 12.2022. Of them, 25 had a NORSE. We collected demographic, clinical, therapeutic and outcome data. Descriptive statistics was performed. RESULTS: Most patients were female (68%), previously healthy (Charlson comorbidity index 1 [0-4]) and relatively young (54 +- 17 years). 96% presented with super-refractory SE. Despite extensive workup, the majority (68%) of cases remained cryptogenic. Most patients had a long and complicated ICU stay. The in-hospital mortality was 36% (n = 9). The mortality at last available follow-up was 56% (n = 14) on average 30 months after ICU admission. The cause of in-hospital death for 89% (n = 8) of the patients was the withholding/withdrawing of therapies. Medical staff except for one patient triggered the decision. The end of life (EOL) decision was taken 29 [12-51] days after the ICU admission. Death occurred on day 6 [1-8.5] after the decision was taken. The functional outcome improved over time for 13/16 (81%) hospital survivors (median mRS at hospital discharge 4 [3.75-5] vs. median mRS at last available follow-up 2 [1.75-3], p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the long-term outcome can still be favorable in NORSE survivors, despite a prolonged and complicated ICU stay. Clinicians should be careful in taking EOL decisions to avoid the risk of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Our results encourage clinicians to continue treatment even in initially refractory cases.
