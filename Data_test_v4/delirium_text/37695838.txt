37695838|t|Investigation of Peptides for Molecular Recognition of C-Reactive Protein-Theoretical and Experimental Studies.
37695838|a|We investigate the interactions between C-reactive protein (CRP) and new CRP-binding peptide materials using experimental (biological and physicochemical) methods with the support of theoretical simulations (computational modeling analysis). Three specific CRP-binding peptides (P2, P3, and P9) derived from an M13 bacteriophage have been identified using phage-display technology. The binding efficiency of the peptides exposed on phages toward the CRP protein was demonstrated via biological methods. Fibers of the selected phages/peptides interact differently due to different compositions of amino acid sequences on the exposed peptides, which was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Numerical and experimental studies consistently showed that the P3 peptide is the best CRP binder. A combination of theoretical and experimental methods demonstrates that identifying the best binder can be performed simply, cheaply, and fast. Such an approach has not been reported previously for peptide screening and demonstrates a new trend in science where calculations can replace or support laborious experimental techniques. Finally, the best CRP binder the P3 peptide was used for CRP recognition on silicate-modified indium tin oxide-coated glass electrodes. The obtained electrodes exhibit a wide range of operation (1.0-100 mug mL-1) with a detection limit (LOD = 3sigma/S) of 0.34 mug mL-1. Moreover, the dissociation constant Kd of 4.2 +- 0.144 mug mL-1 (35 +- 1.2 nM) was evaluated from the change in the current. The selectivity of the obtained electrode was demonstrated in the presence of three interfering proteins. These results prove that the presented P3 peptide is a potential candidate as a receptor for CRP, which can replace specific antibodies.
