37288428|t|Factor XIII: More than just a fibrin stabilizer for the burn patient? A matched-pair analysis.
37288428|a|Background: Acquired factor XIII deficiency is an underestimated risk in patients with large surface burns, which potentially exposes these patients to prolonged bleeding and delayed wound healing if undetected. Methods: A retrospective matched-pair analysis of the burn registry of the Department of Plastic, Aesthetic, Hand, and Reconstructive Surgery of Hannover Medical School was performed from 2018 to 2023. Results: A total of 18 patients were included. Acquired factor XIII deficiency was not statistically significant correlated with age, sex, or body mass index. Patients who developed acquired factor XIII deficiency had a significantly longer hospital stay (72.8 days) compared with those in the matched group (46.4 days), although burn depths, total body surface area, and Abbreviated Burn Severity Index were not statistically correlated with factor XIII deficiency. Conclusions: Little is known about acquired factor XIII deficiency in patients with burns. Factor XIII supplementation may improve hemostasis, wound healing, and general outcome while reducing the patient's exposure to blood products.
