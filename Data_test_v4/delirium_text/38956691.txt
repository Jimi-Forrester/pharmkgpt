38956691|t|Short-term inhalation of xenon during anesthesia for prevention of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical colectomy: study protocol for a randomized controlled clinical trial.
38956691|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication that is characterized by acute onset of impaired cognitive function and is associated with an increased mortality, a prolonged duration of hospital stay, and additional healthcare expenditures. The incidence of POD in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical colectomy ranges from 8 to 54%. Xenon has been shown to provide neuroprotection in various neural injury models, but the clinical researches assessing the preventive effect of xenon inhalation on the occurrence of POD obtained controversial findings. This study aims to investigate the effects of a short xenon inhalation on the occurrence of POD in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical colectomy. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial and 132 patients aged 65-80 years and scheduled for laparoscopic radical colectomy will be enrolled. The participants will be randomly assigned to either the control group or the xenon group (n = 66 in each group). The primary outcome will be the incidence of POD in the first 5 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes will include the subtype, severity, and duration of POD, postoperative pain score, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PQSI), perioperative non-delirium complications, and economic parameters. Additionally, the study will investigate the activation of microglial cells, expression of inflammatory factors in colon tissues, plasma inflammatory factors, and neurochemical markers. DISCUSSION: Elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical colectomy are at a high risk of POD, with delayed postoperative recovery and increased healthcare costs. The primary objective of this study is to determine the preventive effect of a short xenon inhalation on the occurrence of POD in these patients.
