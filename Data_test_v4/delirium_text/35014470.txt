35014470|t|Dendrimer Architectonics to Treat Cancer and Neurodegenerative Diseases with Implications in Theranostics and Personalized Medicine.
35014470|a|Integration of diagnostic and therapeutic functions in a single platform namely theranostics has become a cornerstone for personalized medicine. Theranostics platform facilitates noninvasive detection and treatment while allowing the monitoring of disease progression and therapeutic efficacy in case of chronic conditions of cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Theranostic tools function by themselves or with the aid of carrier, viz. liposomes, micelles, polymers, or dendrimers. The dendrimer architectures (DA) are well-characterized molecular nanoobjects with a large number of terminal functional groups to enhance solubility and offer multivalency and multifunctional properties. Various noninvasive diagnostic tools like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), gamma scintigraphy, and optical techniques have been accomplished utilizing DAs for simultaneous imaging and drug delivery. Obstacles in the formulation design, drug loading, payload delivery, biocompatibility, overcoming cellular membrane and blood-brain barrier (BBB), and systemic circulation remain a bottleneck in translational efforts. This review focuses on the diagnostic, therapeutic and theranostic potential of DA-based nanocarriers in treating cancer and neurodegenerative disorders like AD and Parkinson's disease (PD), among others. In view of the inverse relationship between cancer and AD, designing suitable DA-based theranostic nanodrug with high selectivity has tremendous implications in personalized medicine to treat cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
