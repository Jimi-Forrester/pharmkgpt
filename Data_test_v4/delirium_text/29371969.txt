29371969|a|Although large numbers of microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed in Alzheimer disease (AD) have been detected, their functions and mechanisms of regulation remain to be fully clarified. Beta-site Amyloid precursor protein Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) has been one of the prime therapeutic targets for AD. Here, we identified that miR-124 levels are gradually decreased in AD. In addition, we demonstrated that miR-124 suppresses BACE1 expression by directly targeting the 3'UTR of Bace1 mRNA in vitro. Inhibition of miR-124 significantly increased BACE1 levels in neuronal cells. In contrast, miR-124 overexpression significantly suppressed BACE1 expression in cells. And finally we determined that downregulation of miR-124 alleviated Abeta-induced viability inhibition and decreased apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. Our results demonstrated that miR-124 is a potent negative regulator of BACE1 in the cellular AD phenotype and might be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.
