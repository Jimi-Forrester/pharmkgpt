18513663|t|Aging and delirium: too much or too little pain medication?
18513663|a|Review of the literature revealed an association of pain and delirium in hip fracture patients. The literature was sparse addressing other types of patients. The purpose of the present study was therefore to examine the association of pain and delirium in medical and surgical patients. A retrospective record review was conducted using records of 100 patients who developed delirium while hospitalized. Data included: age, comorbidities, hospital day when delirium developed, presence of major risk factors for delirium on admission, and amount of medication received in the 24 h before onset of delirium. Descriptive statistics, correlations, and univariate analysis of variance were used to determine association between the variables. The mean age was 76.71 years. The mean number of comorbidities was 2.22. The mean number of risk factors for delirium on admission was 2.26 (range 0 to 5). The mean percentage of total amount of medication ordered that was received was 27.67%. Those individuals admitted with a risk factor of hearing loss received significantly less amount of pain medication than those with other risk factors (p = .023). Nurses should carefully assess pain management in their older patients. If using a PCA pump, the older patient's ability to manage the pump should be reassessed often. If a patient is admitted with risk factors for development of delirium, unmanaged pain might be the additional factor that precipitates delirium.
