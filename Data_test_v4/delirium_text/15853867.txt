15853867|a|This analysis aimed to assess mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores in patients with Alzheimer's disease who received rivastigmine, an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, for up to 5 years. Rivastigmine data came from two pooled open-label extensions of four 6-month, randomised, placebo-controlled trials. Projections of decline, had the same patients not been treated, were made using a baseline-dependent mathematical model. MMSE data were available for 1998 rivastigmine-treated patients and 657, 298 and 83 were still on treatment at 3, 4 and 5 years, respectively. The mean (+/-SD) baseline MMSE score was 19.3 (+/-4.9). Projected mean scores in model-based untreated patients declined below 10 points on the MMSE at about 3 years, while the mean MMSE score of patients who remained on rivastigmine stayed above 10 points for 5 years.
