37289288|a|INTRODUCTION: Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in neurons of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) inhibits the activity of key enzymes in mitochondrial metabolic pathways, triggering mitochondrial dysfunction, which plays an important role in the onset and development of AD. Mitophagy is a process whereby dysfunctional or damaged mitochondria are removed from the cell. Aberrant mitochondrial metabolism may hinder mitophagy, promote autophagosome accumulation, and lead to neuronal death. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this experiment is to explore the mechanism of neuronal mitochondria damage in the hippocampus of different age APP/PS1 double transgenic AD mice, and to explore the related metabolites and metabolic pathways for further understanding of the pathogenesis, so as to provide new ideas and strategies for the treatment of AD. METHODS: In this study, 24 APP/PS1(APPswe/PSEN1dE9) mice were divided into 3, 6, 9, and 12-month-old groups, and 6-month-old wild-type C57BL/6 mice were as controls. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate learning and memory. Levels of Abeta were detected by immunohistochemistry. Electron microscopy was used to observe mitochondrial damage and autophagosome accumulation. Western blot was for measuring LC3, P62, PINK1, Parkin, Miro1, and Tom 20 protein expression levels. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used to screen differentially abundant metabolites. RESULTS: The results showed that with the increase of age in APP/PS1 mice, cognitive impairment, hippocampal neuron mitochondrial damage, and autophagosome accumulation all increased. Furthermore, enhanced mitophagy and impaired mitochondrial clearance leading to metabolic abnormalities were observed with ageing in APP/PS1 mouse hippocampus. Especially, abnormal accumulation of succinic acid and citric acid in the Krebs cycle was observed. CONCLUSION: This study investigated the abnormal glucose metabolism associated with age-related damage to mitochondria in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of AD.
