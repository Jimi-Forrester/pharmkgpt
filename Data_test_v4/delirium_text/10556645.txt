10556645|a|Since increasing evidence suggests that upregulation of the cAMP-second messenger system may be implicated in Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration, we have compared the cAMP and cGMP levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT, n=10) with those from nondemented age-matched controls (n=10). Our results show that cAMP levels, but not cGMP, are significantly (p<0.01) elevated in CSF from patients with DAT compared to those from nondemented controls. Moreover, a linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant correlation (r=0.62; p<0.01) between cAMP and tau protein levels in CSF when controls and patients with DAT were studied together. These results suggest that upregulation of cAMP-signaling pathway is implicated in Alzheimer's disease physiopathology.
