32665390|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe overlapping coping strategies in people with Parkinson's disease. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, cohort study. SETTING: Monocentric, inpatient and outpatient, university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Two-hundred participants enrolled, 162 patients with Parkinson's disease (without dementia) analysed. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of different coping styles according to the German Essen Coping Questionnaire. Association between coping, sociodemographic and clinical parameters (Movement Disorder Society (MDS)-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), non-motor symptoms questionnaire (NMS-Quest), Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), Beck depression inventory (BDI) and health-related quality of life (Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36))). RESULTS: In comparison with patients who employed a passive coping style, patients using an active form of coping were characterised by a shorter disease duration (p=0.017), fewer motor impairments (MDS-UPDRS II p=0.040, MDS-UPDRS III p=0.003), a lower non-motor burden (NMS-Quest p=0.048), better cognitive function (MoCA p=0.036) and fewer depressive symptoms (BDI p<0.001). From the 162 participants, 24% showed an overlap of active and passive coping strategies. The most common combination was acting/problem-oriented coping and distance and self-promotion. In comparison with patients who employed passive coping, the group with an overlapping coping style was characterised by a shorter disease duration (p=0.023) and lower depressive burden (p=0.001). In comparison with patients who employed active coping, the overlap group was characterised by poorer cognitive function (p=0.045). The SF-36 values of the overlap group were between those of the active and passive coping groups. CONCLUSION: Knowledge about overlapping coping strategies is relevant to the implementation of strategies to promote active and healthy coping.
