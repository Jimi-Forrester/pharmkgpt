35801090|a|Due to their vital physiological functions, nutritional fatty acids have great potential as nutraceutical food supplements for preventing an array of diseases such as inflammation, depression, arthritis, osteoporosis, diabetes and cancer. Microbial biosynthesis of fatty acids follows the trend of sustainable development, as it enables green, environmentally friendly and efficient production. As a natural oleaginous yeast, Yarrowia lipolytica is especially well-suited for the production of fatty acids. Moreover, it has a variety of genetic engineering tools and novel metabolic engineering strategies that make it a robust workhorse for the production of an array of value-added products. In this review, we summarize recent advances in metabolic engineering strategies for accumulating nutritional fatty acids in Y. lipolytica, including conjugated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, the future prospects of nutritional fatty acid production using the Y. lipolytica platform are discussed in light of the current progress, challenges, and trends in this field. Finally, guidelines for future studies are also emphasized.
