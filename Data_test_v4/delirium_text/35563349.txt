35563349|t|Human Serine Racemase Weakly Binds the Third PDZ Domain of PSD-95.
35563349|a|Human serine racemase (hSR) is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent dimer that catalyzes the formation of D-serine from L-serine, as well as the dehydration of both L- and D-serine to pyruvate and ammonia. As D-serine is a co-agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), hSR is a key enzyme in glutamatergic neurotransmission. hSR activity is finely regulated by Mg2+, ATP, post-translational modifications, and the interaction with protein partners. In particular, the C-terminus of murine SR binds the third PDZ domain (PDZ3) of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family involved in the trafficking and localization of glutamate receptors. The structural details of the interaction and the stability of the complex have not been elucidated yet. We evaluated the binding of recombinant human PSD-95 PDZ3 to hSR by glutaraldehyde cross-linking, pull-down assays, isothermal titration calorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and enzymatic assays. Overall, a weak interaction was observed, confirming the binding for the human orthologs but supporting the hypothesis that a third protein partner (i.e., stargazin) is required for the regulation of hSR activity by PSD-95 and to stabilize their interaction.
