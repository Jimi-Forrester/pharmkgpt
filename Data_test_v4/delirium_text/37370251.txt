37370251|t|Educational intervention for family caregivers of older adults with delirium: An integrative review.
37370251|a|AIM: To propose educational strategies to prevent delirium in older adults. DESIGN: Integrative review. METHODS: This review followed the methodology of Whittemore and Knafl (J Adv Nurs 52(5):546-553, 2005. 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2005.03621.x). DATA SOURCES: A literature search was performed of the PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane Library CENTRAL, and Scopus databases on 8 July 2022. RESULTS: Three themes of educational interventions were identified: capacity building, resource provision and enhancement of relationships, collectively termed Fa-CARE. Educational interventions improved family caregivers' knowledge about delirium, their anxiety; depression; self-efficacy; and attitudes. Among older adults, these interventions improved the duration, severity and incidence of delirium; functional abilities; and length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Providing education to family caregivers benefits both those caregivers and the older adults. When planning educational intervention, diverse and innovative approaches need to be considered. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND/OR PATIENT CARE: This study can guide family education regarding the care of older adults with delirium. IMPACT: Educational interventions positively impacted both family caregivers and older adults with delirium. Educational interventions provide family caregivers with resources, improve their capacity for delirium management, and enhance their relationships with older adults. This study suggests future directions in education for family caregivers of older adults with delirium. REPORTING METHOD: This review adhered to the EQUATOR guidelines by using the PRISMA 2020 checklist. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No patient or public contribution.
