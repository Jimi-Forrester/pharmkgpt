31934509|a|Lactate treatment has shown a therapeutic potential for several neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. In order to optimize the administration of lactate for studies in mouse models, we compared blood lactate dynamics after intraperitoneal (IP) and subcutaneous (SC) injections. We used the 5xFAD mouse model for familial Alzheimer's disease and performed the experiments in both awake and anaesthetized mice. Blood glucose was used as an indication of the hepatic conversion of lactate. In awake mice, both injection routes resulted in high blood lactate levels, mimicking levels reached during high-intensity training. In anaesthetized mice, SC injections resulted in significantly lower lactate levels compared to IP injections. Interestingly, we observed that awake males had significantly higher lactate levels than awake females, while the opposite sex difference was observed during anaesthesia. We did not find any significant difference between transgenic and wild-type mice and therefore believe that our results can be generalized to other mouse models. These results should be considered when planning experiments using lactate treatment in mice.
