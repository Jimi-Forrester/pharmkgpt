1436761|a|Ferric lactate increases Ca(2+)-uptake by Ehrlich carcinoma ascites cells as well as in vitro and in vivo Ca(2+)-uptake by the liver. Iron and aluminium are increased in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease and aluminium is suspected to be involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. This study was conducted to determine if there is any relationship between iron and aluminium uptake and a possible calcium influx into brain tissue. Groups of Swiss mice were injected in the tail vein with 100 microliters of 0.05 M ferric lactate plus 2 microCi45CaCl2, or 100 microliters of 0.05 M aluminium lactate plus 2 microCi45CaCl2, or 100 microliters of saline plus 2 microCi45CaCl2. Twenty-four hr later they were sacrificed by decapitation. Samples of blood and the total brain were weighed and ashed. The ashes were dissolved and the solution transferred to counting vials evaporated to dryness. A scintillation solution was added to the vials and the radioactivity was counted. To accurately assess brain uptake in each animal the value of brain specific activity was related to blood specific activity. When compared to those of control animals, these values gave the 24 hr increase of 45Ca-uptake by brain of ferric lactate or aluminium lactate-treated animals. A significant increase of 45Ca-uptake was observed for ferric lactate (136% of control value, p less than 0.005), which is more important for aluminium lactate (163% of control value, p less than 0.001). The nature of the complexed metal-brain tissue interaction is not known, several mechanisms are discussed.
