38013241|t|Dysfunction of Drosophila mitochondrial carrier homolog (Mtch) alters apoptosis and disturbs development.
38013241|a|Mitochondrial carrier homologs 1 (MTCH1) and 2 (MTCH2) are orphan members of the mitochondrial transporter family SLC25. Human MTCH1 is also known as presenilin 1-associated protein, PSAP. MTCH2 is a receptor for tBid and is related to lipid metabolism. Both proteins have been recently described as protein insertases of the outer mitochondrial membrane. We have depleted Mtch in Drosophila and show here that mutant flies are unable to complete development, showing an excess of apoptosis during pupation; this observation was confirmed by RNAi in Schneider cells. These findings are contrary to what has been described in humans. We discuss the implications in view of recent reports concerning the function of these proteins.
