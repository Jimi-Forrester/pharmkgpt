16945215|a|OBJECTIVES: To review the contributions of cardiovascular disease to Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. METHODS: Review of the literature. RESULTS: Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia both share significant risk attributable to cardiovascular risk factors. Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia at midlife are significant risk factors for both subsequent dementia. Diabetes and obesity are also risk factors for dementia. Stressful medical procedures, such as coronary artery bypass and graft operations also appear to contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Apolipoprotein E is the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Apolipoprotein E does not appear to contribute to Alzheimer's disease by increasing serum cholesterol, but it might contribute to the disease through a mechanism involving both Abeta and an increase in neuronal vulnerability to stress. DISCUSSION: The strong association of cardiovascular risk factors with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia suggest that these diseases share some biologic pathways in common. The contribution of cardiovascular disease to Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia suggest that cardiovascular therapies might prove useful in treating or preventing dementia. Antihypertensive medications appear to be beneficial in preventing vascular dementia. Statins might be beneficial in preventing the progression of dementia in subjects with Alzheimer's disease.
