38910742|t|The Impact of Concomitant Neck of Femur Fractures and Upper Limb Fractures on Length of Stay and Key Performance Indicators: A Single-Centre Study.
38910742|a|Background Hip fractures are one of the most common serious injuries seen today and constitute one of the most serious healthcare problems affecting the elderly worldwide. Due to the elderly population, associated falls and osteoporosis increase the incidence of hip fractures. Patients may remain hospitalized for several weeks, leading to one and a half million hospital bed days used each year. The reported incidence of a concurrent upper limb and a lower limb fracture is between 3% and 5%. It has been shown in the literature that patients who sustain both a hip fracture and an upper limb fracture have difficulties with rehabilitation which causes prolonged stays. The available literature on concomitant hip fracture and upper extremity fracture is limited. This study aimed to review patients with concurrent upper limb injury and hip fractures and to analyse the pattern of associated upper limb fractures, management of these fractures, length of hospital stay, mortality rates, and complications. Methodology We performed a retrospective data collection of all patients with a concomitant upper limb fracture and hip fracture from January 2017 to December 2020 at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom. Patients were identified from the registers maintained in the ward. All patients aged over 60 years with a fragility hip fracture (managed operatively) and a concurrent upper limb fracture were included in the study. Patients aged less than 60 years were excluded. The local research department registered and approved this study as a service evaluation and therefore did not need ethical committee approval. The anatomical location of the upper limb and hip fractures was confirmed using the imaging database (Synapse). Results Of the 760 patients admitted with neck of femur fractures during this period, 39 (5.1%) patients had concomitant upper limb fractures. Only one upper limb fracture was managed with fixation, and for this study, that patient was excluded. Our retrospective search identified 38 patients, of whom 11 were men and 27 were women. Distal radius fractures were the most commonly associated upper limb fractures (55%). There was a significant increase in length of stay (43.6 days vs. 16.6 days) and delay in mobilization (58.9% vs. 81%) compared to an isolated hip fracture. There was no difference in the 30-day mortality rates. We were unable to collect the data for the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence compliant surgery, and this KPI was excluded from our study. Of the remaining five KPIs, our group of patients displayed better averages in three of the five categories, including prompt orthogeriatric review (92%), not delirious postoperatively (87%), and return to original residence (79%). Conclusions Due to the ageing population, hip fractures are increasing, and within one year of operation, have shown higher mortality rates. Annually, reports show that the worldwide incidence of fractures in the adult population ranges between 9.0 and 22.8 per 1,000. These fractures are more frequent in osteoporotic patients with weak bone quality. Following hip fractures, upper extremity fractures are the second most common among the osteoporotic, elderly population, with distal radius fractures being the most common. With the length of stay almost tripled (from 16.6 to 44.4 days), one can see this has a very big effect on costs in the National Health Service system.
