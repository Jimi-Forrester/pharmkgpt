37686309|t|A Deep View of the Biological Property of Interleukin-33 and Its Dysfunction in the Gut.
37686309|a|Intestinal diseases have always posed a serious threat to human health, with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) being one of them. IBD is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The "alarm" cytokine IL-33, which is intimately associated with Th2 immunity, is a highly potent inflammatory factor that is considered to have dual functions-operating as both a pro-inflammatory cytokine and a transcriptional regulator. IL-33 has been shown to play a crucial role in both the onset and development of IBD. Therefore, this review focuses on the pathogenesis of IBD, the major receptor cell types, and the activities of IL-33 in innate and adaptive immunity, as well as its underlying mechanisms and conflicting conclusions in IBD. We have also summarized different medicines targeted to IL-33-associated diseases. Furthermore, we have emphasized the role of IL-33 in gastrointestinal cancer and parasitic infections, giving novel prospective therapeutic utility in the future application of IL-33.
