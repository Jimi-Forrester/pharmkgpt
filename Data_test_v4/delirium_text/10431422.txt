10431422|t|Is it dementia?
10431422|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia is a disorder of memory and thinking, severe enough to interfere with a person's life. In the early stages of the disease, an accurate diagnosis may be difficult to make. OBJECTIVE: To outline the assessment of people who present with cognitive difficulties, and discuss important conditions which may mimic dementia, and diagnostic criteria for dementia. DISCUSSION: The assessment of people with cognitive difficulties includes the exclusion of conditions such as depression, delirium and normal changes of ageing. The accurate diagnosis of dementia allows the institution of early and appropriate management and support of affected people and their families.
