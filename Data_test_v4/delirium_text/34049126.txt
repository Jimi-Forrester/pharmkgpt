34049126|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium evaluation is important because the development of delirium in critically ill patients negatively affects their progress and prognosis. Although delirium assessment tools have been developed, nurses have insufficient experience using these tools in clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effects of case-based confusion assessment methods for intensive care unit education on delirium knowledge and assessment accuracy for intensive care nurses. DESIGN: This study adopted a pre- and post-test non-equivalent control group design. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: The study participants were 122 general nurses (61 participants each in the experimental and control groups) working in the intensive care unit of one university hospital in South Korea. METHODS: Case-based confusion assessment methods for intensive care unit education comprised lectures on delirium and confusion assessment methods for intensive care unit tools and delirium assessment education using standardized patients. The experimental group received 80-min case-based confusion assessment methods for intensive care unit training, whereas the control group received no intervention. RESULTS: Differences in the degree of pre- and post-knowledge in subcategories between the experimental and control groups were the cause, symptom, and management. The delirium assessment accuracy score of the experimental group changed from 2.89 +- 1.61 points before training to 8.11 +- 1.23 points after training, whereas that of the control group changed from 2.92 +- 1.94 points before training to 3.05 +- 2.99 points after training (Z = -9.668, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The case-based confusion assessment methods for intensive care unit educational program developed in this study is effective for improving delirium knowledge and delirium assessment accuracy in intensive care nurses. Based on the study results, various cases can be developed for the education of intensive care nurses.
