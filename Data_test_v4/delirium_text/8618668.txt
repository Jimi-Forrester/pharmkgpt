8618668|a|The memory disorder in Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be described as having two components: one primarily a defect in secondary memory and the other a defect in executive processes. We compared and contrasted the pattern of neuropsychological impairment in AD patients as a function of their memory and executive deficits. A K-Means cluster analysis identified four groups of patients. All four groups had impaired episodic and semantic memory and three had progressively more severe impairments in executive functions. The fourth group had normal executive functions; this group (N=32), described as having a "temporal lobe" pattern of impairment, had a significantly slower rate of progression of their dementia, with visual-construction skills virtually spared. These data demonstrate the existence of a subgroup of AD patients with a consistent pattern of impairment who progress more slowly than other patients over the course of 2 years and who maintain some specific cognitive abilities. This suggests that the mechanism of their disease may be different.
