37629464|a|The Mild Behavioral Impairment (MBI) concept was developed to determine whether late-onset persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) may be early manifestations of cognitive decline. Our study aims to investigate the prevalence and differentiating features of MBI with respect to major neurocognitive disorders (MNDs) and primary psychiatric disorders (PPDs). A total of 144 elderly patients who were referred to our psychogeriatric outpatient service were recruited. The severity of mental illness was evaluated by means of the Clinical Global Impression Severity scale, the severity of psychopathology was evaluated by means of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and overall functioning was evaluated by means of the Global Assessment of Functioning scale. The sample included 73 (50.6%) patients with PPDs, 40 (27.8%) patients with MBI, and 31 (21.5%) patients with MNDs. Patients with MNDs reported the greatest severity of mental illness, the highest BPRS Total, Psychosis, Activation, and Negative Symptom scores, and the lowest functioning. Patients with MBI and PPDs had comparable levels of severity of mental illness and overall functioning, but MBI patients reported higher BPRS Total and Negative Symptom scores than PPD patients. Patients with MBI frequently reported specific clinical features, including a higher severity of apathy and motor retardation. These features merit further investigation since they may help the differential diagnosis between MBI and PPDs.
