34666621|t|An Evaluation of the Effects of Active Game Play on Cognition, Quality of Life and Depression for Older People with Dementia.
34666621|a|OBJECTIVES: This pilot study was intended to evaluate the effects of active game play on cognition, quality of life, and depression for older people with dementia. METHODS: Thirty-eight older people with dementia were recruited. Eighteen people received eight-week active game play using Xbox 360 Kinect. Twenty people received their usual care. The Mini Mental State Examination, Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia were used to measure the outcomes. RESULTS: The results showed that there was no significant improvement on the mean scores of Mini Mental State Examination (P = .252), however, the active game play increased the mean score of Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (P = .005), and reduced the mean score of Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (P = .001) in comparison with the usual care group. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that the active game play was effective in improving quality of life and alleviating depression in older people with dementia. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Findings highlight the potential for gaming as a non-pharmacological interventions for older people with dementia.
