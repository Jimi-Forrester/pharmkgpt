37660490|t|An unusual etiology of acute intestinal occlusion: The swallowed missing dentures a case reports and literature review.
37660490|a|INTRODUCTION: Denture swallowing is an uncommon incident. However, it should be suspected in edentulous elderly patients who wear removable dentures which are poorly cared for and maintain. The existence of neuro-psychiatric disorders may contribute to the occurrence of this adverse event. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of an 85-years-old woman admitted to emergency with acute intestinal occlusion. The investigations concluded that the bowel was obstructed by a foreign body blocked in the terminal ileum. There was a high suspicion that his dental prosthesis had been swallowed. Removal of the dental prosthesis was achieved surgically after laparotomy. DISCUSSION: Foreign bodies in the esophagus could be responsible of a variety of symptoms, including dysphagia, airway obstruction and even perforation. In the gastrointestinal tract foreign bodies may be responsible of fewer specific symptoms, including abdominal pain, melena or perforation. The blockage will occur in anatomical strictures. At the most appropriate situations, removal should be performed through endoscopy, although in case of failure of procedure or complication, surgery will be unavoidable. CONCLUSION: Ingestion of a dental or other foreign object is a clinical condition that is more common in pediatric populations, but is very rare in healthy individuals. Denture swallowing is insidious in itself and may lead to a complicated course, if not properly managed. Although most of these can be conservative, careful monitoring is necessary to avoid such adverse event.
