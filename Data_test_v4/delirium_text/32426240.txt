32426240|t|Organochlorine pesticide levels in Greek patients with Parkinson's disease.
32426240|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease, mostly presenting with characteristic motor symptoms. Organochlorines (OC) are a class of widely-used pesticides that have been included among the list of environmental factors incriminated in PD pathogenesis. However, most studies reporting this association are based on questionnaires, and few have reported exposure data. AIM: To examine the relationship between OC blood concentrations and PD risk. METHODS: In the present study, we studied the concentrations of 8 OC compounds (hexachlorobenzene, heptachlor, hepachlor epoxide, c-chlordane, a-chlordane, p,p'-DDE, DDD, DDT) in 104 Greek PD patients and 110 healthy controls. RESULTS: All substances studied were present in at least one sample. The most frequently detected (above the level of quantification) pesticides were p,p'-DDE (n = 214, 100 % of both groups) and hexachlorobenzene, HCB (n = 189, cases 46.5 %, controls 53.5 %). Higher levels of DDE were detected among PD patients in comparison to controls by using logistic regression analysis to control for confounders [Odds Ratio, OR (95 % confidence interval, C.I.)]: 2.592,(1.29-5.21)], whilst lower levels of HCB were detect among PD patients [OR,95 %CI:0.176(0.09-0.35)]. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that exposure to specific OCs is related to the risk of PD. Further studies, using real exposure data, are needed in order to confirm and extend these findings.
