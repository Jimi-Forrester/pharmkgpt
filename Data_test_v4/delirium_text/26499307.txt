26499307|a|The chemokine CXCL16 and its receptor CXCR6 have been linked to the pathogenesis of acute and chronic cardiovascular disease. However, data on the clinical significance of CXCL16 in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) are still lacking. Therefore, we determined CXCL16 in the serum of cardiac surgery patients and investigated its kinetics and association with the extent of organ dysfunction. 48 patients underwent conventional cardiac surgery with myocardial I/R and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were consecutively enrolled in the present study. We investigated the peri- and post-operative profile of CXCL16. Clinical relevant data were assessed and documented throughout the entire observation period. To identify the influence of myocardial I/R and CPB on CXCL16 release data were compared to those received from patients that underwent off-pump procedure. Pre-operative serum CXCL16 levels were comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers (1174 +- 55.64 pg/ml versus 1225 +- 70.94). However, CXCL16 levels significantly increased during surgery (1174 +- 55.64 versus 1442 +- 75.42 pg/ml; P = 0.0057) and reached maximum levels 6 hrs after termination of surgery (1174 +- 55.64 versus 1648 +- 74.71 pg/ml; P < 0.001). We revealed a positive correlation between the intraoperative serum levels of CXCL16 and the extent of organ dysfunction (r(2) = 0.356; P = 0.031). Patients with high CXCL16 release showed an increased extent of organ dysfunction compared to patients with low CXCL16 release. Our study shows that CXCL16 is released into the circulation as a result of cardiac surgery and that high post-operative CXCL16 levels are associated with an increased severity of post-operative organ dysfunctions.
