35008798|t|Pyroptosis-Mediated Periodontal Disease.
35008798|a|Pyroptosis is a caspase-dependent process relevant to the understanding of beneficial host responses and medical conditions for which inflammation is central to the pathophysiology of the disease. Pyroptosis has been recently suggested as one of the pathways of exacerbated inflammation of periodontal tissues. Hence, this focused review aims to discuss pyroptosis as a pathological mechanism in the cause of periodontitis. The included articles presented similarities regarding methods, type of cells applied, and cell stimulation, as the outcomes also point to the same direction considering the cellular events. The collected data indicate that virulence factors present in the diseased periodontal tissues initiate the inflammasome route of tissue destruction with caspase activation, cleavage of gasdermin D, and secretion of interleukins IL-1beta and IL-18. Consequently, removing periopathogens' virulence factors that trigger pyroptosis is a potential strategy to combat periodontal disease and regain tissue homeostasis.
