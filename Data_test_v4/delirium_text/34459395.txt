34459395|t|Psychotic Features Among Patients in the Prodromal Stage of Dementia with Lewy Bodies During Longitudinal Observation.
34459395|a|BACKGROUND: Many cases of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) present with various psychotic features, including hallucinations, depression, catatonia, and delusions before the onset of cognitive impairment. However, the characteristic features of these psychotic symptoms in prodromal DLB have not been sufficiently described. OBJECTIVE: To clarify and describe the psychotic features of prodromal DLB before overt cognitive impairment. METHODS: The authors analyzed the characteristic psychotic features of prodromal DLB in 21 subjects who developed severe psychotic symptoms without dementia and were diagnosed as DLB after the longitudinal observation period. They were then confirmed to have DLB through indicative and supportive biomarkers of scintigraphy. RESULTS: The psychotic features included a wide variety of symptoms, but convergent to three principal categories: catatonia, delusions-hallucinations, and depression and/or mania. Catatonia was observed in nine cases, five were delusional-hallucinatory, and seven were manic and/or depressive. Seven of the 21 cases exhibited delirium during longitudinal observation. A psychotic state repeatedly appeared without any trigger in 20 of the 21 patients. All subjects developed cognitive impairment at 9.1+-4.6 (mean+-SD) years after the initial appearance of psychotic symptoms, and subsequently diagnosed with DLB at 71.3+-6.1 (mean+-SD) years. CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with psychotic symptoms, such as catatonia, delusion-hallucination, manic and/or depressive features, and delirium without dementia, could indicate symptomatic psychosis or a prodromal stage of any neurocognitive disorder such as DLB. Therefore, further extensive workout (e.g., radioisotope neuroimaging) is required to avoid misdiagnosis.
