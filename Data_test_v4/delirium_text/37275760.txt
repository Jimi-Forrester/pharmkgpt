37275760|a|Objectives: Since diminished hippocampal insulin signaling leads to memory impairment, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are probably associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The effect of intracerebroventricular injection of insulin (Ins) and oral cinnamon extract (Cinn) on glucose transporter (GLUT) 1, 3, and 4 gene expressions in the hippocampus and spatial memory in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD rat model was investigated in the present study. Materials and Methods: Fifty-six adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (280+-20 g) were allocated into eight distinct groups (n=7) of five controls (negative, Ins, Cinn, Ins+Cinn, and STZs) and three treatments (STZ+ Ins, STZ+ Cinn, and STZ+ Ins + Cinn). Single dose STZ 4 mg/kg (icv), Cinn at a dose of 200 mg/ kg (orally for 14 days), and Ins 5 mIU/5 microl (icv for 14 days) were administered in the defined groups. To evaluate the behavioral performance the animals were subjected to the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. The level of mRNA expression of GLUTs was evaluated by the Real time-PCR method. Results: In the STZ+Cinn+Ins group, the performance of animals in the MWM test was improved and the over-expression of GLUTs genes in hippocampal tissue was observed. The results of Ins and Cinn synergist treatment groups revealed improvement in the behavioral tests and gene expression compared with Ins and Cinn treatment groups (P<0.001). Conclusion: Administration of Ins and Cinn has a positive effect on the function of the AD rat model. To clarify the effect of Ins and Cinn extract on the GLUTs investigated in this study, it is essential to evaluate their influence on the protein levels.
