32565146|t|Long-term mortality in very old patients with cancer admitted to intensive care unit: A retrospective cohort study.
32565146|a|BACKGROUND: Long-term outcomes of older patients referred to intensive care unit (ICU) are of paramount importance for care planning and counseling of patients and relatives. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study with patients aged >=80 years admitted to ICU from 2011 to 2017 in a cancer center. We performed two Cox proportional hazard regressions. In the first, we tested whether type of cancer (solid locoregional, solid metastatic or hematologic), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS), and comorbidities [Charlson Comorbidity Index - CCI]) were associated with one-year mortality in all patients. In the second, we assessed whether delirium, use of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and forgoing life-sustaining therapies were associated with one-year mortality in survivors to hospital discharge. RESULTS: Of 763 patients included, 482 (62.3%) patients died at one year. Metastatic cancer was significantly associated with one-year mortality (HR = 1.97; CI 95%, 1.16-3.36), but hematologic cancer, CCI and ECOG PS were not. Among patients who survived to hospital discharge, delirium, use of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy and decisions to forgo life-sustaining therapies in ICU were not associated with one-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic disease at ICU admission was associated with one-year mortality in patients aged >=80 years. Delirium, use of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy and decisions to forgo life-sustaining therapies in ICU were not associated with one-year mortality among the patients discharged from hospital.
