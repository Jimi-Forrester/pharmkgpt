37907912|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer (PC) sometimes experience gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to tumor invasion of the gastrointestinal tract (tumor bleeding); no standard treatment has been established yet for this complication. Palliative radiotherapy (PRT) could be promising, however, there are few reports of PRT for tumor bleeding in patients with unresectable PC. Therefore, we evaluated the outcomes of PRT for tumor bleeding in patients with unresectable PC. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients with unresectable PC diagnosed at our institution between May 2013 and January 2022, and identified patients with endoscopically confirmed tumor bleeding who had received PRT. PRT was administered at a total dose of 30 Grays (Gy) in 10 fractions, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, or 8 Gy in a single fraction, and the dose selection was left to the discretion of the attending radiation oncologists. RESULTS: During the study period, 2562 patients were diagnosed as having unresectable PC at our hospital, of which 225 (8.8%) developed GIB. Among the 225 patients, 63 (2.5%) were diagnosed as having tumor bleeding and 20 (0.8%) received PRT. Hemostasis was achieved in 14 of the 20 patients (70%) who received PRT, and none of these patients developed grade 3 or more adverse events related to the PRT. The median time to hemostasis was 8.5 days (range 7-14 days). The rebleeding rate was 21.4% (3/14). The median hemoglobin level increased significantly (p < 0.001) from 5.9 to 9.1 g/dL, and the median volume of red blood cell transfusion tended (p = 0.052) to decrease, from 1120 mL (range 280-3360 mL) to 280 mL (range 0-5560 mL) following the PRT. The median overall survival (OS) was 52 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 39-317). Of the 14 patients in whom hemostasis was achieved following PRT, chemotherapy could be started/resumed in seven patients (50%), and the median OS in these patients was 260 days (95% CI 76-not evaluable [NE]). Three patients experienced rebleeding (21.4%), on days 16, 22, and 25, after the start of PRT. CONCLUSION: This study showed that PRT is an effective and safe treatment modality for tumor bleeding in patients with unresectable PC.
