Provision of adequate long term care, together with support for both family carers and healthcare workers were strongly stated needs. Other needs were rapid access to care, clear diagnosis, special needs of young patients with Alzheimer's disease, joint guidelines, and an increased role for CPNs. GPs valued the role of voluntary organisations and help given to them by Consultant Psycho-geriatricians.
