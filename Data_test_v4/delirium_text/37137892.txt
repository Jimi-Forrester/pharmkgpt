37137892|a|Neuropsychiatric disorders are multifactorial disorders with diverse aetiological factors. Identifying treatment targets is challenging because the diseases are resulting from heterogeneous biological, genetic, and environmental factors. Nevertheless, the increasing understanding of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) opens a new possibility in drug discovery. Harnessing our knowledge of molecular mechanisms and structural information of GPCRs will be advantageous for developing effective drugs. This review provides an overview of the role of GPCRs in various neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Besides, we highlight the emerging opportunities of novel GPCR targets and address recent progress in GPCR drug development.
