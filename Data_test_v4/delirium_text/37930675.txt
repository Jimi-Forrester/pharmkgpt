37930675|t|Neuronal insulin signaling and resistance: a balancing act of kinases and phosphatases.
37930675|a|Insulin signaling cascade in peripheral insulin sensitive tissues regulates whole-body glucose metabolism. Any deregulation in this pathway leads to insulin resistance, ultimately leading to metabolic diseases like diabetes-I, -II, obesity, etc. Insulin signaling in the brain has also been studied for many decades, and associated with many primary functions like maintaining synaptic plasticity, regulating cognition, circadian rhythm etc. Importantly, neuronal insulin signaling has also been associated with regulating neuronal glucose uptake. Any impairment in neuronal insulin signaling affecting neuronal glucose uptake has been associated with neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disorder, which is now being termed as type-3 diabetes. Since the criticality lies in proper signaling cascade, determining important points of deregulation is important. In this review, we have discussed some critical points of such deregulation, dividing them into two classes: kinases and phosphatases. We have highlighted their individual roles in neuronal insulin signaling, possible implications in neuronal insulin resistance. Future strategies in targeting these nodes in neuronal insulin signaling might be helpful in potential therapeutic opportunities to overcome neuronal insulin resistance and related neurodegenerative diseases.
