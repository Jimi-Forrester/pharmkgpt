31533445|a|BACKGROUND: The authors examined associations between physical activity, cognitive function, activities of daily living, and behavioral and psychological dementia symptoms (BPSD) in severe and moderate dementia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess severe and moderate dementia groups according to the Clinical Dementia Rating. An actigraphy measured physical activity. Other measures included Mini-Mental State Examination, Cognitive Test for Severe Dementia, Hyogo Activities of Daily Living Scale, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home. RESULTS: Sixty-three participants were assessed (mean age = 89.3 +- 6.4). Physical activity was not associated with cognitive function among participants with severe dementia, although there was a trend-level association with cognitive function among those with moderate dementia. Physical activity was significantly associated with BPSD, specifically agitation/aggression symptoms, for participants with severe dementia, and there was a trend-level association with anxiety for participants with moderate dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity appears to be associated with BPSD among individuals in the advanced stages of dementia.
