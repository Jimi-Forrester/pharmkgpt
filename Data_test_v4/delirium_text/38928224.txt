38928224|t|Evaluation of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Immunohistochemical Expression in Early-Stage Breast Cancer Subtypes.
38928224|a|Breast cancer, known for its diverse subtypes, ranks as one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), primarily associated with prostate cancer, has also been identified in breast cancer, though its role remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate PSMA expression across different subtypes of early-stage breast cancer and investigate its correlation with clinicopathological factors. This retrospective study included 98 breast cancer cases. PSMA expression was examined in both tumor cells and tumor-associated blood vessels. The analysis revealed PSMA expression in tumor-associated blood vessels in 88 cases and in tumor cells in 75 cases. Ki67 expression correlated positively with PSMA expression in blood vessels (p < 0.0001, RSpearman 0.42) and tumor cells (p = 0.010, RSpearman 0.26). The estrogen and progesterone receptor expression correlated negatively with PSMA levels in blood vessels (p = 0.0053, R Spearman -0.26 and p = 0.00026, R Spearman -0.347, respectively). Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status did not significantly impact PSMA expression. We did not detect any statistically significant differences between breast cancer subtypes. These findings provide evidence for a heterogenous PSMA expression in breast cancer tissue and suggest its correlation with tumor aggressiveness. Despite the limited sample size, the study provides valuable insights into the potential of PSMA as a prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic target in the management of breast cancer.
