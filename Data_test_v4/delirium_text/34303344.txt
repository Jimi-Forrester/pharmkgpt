34303344|a|Many survivors of critical illness suffer from long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health sequelae. The number of affected patients is expected to markedly increase due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many ICU survivors receive long-term care from a primary care physician. Hence, awareness and appropriate management of these sequelae is crucial. An interdisciplinary authorship team participated in a narrative literature review to identify key issues in managing COVID-19 ICU-survivors in primary care. The aim of this perspective paper is to synthesize important literature to understand and manage sequelae of critical illness due to COVID-19 in the primary care setting.
