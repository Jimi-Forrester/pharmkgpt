33306925|t|A Multi-Omics Analysis of PON1 Lactonase Activity in Relation to Human Health and Disease.
33306925|a|Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) enzyme has antioxidative properties and is present in mammalian blood and several other body fluids. In blood, PON1 is usually integrated into the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. PON1 is a highly versatile enzyme displaying diverse functions such as arylesterase, lactonase, and paraoxonase, among others. PON1 activities are usually investigated with artificial substrates, for example, dihydrocoumarin and thiobutyl butyrolactone for lactonase activity. The PON1 enzyme activities measured with different substrates tend to be falsely assumed as being equivalent in the literature, although there are poor or weak correlations among the PON1 enzyme activities with different substrates. In addition, and despite our knowledge of the factors influencing PON1 paraoxonase and arylesterase activities, there is little knowledge of PON1 lactonase activity variations and attendant mechanisms. This is important considering further that the lactonase activity is the native activity of PON1. We report here a multi-omics analysis of PON1 lactonase activity. The influence of genetic variations, particularly of single nucleotide polymorphisms and epigenetic, proteomic, and lipidomic variations on PON1 lactonase activity are reviewed. In addition, the influence of various environmental, clinical, and demographic variables on PON1 lactonase activity is discussed. Finally, we examine the associations between PON1 lactonase activity and health states and common complex diseases such as atherosclerosis, dementias, obesity, and diabetes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-omics analysis of PON1 lactonase activity with an eye to future applications in basic life sciences and translational medicine and the nuances of critically interpreting PON1 function with lactones as substrates.
