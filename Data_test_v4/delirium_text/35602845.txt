35602845|t|Massive Lower Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage as a Complication of Severe Campylobacter Enteritis.
35602845|a|Campylobacter enteritis is typically caused by Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli and is a major cause of diarrheal illness worldwide. Patients with Campylobacter gastroenteritis can be asymptomatic, but commonly present with a wide range of clinical symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and occasionally self-resolving hematochezia. Although hematochezia can occur, acute massive lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a rare complication of Campylobacter gastroenteritis and should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis in the presentation of lower GI bleeds. We describe a unique case of a 48-year-old male who presented with massive lower GI bleeding requiring multiple transfusions and admission to the medical intensive unit; the patient was ultimately diagnosed with severe Campylobacter gastroenteritis.
