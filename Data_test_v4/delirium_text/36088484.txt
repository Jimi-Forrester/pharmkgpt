36088484|a|Strong evidence demonstrates a significant association between cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). For this reason, interest in understanding the underlying vascular pathologies that contribute to AD remain. CAA research has primarily focused on arterioles and capillaries, overlooking the draining venules. Therefore, this study sought to examine venular amyloid pathology and its relationship to arteriolar amyloidosis throughout AD progression in the TgF344-AD rat model. Antibodies targeting the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) sequence suggest morphological differences between arteriolar and venular amyloid. Mass spectrometric analyses of isolated cortical parenchymal plaques, arteriolar and venular amyloid demonstrated presence of Abeta in all three samples, as well as proteins known to be associated with AD. Histopathological analysis indicates a significant age effect for both arteriolar and venular amyloid accumulation, with accumulation initiated in the somatosensory cortex followed by the motor and cingulate cortex. Lastly, significant arteriolar amyloid accumulates relative to venular amyloid deposition in AD progression. Overall, understanding venular and arteriolar amyloid pathology provides insight into the complex connection between CAA and AD.
