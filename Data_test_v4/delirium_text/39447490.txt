39447490|a|The hAbeta-KI and APPSAA-KI are two amyloid models that harbor mutations in the endogenous mouse App gene. Both hAbeta-KI and APPSAA-KI mice contain a humanized Abeta sequence, and APPSAA-KI mice carry three additional familial AD mutations. We herein report that the Abeta levels and Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in APPSAA-KI homozygotes are dramatically higher than those in hAbeta-KI homozygotes at 14 months of age. In addition, APPSAA-KI mice display a widespread distribution of amyloid plaques in the brain, whereas the plaques are undetectable in hAbeta-KI mice. Moreover, there are no sex differences in amyloid pathology in APPSAA-KI mice. Both APPSAA-KI and hAbeta-KI mice exhibit cognitive impairments, wherein no significant differences are found between these two models, although APPSAA KI mice show a trend towards worse cognitive function. Notably, female hAbeta-KI and APPSAA-KI mice have a more pronounced cognitive impairments compared to their respective males. Our findings suggest that Abeta humanization contributes to cognitive deficits in APPSAA-KI mice, and that amyloid deposition might not be closely associated with cognitive impairments in APPSAA-KI mice.
