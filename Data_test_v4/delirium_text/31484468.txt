31484468|t|Pterins as Diagnostic Markers of Mechanical and Impact-Induced Trauma: A Systematic Review.
31484468|a|We performed a systematic review of the literature to evaluate pterins as biomarkers of mechanical and impact-induced trauma. MEDLINE and Scopus were searched in March 2019. We included in vivo human studies that measured a pterin in response to mechanical or impact-induced trauma with no underlying prior disease or complication. We included 40 studies with a total of 3829 subjects. Seventy-seven percent of studies measured a significant increase in a pterin, primarily neopterin or total neopterin (neopterin + 7,8-dihydroneopterin). Fifty-one percent of studies measured an increase within 24 h or trauma, while 46% measured increases beyond 48 h. Pterins also showed promise as predictors of post-trauma complications such as sepsis, multi-organ failure and mortality. Exercise-induced trauma and traumatic brain injury caused an immediate increase in neopterin or total neopterin, while patients of multiple trauma had elevated pterin levels that remained above baseline for several days. Pterin concentration changes in response to surgery were variable with patients undergoing cardiac surgery having immediate and sustained pterin increases, while hysterectomy, liver resection or hysterectomy showed no change. This review provides systematic evidence that pterins, in particular neopterin and total neopterin, increase in response to multiple forms of mechanical or impact-induced trauma.
