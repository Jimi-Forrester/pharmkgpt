34094003|t|One Hundred Twenty-Day Mortality Rates for Hip Fracture Patients with COVID-19 Infection.
34094003|a|BACKGROUND: Increased 30-day mortality rates have been reported for patients with hip fractures and a concurrent diagnosis of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infection. Due to nosocomial spread of infection and the variable incubation period with the virus, follow-up past 30 days after injury is required to evaluate the true mortality amongst these patients. We aim to assess 120-day mortality rates in hip fracture patients with COVID-19 infection and compare this to hip fracture patients without COVID-19 infection presenting during the same time period. METHODS: This is a retrospective multicenter review of all patients aged >= 60 years admitted with a fractured neck of femur between March 5 and April 5, 2020, at nine U.K. trauma units. COVID-19 status, demographic data, comorbidities, and date of death (if applicable) were collected. RESULTS: Data were collected for 265 hip fracture patients. Forty-six patients (17.4%) tested positive for COVID-19 infection. There were no significant differences in age or Charlson comorbidity score between those with or without COVID-19. Those with COVID-19 infection were more likely to be male (p = 0.01). Patients with COVID-19 had a 30-day mortality of 35% versus 10% in patients without (p < 0.01). One hundred twenty-day mortality was also greater in those with COVID-19 infection at 63% compared to those without at 17% (p < 0.01). Previous history of myocardial infarction was the only independent factor that showed to increase mortality rate (p = 0.03). Subgroup analysis also revealed significantly increased mortality rates at 120 days in men (27% vs. 67%), women (14% vs. 59%), and those undergoing surgery (56% vs. 30%). CONCLUSIONS: We report a significantly increased mortality rate at 30 and 120 days after injury in an already high-risk cohort of surgical patients. With nearly half of patients being diagnosed with COVID-19 at 14 days or greater following admission, this study highlights the importance of taking appropriate measures to decrease the incidence of nosocomial infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in hip fracture patients.
