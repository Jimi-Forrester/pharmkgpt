38612251|t|Stereoselective Pharmacokinetics of Ketamine Administered at a Low Dose in Awake Dogs.
38612251|a|The present study aimed to examine the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of racemic ketamine in dogs at low doses. The secondary aims were to identify associated behavioural effects and propose a ketamine infusion rate. The study was conducted on nine intact male beagles, with each dog undergoing two treatments (BOL and INF). For treatment BOL, an intravenous bolus of 1 mg/kg was administered over 2 min. The treatment INF involved an initial bolus of 0.5 mg/kg given over 1 min, followed by an infusion at 0.01 mg/kg/min for 1 h. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. The median R/S enantiomer ratio of ketamine remained close to 1 throughout the study. Levels of S-norketamine were significantly higher than those of R-norketamine across all time points. Based on the collected data, the infusion rate predicted to achieve a steady-state racemic ketamine plasma concentration of 150 ng/mL was 0.028 mg/kg/min. Higher scores for behavioural effects were observed within the first five minutes following bolus administration. The most common behaviours observed were disorientation, head movements and staring eyes. Furthermore, employing ROC curve analysis, a racemic ketamine plasma concentration of 102 ng/mL was defined as the cut-off value, correlating with the occurrence of undesirable behavioural patterns.
