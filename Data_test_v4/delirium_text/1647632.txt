1647632|t|[Clinico-hemodynamic typification of alcoholics with various central circulatory disorders].
1647632|a|A study was made of the clinical picture of autonomic-somatic++ components of alcoholic abstinence and delirium as well as of the role of cardiovascular (hemodynamic) deviations. Using tetrapolar chest rheography the main types of hemodynamic disorders were described on a material of a random examination of 137 patients with stage II and III alcoholism. Of these, 64 patients were with the abstinent syndrome and 73 with the delirious syndrome according to the growth of the status gravity. Analysis of the clinical picture of the disease was first performed over time on the basis of the clinico-hemodinamic + parameters and phases of hemodynamic decompensation. The role of alcoholic cardiomyopathy in the general structure of the cardiovascular and somatovegetative manifestations was shown as dependent on variants of abstinence and delirium. Based on three clinico-hemodynamic++ types equivalent to the types of hemodynamic disorders, a new approach was applied to the differentiated treatment of alcoholic patients depending on their individual features, using optimally computed drug doses influencing the hemodynamics.
