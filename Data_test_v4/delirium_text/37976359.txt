37976359|t|Iron deficiency-induced ferritinophagy impairs skeletal muscle regeneration through RNF20-mediated H2Bub1 modification.
37976359|a|Iron deficiency (ID) is a widespread condition concomitant with disease and results in systemic dysfunction of target tissues including skeletal muscle. Activated by ID, ferritinophagy is a recently found type of selective autophagy, which plays an important role in various physiological and pathological conditions. In this study, we demonstrated that ID-mediated ferritinophagy impeded myogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, ferritinophagy induced RNF20 degradation through the autophagy-lysosomal pathway and then negatively regulated histone H2B monoubiquitination at lysine-120 in the promoters of the myogenic markers MyoD and MyoG, which inhibited myogenic differentiation and regeneration. Conditional knockout of NCOA4 in satellite cells, overexpression of RNF20 or treatment with 3-methyladenine restored skeletal muscle regenerative potential under ID conditions. In patients with ID, RNF20 and H2Bub1 protein expression is downregulated in skeletal muscle. In conclusion, our study indicated that the ferritinophagy-RNF20-H2Bub1 axis is a pathological molecular mechanism underlying ID-induced skeletal muscle impairment, suggesting potential therapeutic prospects.
