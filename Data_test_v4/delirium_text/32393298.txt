32393298|a|BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation plays a vital role in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. Recent evidence has proved that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) can inhibit neuropathic pain and possess potent immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive properties via secreting a variety of bioactive molecules, such as TNF-alpha-stimulated gene 6 protein (TSG-6). However, it is unknown whether BMSCs exert their analgesic effect against neuropathic pain by secreting TSG-6. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the analgesic effects of TSG-6 released from BMSCs on neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) in rats and explored the possible underlying mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: BMSCs were isolated from rat bone marrow and characterized by flow cytometry and functional differentiation. One day after CCI surgery, about 5 x 106 BMSCs were intrathecally injected into spinal cerebrospinal fluid. Behavioral tests, including mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, and motor function, were carried out at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 days after CCI surgery. Spinal cords were processed for immunohistochemical analysis of the microglial marker Iba-1. The mRNA and protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, TNFalpha, IL-6) were detected by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. The activation of the TLR2/MyD88/NF-kappaB signaling pathway was evaluated by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. The analgesic effect of exogenous recombinant TSG-6 on CCI-induced mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia was observed by behavioral tests. In the in vitro experiments, primary cultured microglia were stimulated with the TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4, and then co-cultured with BMSCs or recombinant TSG-6. The protein expression of TLR2, MyD88, p-p65 was evaluated by Western blot. The mRNA and protein levels of IL-1beta, TNFalpha, IL-6 were detected by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. BMSCs were transfected with the TSG-6-specific shRNA and then intrathecally injected into spinal cerebrospinal fluid in vivo or co-cultured with Pam3CSK4-treated primary microglia in vitro to investigate whether TSG-6 participated in the therapeutic effect of BMSCs on CCI-induced neuropathic pain and neuroinflammation. RESULTS: We found that CCI-induced mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia were ameliorated by intrathecal injection of BMSCs. Moreover, intrathecal administration of BMSCs inhibited CCI-induced neuroinflammation in spinal cord tissues. The analgesic effect and anti-inflammatory property of BMSCs were attenuated when TSG-6 expression was silenced. We also found that BMSCs inhibited the activation of the TLR2/MyD88/NF-kappaB pathway in the ipsilateral spinal cord dorsal horn by secreting TSG-6. Meanwhile, we proved that intrathecal injection of exogenous recombinant TSG-6 effectively attenuated CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that BMSCs and TSG-6 downregulated the TLR2/MyD88/NF-kappaB signaling and reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, in primary microglia treated with the specific TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated a paracrine mechanism by which intrathecal injection of BMSCs targets the TLR2/MyD88/NF-kappaB pathway in spinal cord dorsal horn microglia to elicit neuroprotection and sustained neuropathic pain relief via TSG-6 secretion.
