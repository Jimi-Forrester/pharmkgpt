35930096|a|According to available evidence, prolonged or chronic exposure to stress is detrimental to various brain structures, including the hippocampus. The current study examined the expression of two critical blood-brain barrier receptors required for amyloid-beta clearance to understand better the mechanism by which chronic stress impairs learning and memory in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rats were randomly assigned to one of two groups in this study: experiment 1 and experiment 2. Each main group was then divided into four subgroups. Rats were bilaterally injected with streptozotocin (STZ, 3 mg/kg, twice) using the intracerebroventricular (ICV) technique to induce the Alzheimer's model. Additionally, they were subjected to foot shock (1 mA, 1 Hz) for 10 s every 60 s (1 h/day) for ten consecutive days prior to and following STZ injection. The Morris Water Maze (MWM) test was used to assess spatial learning and memory. Real-time PCR was used to determine Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) and receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) mRNA levels in the hippocampus. Moreover, the animals' body weights were determined as physiological parameters in all groups. The results indicated that 10-day chronic electric foot shock stress reduced body weight, impaired spatial learning and memory, decreased hippocampal LRP1 mRNA expression, and increased hippocampal RAGE mRNA expression in a rat AD model. It can be concluded that chronic stress in conjunction with AD alters the expression of LRP1 and RAGE in the hippocampus. The findings pave the way for scientists to develop novel treatment strategies for AD.
