38548196|t|The relationship between major depressive disorder and dementia: A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study.
38548196|a|BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and dementia psychiatric and neurological diseases that are clinically widespread, but whether there is a causal link between them is still unclear. In this study, bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to investigate the potential causal relationship between MDD and dementia via a genome-wide association study (GWAS) database, containing samples from the European population. METHOD: We collected data on MDD and common clinical dementia subtypes from GWAS, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), and vascular dementia (VaD). A series of bidirectional two-sample MR studies and correlation sensitivity analysis were carried out. RESULTS: In the study of the effect of MDD on dementia subtypes, no causal relationship was found between MDD and dementia subtypes other than VaD, inverse variance weighted (IVW) method: odds ratio (OR), 2.131; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.249-3.639, P = 0.006; MDD-AD: OR, 1.000; 95 % CI, 0.999-1.001, P = 0.537; MDD-FTD: OR, 1.476; 95 % CI, 0.471-4.627, P = 0.505; MDD-PDD: OR, 0.592; 95 % CI, 0.204-1.718, P = 0.335; MR-Egger method: MDD-DLB: OR, 0.582; 95 % CI, 0.021-15.962, P = 0.751. In reverse MR analyses, no dementia subtype was found to be a risk factor for MDD. LIMITATIONS: The results of this study may not be generalizable to non-European populations. CONCLUSION: MDD was identified as a potential risk factor for VaD, but no dementia subtype was found to be a risk factor for MDD. These results suggest a new avenue for the prevention of VaD.
