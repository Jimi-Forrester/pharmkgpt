39369299|a|INTRODUCTION: Nursing home (NH) residents with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD) are at high risk for hospital transfer. We aimed to (1) describe characteristics and predictors of avoidable transfer of residents with ADRD and (2) explore how "what matters" influences the decision to transfer. METHODS: We applied an exploratory, mixed methods design using data collected as part of a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services demonstration project. Advanced practice registered nurses documented retrospective details about nursing home (NH)-to-hospital transfers (n = 3687) from 16 NHs. RESULTS: NH residents with ADRD had 1.22 times higher odds of having an avoidable NH-to-hospital transfer (odds ratio = 1.22; 95% confidence interval = 1.03, 1.45). Factors contributing to avoidable transfers were age, stage of ADRD, what matters to the resident and their family, changes in condition, and resources available in the NH. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the need for enhanced specificity in the discussion and documentation of resident and family preferences and continued investments in the NH workforce. HIGHLIGHTS: This article reports on factors contributing to avoidable nursing home (NH)-to-hospital transfer of residents with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). The mixed methods design used in this study offers insight beyond what is possible using a single-method design. Using data collected from a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services demonstration project, advanced practice registered nurses documented retrospective details about NH-to-hospital transfers (n = 3687) of residents. NH residents with ADRD were more likely to have an avoidable NH-to-hospital transfer. Factors contributing to avoidable transfers were age, stage of ADRD, what matters to the resident and their family, changes in condition, and resources available in the NH. These findings highlight the need for enhanced specificity in discussion and documentation of resident and family preferences and continued investments in the NH workforce.
