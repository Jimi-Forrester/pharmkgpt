35250977|t|Computational Design of a Multi-Epitope Vaccine Against Porphyromonas gingivalis.
35250977|a|Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium associated with chronic periodontitis. The development of a chimeric peptide-based vaccine targeting this pathogen could be highly beneficial in preventing oral bone loss as well as other severe gum diseases. We applied a computational framework to design a multi-epitope-based vaccine candidate against P. gingivalis. The vaccine comprises epitopes from subunit proteins prioritized from the P. gingivalis reference strain (P. gingivalis ATCC 33277) using several reported vaccine properties. Protein-based subunit vaccines were prioritized through genomics techniques. Epitope prediction was performed using immunoinformatic servers and tools. Molecular modeling approaches were used to build a putative three-dimensional structure of the vaccine to understand its interactions with host immune cells through biophysical techniques such as molecular docking simulation studies and binding free energy methods. Genome subtraction identified 18 vaccine targets: six outer-membrane, nine cytoplasmic membrane-, one periplasmic, and two extracellular proteins. These proteins passed different vaccine checks required for the successful development of a vaccine candidate. The shortlisted proteins were subjected to immunoinformatic analysis to map B-cell derived T-cell epitopes, and antigenic, water-soluble, non-toxic, and good binders of DRB1*0101 were selected. The epitopes were then modeled into a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct (linked epitopes plus adjuvant) to enhance immunogenicity and effectively engage both innate and adaptive immunity. Further, the molecular docking approach was used to determine the binding conformation of the vaccine to TLR2 innate immune receptor. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations of the vaccine-TLR2 complex were performed to highlight key intermolecular binding energies. Findings of this study will be useful for vaccine developers to design an effective vaccine for chronic periodontitis pathogens, specifically P. gingivalis.
