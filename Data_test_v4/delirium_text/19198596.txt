19198596|t|Nanomole-scale protein solid-state NMR by breaking intrinsic 1HT1 boundaries.
19198596|a|We present an approach that accelerates protein solid-state NMR 5-20-fold using paramagnetic doping to condense data-collection time (to approximately 0.2 s per scan), overcoming a long-standing limitation on slow recycling owing to intrinsic (1)H T(1) longitudinal spin relaxation. Using low-power schemes under magic-angle spinning at 40 kHz, we obtained two-dimensional (13)C-(13)C and (13)C-(15)N solid-state NMR spectra for several to tens of nanomoles of beta-amyloid fibrils and ubiquitin in 1-2 d.
