34063167|t|Mental Adjustment as a Predictor of Comprehensive Quality of Life Outcome among Patients with Terminal Cancer.
34063167|a|Using path modeling, this study aimed to explore whether mental adjustment was directly or indirectly related to comprehensive quality of life outcome (CoQoLO) among patients with terminal cancer. We conducted a cross-sectional designed study among patients with terminal cancer who underwent convenience sampling at our northern Taiwan clinic from August 2019 to August 2020. Patient characteristics data were collected via structured questionnaires, namely, the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale and the Comprehensive Quality of Life Outcome Inventory. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between mental adjustment and CoQoLO. Path analysis described the dependencies among variables. For the 117 enrolled patients analyzed, MAC (beta = 1.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.8-1.6, p < 0.001) and living with others (beta = 19.9, 95% CI = 4.1-35.7, p = 0.015) were significant predictors and correlated positively with a CoQoLO score. Path modeling showed that the patients' mental adjustment, economic status, perceived disease severity, palliative prognostic index, and symptom severity directly affected their CoQoLO. Our results indicate that the higher the mental adjustment, the better the CoQoLO among patients with terminal cancer. Thus, nurses need to assess mental adjustment levels when patients are hospitalized and accordingly develop interventions to improve the terminally ill patients' mental adjustment to the final stages of cancer, thereby helping them to achieve good CoQoLO.
