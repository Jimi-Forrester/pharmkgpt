10200363|a|OBJECTIVE: To detect the relation between alpha1-antichymotrpsin(AACT)gene polymorphism and epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene in Alzheimer disease (AD) in Chinese. METHODS: The gene polymorphisms of ApoE and AACT were genotyped in 125 AD cases and 140 controls with PCR methods and RFLP typing. Then the association between AACT polymorphism and ApoE epsilon4 was analysed. RESULTS: There was no association between AD and any allele or genotype of AACT polymorphism; AACT polymorphism was not associated with AD ApoE epsilon4 or without ApoE epsilon4. In AACT* AT and AACT* TT genotypes, ApoE epsilon4 allele was associated with AD, but no association was observed in AACT* AA genotype. CONCLUSION: AACT may not be associated with AD in Chinese, and this effect can not be influenced by ApoE epsilon4, but AACT gene polymorphism may affect the association between ApoE epsilon4 allele and AD.
