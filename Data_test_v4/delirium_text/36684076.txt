36684076|a|Brain administration of human platelet lysates (HPL) is a potential emerging biotherapy of neurodegenerative and traumatic diseases of the central nervous system. HPLs being prepared from pooled platelet concentrates, thereby increasing viral risks, manufacturing processes should incorporate robust virus-reduction treatments. We evaluated a 19 +- 2-nm virus removal nanofiltration process using hydrophilic regenerated cellulose hollow fibers on the properties of a neuroprotective heat-treated HPL (HPPL). Spiking experiments demonstrated >5.30 log removal of 20-22-nm non-enveloped minute virus of mice-mock particles using an immuno-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. The nanofiltered HPPL (NHPPL) contained a range of neurotrophic factors like HPPL. There was >2 log removal of extracellular vesicles (EVs), associated with decreased expression of pro-thrombogenic phosphatidylserine and procoagulant activity. LC-MS/MS proteomics showed that ca. 80% of HPPL proteins, including neurotrophins, cytokines, and antioxidants, were still found in NHPPL, whereas proteins associated with some infections and cancer-associated pathways, pro-coagulation and EVs, were removed. NHPPL maintained intact neuroprotective activity in Lund human mesencephalic dopaminergic neuron model of Parkinson's disease (PD), stimulated the differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuronal cells and showed preserved anti-inflammatory function upon intranasal administration in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Therefore, nanofiltration of HPL is feasible, lowers the viral, prothrombotic and procoagulant risks, and preserves the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties in neuronal pre-clinical models of PD and TBI.
