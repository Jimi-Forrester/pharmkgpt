28243755|a|The objective of this work was to develop and evaluate a classifier for differentiating probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) from Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and from frontotemporal dementia, behavioral variant (bvFTD) based on quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG). We compared 25 QEEG features in 61 dementia patients (20 patients with probable AD, 20 patients with PDD or probable DLB (DLBPD), and 21 patients with bvFTD). Support vector machine classifiers were trained to distinguish among the three groups. Out of the 25 features, 23 turned out to be significantly different between AD and DLBPD, 17 for AD versus bvFTD, and 12 for bvFTD versus DLBPD. Using leave-one-out cross validation, the classification achieved an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 100% using only the QEEG features Granger causality and the ratio of theta and beta1 band powers. These results indicate that classifiers trained with selected QEEG features can provide a valuable input in distinguishing among AD, DLB or PDD, and bvFTD patients. In this study with 61 patients, no misclassifications occurred. Therefore, further studies should investigate the potential of this method to be applied not only on group level but also in diagnostic support for individual subjects.
