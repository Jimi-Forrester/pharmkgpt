39269831|t|A Data-Driven Cognitive Composite Sensitive to Amyloid-beta for Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease.
39269831|a|Background: Integrating scores from multiple cognitive tests into a single cognitive composite has been shown to improve sensitivity to detect AD-related cognitive impairment. However, existing composites have little sensitivity to amyloid-beta status (Abeta +/-) in preclinical AD. Objective: Evaluate whether a data-driven approach for deriving cognitive composites can improve the sensitivity to detect Abeta status among cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals compared to existing cognitive composites. Methods: Based on the data from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in the Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) study, a novel composite, the Data-driven Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (D-PACC), was developed based on test scores and response durations selected using a machine learning algorithm from the Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB). The D-PACC was then compared with conventional composites in the follow-up A4 visits and in individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Result: The D-PACC showed a comparable or significantly higher ability to discriminate Abeta status [median Cohen's d = 0.172] than existing composites at the A4 baseline visit, with similar results at the second visit. The D-PACC demonstrated the most consistent sensitivity to Abeta status in both A4 and ADNI datasets. Conclusions: The D-PACC showed similar or improved sensitivity when screening for Abeta+ in CU populations compared to existing composites but with higher consistency across studies.
