37684694|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a cerebral small vessel disease that carries mutations in NOTCH3. The clinical manifestations are influenced by genetic and environmental factors that may include gut microbiome. RESULTS: We investigated the fecal metagenome, fecal metabolome, serum metabolome, neurotransmitters, and cytokines in a cohort of 24 CADASIL patients with 28 healthy household controls. The integrated-omics study showed CADASIL patients harbored an altered microbiota composition and functions. The abundance of bacterial coenzyme A, thiamin, and flavin-synthesizing pathways was depleted in patients. Neurotransmitter balance, represented by the glutamate/GABA (4-aminobutanoate) ratio, was disrupted in patients, which was consistent with the increased abundance of two major GABA-consuming bacteria, Megasphaera elsdenii and Eubacterium siraeum. Essential inflammatory cytokines were significantly elevated in patients, accompanied by an increased abundance of bacterial virulence gene homologs. The abundance of patient-enriched Fusobacterium varium positively correlated with the levels of IL-1beta and IL-6. Random forest classification based on gut microbial species, serum cytokines, and neurotransmitters showed high predictivity for CADASIL with AUC = 0.89. Targeted culturomics and mechanisms study further showed that patient-derived F. varium infection caused systemic inflammation and behavior disorder in Notch3R170C/+ mice potentially via induction of caspase-8-dependent noncanonical inflammasome activation in macrophages. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested the potential linkage among the brain-gut-microbe axis in CADASIL. Video Abstract.
