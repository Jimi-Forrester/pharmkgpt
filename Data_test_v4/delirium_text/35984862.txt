35984862|a|The fine-tuning of gene expression is critical for all cellular processes; aberrations in this activity can lead to pathology, and conversely, resilience. As their role in coordinating organismal responses to both internal and external factors have increasingly come into focus, small non-coding RNAs have emerged as an essential component to disease etiology. Using Systemic RNA interference Defective (SID) mutants of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, deficient in gene silencing, we examined the potential consequences of dysfunctional epigenomic regulation in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). Specifically, the loss of either the sid-1 or sid-3 genes, which encode a dsRNA transporter and an endocytic regulatory non-receptor tyrosine kinase, respectively, conferred neuroprotection to dopaminergic (DA) neurons in an established transgenic C. elegans strain wherein overexpression of human alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) from a chromosomally integrated multicopy transgene causes neurodegeneration. We further show that knockout of a specific microRNA, mir-2, attenuates alpha-syn neurotoxicity; suggesting that the native targets of mir-2-dependent gene silencing represent putative neuroprotective modulators. In support of this, we demonstrated that RNAi knockdown of multiple mir-2 targets enhanced alpha-syn-induced DA neurodegeneration. Moreover, we demonstrate that mir-2 overexpression originating in the intestine can induce neurodegeneration of DA neurons, an effect that was reversed by pharmacological inhibition of SID-3 activity. Interestingly, sid-1 mutants retained mir-2-induced enhancement of neurodegeneration. Transcriptomic analysis of alpha-syn animals with and without a sid-1 mutation revealed 27 differentially expressed genes with human orthologs related to a variety of diseases, including PD. Among these was pgp-8, encoding a P-glycoprotein-related ABC transporter. Notably, sid-1; pgp-8 double mutants abolished the neurodegeneration resulting from intestinal mir-2 overexpression. This research positions known regulators of small RNA-dependent gene silencing within a framework that facilitates mechanistic evaluation of epigenetic responses to exogenous and endogenous factors influencing DA neurodegeneration, revealing a path toward new targets for therapeutic intervention of PD.
