29890636|t|Amyloid Beta Peptide Is Released during Thrombosis in the Skin.
29890636|a|While it is known that amyloid beta (Abeta) deposits are found in different tissues of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy individuals, there remain questions about the physiological role of these deposits, the origin of the Abeta peptide, and the mechanisms of its localization to the tissues. Using immunostaining with specific antibodies, as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, this study demonstrated Abeta40 peptide accumulation in the skin during local experimental photothrombosis in mice. Specifically, Abeta peptide accumulation was concentrated near the dermal blood vessels in thrombotic skin. It was also studied whether the released peptide affects microorganisms. Application of Abeta40 (4 microM) to the external membrane of yeast cells significantly increased membrane conductance with no visible effect on mouse host cells. The results suggest that Abeta release in the skin is related to skin injury and thrombosis, and occurs along with clotting whenever skin is damaged. These results support the proposition that Abeta release during thrombosis serves as part of a natural defense against infection.
