28990640|t|Very Late-Onset Schizophrenia-Like Psychosis: A Clinical Update.
28990640|a|Psychosis symptoms (delusions and hallucinations) are multifactorial in origin and, in later life, occur in the context of schizophrenia, delirium, dementia, delusional and schizophrenia-like disorders, mood disorders, and alcohol or substance abuse. The current article provides a clinical overview of very late-onset (after age 60) schizophrenia-like psychosis (VLOSLP), summarizing the literature on treatment options and reflecting on the role of psychiatric-mental health nurses (PMHNs). Increased awareness of the clinical presentation, key features, and evidence-based treatment options will assist PMHNs to confidently recognize this often under-diagnosed disorder and adopt a more assertive role in terms of engagement and follow up. Pragmatic research involving individuals with VLOSLP is required to increase the evidence base for treatment and improve outcomes of care.
