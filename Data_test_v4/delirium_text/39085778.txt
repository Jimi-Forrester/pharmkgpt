39085778|a|BACKGROUND: The administration of anesthesia during gastrointestinal endoscopy potentially contributes to post-anesthesia cognitive dysfunction (PACD), with detrimental impacts for cognitive function. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards PACD among patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy in Wenzhou region. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between June and August 2023, and recruited individuals undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy. Demographic data and KAP scores were collected through questionnaires. Pearson correlation analysis was applied to evaluate correlations between KAP scores, and logistic regression was utilized to identify influential factors. RESULTS: We collected 405 valid questionnaires, with 54.57% being male and 29.88% aged 31-40 years. Mean KAP scores were 13.99 +- 4.80, 16.19 +- 2.35, and 15.61 +- 2.86, respectively (possible range: 0-16, 0-25, and 0-25). Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated significant positive correlations between knowledge and practice (r = 0.209, P < 0.001), attitude and practice (r = 0.233, P < 0.001), and knowledge and attitude (r = 0.328, P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression revealed negative associations of opting for standard gastrointestinal endoscopy (without anesthesia) with knowledge (OR = 0.227, 95%CI: 0.088-0.582, P = 0.002) and practice scores (OR = 0.336, 95%CI: 0.154-0.731, P = 0.006). Additionally, the presence of cognitive-related diseases or symptoms before undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy was negatively associated with knowledge scores (OR = 0.429, 95%CI: 0.225-0.818, P = 0.010). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy demonstrated good knowledge, neutral attitudes, and moderate practices regarding PACD. Educational interventions and behavior modification are recommended, particularly for individuals with lower monthly income, undergoing standard gastrointestinal endoscopy, or experiencing cognitive-related conditions.
