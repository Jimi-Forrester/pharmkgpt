35381593|a|BACKGROUND: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) causes hyperkalemia, and hyponatremia caused by TMP/SMX is a challenge for clinicians. We described the clinical features of hyponatremia induced by TMP/SMX after collecting cases. SUMMARY: The median age of the 24 patients (10 males and 14 females) was 67 years (range: 28-90 years). Hyponatremia induced by TMP/SMX manifested as nausea (41.7%) and vomiting (29.2%) or asymptomatic hyponatremia (20.8%). The median duration of hyponatremia was 5 days (range: 3-10 days). The median serum sodium concentration was 118 mmol/L (range: 101-128.1 mmol/L). The serum sodium levels gradually returned to the normal range at 4 days (median; range: 2-14 days) after withdrawing TMP/SMX. KEY MESSAGES: TMP/SMX-induced hyponatremia is a rare and serious adverse reaction. Clinicians should be aware of electrolyte disturbances caused by TMP/SMX and should always consider electrolyte monitoring.
