37762549|t|The Effect of Potassium Canrenoate (Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist) on the Markers of Inflammation in the Treatment of COVID-19 Pneumonia and Fibrosis-A Secondary Analysis of Randomized Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.
37762549|a|In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that presented mainly as an acute infection of the lower respiratory tract (pneumonia), with multiple long-term consequences, including lung fibrosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of potassium canrenoate on inflammatory markers in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. A randomized clinical trial (RCT) of intravenous potassium canrenoate vs. placebo was performed between December 2020 and November 2021. This study is a secondary analysis of that RCT. In the final analysis, a total of 49 hospitalized patients were included (24 allocated to the potassium canrenoate group and 25 to the placebo group). Patients were assessed by serum testing and blood cell cytometry on day 1 and day 7 of the intervention. Age, sex, and body mass index were not significantly different between the placebo group and intervention group. Although there was a significantly higher rate of ischemic heart disease in the placebo group, rates of other preexisting comorbidities were not significantly different. There were no significant differences in the inflammatory parameters between the potassium canrenoate and placebo groups on day 1 and day 7. However, the intragroup comparisons using Wilcoxon's test showed significant differences between day 1 and day 7. The CD3% for potassium canrenoate increased significantly between day 1 and day 7 (12.85 +- 9.46; 11.55 vs. 20.50 +- 14.40; 17.80; p = 0.022), while the change in the placebo group was not significant (15.66 +- 11.39; 12.65 vs. 21.16 +- 15.37; 16.40; p = 0.181). The IL-1ss total count [%] increased over time for both potassium canrenoate (0.68 +- 0.58; 0.45 vs. 1.27 +- 0.83; 1.20; p = 0.004) and placebo (0.61 +- 0.59; 0.40 vs. 1.16 +- 0.91; 1.00; p = 0.016). The TNF-alpha total count (%) decreased significantly between day 1 and day 7 for potassium canrenoate (0.54 +- 0.45; 0.40 vs. 0.25 +- 0.23; 0.10; p = 0.031), but not for placebo (0.53 +- 0.47; 0.35 vs. 0.26 +- 0.31; 0.20; p = 0.056). Interleukin-6 (pg/mL) showed a significant decrease between day 1 and day 7 for potassium canrenoate (64.97 +- 72.52; 41.00 vs. 24.20 +- 69.38; 5.30; p = 0.006), but not the placebo group. This RCT has shown that the administration of potassium canrenoate to patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia may be associated with significant changes in certain inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, CD3%, TNF-alpha), potentially related to pulmonary fibrosis. Although some positive trends were observed in the potassium canrenoate group, none of these observations reached statistical significance. Any possible benefits from the use of potassium canrenoate as an anti-inflammatory or antifibrotic drug in COVID-19 patients require further investigation.
