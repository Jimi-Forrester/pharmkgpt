Many brain tumors go undiagnosed or are overlooked by clinicians as a result of the challenges associated with manually evaluating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images in clinical practice. In this study, we built a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for glioma detection, grading, segmentation, and knowledge discovery based on artificial intelligence algorithms. Neuroimages are specifically represented using a type of visual feature known as the histogram of gradients (HOG). Then, through a two-level classification framework, the HOG features are employed to distinguish between healthy controls and patients, or between different glioma grades. This CAD system also offers tumor visualization using a semi-automatic segmentation tool for better patient management and treatment monitoring. Finally, a knowledge base is created to offer additional advice for the diagnosis of brain tumors. Based on our proposed two-level classification framework, we train models for glioma detection and grading, achieving area under curve (AUC) of 0.921 and 0.806, respectively. Different from other systems, we integrate these diagnostic tools with a web-based interface, which provides the flexibility for system deployment.
