36358518|a|The development of many chronic diseases is associated with an excess of free radicals leading to harmful oxidative stress. Certain probiotic strains have been shown to have antioxidant and anti-aging properties and are an important resource for development of microbial antioxidants. The present study aimed to explore the protection offered by Bifidobacterium animalis strain MSMC83 in a model of oxidative stress induced by D-galactose (D-gal). Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly allocated to four groups: a control group injected with saline, a group injected subcutaneously with D-galactose, a probiotic group injected with D-galactose and administered B. animalis MSMC83 (109 CFU/mL) via daily oral gavage, and an ascorbic acid group. The probiotics significantly increased the superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase and significantly decreased the malondialdehyde in the plasma and livers of D-galactose-treated rats. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor-alpha level in the liver was significantly decreased. Furthermore, the treatment with B. animalis MSMC83 restored the microbiota diversity after D-galactose injection. Therefore, our results supported a beneficial role of B. animalis MSMC83 in alleviating oxidative stress through the increased expression of antioxidant enzymes and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in rats. Our study suggests that B. animalis MSMC83 may be part of a healthy diet to prevent oxidative stress-associated diseases.
