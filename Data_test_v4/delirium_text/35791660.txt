35791660|t|Cytokine profiles in intensive care unit delirium.
35791660|a|BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation causing disruption of the blood-brain barrier and immune cell extravasation into the brain parenchyma may cause delirium; however, knowledge of the exact pathophysiologic mechanism remains incomplete. The purpose of our study was to determine whether cytokine profiles differ depending on whether delirium occurs in the setting of sepsis, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), or recent surgery. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study involved 119 critically ill patients admitted to a multidisciplinary intensive care unit (ICU) during 2019 and 2020. Delirium was identified using the validated confusion assessment method for the ICU. Multiple delirium risk factors were collected daily including clinical characteristics, hospital course, lab values, vital signs, surgical exposure, drug exposure, and COVID-19 characteristics. Serums samples were collected within 12 hours of ICU admission and cytokine levels were measured. RESULTS: The following proinflammatory cytokines were elevated in our delirium population: tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, C-C motif ligand (CCL) 2, CCL3, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)1, CXCL10, IL-8, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and IL-10. Analysis of relative cytokine levels in those patients that developed delirium in the setting of sepsis, COVID-19, and recent surgery showed elevations of CCL2, CXCL10, and TNF-alpha in both the sepsis and COVID-19 group in comparison to the postsurgical population. In the postsurgical group, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was elevated and CXCL10 was decreased relative to the opposing groups. CONCLUSIONS: We identify several cytokines and precipitating factors known to be associated with delirium. However, our study suggests that the cytokine profile associated with delirium is variable and contingent upon delirium precipitating factors.
