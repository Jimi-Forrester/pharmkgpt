38538647|a|Body mass index (BMI) is a crucial health indicator for obesity. With the progression of socio-economic status and alterations in lifestyle, an increasing number of global populations are at risk of obesity. Given the complexity and severity of neurological diseases, early identification of risk factors is vital for the diagnosis and prognosis of such diseases. In this study, we employed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis utilizing the most comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to date. We selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are unaffected by confounding factors and reverse causality as instrumental variables. These variables were used to evaluate the genetic and causal relationships between Body Mass Index (BMI) and various neurological diseases, including Parkinson's Disease (PD), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Ischemic Stroke (IS), and Epilepsy (EP). The Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) analysis indicated that there was no significant causal relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) indicators and PD (P-value = 0.511), AD (P-value = 0.076), ALS (P-value = 0.641), EP (P-value = 0.380). However, a causal relationship was found between BMI indicators and MS (P-value = 0.035), and IS (P-value = 0.000), with the BMI index positively correlated with the risk of both diseases. The Cochran's Q test for MR-IVW showed no heterogeneity in the MR analysis results between the BMI index and the neurological diseases (P > 0.05). The Egger intercept test for pleiotropy revealed no horizontal pleiotropy detected in any of the neurological diseases studied (P > 0.05). It was found that there was no causal relationship between BMI and PD, AD, ALS, EP, and a genetic causal association with MS, and IS. Meanwhile, the increase in BMI can lead to a higher risk of MS and IS, which reveals the critical role of obesity as a risk factor for specific neurological diseases in the pathogenesis of the diseases.
