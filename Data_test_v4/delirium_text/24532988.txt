24532988|t|Pharmacogenetics of Parkinson's disease - through mechanisms of drug actions.
24532988|a|In the last years due to development of molecular methods a substantial progress in understanding of genetic associations with drug effects in many clinical disciplines has been observed. The efforts to define the role of genetic polymorphisms in optimizing pharmacotherapy of Parkinson's disease (PD) were also undertaken. So far, some promising genetic loci for PD treatment were determined. In the review pharmacogenetic aspects of levodopa, dopamine agonists and COMT inhibitors are discussed.
