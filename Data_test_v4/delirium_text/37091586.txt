37091586|a|Projection neurons in the anteriolateral part of entorhinal cortex layer II are the predominant cortical site for hyper-phosphorylation of tau and formation of neurofibrillary tangles in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. A majority of layer II projection neurons in anteriolateral entorhinal cortex are unique among cortical excitatory neurons by expressing the protein reelin. In prodromal Alzheimer's disease, these reelin-expressing neurons are prone to accumulate intracellular amyloid-beta, which is mimicked in a rat model that replicates the spatio-temporal cascade of the disease. Two important findings in relation to this are that reelin-signalling downregulates tau phosphorylation, and that oligomeric amyloid-beta interferes with reelin-signalling. Taking advantage of this rat model, we used proximity ligation assay to assess whether reelin and intracellular amyloid-beta directly interact during early, pre-plaque stages in anteriolateral entorhinal cortex layer II reelin-expressing neurons. We next made a viral vector delivering micro-RNA against reelin, along with a control vector, and infected reelin-expressing anteriolateral entorhinal cortex layer II-neurons to test whether reelin levels affect levels of intracellular amyloid-beta and/or amyloid precursor protein. We analysed 25.548 neurons from 24 animals, which results in three important findings. First, in reelin-expressing anteriolateral entorhinal cortex layer II-neurons, reelin and intracellular amyloid-beta engage in a direct protein-protein interaction. Second, injecting micro-RNA against reelin lowers reelin levels in these neurons, amounting to an effect size of 1.3-4.5 (Bayesian estimation of Cohen's d effect size, 95% credible interval). This causes a concomitant reduction of intracellular amyloid-beta ranging across three levels of aggregation, including a reduction of Abeta42 monomers/dimers amounting to an effect size of 0.5-3.1, a reduction of Abeta prefibrils amounting to an effect size of 1.1-3.5 and a reduction of protofibrils amounting to an effect size of 0.05-2.1. Analysing these data using Bayesian estimation of mutual information furthermore reveals that levels of amyloid-beta are dependent on levels of reelin. Third, the reduction of intracellular amyloid-beta occurs without any substantial associated changes in levels of amyloid precursor protein. We conclude that reelin and amyloid-beta directly interact at the intracellular level in the uniquely reelin-expressing projection neurons in anteriolateral entorhinal cortex layer II, where levels of amyloid-beta are dependent on levels of reelin. Since amyloid-beta is known to impair reelin-signalling causing upregulated phosphorylation of tau, our findings are likely relevant to the vulnerability for neurofibrillary tangle-formation of this entorhinal neuronal population.
