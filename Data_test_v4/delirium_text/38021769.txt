38021769|t|Unveiling the Health Ramifications of Lead Poisoning: A Narrative Review.
38021769|a|The presence of lead (Pb) in children's toys and paint is a significant global public health concern. Numerous studies conducted worldwide have measured lead concentrations in these products. This article aims to examine the research findings and shed light on the implications for human health, including legal consequences and public awareness. Despite regulations on lead levels in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) paints and children's toys in many countries, several reviewed documents indicate that these products often contain substantial amounts of lead, frequently surpassing legal limits. Particularly high levels of lead in paints have been found in countries such as China, Thailand, and Brazil. It is crucial to raise awareness among parents by educating them about this issue and empowering them to take proactive measures to protect their children from lead poisoning associated with toys and colored paints. There is also global support for eliminating lead pigments and regulating the amount of lead in PVC toys.
