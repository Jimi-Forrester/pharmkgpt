37354261|t|Ageing in the brain: mechanisms and rejuvenating strategies.
37354261|a|Ageing is characterized by the progressive loss of cellular homeostasis, leading to an overall decline of the organism's fitness. In the brain, ageing is highly associated with cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. With the rise in life expectancy, characterizing the brain ageing process becomes fundamental for developing therapeutic interventions against the increased incidence of age-related neurodegenerative diseases and to aim for an increase in human life span and, more importantly, health span. In this review, we start by introducing the molecular/cellular hallmarks associated with brain ageing and their impact on brain cell populations. Subsequently, we assess emerging evidence on how systemic ageing translates into brain ageing. Finally, we revisit the mainstream and the novel rejuvenating strategies, discussing the most successful ones in delaying brain ageing and related diseases.
