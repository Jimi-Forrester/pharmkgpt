37038394|t|"This Won't Hurt a Bit": Is There a Role for Music in Bedside Procedures?
37038394|a|Music has played a long and storied role in clinical healing. However, the integration of music into clinical practice has been slow to gain traction, despite a recent meta-analysis demonstrating association of music interventions with clinically meaningful improvements in health-related quality of life. There is growing evidence that music has an active role in reducing patient pain and anxiety as well as affecting physiologic parameters, such as heart rate and blood pressure, in an ICU setting. Past studies have shown that incorporation of music into procedures in the operating room, radiology suites, and catheterization labs has reduced concurrent pharmacologic sedation requirements. In the age of patient-centered personalized medicine, we propose a call to action to implement an easily accessible, attainable checklist item offering a personal choice of music for patients during standardized bedside procedural training, to reduce anxiety, pain, and pharmacologic sedation and potentially improve clinical outcomes.
