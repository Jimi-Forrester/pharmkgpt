30480250|t|Long-Term Non-Invasive Treatment via Intranasal Administration of Nerve Growth Factor Protects the Human Brain in Frontotemporal Dementia associated with Corticobasal Syndrome: A Pilot Study.
30480250|a|BACKGROUND: Nerve growth factor (NGF) is known for playing a critical protective role on a number of brain neurons in mammals, including humans. NGF can be delivered to the CNS via nasal route and has a neuroprotective action in case of neurodegenerative diseases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate for the first time whether purified NGF can play a neuroprotective role on human brain neurons affected by neurodegenerative diseases when administered via nasal route. METHODS: Two female patients, both affected by frontotemporal dementia (FTD) associated with corticobasal syndrome (CBS) at different stages of disease progression, received a daily intranasal NGF spray for one year. Clinical/neurological aspects were observed over time. The follow-up study was performed using 18 FDG PET. RESULTS: This case study seems to demonstrate that IN-NGF slows down the common decline caused by FTD/CBS. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the potential neuroprotective role of IN-NGF administered in case of neurodegenerative diseases.
