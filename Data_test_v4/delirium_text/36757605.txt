36757605|a|BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents the most recent severe pandemic resulting in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 can damage the central nervous system, requiring admission to intensive care units (ICU) and aggressive treatments (long-term ventilatory assistance and sedation) to stabilize vitals. Most post-COVID-19 patients experience cognitive impairments and mood or stress disorders. We aimed to study the frequency of cognitive deficits in COVID-19 survivors, the relationship between clinical factors in the acute phase and cognitive outcomes, affective states, and quality of life. We explored cognitive reserve (CR) role, as a post-COVID-19 resilience factor. METHODS: Twenty-nine COVID-19 inpatients were assessed using a neuropsychological battery, mood scales, quality of life, and social integration questionnaires. Twenty-five were retained through telephone follow-up to monitor cognitive sequelae, affective states, and reintegration levels roughly 8 months after hospital discharge. We administered the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire. RESULTS: We found most patients display no cognitive deficits. When they did, multi-domain impairment occurred most frequently, especially involving executive functions. Results revealed a significant correlation between depression levels and the interval between ICU admission and tracheal tube removal. We found increased levels of depression and anxiety at follow-up, a significant relationship between resuming daily life activities, high CR, and executive functions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the importance of psychological support in the long term and the modulating role of cognitive reserve in quality of life after infection.
