39068669|t|Plasma Phosphorylated Tau 217 and Abeta42/40 to Predict Early Brain Abeta Accumulation in People Without Cognitive Impairment.
39068669|a|Importance: Phase 3 trials of successful antiamyloid therapies in Alzheimer disease (AD) have demonstrated improved clinical efficacy in people with less severe disease. Plasma biomarkers will be essential for efficient screening of participants in future primary prevention clinical trials testing antiamyloid therapies in cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals with initially low brain beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels who are at high risk of accumulating Abeta. Objective: To investigate if combining plasma biomarkers could be useful in predicting subsequent development of Abeta pathology in CU individuals with subthreshold brain Abeta levels (defined as Abeta levels <40 Centiloids) at baseline. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a longitudinal study including Swedish BioFINDER-2 (enrollment 2017-2022) and replication in 2 independent cohorts, the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC; enrollment 1988 and 2019) and Swedish BioFINDER-1 (enrollment 2009-2015). Included for analysis was a convenience sample of CU individuals with baseline plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) and Abeta42/40 assessments and Abeta assessments with positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42/40. Data were analyzed between April 2023 and May 2024. Exposures: Baseline plasma levels of Abeta42/40, p-tau217, the ratio of p-tau217 to nonphosphorylated tau (%p-tau217), p-tau231, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Main Outcomes and Measures: Cross-sectional and longitudinal PET and CSF measures of brain Abeta pathology. Results: This study included 495 (BioFINDER-2), 283 (Knight ADRC), and 205 (BioFINDER-1) CU participants. In BioFINDER-2, the mean (SD) age was 65.7 (14.4) with 261 females (52.7%). When detecting abnormal CSF Abeta-status, a combination of plasma %p-tau217 and Abeta42/40 showed better performance (area under the curve = 0.949; 95% CI, 0.929-0.970; P <.02) than individual biomarkers. In CU participants with subthreshold baseline Abeta-PET, baseline plasma %p-tau217 and Abeta42/40 levels were significantly associated with baseline Abeta-PET (n = 384) and increases in Abeta-PET over time (n = 224). Associations of plasma %p-tau217 and Abeta42/40 and their interaction with baseline Abeta-PET (%p-tau217: beta = 2.77; 95% CI, 1.84-3.70; Abeta42/40: beta = -1.64; 95% CI, -2.53 to -0.75; %p-tau217 x Abeta42/40: beta = -2.14; 95% CI, -2.79 to -1.49; P < .001) and longitudinal Abeta-PET (%p-tau217: beta = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48-0.87; Abeta42/40: beta = -0.33; 95% CI, -0.51 to -0.15; %p-tau217 x Abeta42/40: beta = -0.31; 95% CI, -0.44 to -0.18; P < .001) were also significant in the models combining the 2 baseline biomarkers as predictors. Similarly, baseline plasma p-tau217 and Abeta42/40 were independently associated with longitudinal Abeta-PET in Knight ADRC (%p-tau217: beta = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.26-1.16; P = .002; Abeta42/40: beta = -0.74; 95% CI, -1.26 to -0.22; P = .006) and longitudinal CSF Abeta42/40 in BioFINDER-1 (p-tau217: beta = -0.0003; 95% CI, -0.0004 to -0.0001; P = .01; Abeta42/40: beta = 0.0004; 95% CI, 0.0002-0.0006; P < .001) in CU participants with subthreshold Abeta levels at baseline. Plasma p-tau231 and GFAP did not provide any clear independent value. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this cohort study suggest that combining plasma p-tau217and Abeta42/40 levels could be useful for predicting development of Abeta pathology in people with early stages of subthreshold Abeta accumulation. These biomarkers might thus facilitate screening of participants for future primary prevention trials.
