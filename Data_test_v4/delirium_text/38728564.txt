38728564|a|OBJECTIVE: Hearing loss has been identified as a major modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline. The Early Age-Related Hearing Loss Investigation (EARHLI) study will assess the mechanisms linking early age-related hearing loss (ARHL) and cognitive impairment. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, single-site, early phase II, superiority trial. SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty participants aged 55 to 75 years with early ARHL (severity defined as borderline to moderate) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment will be included. INTERVENTIONS: Participants will be randomized 1:1 to a best practice hearing intervention or a health education control. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary study outcome is cognition measured by the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study-Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite. Secondary outcomes include additional measures of cognition, social engagement, and brain organization/connectivity. RESULTS: Trial enrollment will begin in early 2024. CONCLUSIONS: After its completion in 2028, the EARHLI trial should offer evidence on the effect of hearing treatment versus a health education control on cognitive performance, social engagement, and brain organization/connectivity in 55- to 75-year-old community-dwelling adults with early ARHL and amnestic mild cognitive impairment.
