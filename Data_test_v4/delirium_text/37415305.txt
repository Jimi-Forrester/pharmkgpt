37415305|t|A novel peptide derived from vascular endothelial growth factor prevents amyloid beta aggregation and toxicity.
37415305|a|Amyloid-beta oligomers (Abetao) are the most pathologically relevant Abeta species in Alzheimer's disease (AD), because they induce early synaptic dysfunction that leads to learning and memory impairments. In contrast, increasing VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) brain levels have been shown to improve learning and memory processes, and to alleviate Abeta-mediated synapse dysfunction. Here, we designed a new peptide, the blocking peptide (BP), which is derived from an Abetao-targeted domain of the VEGF protein, and investigated its effect on Abeta-associated toxicity. Using a combination of biochemical, 3D and ultrastructural imaging, and electrophysiological approaches, we demonstrated that BP strongly interacts with Abetao and blocks Abeta fibrillar aggregation process, leading to the formation of Abeta amorphous aggregates. BP further impedes the formation of structured Abetao and prevents their pathogenic binding to synapses. Importantly, acute BP treatment successfully rescues long-term potentiation (LTP) in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, at an age when LTP is highly impaired in hippocampal slices. Moreover, BP is also able to block the interaction between Abetao and VEGF, which suggests a dual mechanism aimed at both trapping Abetao and releasing VEGF to alleviate Abetao-induced synaptic damage. Our findings provide evidence for a neutralizing effect of the BP on Abeta aggregation process and pathogenic action, highlighting a potential new therapeutic strategy.
