9700657|t|Biological markers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
9700657|a|A diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on biochemical markers in the cerebrospinal fluid can help improve diagnostic accuracy, which currently is approximately 90%, leaving every tenth AD patient undiagnosed or falsely diagnosed as having the disease. From all biochemical abnormalities described in AD patients, those related to the hallmark neuropathologic lesions, deposition of amyloid and formation of paired helical filaments mainly consisting of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein, are the most promising and the best documented, even though other markers bear some potential and remain to be further studied. Determining an increase of tau and a reduction of A beta 42 bears satisfactory, even though not absolute specificity for AD and represents a true aid for clinicians in diagnosing AD during the patients lifetime. It remains open if these markers will be helpful for the most challenging goal, diagnosing AD in the preclinical phase, when, according to morphological data, high amounts of these pathological proteins are already deposited in the brain tissue.
