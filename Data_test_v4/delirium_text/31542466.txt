31542466|a|Exposure to urban ambient particulate matter (PM) is associated with risk of Alzheimer's disease and accelerated cognitive decline in normal aging. Assessment of the neurotoxic effects caused by urban PM is complicated by variations of composition from source, location, and season. We compared several in vitro cell-based assays in relation to their in vivo neurotoxicity for NF-kappaB transcriptional activation, nitric oxide induction, and lipid peroxidation. These studies compared batches of nPM, a nanosized subfraction of PM2.5, extracted as an aqueous suspension, used in prior studies. In vitro activities were compared with in vivo responses of mice chronically exposed to the same batch of nPM. The potency of nPM varied widely between batches for NF-kappaB activation, analyzed with an NF-kappaB reporter in human monocytes. Three independently collected batches of nPM had corresponding differences to responses of mouse cerebral cortex to chronic nPM inhalation, for levels of induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglial activation (Iba1), and soluble Abeta40 & -42 peptides. The in vitro responses of BV2 microglia for NO-production and lipid peroxidation also differed by nPM batch, but did not correlate with in vivo responses. These data confirm that batches of nPM can differ widely in toxicity. The in vitro NF-kappaB reporter assay offers a simple, high throughput screening method to predict the in vivo neurotoxic effects of nPM exposure.
