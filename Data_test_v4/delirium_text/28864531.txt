28864531|a|Caspase-6 is critical to the neurodegenerative pathways of Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases and has been identified as a potential molecular target for treatment of neurodegeneration. Thus, understanding the global and regional changes in dynamics and conformation provides insights into the unique properties of caspase-6 that may contribute to achieving control of its function. In this work, hydrogen/deuterium exchange MS (H/DX-MS) was used to map the local changes in the conformational flexibility of procaspase-6 at the discrete states that reflect the series of cleavage events that ultimately lead to the fully active, substrate-bound state. Intramolecular self-cleavage at Asp-193 evoked higher solvent exposure in the regions of the substrate-binding loops L1, L3, and L4 and in the 130s region, the intersubunit linker region, the 26-32 region as well as in the stabilized loop 2. Additional removal of the linker allowed caspase-6 to gain more flexibility in the 130s region and in the L2 region converting caspase-6 to a competent substrate-binding state. The prodomain region was found to be intrinsically disordered independent of the activation state of caspase-6; however, its complete removal resulted in the protection of the adjacent 26-32 region, suggesting that this region may play a regulatory role. The molecular details of caspase-6 dynamics in solution provide a comprehensive scaffold for strategic design of therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative disorders.
