22053263|a|Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but potentially fatal disease characterized by fever, muscle rigidity, delirium and autonomic instability. Here we report a child, with NMS due to the risperidone misdiagnosed as status epilepticus. Nine year old boy, who had been under high dose risperidone treatment for 8 weeks, admitted to the emergency room because of the contractions (evaluated as status epilepticus) persisting for 7 hours. Since there was neuroleptic treatment in the past medical history and, unconsciousness, muscular rigidity, diaphoresis, hypertermi and, hypotension in physical examination, leucocytosis and elevated creatininphosphokinase levels in laboratory tests, the patient was evaluated as NMS and discharged without any complications. We reported this case to point out that; NMS may be misdiagnosed as status epilepticus in children when EEG monitoring is unavailable. When a child admitted to the emergency room because of suspicious convulsion neuroleptic drug use must surely be asked.
