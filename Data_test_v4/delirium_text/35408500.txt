35408500|t|Untargeted Metabolomics Reveals the Potential Antidepressant Activity of a Novel Adenosine Receptor Antagonist.
35408500|a|Depression is the most common mental illness, affecting approximately 4.4% of the global population. Despite many available treatments, some patients exhibit treatment-resistant depression. Thus, the need to develop new and alternative treatments cannot be overstated. Adenosine receptor antagonists have emerged as a promising new class of antidepressants. The current study investigates a novel dual A1/A2A adenosine receptor antagonist, namely 2-(3,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)-4-methoxy-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-one (1a), for antidepressant capabilities by determining its metabolic profiles and comparing them to those of two reference compounds (imipramine and KW-6002). The metabolic profiles were obtained by treating male Sprague-Dawley rats with 1a and the reference compounds and subjecting them to the forced swim test. Serum and brain material was consequently collected from the animals following euthanasia, after which the metabolites were extracted and analyzed through untargeted metabolomics using both 1H-NMR and GC-TOFMS. The current study provides insight into compound 1a's metabolic profile. The metabolic profile of 1a was similar to those of the reference compounds. They potentially exhibit their antidepressive capabilities via downstream effects on amino acid and lipid metabolism.
