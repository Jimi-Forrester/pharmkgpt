31236307|t|The Current State of Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.
31236307|a|Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Children with PARDS often require intensive care admission and mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately, beyond lung protective ventilation, there are limited data to support our management strategies in PARDS. The Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC) offered a new definition of PARDS in 2015 that has improved our understanding of the true epidemiology and heterogeneity of the disease as well as risk stratification. Further studies will be crucial to determine optimal management for varying disease severity. This review will present the physiologic basis of PARDS, describe the unique pediatric definition and risk stratification, and summarize the current evidence for current standards of care as well as adjunctive therapies.
