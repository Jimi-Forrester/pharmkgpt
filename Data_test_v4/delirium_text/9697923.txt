9697923|a|The alpha1-antichymotrypsin (AACT)-155 allele was found elsewhere to have a significant effect on Alzheimer disease (AD) risk in individuals with at least one APOE-4 allele. We compared AACT genotypes of 284 cases of sporadic AD and 172 controls. The frequency of the AACT-155 allele did not differ significantly between cases and controls, either overall or when restricted to subjects with at least one APOE-4 allele. Logistic regression controlling for age and sex failed to show an effect due to AACT either alone or acting with APOE. There was no evidence of an interaction between APOE-4 and the AACT-155 allele to reduce age at onset. Thus, our data do not support an association of AACT-155 with risk or age at onset in AD.
