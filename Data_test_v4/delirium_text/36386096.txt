36386096|t|Hemostatic and Coagulation Profile in Psoriasis: A Hospital-Based case control Study.
36386096|a|Context: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and atherothrombosis. Aims: This study was conducted to assess the levels of various hemostatic and coagulation parameters in psoriasis and their correlation with disease severity. Settings and Design: This was a hospital-based observational study. Methods and Material: Seventy-five patients with psoriasis and seventy controls were included in the study. History taking, clinical examination, and calculation of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) were done. Blood analysis for Platelet count (PC), mean platelet volume (MPV), Vitamin B12, Thrombin Time (TT), Prothrombin time (PT) and Activated partial thromboplastin time (APPT) were done in both groups. Results: MPV which is a marker of inflammation and platelet activation was significantly increased in cases and positively correlated with the disease severity. Vitamin B12 is an important cofactor in homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism and correlates inversely with serum Hcy which is a known atherothrombotic marker. Vitamin B12 levels were significantly decreased in the cases with a significant negative correlation between Vitamin B12 level and PASI. There was also a significant decrease in serum level of PT, aPTT and TT in cases as compared to controls; however they showed no significant correlation with PASI. Conclusions: Inflammation in psoriasis may drive the process of abnormal platelet activation and coagulation abnormalities thus predisposing psoriatic patients to an atherothrombotic state and increasing the cardiovascular risk in psoriatic patients.
