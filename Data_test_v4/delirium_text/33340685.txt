33340685|t|Structural imaging outcomes in subjective cognitive decline: Community vs. clinical-based samples.
33340685|a|Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has been proposed as a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuroimaging studies have suggested early AD-like structural brain alterations in SCD subjects compared to healthy controls. However, there is substantial heterogeneity in the results, which might depend on whether SCD samples were drawn from the community or from memory clinics. Here we reviewed brain atrophy, assessed through structural magnetic resonance imaging, separately for SCD-community and clinic-based samples. SCD-community samples show a more consistent pattern of atrophy, involving the hippocampus and temporal and parietal cortices. Similarly, in SCD-clinic samples the temporo-parietal cortex showed early vulnerability, however these studies reported a more heterogeneous atrophy pattern. Overall, these studies suggest both commonalities and differences in brain atrophy patterns between SCD clinical and community samples. In SCD-community, the temporal cortex is involved, while SCD-clinical exhibited a more complex pattern of atrophy, which may be related to a more heterogeneous sample reporting neuropsychiatric symptoms along with preclinical AD.
