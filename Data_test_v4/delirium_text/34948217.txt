34948217|a|Axonal and neuronal pathologies are a central constituent of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), induced by the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55 peptide. In this study, we investigated neurodegenerative manifestations in chronic MOG 35-55 induced EAE and the effect of glatiramer acetate (GA) treatment on these manifestations. We report that the neuronal loss seen in this model is not attributed to apoptotic neuronal cell death. In EAE-affected mice, axonal damage prevails from the early disease phase, as revealed by analysis of neurofilament light (NFL) leakage into the sera along the disease duration, as well as by immunohistological examination. Elevation of interstitial glutamate concentrations measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) implies that glutamate excess plays a role in the damage processes inflicted by this disease. GA applied as a therapeutic regimen to mice with apparent clinical symptoms significantly reduces the pathological manifestations, namely apoptotic cell death, NFL leakage, histological tissue damage, and glutamate excess, thus corroborating the neuroprotective consequences of this treatment.
