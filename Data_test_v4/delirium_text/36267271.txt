36267271|a|Background: Adverse drug reaction (ADR) signal mining is essential for assessing drug safety. However, the currently available methods for this are rather cumbersome. Objective: We aimed to develop a drug risk analysis and assessment system using Java language and conduct pharmacovigilance data mining for fluoroquinolones at our hospital. Methods: We used ADR data reported by Shandong Provincial Third Hospital between July 2007 and August 2021. The signal detection methods included proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The BCPNN method was used as the reference standard for comparing the remaining three signal detection methods based on sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and Jorden index. Results: The hospital database contained a total of 2,621 ADR reports, among which 263 were attributed to fluoroquinolones. There were 391 fluoroquinolone-ADR pairs. Using the PRR, ROR, MHRA, and BCPNN method, we detected 13 signals, 13 signals, 10 signals, and 11 weak signals, respectively. After signal detection, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin were shown to induce high risk signals for mental and sleep disorders, with the signal intensity of moxifloxacin being the most significant. Compared with BCPNN, the PRR and ROR methods showed better sensitivity, whereas the MHRA method showed better specificity. Conclusion: We developed a drug risk analysis and assessment system that can help hospitals and other medical institutions to detect and analyse ADR signals in the self-reporting system database, and thus improve drug safety. Further, it indicates that the central nervous system damage caused by fluoroquinolones should be monitored closely, and thus provides a reference for the clinical application of these drugs.
