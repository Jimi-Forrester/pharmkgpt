32082114|t|An Informant-Based Simple Questionnaire for Visuospatial Dysfunction Assessment in Dementia.
32082114|a|OBJECTIVES: Visuospatial dysfunction (VSD) is one of the most important symptoms for the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The aim of this study was to validate a novel VSD questionnaire and determine the cutoff score for the screening for VSD in DLB. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of data from a project of the History-based Artificial Intelligent Clinical Dementia Diagnostic System (HAICDDS). VSD of non-demented control (NDC), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and DLB participants were analyzed and compared using the visuospatial questionnaire in the HAICDDS (HAI-VSQ), the Draw subscale in the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI-Draw), and the visuospatial subscale in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-VS). RESULTS: A total of 440 individuals were studied, including 154 NDC, 229 AD, and 57 DLB participants. Compared to NDC or AD participants, DLB participants showed a higher total score on HAI-VSQ after adjustment for age. Using HAI-VSQ, a cutoff score >= 2 was useful for the screening for VSD in DLB with a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.94. Compared with CASI-Draw or MoCA-VS, HAI-VSQ was least influenced by gender, age, and education and had the highest correlation with the sum of boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. After adjustment for age, education, gender, and global cognitive function, HAI-VSQ significantly discriminated DLB from AD and NDC whereas MoCA-VS or CASI-Draw did not. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the newly designed simple questionnaire was a practical screening tool for VSD in DLB that can be applied in clinical practice as well as on a registration platform.
