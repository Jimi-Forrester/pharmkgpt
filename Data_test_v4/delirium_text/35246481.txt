35246481|a|AMPA-type gultamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate excitatory signaling in the brain and are therapeutic targets for the treatment of diverse neurological disorders. The receptors interact with a variety of auxiliary subunits, including the transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). The TARPs influence AMPAR biosynthesis and trafficking and enhance receptor responses by slowing desensitization and deactivation and increasing single-channel conductance. TARP gamma8 has an expression pattern that is distinct from that of other TARPs, being enriched in the hippocampus. Recently, several compounds have been identified that selectivity inhibit gamma8-containing AMPARs. One such inhibitor, JNJ-55511118, has shown considerable promise for the treatment of epilepsy. However, key details of its mechanism of action are still lacking. Here, using patch-clamp electrophysiological recording from heterologously expressed AMPARs, we show that JNJ-55511118 inhibits peak currents of gamma8-containing AMPARs by decreasing their single-channel conductance. The drug also modifies hallmark features of AMPAR pharmacology, including the TARP-dependent actions of intracellular polyamines and the partial agonist kainate. Moreover, we find that JNJ-55511118 reduces the influence of gamma8 on all biophysical measures, aside from its effect on the recovery from desensitization. The drug is also effective when applied intracellularly, suggesting it may access its binding site from within the membrane. Additionally, we find that AMPARs incorporating TARP gamma2 mutated to contain the JNJ-55511118 binding site, exhibit greater block than seen with AMPARs containing gamma8, potentially reflecting differences in TARP stoichiometry. Taken together, our data provide new insight into the mechanism by which gamma8-selective drugs inhibit AMPARs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Although modulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors shows promise for the treatment various neurological conditions, the absence of subtype-selective drugs has hindered adoption of this therapeutic strategy. We made patch-clamp recordings to characterize the actions of the gamma8-selective AMPAR inhibitor JNJ-55511118 on GluA2(Q) receptors expressed in HEK cells. We report that JNJ-55511118 inhibits AMPAR-mediated currents by reducing single-channel conductance, providing clear insight into the mechanism of action of this important class of AMPAR modulators.
