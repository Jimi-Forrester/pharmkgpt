31297437|t|A 24-week double-blind placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of the AMPA modulator S47445 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and depressive symptoms.
31297437|a|INTRODUCTION: S47445 is a novel positive allosteric modulator of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid receptors that may emerge as a favorable candidate for the symptomatic treatment of cognitive and depressive disorders in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) of mild to moderate severity and with depressive symptoms. METHODS: For this double-blind, placebo-controlled 24-week phase II trial, 520 outpatients aged between 55 and 85 years, with probable AD at mild to moderate stages (a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 24-15 inclusive) and exhibiting depressive symptoms (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia [CSDD] >= 8) were recruited in twelve countries and randomized to 3 doses of S47445 (5-15-50 mg) or placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) total score at week 24. Secondary measures included the Disability Assessment for Dementia, Mini-Mental State Examination, ADAS-Cog 13-item, CSDD, Clinical Global Impression of Change (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-CGIC), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and safety criteria. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were comparable between the 4 groups. After 24 weeks, no statistically significant treatment difference was demonstrated between S47445 (5, 15 or 50 mg/d) and placebo on cognition (ADAS-Cog), function (Disability Assessment for Dementia), or depressive symptoms (CSDD). An improvement on neuropsychiatric symptoms assessed by NPI was evidenced at the lower dose 5 mg/d (Delta -2.55, P = .023, post hoc analysis) compared to placebo. CSDD and total NPI scores improved in all groups including placebo. There were no specific and/or unexpected safety signals observed with any of the S47445 doses. DISCUSSION: S47445 administered for 24 weeks was safe and well tolerated by patients with mild to moderate AD; the compound did not show significant benefits over placebo on cognition, function, or depressive symptoms.
