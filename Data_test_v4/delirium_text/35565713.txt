35565713|t|Nationwide Prevalence and Outcomes of Long-Term Nasogastric Tube Placement in Adults.
35565713|a|Tube feeding (TF) is commonly used for patients with severe swallowing disturbance, and patients with chronic dysphagia are often provided with a long-term nasogastric tube (NGT). However, nationwide epidemiological data on long-term NGT placement are limited. The present study identified the prevalence and outcomes of patients with long-term NGT placement in Taiwan. Data were obtained from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. Patients with NGT placement for more than 3 months between 2000 and 2012 were enrolled in this cohort study. An NGT cohort of 2754 patients was compared with 11,016 controls matched for age, sex, residential area, and comorbidities. The prevalence rate of long-term NGT reached 0.063% in 2005 and then remained stable at 0.05-0.06%. The major causes of NGT placement were stroke (44%), cancer (16%), head injury (14%), and dementia (12%). Men (63%) were more likely to have long-term NGT placement than women (37%). The adjusted hazard ratios were 28.1 (95% CI = 26.0, 30.3) for acute and chronic respiratory infections; 26.8 (95% CI = 24.1, 29.8) for pneumonia, 8.84 (95% CI = 7.87, 9.93) for diseases of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum; and 7.5 (95% CI = 14.7, 20.8) for mortality. Patients with NGT placement for more than 6 months had a higher odds ratio (1.58, 95% CI = 1.13, 2.20) of pneumonia than those with NGT placement for less than 6 months. Only 13% and 0.62% of the patients underwent rehabilitation therapy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, respectively. Long-term NGT use was associated with a higher risk of comorbidities and mortality. Stroke was the main illness contributing to long-term NGT use. Further interventions are necessary to improve the negative effects of long-term TF.
