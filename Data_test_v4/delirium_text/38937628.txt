38937628|t|Recruitment of Ahsa1 to Hsp90 is regulated by a conserved peptide that inhibits ATPase stimulation.
38937628|a|Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that acts on its clients through an ATP-dependent and conformationally dynamic functional cycle. The cochaperone Accelerator of Hsp90 ATPase, or Ahsa1, is the most potent stimulator of Hsp90 ATPase activity. Ahsa1 stimulates the rate of Hsp90 ATPase activity through a conserved motif, NxNNWHW. Metazoan Ahsa1, but not yeast, possesses an additional 20 amino acid peptide preceding the NxNNWHW motif that we have called the intrinsic chaperone domain (ICD). The ICD of Ahsa1 diminishes Hsp90 ATPase stimulation by interfering with the function of the NxNNWHW motif. Furthermore, the NxNNWHW modulates Hsp90's apparent affinity to Ahsa1 and ATP. Lastly, the ICD controls the regulated recruitment of Hsp90 in cells and its deletion results in the loss of interaction with Hsp90 and the glucocorticoid receptor. This work provides clues to how Ahsa1 conserved regions modulate Hsp90 kinetics and how they may be coupled to client folding status.
