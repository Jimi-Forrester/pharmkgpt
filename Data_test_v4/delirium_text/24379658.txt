24379658|t|Outcome after osteosynthesis of hip fractures in nonagenarians.
24379658|a|BACKGROUND: Hip fractures in the elderly population are associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, there is still a lack of information on mortality and loss of independence in extremely elderly people with a hip fracture. OBJECTIVE: To study functional outcomes and mortality after osteosynthesis of hip fractures in very old patients in our clinic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Hospital charts of all patients over 90 years old who were operated for a hip fracture between January 2007 and December 2011 were reviewed. Outcome measures were mortality, preoperative and postoperative mobility, and loss of independence. RESULTS: A total of 149 patients were included; 132 (89%) women, median age 93.5+-2.45 years. Thirty-six (24%) patients were classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade 2, 104 (70%) as ASA grade 3, and nine (6%) as ASA grade 4. The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score was 2 or less in 115 (77%) patients and 34 (23%) patients scored 3 or more points. Short-term survival was 91% and 77% at 30 days and 3 months, respectively. Long-term survival was 64%, 42%, and 18% at 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery, respectively. Survival was significantly better in patients with lower ASA scores (P=0.005). No significant difference in survival was measured between patients according to CCI score (P=0.13). Fifty-one percent of patients had to be accommodated in an institution with more care following treatment, and 57% were less mobile after osteosynthesis of a hip fracture. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that short-term mortality rates in very elderly patients with a hip fracture are high and there is no clear predictive value for mortality. ASA classification is the best predictive value for overall mortality. A large proportion of these patients lost their independence after osteosynthesis of a hip fracture.
