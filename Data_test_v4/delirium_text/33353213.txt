33353213|t|Nanobodies as Versatile Tool for Multiscale Imaging Modalities.
33353213|a|Molecular imaging is constantly growing in different areas of preclinical biomedical research. Several imaging methods have been developed and are continuously updated for both in vivo and in vitro applications, in order to increase the information about the structure, localization and function of molecules involved in physiology and disease. Along with these progresses, there is a continuous need for improving labeling strategies. In the last decades, the single domain antigen-binding fragments nanobodies (Nbs) emerged as important molecular imaging probes. Indeed, their small size (~15 kDa), high stability, affinity and modularity represent desirable features for imaging applications, providing higher tissue penetration, rapid targeting, increased spatial resolution and fast clearance. Accordingly, several Nb-based probes have been generated and applied to a variety of imaging modalities, ranging from in vivo and in vitro preclinical imaging to super-resolution microscopy. In this review, we will provide an overview of the state-of-the-art regarding the use of Nbs in several imaging modalities, underlining their extreme versatility and their enormous potential in targeting molecules and cells of interest in both preclinical and clinical studies.
