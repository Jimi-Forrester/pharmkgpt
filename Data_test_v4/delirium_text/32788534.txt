32788534|t|Dementia with Lewy Bodies with Pure Agraphia for Kanji (Japanese Morphograms).
32788534|a|A 70-year-old dextral woman was admitted to a hospital with agraphia for kanji (Japanese morphograms). She had a history of severe constipation, nightmares, and visual hallucinations. Neurological examinations revealed no obvious Parkinson's disease symptoms. She showed poor skills in writing the kanji for looking at picture objects, [e.g., writing the Japanese word "inu" (which means dog) when she saw a drawing of a dog] or dictated words. A reduced striatal uptake of [123I]-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl) nortropane (FP-CIT) on single-photon-emission computed tomography and reduced meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) cardiac uptake on myocardial scintigraphy were detected. The accumulation of amyloid beta in the bilateral cerebral cortices was observed on amyloid-positron emission tomography. We herein report a case of Lewy body dementia with pure agraphia for kanji with underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology.
