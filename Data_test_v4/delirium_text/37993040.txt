37993040|t|Trends in Cardiovascular Mortality Among Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease in the United States, 1999-2020.
37993040|a|This study aimed to compare the trends in cardiovascular diseases (CVD)-related mortality in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and in the general population aged 65 and above. Data from the CDC WONDER Multiple Cause of Death dataset was used to determine national trends in age-adjusted CVD-mortality rates (AAMR) and average annual percent change (AAPC) values in patients with AD and the overall population aged 65 and over from 1999 to 2020. Data for AAMR and AAPCs were also stratified by age, sex, ethnicity/race, geographical region, urbanization status, subgroups of CVD. Trends in the overall age-adjusted CVD-mortality rates and the overall age-adjusted CVD-mortality rates stratified by sex, age, ethnicity/race, geographical region, urbanization status, and CVD subgroups were statistically different between AD patients and the overall population (overall AAPC for CVD-mortality rate in AD patients = - 3.5% [CI, -4.1 to -2.9%] vs. - 2.6% [CI, -2.3 to -2.9%] in overall population, p = 0.01). Differences in the decrease in the mortality rates between patients with AD and the overall population were found to be statistically different across all stratifications except for the change in the mortality rates for hypertensive diseases (p = 0.05), females (p = 0.2), and Asian or Pacific Islanders (p = 0.09). In conclusion, CVD-related mortality in patients with AD decreased over the last two decades and decreases were more prominent than seen in the general population aged 65 and over. These results may help focus public health efforts to optimize CVD health in patients with AD.
