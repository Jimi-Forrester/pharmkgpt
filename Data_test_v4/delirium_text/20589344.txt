20589344|a|Delirium represents a symptom of a thought disorder in which a belief is strongly held in spite of invalidating evidence. Many varieties of delirium have been described and this symptom is common in psychotic disorders (schizophrenia, brief psychotic disorder, chronic delusional disorders, etc.), affective disorders (major depressive disorder, psychotic depression, melancholic depression, bipolar disorder, etc.), organic illnesses and psychotropic substance abuse. Delirium has been deeply studied by psychopathology. Our work offers an overview of the most relevant psychopathological descriptions of delirium in the last century, from Jaspers to Kapur.
