37958889|a|Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a highly malignant neoplasm, is classified as one of the most severe and devastating types of cancer. PDAC is a notable malignancy that exhibits a discouraging prognosis and a rising occurrence. The interplay between diabetes and pancreatic cancer exhibits a reciprocal causation. The identified metabolic disorder has been observed to possess noteworthy consequences on health outcomes, resulting in elevated rates of morbidity. The principal mechanisms involve the suppression of the immune system, the activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), and the onset of systemic metabolic disease caused by dysfunction of the islets. From this point forward, it is important to recognize that pancreatic-cancer-related diabetes (PCRD) has the ability to increase the likelihood of developing pancreatic cancer. This highlights the complex relationship that exists between these two physiological states. Therefore, we investigated into the complex domain of PSCs, elucidating their intricate signaling pathways and the profound influence of chemokines on their behavior and final outcome. In order to surmount the obstacle of drug resistance and eliminate PDAC, researchers have undertaken extensive efforts to explore and cultivate novel natural compounds of the next generation. Additional investigation is necessary in order to comprehensively comprehend the effect of PCRD-mediated apoptosis on the progression and onset of PDAC through the utilization of natural compounds. This study aims to examine the potential anticancer properties of natural compounds in individuals with diabetes who are undergoing chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. It is anticipated that these compounds will exhibit increased potency and possess enhanced pharmacological benefits. According to our research findings, it is indicated that naturally derived chemical compounds hold potential in the development of PDAC therapies that are both safe and efficacious.
