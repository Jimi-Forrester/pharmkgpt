38868407|t|Comparative efficacy and safety of suvorexant and lemborexant for insomnia treatment.
38868407|a|Aim: Although suvorexant and lemborexant, which have orexin receptor antagonist activity, are used as sleep medications in Japan, no report has directly compared their efficacy and safety. This study compared the efficacy and safety of the drugs. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients who presented to the Outpatient Department of Psychiatry at Tottori University Hospital between December 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. Information was obtained from 108 patients who were newly treated with suvorexant or lemborexant. Data were analyzed after excluding one case of discontinuation due to a post-administration allergic reaction. Improvement in sleep status after administration was assessed retrospectively from medical records by using the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale, which is a subscale of the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Scale. The incidence of side-effects was obtained from the medical records of the patient's first visit after administration. Results: There was no significant difference between the CGI-I scores in the suvorexant (mean [SD], 3.05 [0.93]) and lemborexant groups (mean [SD], 3.38 [0.83]) (p = 0.10). The incidence of side-effects with continued treatment was not significantly different between the suvorexant group (12.5%) and the lemborexant group (2.9%) (p = 0.10). Patients who switched from suvorexant to lemborexant had CGI-I scores <=4, and no side-effects were observed after switching to lemborexant. Conclusion: There was no difference in effectiveness between suvorexant and lemborexant. However, lemborexant might cause side-effects less frequently than suvorexant, at least in the early stages of treatment.
