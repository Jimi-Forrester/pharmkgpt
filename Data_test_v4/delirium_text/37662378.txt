37662378|a|Background: In 2021, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) launched the National Hypertension Control Initiative (HTN Initiative) with the goal to enhance HTN control through Bluetooth-enabled self-measured blood pressure (BT SMBP) monitoring and use this data to inform clinical decisions in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) with large proportion of their population with uncontrolled BP. We sought to understand the experience of Michigan-based FQHCs in implementing the HTN initiative. Methods: Staff from three Michigan-based FQHCs were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews from September to November 2022. Interviews were conducted in-person and were based on the Tailored Implementation of Chronic Diseases framework. Content analysis was performed by three coders. Results: Ten staff participated in interviews (FQHC 1: n=6, FQHC 2: n=1, FQHC 3: n=3). The FQHCs differed in their stage of implementation and their approach. FQHC 1 created a large-scale, community health worker driven program, FQHC 2 created a small-scale, short term, BP device loan program, and FQHC 3 created a primarily outsourced, large-scale program through a contracted partner. Positive staff attitudes and outcome expectations, previous experience with SMBP grants, and supportive clinic leadership were identified as facilitators to implementation; Patients high social needs, SMBP-related Technology, and insufficient workforce and staff capacity were identified as barriers. Conclusion: BT SMBP among FQHC patients is promising but challenges in integrating SMBP data into clinic workflow, workforce capacity to support the high social needs of participants and to assist in reacting to the more frequent BP data remain to be overcome.
