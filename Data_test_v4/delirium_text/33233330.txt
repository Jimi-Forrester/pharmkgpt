33233330|t|Adherence to Beers Criteria in Geriatrics: A Retrospective Study in a Saudi Teaching Hospital.
33233330|a|BACKGROUND: The aging process makes geriatric populations more prone to various chronic diseases. Such diseases require older patients to be on more medications than any other age group and make them more susceptible to adverse drug events related to potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). AIM: To identify the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications among older people and explore the most commonly prescribed PIMs in hospitalized patients. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective study conducted in a large tertiary hospital among patients hospitalized in a 4 year period from January 2015 to December 2018. METHODS: The 2019 Beers Criteria were used to assess PIMs in all inpatient prescribed medications focusing on the first class (i.e., drug/drug class to be avoided in older adults). RESULTS: The mean age was 75.17 +- 7.66 years. A total of 684 (80.6%) patients were prescribed at least one medication listed in the first-class category of the 2019 Beers Criteria. Top five drugs were proton pump inhibitors (40.3%), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (10.2%), metoclopramide (9.3%), benzodiazepines (8.4%), and insulin (5.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PIMs is high among older patients admitted to the hospital. More efforts are needed to investigate the potential reasons and develop action plans to improve concordance to Beers Criteria among healthcare providers.
