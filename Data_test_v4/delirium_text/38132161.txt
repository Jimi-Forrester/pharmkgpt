38132161|t|Signaling Pathways Involved in Manganese-Induced Neurotoxicity.
38132161|a|Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element, but insufficient or excessive bodily amounts can induce neurotoxicity. Mn can directly increase neuronal insulin and activate insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptors. As an important cofactor, Mn regulates signaling pathways involved in various enzymes. The IGF signaling pathway plays a protective role in the neurotoxicity of Mn, reducing apoptosis in neurons and motor deficits by regulating its downstream protein kinase B (Akt), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In recent years, some new mechanisms related to neuroinflammation have been shown to also play an important role in Mn-induced neurotoxicity. For example, DNA-sensing receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cCAS) and its downstream signal efficient interferon gene stimulator (STING), NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3(NLRP3)-pro-caspase1, cleaves to the active form capase1 (CASP1), nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), sirtuin (SIRT), and Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducers and activators of the transcription (STAT) signaling pathway. Moreover, autophagy, as an important downstream protein degradation pathway, determines the fate of neurons and is regulated by these upstream signals. Interestingly, the role of autophagy in Mn-induced neurotoxicity is bidirectional. This review summarizes the molecular signaling pathways of Mn-induced neurotoxicity, providing insight for further understanding of the mechanisms of Mn.
