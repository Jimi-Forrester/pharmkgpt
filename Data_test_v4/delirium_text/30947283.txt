30947283|a|Recent studies showed that physical and/or neuropsychiatric impairments significantly affect long-term mortality of ICU survivors. We conducted this study to investigate that simplified measurement of physical function and level of consciousness at hospital discharge by attending nurses could predict long-term outcomes after hospital discharge. A retrospective analysis of prospectively and retrospectively collected data of 246 patients who received medical ICU treatment was conducted. We grouped patients according to physical function and level of consciousness measured by the simplified method at hospital discharge as follow; group A included patients with alert mental and capable of walking or moving by wheel chairs; group B included those with alert mental and bed-ridden status; and Group C included those with confused mental and bed-ridden status. The two-year survival rate after hospital discharge was compared. Of 246 patients, 157 patients were included in the analysis and there were 103 survivors after two-year follow up. Compared to non-survivors, survivors were more likely to be younger (P = 0.026) and have higher body mass index (P = 0.019) and no malignant disease (P = 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in treatment modalities including medication, use of medical devices, and physical therapy between the survivors and non-survivors. The analysis showed significant differences in survival between the groups classified by physical function (P < 0.001) and level of consciousness (P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that survival rate was significantly lower among the patients in group C than in those in group B or group A (P < 0.001). Simplified method to assess physical function and level of consciousness at hospital discharge can predict long-term outcomes of medical ICU survivors.
