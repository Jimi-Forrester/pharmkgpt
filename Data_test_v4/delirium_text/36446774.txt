36446774|t|The APOE locus is linked to decline in general cognitive function: 20-years follow-up in the Doetinchem Cohort Study.
36446774|a|Cognitive decline is part of the normal aging process. However, some people experience a more rapid decline than others due to environmental and genetic factors. Numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been linked to cognitive function, but only a few to cognitive decline. To understand whether cognitive function and cognitive decline are driven by the same mechanisms, we investigated whether 433 SNPs previously linked to cognitive function and 2 SNPs previously linked to cognitive decline are associated with both general cognitive functioning at baseline and general cognitive decline up to 20-years follow-up in the Doetinchem Cohort Study (DCS). The DCS is a longitudinal population-based study that enrolled men and women aged 20-59 years between 1987-1991, with follow-up examinations every 5 years. We used data of rounds 2-6 (1993-2017, n = 2559). General cognitive function was assessed using four cognition tests measuring memory, speed, fluency and flexibility. With these test scores, standardized residuals (adjusted for sex, age and examination round) were calculated for each cognition test at each round and subsequently combined into one general cognitive function measure using principal component analyses. None of the 435 previously identified variants were associated with baseline general cognitive function in the DCS. But rs429358-C, a coding apolipoprotein E (APOE) SNP and one of the variants previously associated with cognitive decline, was associated with general cognitive decline in our study as well (p-value = 1 x 10-5, Beta = -0.013). These findings suggest that decline of general cognitive function is influenced by other mechanisms than those that are involved in the regulation of general cognitive function.
