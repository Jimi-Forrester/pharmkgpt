31417028|t|'Obesageing': Linking obesity & ageing.
31417028|a|Obesity is one of the leading causes of preventable mortalities in many parts of the globe. The rise in geriatric population due to better treatment opportunities has also emerged as a major public health challenge. Both of these health challenges have impacted developed as well as developing countries. Obesity is attributed as a powerful risk factor of a variety of health problems such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dementia, neuropsychiatric diseases and many more. On the other hand, ageing is a natural process involving a gradual decline in physiological functions and is associated with similar co-morbidities as obesity. This review discusses about the commonalities (termed as 'Obesageing') between the pathological phenomenon of obesity and normal physiological process of ageing. A unique rodent model of obesageing has been developed (WNIN/Ob) that has characteristics of morbid obesity as well as premature ageing. Such a novel animal model would facilitate the understanding of the complex interplay of different mechanisms that are common to obesity and ageing and help to devise strategies in future to tackle the growing burden of obesity and ageing.
