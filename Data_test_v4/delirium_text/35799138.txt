35799138|a|BACKGROUND: The use of oxaliplatin in digestive tract cancers could induce severe peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) decreasing the quality of life of patients and survivors. There is currently, no univocal treatment for these peripheral neuropathies. Donepezil, a reversible inhibitor of cholinesterase, used to treat Alzheimer's disease and dementia, is reported to have a good safety profile in humans, and preclinical data have provided initial evidence of its effectiveness in diminishing neuropathic symptoms and related comorbidities in OIPN animal models. METHODS: The DONEPEZOX trial will be a proof-of-concept, randomised, triple-blinded, and multicentre study. It will be the first clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of donepezil for the management of OIPN. Adult cancer survivors with OIPN that report sensory neuropathy according to QLQ-CIPN20 sensory score (equivalence of a grade >= 2), at least 6 months after the end of an oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy will be included. Eighty patients will be randomly assigned to receive either donepezil or placebo over 16 weeks of treatment. The primary endpoint will be the rate of responders (neuropathic grade decreases according to the QLQ-CIPN20 sensory score) in the donepezil arm. The severity of OIPN will be assessed by the QLQ-CIPN20 sensory scale before and after 16 weeks of treatment. The comparison versus the placebo arm will be a secondary objective. The other secondary endpoints will be tolerance to donepezil, the severity and features of OIPN in each arm before and after treatment, related-comorbidities and quality of life. Fleming's one-stage design will be used for sample size estimation. This design yields a type I error rate of 0.0417 and power of 91% for a responder rate of at least 30% in donepezil arm. A total of 80 randomized patients is planned. DISCUSSION: This study will allow, in the case of positive results, to initiate a phase 3 randomized and placebo-controlled (primary endpoint) clinical study to assess the therapeutic interest of donepezil to treat OIPN.
