35122250|a|Phyllanthus emblica L. pomace is a waste residue obtained following juicing that contains many polyphenols. In this study, NKA-II resin was selected as the optimal macroporous resin for separation and employed to separate the crude polyphenol extract of P. emblica pomace. The separation conditions were optimized, and the polyphenol content, polyphenol components, antioxidant activity, and potential anti-Alzheimer's effects of the extract were measured before and after purification. Results showed that the polyphenol content of the purified extract was 656.85 mg/g, which was 2.1 times higher than that of the nonpurified form. Further, the polyphenol components of the pomace, which was like that of the fruit, did not vary after purification. The antioxidant activity of the purified extract was also significantly improved. Moreover, purified extract significantly reduced the paralysis rate of the transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model of Alzheimer's disease, and the mechanism was related to maintenance of redox homeostasis. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The polyphenol content and antioxidant activity of purified polyphenol from Phyllanthus emblica L. pomace extracts were significantly improved using optimal separation methods with NKA-II macroporous resin and 70% aqueous ethanol as the eluent in this study. Moreover, purified polyphenols showed potential effects in alleviating Alzheimer's disease. These results suggest that polyphenols separated from P. emblica pomace are valuable for further research and development, and the utilization rate of P. emblica fruit is improved due to the further development of P. emblica pomace.
