36571847|a|Aggregated alpha-synuclein, a major constituent of Lewy bodies plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of alpha-synucleinopathies (SPs) such as Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is affected by the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, and recently both active and passive immunotherapies targeted against alpha-synuclein are being trialed as potential novel treatment strategies. Specifically, dendritic cell-based vaccines have shown to be an effective treatment for SPs in animal models. Here, we report on the development of adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) for SP and demonstrate that adoptive transfer of pre-activated T-cells generated from immunized mice can improve survival and behavior, reduce brain microstructural impairment via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and decrease alpha-synuclein pathology burden in a peripherally induced preclinical SP model (M83) when administered prior to disease onset. This study provides preclinical evidence for ACT as a potential immunotherapy for LBD, PD and other related SPs, and future work will provide necessary understanding of the mechanisms of its action.
