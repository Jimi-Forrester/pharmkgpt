31825347|a|AIM: To assess the effect of the modified infusion therapy regimen on the frequency of development of laboratory and clinical manifestations of fat embolism syndrome in patients after hip replacement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted in 80 patients (70 men and 10 women) who were admitted for planned revision hip arthroplasty. The criteria for not inclusion in the study were the presence of a traumatic brain injury, episodes of acute disturbance of blood supply (stroke) and diabetes mellitus in history. 40 patients of the main group during the operation were administered Gelofuzin and Sterofundin isotonic, and in the first day after the operation Remaxol and Sterofundin isotonic. Using the copy-steam method, a control group (n=40) out of 197 patients was selected by gender and age. In the control group, infusion therapy was carried out using a 0.9% NaCl solution. All patients underwent assessment of fat globulemia, water-electrolyte balance, acid-base status and oxygenation index - before surgery; 2, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the operation, on the third day, mental disorders were assessed using the Addenburg scale (ACE-R) for evaluating cognitive functions. RESULTS: All patients underwent hip joint endoprosthetics. In the group receiving the modified infusion therapy regimen, the results were significantly better, there were no statistically significant changes in the level of electrolytes (p=0.14), episodes of a decrease in the oxygenation index and cognitive dysfunction. In contrast to patients in the control group, where the level of chlorine and sodium was significantly higher, the number of fat globules with a diameter of more than 8 mum, as well as in two patients, the development of postoperative delirium with a decrease in the oxygenation index below 300 was observed. The causal relationship between the number of fat globules with a diameter of more than 8 microns and clinical manifestations of cerebral and pulmonary forms of fat embolism (r-Pirsen = -0.87 and -0.80, respectively). There were no statistically significant changes in platelet count, potassium concentration with indicators of fat globulemia and a scale of cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: A high correlation of fatty globulemia with the development of respiratory and pulmonary dysfunction after hip replacement was determined. The inclusion of Gelofuzin, Sterofundin isotonic and Remaxol in intensive therapy provides a pronounced emulsifying effect on fat globules appearing in the bloodstream in the first hours after hip replacement, and effective prevention of potentially dangerous fat embolism.
