33472143|a|BACKGROUND: Greater brain atrophy is associated with disability progression (DP) in patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). However, methodological challenges limit its routine clinical use. OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of atrophy measures as markers of DP in PwMS scanned across different MRI field strengths. METHODS: A total of 980 PwMS were scanned on either 1.5 T or 3.0 T MRI scanners. Demographic and clinical data were retrospectively collected, and the presence of DP was determined according to standard clinical trial criteria. Lateral ventricular volume (LVV) change was measured with the NeuroSTREAM technique on clinical routine T2-FLAIR images. Percent brain volume change (PBVC) was measured using SIENA and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (vCSF) % change was measured using VIENA and SIENAX algorithms on 3D T1-weighted images (WI). Stable vs. DP PwMS were compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Mixed modeling determined the effect of MRI scanner change on MRI-derived atrophy measures. RESULTS: Longitudinal LVV analysis was successful in all PwMS. SIENA-based PBVC and VIENA-based changes failed in 37.6% of cases, while SIENAX-based vCSF failed in 12.9% of cases. PwMS with DP (n = 241) had significantly greater absolute (20.9% vs. 8.7%, d = 0.66, p < 0.001) and annualized LVV % change (4.1% vs. 2.3%, d = 0.27, p < 0.001) when compared to stable PwMS (n = 739). In subjects with both analyses available, both 3D-T1 and T2-FLAIR-based analyses differentiated PwMS with DP (n = 149). However, only NeuroSTREAM and VIENA-based LVV/vCSF were able to show greater atrophy in PwMS that were scanned on different scanners. PBVC and SIENAX-based vCSF % changes were significantly affected by scanner change (Beta = -0.16, t-statistics = -2.133, p = 0.033 and Beta = -2.08, t-statistics = -4.084, p < 0.001), whereas no MRI scanner change effects on NeuroSTREAM-based PLVVC and VIENA-based vCSF % change were noted. CONCLUSIONS: LVV-based atrophy on T2-FLAIR is a clinically relevant measure in spite of MRI scanner changes and mild disability levels.
