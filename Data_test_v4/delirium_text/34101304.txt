Since the effectiveness of anti-dementia drugs for AD on SNAP is unknown, it is important to distinguish between patients with SNAP and AD. We aimed to compare decreases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, and parietal lobe critical to AD between SNAP and AD groups using the easy Z-score imaging system in single-photon emission computed tomography (eZIS-SPECT). METHODS: We retrospectively analysed eZIS-SPECT data of 13 SNAP and 24 AD patients. The three indicators (severity, extent, and ratio) that distinguished AD patients from healthy controls in previous studies were automatically calculated and were compared between the SNAP and AD groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the three indicators of eZIS in discriminating between the two groups. RESULTS: The mean values of severity, extent, and ratio were significantly lower in the SNAP group than in the AD group (P = 0.024, P = 0.044, and P = 0.045, respectively). The AUC values for severity, extent, and ratio were 0.668, 0.683, and 0.692, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that SNAP shows milder reduction of rCBF in the PCC, precuneus, and parietal lobe as compared to AD. However, it may be difficult to distinguish between SNAP and AD with the degrees of decrease in rCBF in these regions.
