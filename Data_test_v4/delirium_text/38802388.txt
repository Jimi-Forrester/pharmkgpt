38802388|t|Balance function in critical illness survivors and evaluation of psychometric properties of the Mini-BESTest.
38802388|a|Critical illness survivors commonly face impairments, such as intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) which is characterized by muscle weakness and sensory deficits. Despite these symptoms indicating potential balance deficits, systematic investigations and validated assessments are lacking. Therefore, we aimed to assess balance function using the Mini-BESTest, evaluate its psychometric properties, and identify associated variables. Balance was assessed post-ICU discharge (V1) and at discharge from inpatient neurorehabilitation (V2) in patients with >= 5 days of invasive ventilation. Mini-BESTest measurement characteristics were evaluated in an ambulatory subgroup. A multiple linear regression was conducted. The prospective cohort study comprised 250 patients (34% female, 62 +- 14 years, median ICU stay 55 days). Median Mini-BESTest scores improved significantly from V1 (5 (IQR 0-15)) to V2 (18.5 (10-23)) with a large effect size. Excellent inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities of the Mini-BESTest were observed (ICC = 0.981/0.950). Validity was demonstrated by a very high correlation with the Berg Balance Scale (rho = 0.90). No floor or ceiling effects were detected. Muscle strength, cognitive function, cerebral disease, critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy, and depression were significantly associated with balance. Despite significant improvements during the rehabilitation period, balance disorders were prevalent in critical illness survivors. Ongoing therapy is recommended. Due to its excellent psychometric properties, the Mini-BESTest is suitable for use in critical illness survivors.Registration: The study was registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00021753, date of registration: 2020-09-03).
