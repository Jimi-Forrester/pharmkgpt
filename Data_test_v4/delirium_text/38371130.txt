38371130|t|The Role of Electroconvulsive Therapy in the Treatment of Catatonia Associated With Lewy Body Dementia: A Case Report.
38371130|a|Catatonia is a complex amalgamation of neuropsychiatric symptoms that can manifest in both psychiatric and neurological conditions. The treatment of catatonia related to psychiatric illnesses is well documented as it typically responds to benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). However, the treatment of catatonia related to neurological disorders has shown to be more difficult, particularly when associated with Lewy Body Dementia (LBD). Here, we present the case of a 78-year-old woman with LBD, Bipolar I, depressive type, who successfully underwent twelve ECT sessions to treat catatonia refractory to benzodiazepine therapy. The effectiveness of the treatment was measured using the Bush-Francis Catatonia Scale (BFCS) to measure her catatonic symptoms as she progressed through the therapy. This report highlights the importance of considering ECT as a leading therapeutic approach in this particular subset of patients who do not respond adequately to pharmaceutical therapy and medical titrations.
