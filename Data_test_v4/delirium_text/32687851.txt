32687851|t|Regional segmentation strategy for DTI analysis of human corpus callosum indicates motor function deficit in mild cognitive impairment.
32687851|a|BACKGROUND: The corpus callosum is the largest white matter tract in the human brain, involved in inter-hemispheric transfer and integration of lateralised visual, sensory-motor, language, and cognitive information. Microstructural alterations are implicated in ageing as well as various neurological conditions. NEW METHOD: Cross-sectional diffusion-weighted images of 107 healthy adults were used to create a linear regression model of the ageing corpus callosum and its sub-regions to evaluate the impact of analysis by sub-region, and to test for deviations from healthy ageing parameters in 28 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Alterations in diffusion properties including fractional anisotropy, mean, radial and axial diffusivities were investigated as a function of age. RESULTS: Changes in DTI parameters showed age-dependent regional differences, likely arising from axonal diameter variation across cross-sectional regions of interest in the corpus callosum. Patterns suggestive of degeneration with healthy ageing were observed in all regions. Diffusion parameters in sub-regions projecting to pre-motor, primary, and supplementary motor areas of the brain differed for MCI versus healthy controls, and MCI subjects were more likely than healthy controls to experience a reduction in motor skills. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Statistical analyses of the corpus callosum by five manually-defined sub-regions, instead of a single manually-defined region of interest, revealed region-specific changes in microstructure in healthy ageing and MCI, and accounted for clinically-evaluated differences in motor skills between cohorts. CONCLUSION: This method will support future studies of corpus callosum, enabling identification and measurement of white matter changes that are undetectable with the single ROI approach.
