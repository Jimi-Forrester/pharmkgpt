21343890|t|Tin (IV) chloride-promoted one-pot synthesis of novel tacrine analogues.
21343890|a|A facile synthesis of potential acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, the tacrine analogues 3a-p, has been accomplished by direct cyclocondensation of 1-aryl-4-cyano-5-aminopyrazole with beta-ketoesters using tin(IV) chloride as catalyst. The structures of all the compounds have been confirmed by IR, 1H- and 13C-NMR.
