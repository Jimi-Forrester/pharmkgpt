30881148|t|Suspected hyponatremia-induced Brugada phenocopy.
30881148|a|Brugada syndrome is a genetic condition that predisposes to an increased risk of ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death in a structurally normal heart. The Brugada type 1 electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern may occur independently of the actual syndrome, and this clinical phenomenon is often referred to as Brugada phenocopy. There are several other factors which have been known to induce this electrocardiographic pattern, and currently, there is a paucity of literature with respect to the pattern that is observed in patients with electrolyte disturbances, specifically hyponatremia. This case report highlights a suspected hyponatremia-induced Brugada type 1 ECG pattern, which subsequently normalized following resolution of the electrolyte derangement.
