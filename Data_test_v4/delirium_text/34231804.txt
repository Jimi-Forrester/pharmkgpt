34231804|a|OBJECTIVE: To relate functional independence to the degree of pulmonary impairment in adult patients 3 months after discharge from the intensive care unit. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in one adult intensive care unit and a multi-professional post-intensive care unit outpatient clinic of a single center. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit from January 2012 to December 2013 who underwent (3 months later) spirometry and answered the Functional Independence Measure Questionnaire were included. RESULTS: Patients were divided into groups according to the classification of functional independence and spirometry. The study included 197 patients who were divided into greater dependence (n = 4), lower dependence (n = 12) and independent (n = 181) groups. Comparing the three groups, regarding the classification of the Functional Independence Measure, patients with greater dependence had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment values at intensive care unit admission with more advanced age, more days on mechanical ventilation, and longer stay in the intensive care unit and hospital. The majority of patients presented with pulmonary impairment, which was the obstructive pattern observed most frequently. When comparing functional independence with pulmonary function, it was observed that the lower the functional status, the worse the pulmonary function, with a significant difference being observed in peak expiratory flow (p = 0.030). CONCLUSION: The majority of patients who returned to the outpatient clinic 3 months after discharge had good functional status but did present with pulmonary impairment, which is related to the degree of functional dependence.
