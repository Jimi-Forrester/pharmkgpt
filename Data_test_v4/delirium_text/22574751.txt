22574751|a|Mounting evidence suggests that the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurofibrillary tangles and parenchymal amyloid plaques, are downstream reflections of neurodegeneration caused by the intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid-beta proteins (Abeta), particularly Abeta42 and Abeta40. While the neurotoxicity of more amyloidogenic but less abundant Abeta42 is well documented, the effect of Abeta40 on neurons has been understudied. The Abeta40 expression in the presymptomatic AD brain is ten times greater than that of Abeta42. However, the Abeta40:42 ratio decreases with AD progression and coincides with increased amyloid plaque deposition in the brain. Hence, it is thought that Abeta40 protects neurons from the deleterious effects of Abeta42. The pathophysiological pathways involved in the neuronal uptake of Abeta40 or Abeta42 have not been clearly elucidated. Lack of such critical information obscures therapeutic targets and thwarts rational drug development strategies aimed at preventing neurodegeneration in AD. The current study has shown that fluorescein labeled Abeta42 (F-Abeta42) is internalized by neurons via dynamin dependent endocytosis and is sensitive to membrane cholesterol, whereas the neuronal uptake of F-Abeta40 is energy independent and nonendocytotic. Following their uptake, both F-Abeta40 and F-Abeta42 did not accumulate in early/recycling endosomes; F-Abeta42 but not F-Abeta40 accumulated in late endosomes and in the vesicles harboring caveolin-1. Furthermore, F-Abeta42 demonstrated robust accumulation in the lysosomes and damaged their integrity, whereas F-Abeta40 showed only a sparse lysosomal accumulation. Such regulated trafficking along distinct pathways suggests that Abeta40 and Abeta42 exercise differential effects on neurons. These differences must be carefully considered in the design of a pharmacological agent intended to block the neurodegeneration triggered by Abeta proteins.
