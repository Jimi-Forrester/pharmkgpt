20579874|a|Inhibition of the aspartyl protease BACE-1 has the potential to deliver a disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease. Herein, is described a series of potent inhibitors based on an hydroxyethylamine (HEA) transition state mimetic template. These inhibitors interact with the non prime side of the enzyme using a novel edge-to-face interaction with Arg-296.
