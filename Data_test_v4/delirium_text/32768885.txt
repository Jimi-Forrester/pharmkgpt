32768885|a|Honey and its phenolic compounds specifically chrysin are focused as nutritional supplements and likewise as valued phytochemicals, nutraceuticals, and phytopharmaceuticals alone, or adjuvant with some conventional medications to cause synergistic therapeutic or cytotoxic effects. Through the verified beneficial strategies combat several disturbances, phenolic compounds play fundamental functions in the avoidance and treatment of disorders. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis are the three most imperative physiological reactions in the prevalence of numerous ailments. Honey, chrysin, and other phenolic compounds detected in honey can modify clinical conditions via modulation of these contrivances and correlated signaling pathways. The current study desires to review the therapeutic effects of honey and its allied molecular mechanisms. Evidenced-base studies show that honey would represent therapeutic potential against various types of cancer and tumor proliferation (colorectal cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, leukemia, glioma, hepatocellular cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma), wounds, diabetes mellitus, neurological (depression, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer's disease), respiratory, gastrointestinal (peptic ulcer and ulcerative colitis), cardiovascular disorders, renal injuries, liver diseases and many other kinds of physiological dysfunctionalities through various molecular mechanisms contributed with oxidative stress, inflammatory process, and apoptosis.
