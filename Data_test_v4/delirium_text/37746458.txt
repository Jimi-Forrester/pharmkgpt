37746458|t|Exploring Novel Therapeutic Approaches for Depressive Disorders: The Role of Allopregnanolone Agonists.
37746458|a|Depressive disorders are caused due to the impaired functioning of important brain networks. Recent studies have also shown that it is caused by a significant reduction in the levels of allopregnanolone, which is a progesterone metabolite. Newer treatment modalities are now focusing on the usage of neuroactive steroids, such as allopregnanolone, in various depressive disorders. Our aim was to provide a comprehensive literature review on the clinical aspects of the allopregnanolone agonists brexanolone and zuranolone with reference to the physiological role of allopregnanolone. Brexanolone was approved by the FDA in 2019 for the treatment of postpartum depression and has greatly influenced further research into potential drugs such as zuranolone, which is currently undergoing phase 3 of clinical trials. Although these drugs exhibit improvement in symptoms of depressive disorders along with notable side effects, further research is required for their future clinical use.
