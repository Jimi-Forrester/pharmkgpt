18620351|a|Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show a deficit in olfactory threshold sensitivity. The Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 allele is associated with increased risk of AD and earlier symptom onset. Hormone therapy (HT) may exert neuroprotective effects on brain areas affected by AD. The current study investigated the effect of HT on performance on an olfactory threshold test in epsilon4 positive and epsilon4 negative non-hysterectomized, non-demented, elderly females and AD patients. Among the non-demented participants, epsilon4 positive females who had received HT performed 1) significantly better than those without HT, and 2) at levels similar to those of epsilon4 negative females. In contrast, those without HT who were epsilon4 positive performed significantly worse than those who were epsilon4 negative. HT had no effect on performance in AD patients regardless of epsilon4 status. These results suggest that HT may offer protection against loss of olfactory function in epsilon4 positive individuals in preclinical stages of AD. Future research is warranted in order to investigate further the neuroprotective role of HT on sensory and cognitive functions in non-demented aging individuals.
