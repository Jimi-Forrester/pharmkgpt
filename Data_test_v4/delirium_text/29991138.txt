29991138|t|Neuroepigenetics and Alzheimer's Disease: An Update.
29991138|a|Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression which may be triggered by both genetic and environmental factors, and independent from changes to the underlying DNA sequence-a change in phenotype without a change in genotype-which in turn affects how cells read genes. Epigenetic changes represent a regular and natural occurrence but can be influenced also by factors such as age, environment, and disease state. Epigenetic modifications can manifest themselves not only as the manner in which cells terminally differentiate, but can have also deleterious effects, resulting in diseases such as cancer. At least three systems including DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-associated gene silencing are thought to initiate and sustain epigenetic change. For example, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), both genetic and non-genetic factors contribute to disease etiopathology. While over 250 gene mutations have been related to familial AD, less than 5% of AD cases are explained by known disease genes. More than likely, non-genetic factors, probably triggered by environmental factors, are causative factors of late-onset AD. AD is associated with dysregulation of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and ncRNAs. Among the classes of ncRNA, microRNAs (miRNAs) have a well-established regulatory relevance. MicroRNAs are highly expressed in CNS neurons, where they play a major role in neuron differentiation, synaptogenesis, and plasticity. MicroRNAs impact higher cognitive functions, as their functional impairment is involved in the etiology of neurological diseases, including AD. Alterations in the miRNA network contribute to AD disease processes, e.g., in the regulation of amyloid peptides, tau, lipid metabolism, and neuroinflammation. MicroRNAs, both as biomarkers for AD and therapeutic targets, are in the early stages of exploration. In addition, emerging data suggest that altered transcription of long ncRNAs, endogenous, ncRNAs longer than 200 nucleotides, may be involved in an elevated risk for AD.
