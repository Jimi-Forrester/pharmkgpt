39332414|t|CSF proteomics identifies early changes in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.
39332414|a|In this high-throughput proteomic study of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD), we sought to identify early biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for disease monitoring and treatment strategies. We examined CSF proteins in 286 mutation carriers (MCs) and 177 non-carriers (NCs). The developed multi-layer regression model distinguished proteins with different pseudo-trajectories between these groups. We validated our findings with independent ADAD as well as sporadic AD datasets and employed machine learning to develop and validate predictive models. Our study identified 137 proteins with distinct trajectories between MCs and NCs, including eight that changed before traditional AD biomarkers. These proteins are grouped into three stages: early stage (stress response, glutamate metabolism, neuron mitochondrial damage), middle stage (neuronal death, apoptosis), and late presymptomatic stage (microglial changes, cell communication). The predictive model revealed a six-protein subset that more effectively differentiated MCs from NCs, compared with conventional biomarkers.
