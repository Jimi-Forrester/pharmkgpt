16640110|t|Psychosis related to neurological conditions: pro and cons of the dis- / mis-connectivity models of schizophrenia.
16640110|a|Schizophrenia is still a condition with obscure causes and psychopathology. This paper aims to discuss the "disconnectivity" hypothesis in relation to some neurological conditions which are known to alter brain connectivity, as well as mimicking some aspects of the disorder. After a short historical introduction to the concept, we will examine the evidence for connectivity problems in schizophrenia, separating the anatomical level from the functional level. Then, we will discuss three different issues concerning connectivity: i) local reduction in connectivity without neuronal loss (within the gray matter); ii) reduction in or alteration of long-range connectivity (within the white matter); and iii) abnormal targets for connections. For each of these aspects, we will look at the conditions able to reproduce anomalies capable of increasing susceptibility to schizophrenia. We conclude that psychosis is more likely to occur: i) when long-range connectivity is concerned; ii) when lesions result in lengthening and scattering of conduction times; and iii) when there are high dopamine levels, shedding light on or adding weight to the idea of an interaction between dopamine and connectivity.
