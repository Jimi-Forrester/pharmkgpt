38947802|t|Novel Properties of Old Propranolol-Assessment of Antiglycation Activity through In Vitro and In Silico Approaches.
38947802|a|Hypertension has earned the "silent killer" nickname since it may lead to a number of comorbidities, including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Oxidative stress and protein glycation play vital roles in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Several studies have shown that they profoundly account for vascular dysfunction, endothelial damage, and disruption of blood pressure regulatory mechanisms. Of particular note are advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs alter vascular tissues' functional and mechanical properties by binding to receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), stimulating inflammation and free radical-mediated pathways. Propranolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, is one of the most commonly used drugs to treat hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Our study is the first to analyze propranolol's effects on protein glycoxidation through in vitro and in silico approaches. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was utilized to evaluate glycoxidation inhibition by propranolol. Propranolol (1 mM) and BSA (0.09 mM) were incubated with different glycating (0.5 M glucose, fructose, and galactose for 6 days and 2.5 mM glyoxal and methylglyoxal for 12 h) or oxidizing agents (chloramine T for 1 h). Biomarkers of protein glycation (Amadori products (APs), beta-amyloid (betaA), and advanced glycation end products (AGEs)), protein glycoxidation (dityrosine (DT), kynurenine (KYN), and N-formylkynurenine (NFK)), protein oxidation (protein carbonyls (PCs), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs)) were measured by means of colorimetric and fluorimetric methods. The scavenging of reactive oxygen species (hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, and nitric oxide) and the antioxidant capacity (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical and ferrous ion chelating (FIC) assays)) of propranolol were also evaluated. Additionally, in silico docking was performed to showcase propranolol's interaction with BSA, glycosides, and AGE/RAGE pathway proteins. The products of protein glycation ( APs,  betaA,  AGEs), glycoxidation ( DT,  KYN,  NFK), and oxidation ( PCs,  AOPPs) prominently decreased in the BSA samples with both glycating/oxidizing factors and propranolol. The antiglycoxidant properties of propranolol were similar to those of aminoguanidine, a known protein oxidation inhibitor, and captopril, which is an established antioxidant. Propranolol showed a potent antioxidant activity in the FIC and H2O2 scavenging assays, comparable to aminoguanidine and captopril. In silico analysis indicated propranolol's antiglycative properties during its interaction with BSA, glycosidases, and AGE/RAGE pathway proteins. Our results confirm that propranolol may decrease protein oxidation and glycoxidation in vitro. Additional studies on human and animal models are vital for in vivo verification of propranolol's antiglycation activity, as this discovery might hold the key to the prevention of diabetic complications among cardiology-burdened patients.
