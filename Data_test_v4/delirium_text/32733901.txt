32733901|t|Rapid Geriatric Assessment Using Mobile App in Primary Care: Prevalence of Geriatric Syndromes and Review of Its Feasibility.
32733901|a|With the aging population and consequent increase in associated prevalence of frailty, dementia, and multimorbidity, primary care physicians will be overwhelmed with the complexity of the psychosocial and clinical presentation. Geriatric syndromes including frailty, sarcopenia, cognitive impairment, and anorexia of aging (AA) either in isolation or in combination are associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes and if recognized early, and appropriately managed, will lead to decreased disability. Primary care practices are often located in residential settings and are in an ideal position to incorporate preventive screening and geriatric assessment with personalized management. However, primary care physicians lack the time, multidisciplinary resources, or skills to conduct geriatric assessment, and the limited number of geriatricians worldwide further complicates the matter. There is no one effective strategy to implement geriatric assessment in primary care which is rapid, cost-effective, and do not require geriatricians. Rapid Geriatric Assessment (RGA) takes <5 min to complete. It screens for frailty, sarcopenia, AA, and cognition with assisted management pathway without the need of a geriatrician. We developed RGA iPad application for screening with assisted management in two primary care practices and explored the feasibility and overall prevalence of frailty, sarcopenia, and AA. The assessment was conducted by trained nurses and coordinators. Among 2,589 older patients >=65 years old, the prevalence of frailty was 5.9%, pre-frail 31.2%, and robust 62.9%. Fatigue was present in 17.8%, and among them, the prevalence of undiagnosed depression as assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 was 76.4% and 13.5% of total. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 15.4%, and 13.9% experienced at least one fall in the past year. AA was prevalent in 10.9%. The time taken to do the assessment with defined algorithm was on average 5 min or less per patient, and 96% managed to complete the assessment prior to seeing their doctor in the same session. The RGA app is a rapid and feasible tool to be used by any healthcare professional in primary care for identification of geriatric syndrome with assisted management.
