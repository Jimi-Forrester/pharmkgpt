39743298|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), mainly including Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer's disease (AD), are sporadic and rare genetic disorders of the central nervous system. A key feature of these conditions is the slow accumulation of misfolded protein deposits in brain neurons, the excessive aggregation of which leads to neurotoxicity and further disorders of the nervous system.
