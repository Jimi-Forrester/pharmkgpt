39421393|t|Thinking Induced by Acute Kidney Injury of Diquat Poisoning: Cases Report.
39421393|a|Diquat poisoning is a fatal condition that is becoming increasingly common. The mortality risk of patients taking lethal doses of diquat is extremely high. It typically leads to rapid dysfunction of multiple organs, including the kidneys, heart, lungs, and brain. Acute kidney injury is usually the first manifestation of this poisoning. However, the optimal treatment strategy for diquat poisoning remains uncertain. Additionally, the mechanism of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome caused by diquat poisoning may resemble the progression of sepsis. In this report, we present 3 cases of diquat poisoning, all of which resulted in death. We emphasize that acute kidney injury is the primary cause of death, and suggest that some strategies used in the treatment of sepsis could be beneficial in managing diquat poisoning-induced acute kidney injury.
