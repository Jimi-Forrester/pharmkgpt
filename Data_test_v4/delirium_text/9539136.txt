9539136|a|The 42/43-residue amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is widely believed to play a major role in Alzheimer's disease. The present study shows that the rat brain contains a carboxypeptidase that efficiently deletes three amino acids from Abeta1-43. The carboxypeptidase activity in the brain was completely inhibited by 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, suggesting the protease is a serine carboxypeptidase. The carboxy-terminal truncation of Abeta1-43 was moderately inhibited by carbobenzoxy-Leu-leucinal, carbobenzoxy-Leu-Leu-leucinal, and carbobenzoxy-Leu-Leu-norvalinal, and weakly by antipain. The present data suggest that the serine carboxypeptidase contributes to the generation of short-tailed Abeta peptides and is important in the intracellular clearance of Abeta1-42/43 in brains.
