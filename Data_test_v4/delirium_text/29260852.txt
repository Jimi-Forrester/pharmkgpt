29260852|t|Targeting the Prion-like Aggregation of Mutant p53 to Combat Cancer.
29260852|a|Prion-like behavior of several amyloidogenic proteins has been demonstrated in recent years. Despite having functional roles in some cases, irregular aggregation can have devastating consequences. The most commonly known amyloid diseases are Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs). The pathophysiology of prion-like diseases involves the structural transformation of wild-type (wt) proteins to transmissible forms that can convert healthy proteins, generating aggregates. The mutant form of tumor suppressor protein, p53, has recently been shown to exhibit prion-like properties. Within the context of p53 aggregation and the search for ways to avert it, this review emphasizes discoveries, approaches, and research from our laboratory and others. Although its standard functions are strongly connected to tumor suppression, p53 mutants and aggregates are involved in cancer progression. p53 aggregates are heterogeneous assemblies composed of amorphous aggregates, oligomers, and amyloid-like fibrils. Evidence of these structures in tumor tissues, the in vitro capability for p53 mutants to coaggregate with wt protein, and the detection of cell-to-cell transmission indicate that cancer has the basic characteristics of prion and prion-like diseases. Various approaches aim to restore p53 functions in cancer. Methods include the use of small-molecule and peptide stabilizers of mutant p53, zinc administration, gene therapy, alkylating and DNA intercalators, and blockage of p53-MDM2 interaction. A primary challenge in developing small-molecule inhibitors of p53 aggregation is the large number of p53 mutations. Another issue is the inability to recover p53 function by dissociating mature fibrils. Consequently, efforts have emerged to target the intermediate species of the aggregation reaction. Phi-value analysis has been used to characterize the kinetics of the early phases of p53 aggregation. Our experiments using high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and chemical denaturants have helped to clarify excited conformers of p53 that are prone to aggregation. Molecular dynamics (MD) and phasor analysis of single Trp fluorescence signals point toward the presence of preamyloidogenic conformations of p53, which are not observed for p63 or p73. Exploring the features of competent preamyloidogenic states of wt and different p53 mutants may provide a framework for designing personalized drugs for the restoration of p53 function. Protection of backbone hydrogen bonds (BHBs) has been shown to be an important factor for the stability of amyloidogenic proteins and was employed to identify and stabilize the structural defect resulting from the p53 Y220C mutation. Using MD simulations, we compared BHB protection factors between p53 family members to determine the donor-acceptor pairs in p53 that exhibit lower protection. The identification of structurally vulnerable sites in p53 should provide new insights into rational designs that can rapidly be screened using our experimental methodology. Through continued and combined efforts, the outlook is positive for the development of strategies for regulating p53 amyloid transformation.
