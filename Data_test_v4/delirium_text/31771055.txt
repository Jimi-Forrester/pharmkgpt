31771055|t|Proteomic and Unbiased Post-Translational Modification Profiling of Amyloid Plaques and Surrounding Tissue in a Transgenic Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
31771055|a|Amyloid plaques are one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main constituent of amyloid plaques is amyloid-beta peptides, but a complex interplay of other infiltrating proteins also co-localizes. We hypothesized that proteomic analysis could reveal differences between amyloid plaques and adjacent control tissue in the transgenic mouse model of AD (APPPS1-21) and in similar regions from non-transgenic littermates. Our microproteomic strategy included isolation of regions of interest by laser capture microdissection and analysis by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based label-free relative quantification. We consistently identified 183, 224, and 307 proteins from amyloid plaques, adjacent control and non-tg samples, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed 27 proteins that were significantly regulated when comparing amyloid plaques and corresponding adjacent control regions. We further elucidated that co-localized proteins were subjected to post-translational modifications and are the first to report 193 and 117 unique modifications associated to amyloid plaques and adjacent control extracts, respectively. The three most common modifications detected in proteins from the amyloid plaques were oxidation, deamidation, and pyroglutamylation. Together, our data provide novel information about the biological processes occurring within and around amyloid plaques in the APPPS1-21 mouse model of AD.
