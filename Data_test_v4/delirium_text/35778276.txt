35778276|a|BACKGROUND: Peripheral surgical trauma can trigger neuroinflammation and ensuing neurological complications, such as delirium. The mechanisms whereby surgery contributes to postoperative neuroinflammation remain unclear and without effective therapies. Here, we developed a microfluidic-assisted blood-brain barrier (BBB) device and tested the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on neuroimmune interactions after orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: A microfluidic-assisted BBB device was established using primary human cells. Tight junction proteins, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), BBB permeability, and astrocytic networks were assessed after stimulation with interleukin (IL)-1beta and in the presence or absence of a clinically available omega-3 fatty acid emulsion (Omegaven ; Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany). Mice were treated 1 h before orthopaedic surgery with 10 mul g-1 body weight of omega-3 fatty acid emulsion i.v. or equal volumes of saline. Changes in pericytes, perivascular macrophages, BBB opening, microglial activation, and inattention were evaluated. RESULTS: Omega-3 fatty acids protected barrier permeability, endothelial tight junctions, and VCAM-1 after exposure to IL-1beta in the BBB model. In vivo studies confirmed that omega-3 fatty acid treatment inhibited surgery-induced BBB impairment, microglial activation, and delirium-like behaviour. We identified a novel role for pericyte loss and perivascular macrophage activation in mice after surgery, which were rescued by prophylaxis with i.v. omega-3 fatty acids. CONCLUSIONS: We present a new approach to study neuroimmune interactions relevant to perioperative recovery using a microphysiological BBB platform. Changes in barrier function, including dysregulation of pericytes and perivascular macrophages, provide new targets to reduce postoperative delirium.
