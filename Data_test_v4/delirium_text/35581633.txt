35581633|t|NEAT1 can be a diagnostic biomarker in the breast cancer and gastric cancer patients by targeting XIST, hsa-miR-612, and MTRNR2L8: integrated RNA targetome interaction and experimental expression analysis.
35581633|a|BACKGROUND: The most frequent malignancy in women is breast cancer (BC). Gastric cancer (GC) is also the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are thought to be important neurotic regulators in malignant tumors. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the expression level of NEAT1 and the interaction of this non-coding RNA with correlated microRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs or protein coding genes, experimentally and bioinformatically. METHODS: For the bioinformatics analyses, we performed RNA-RNA and protein-protein interaction analyses, using ENCORI and STRING. The expression analyses were performed by five tools: Microarray data analysis, TCGA data analysis (RNA-seq, R Studio), GEPIA2, ENCORI, and real-time PCR experiment. qRT-PCR experiment was performed on 50 GC samples and 50 BC samples, compared to adjacent control tissue. RESULTS: Based on bioinformatics and experimental analyses, lncRNA NEAT1 have a significant down-regulation in the breast cancer samples with tumor size lower than 2 cm. Also, it has a significant high expression in the gastric cancer patients. Furthermore, NEAT1 have a significant interaction with XIST, hsa-miR-612 and MTRNR2L8. High expression of NEAT1 have a correlation with the lower survival rate of breast cancer samples and higher survival rate of gastric cancer patients. CONCLUSION: This integrated computational and experimental investigation revealed some new aspects of the lncRNA NEAT1 as a potential prognostic biomarker for the breast cancer and gastric cancer samples. Further investigations about NEA1 and correlated mRNAs, lncRNAs, and microRNAs - specially the mentioned RNAs in this study - can lead the researchers to more clear information about the role of NEAT1 in the breast cancer and gastric cancer.
