1972185|t|A quantitative assessment of somatostatin-like and neuropeptide Y-like immunostained cells in the frontal and temporal cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
1972185|a|Immunocytochemical studies utilizing radioimmunoassay and morphological techniques have provided conflicting evidence for the involvement of somatostatin and neuropeptide Y in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, previous investigators have not considered the effects of cortical atrophy in AD tissue on their findings. This study reports the numbers of somatostatin-like (SLI) and neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactive (NPYLI) neuronal perikarya and the length of SLI and NPYLI immunoreactive fibres, with appropriate corrections for atrophy in 6 control and 6 AD cases. There were significantly fewer SLI neurones in AD in layers II + III combined from the temporal cortex, and fewer NPYLI neurones in layers V + VI in both frontal and temporal cortices. Using a randomized method to quantify immunostained fibre length in the neuropil, an analysis of variance revealed no significant differences in the mean SLI or NPYLI fibre length per cortical strip between control and AD groups in frontal or temporal cortex. However, using a second measure of fibre length by tracing the fibres attached to consecutive immunostained perikarya, there were significant reductions in the AD brains in the mean fibre length per cell in layers V + VI for SLI in the temporal cortex, and for NPYLI in the frontal cortex. This reduction in fibre length per individual cell was presumably masked by the large variation in the fibre length found between cases using the randomized approach. It was concluded that in order to evaluate the involvement of these neuropeptides in AD from any measurements of concentration, it is essential to include some compensation for the extent of cortical atrophy that occurs with the disease.
