36793804|a|Objective We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mirabegron monotherapy in very older (>80 years) women with overactive bladder (OAB) who were discontinued anticholinergic drugs by the other departments. Material and methods The present retrospective study evaluated very older (>80 years) women with OAB who were discontinued anticholinergic drugs by the other departments between May 2018 and January 2021. Efficacy assessments were performed using Overactive Bladder-Validated Eight-Question (OAB-V8) scores before and after mirabegron monotherapy (12 weeks). Safety was evaluated based on adverse events (hypertension, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infection), electrocardiography, hypertension measure, uroflowmetry (UFM), and post-voiding. Patient data including demographic characteristics, diagnoses, values before and after mirabegron monotherapy, and adverse events were evaluated. Results A total of 42 very older (>80 years) women with OAB who used mirabegron monotherapy (50 mg per day) were included in this study. Frequency, nocturia, urgency, and total OAB-V8 scores were significantly lower after mirabegron monotherapy than before mirabegron monotherapy (p < 0.05, p < 0.05, p < 0.05, and p < 0.05, respectively). There was no significant difference between systolic-diastolic blood pressure and heart rate before and after mirabegron monotherapy treatment. Conclusion Mirabegron monotherapy is an effective and safe therapy in very older (>80 years) women with OAB.
