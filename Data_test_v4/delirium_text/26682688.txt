26682688|a|Recently we reported that several monoclonal antibodies that recognize linear segments of amyloid-beta (Abeta) also recognize amyloid fibrils, but not monomers of unrelated sequences, indicating that recognition of a linear sequence segment is not a reliable indicator of sequence specificity. We asked whether any of the commonly used commercially available Abeta antibodies also recognize fibrils of unrelated sequence. Here we report that 4G8, which recognizes residues 18-23 of the Abeta sequence and is widely believed to be sequence-specific, also recognizes fibrils formed from alpha-synuclein and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). The recognition of amyloid fibrils is aggregation-dependent because 4G8 does not recognize alpha-synuclein or IAPP monomer. 4G8 also stains fibrillar alpha-synuclein aggregates in human multiple system atrophy brain where it colocalizes with anti-alpha-synuclein monoclonal antibody LB509 immunoreactivity. We also found that LB509 recognizes Abeta fibrils, but not monomer, indicating that generic epitope-reactive antibodies are also produced in response to alpha-synuclein immunization. Taken together, our results indicate that generic fibril conformational epitope specificity may be a pervasive property among monoclonal antibodies raised against amyloid-forming antigens and that the specificity of their immunoreactivity should be rigorously established and otherwise interpreted with caution.
