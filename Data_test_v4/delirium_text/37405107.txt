37405107|a|BACKGROUND: Radical gastrectomy (RG) is commonly used in the treatment of patients with gastric cancer (GC), but this procedure may lead to stress responses, postoperative cognitive dysfunction, and blood coagulation abnormalities in patients. AIM: To investigate the influences of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on stress responses and postoperative cognitive and coagulation functions in patients undergoing RG under general anesthesia (GA). METHODS: One hundred and two patients undergoing RG for GC under GA from February 2020 to February 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Of these, 50 patients had received conventional anesthesia intervention [control group (CG)] and 52 patients had received DEX in addition to routine anesthesia intervention [observation group (OG)]. Inflammatory factor (IFs; tumor necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-alpha; interleukin-6, IL-6), stress responses (cortisol, Cor; adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH), cognitive function (CF; Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE), neurological function (neuron-specific enolase, NSE; S100 calcium-binding protein B, S100B), and coagulation function (prothrombin time, PT; thromboxane B2, TXB2; fibrinogen, FIB) were compared between the two groups before surgery (T0), as well as at 6 h (T1) and 24 h (T2) after surgery. RESULTS: Compared with T0, TNF-alpha, IL-6, Cor, ACTH, NSE, S100B, PT, TXB2, and FIB showed a significant increase in both groups at T1 and T2, but with even lower levels in OG vs CG. Both groups showed a significant reduction in the MMSE score at T1 and T2 compared with T0, but the MMSE score was notably higher in OG compared with CG. CONCLUSION: In addition to a potent inhibitory effect on postoperative IFs and stress responses in GC patients undergoing RG under GA, DEX may also alleviate the coagulation dysfunction and improve the postoperative CF of these patients.
