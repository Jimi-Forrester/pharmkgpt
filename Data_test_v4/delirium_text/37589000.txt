37589000|t|HP1 induces ferroptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells through NRF2 pathway in diabetic nephropathy.
37589000|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ferroptosis in diabetic nephropathy (DN) and the mechanism of its regulatory genes. HK-2 cells were cultured with high glucose and mice were intraperitoneally injected with streptozotocin to establish DN models. GSE111154 was analyzed to identify the abnormal expression of genes associated with DN. Cell injury was evaluated through CCK-8 assay and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/phenylindole double staining. The levels of iron, glutathione, malondialdehyde, urinary albumin, and urinary creatinine were determined by ELISA. Furthermore, western blot and RT-qPCR were used to detect protein and mRNA levels, respectively. Our data showed that heterochromatin protein 1 is an abnormally elevated gene related to DN and is further elevated by ferroptosis activators. Inhibition of HP1 significantly inhibited ferroptosis but promoted cell viability. In addition, nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor2 (NRF2) was decreased in DN cell model, but increased under the action of ferroptosis activators. NRF2 silencing reversed the protective effects of HP1 inhibition on HK-2 cells. Additionally, HP1 silencing also alleviated kidney damage in DN mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that inhibiting HP1 inhibits ferroptosis via NRF2 pathway, thereby protecting renal tubular epithelial cells from damage.
