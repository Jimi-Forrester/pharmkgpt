38441073|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The rising prevalence of neurodegenerative and mental disorders, combined with the challenges posed by their frailty, has presented intensivists with complex issues in the intensive care unit (ICU). This review article explores specific aspects of care for patients with catatonia, Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia within the context of the ICU, shedding light on recent developments in these fields. RECENT FINDINGS: Catatonia, a neuropsychiatric syndrome with potentially life-threatening forms, remains underdiagnosed, and its etiologies are diverse. PD patients in the ICU present unique challenges related to admission criteria, dopaminergic treatment, and respiratory care. Dementia increases the risk of delirium. Delirium is associated with long-term cognitive impairment and dementia. SUMMARY: While evidence is lacking, further research is needed to guide treatment for ICU patients with these comorbidities.
