37917311|a|BACKGROUND: The neurobiology of psychotic depression is not well understood and can be confounded by antipsychotics. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is an ideal tool to measure brain metabolites non-invasively. We cross-sectionally assessed brain metabolites in patients with remitted psychotic depression and controls. We also longitudinally assessed the effects of olanzapine versus placebo on brain metabolites. METHODS: Following remission, patients with psychotic depression were randomized to continue sertraline + olanzapine (n = 15) or switched to sertraline + placebo (n = 18), at which point they completed an MRS scan. Patients completed a second scan either 36 weeks later, relapse, or discontinuation. Where water-scaled metabolite levels were obtained and a Point-RESolved Spectroscopy sequence was utilized, choline, myo-inositol, glutamate + glutamine (Glx), N-acetylaspartate, and creatine were measured in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). An ANCOVA was used to compare metabolites between patients (n = 40) and controls (n = 46). A linear mixed-model was used to compare olanzapine versus placebo groups. RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, patients (compared to controls) had higher myo-inositol (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.84; 95%CI = 0.25-1.44; p = 0.005) in the dACC but not different Glx, choline, N-acetylaspartate, and creatine. Longitudinally, patients randomized to placebo (compared to olanzapine) showed a significantly greater change with a reduction of creatine (SMD = 1.51; 95%CI = 0.71-2.31; p = 0.0002) in the dACC but not glutamate + glutamine, choline, myo-inositol, and N-acetylaspartate. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with remitted psychotic depression have higher myo-inositol than controls. Olanzapine may maintain creatine levels. Future studies are needed to further disentangle the mechanisms of action of olanzapine.
