34443584|t|The Nrf2 Pathway in Ischemic Stroke: A Review.
34443584|a|Ischemic stroke, characterized by the sudden loss of blood flow in specific area(s) of the brain, is the leading cause of permanent disability and is among the leading causes of death worldwide. The only approved pharmacological treatment for acute ischemic stroke (intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) has significant clinical limitations and does not consider the complex set of events taking place after the onset of ischemic stroke (ischemic cascade), which is characterized by significant pro-oxidative events. The transcription factor Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which regulates the expression of a great number of antioxidant and/or defense proteins, has been pointed as a potential pharmacological target involved in the mitigation of deleterious oxidative events taking place at the ischemic cascade. This review summarizes studies concerning the protective role of Nrf2 in experimental models of ischemic stroke, emphasizing molecular events resulting from ischemic stroke that are, in parallel, modulated by Nrf2. Considering the acute nature of ischemic stroke, we discuss the challenges in using a putative pharmacological strategy (Nrf2 activator) that relies upon transcription, translation and metabolically active cells in treating ischemic stroke patients.
