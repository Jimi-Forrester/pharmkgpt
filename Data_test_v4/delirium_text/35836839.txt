35836839|a|OBJECTIVE: To clarify the influence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients undergoing joint replacement. METHODS: This study retrospectively enrolled130 patients who underwent joint replacement in the Department of Orthopaedics of Taizhou Municipal Hospital between January 2019 and March 2021 for analysis. According to polysomnography (PSG) results, 80 patients without OSA were included in group A and 50 with OSA were assigned to group B. The two groups were compared with respect to the following items: surgical indications (length of stay (LOS), intraoperative blood loss (IBL) and operation time (OT), incidence of postoperative delirium (POD), postoperative cognitive function (Mini-mental State Examination, MMSE), neurological function recovery (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS) and (Scandinavian Stroke Scale, SSS)), mental health (Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS)), compliance, overall response rate (ORR), complications and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: The LOS and OT were shorter, and the IBL was less in group A compared with those in group B. Group A also showed reduced NIHSS and SSS scores as well as SAS and SDS scores when compared with group B. In addition, lower incidence of POD, and higher compliance, ORR and satisfaction were observed in group A than in group B. In terms of cognitive function, although the MMSE score in both groups decreased after surgery, patients in group B had a lower MMSE score and a milder form of POCD. CONCLUSIONS: OSA may affect the postoperative cognitive function and adversely influence the treatment outcome of elderly patients undergoing joint replacement.
