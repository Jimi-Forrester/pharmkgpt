38230214|a|The disruption of zinc (Zn) homeostasis has been implicated in cancer development and progression through various signaling pathways. Maintaining intracellular zinc balance is crucial in the context of cancer. Human cells rely on two families of transmembrane transporters, SLC30A/ZNT and SLC39A/ZIP, to coordinate zinc homeostasis. While some ZNTs and ZIPs have been linked to cancer progression, limited information is available regarding the expression patterns of zinc homeostasis-related genes and their potential roles in predicting prognosis and developing therapeutic strategies for specific cancers. In this study, a systematic analysis was conducted to examine the expression of all genes from the SLC30A and SLC39A families at both mRNA and protein levels across different cancers. As a result, three SLC39A genes (SLC39A1, SLC39A4, and SLC39A8) were found to be significantly dysregulated in specific cancers, including cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP). Moreover, the dysregulation of these genes was tightly associated with the prognosis of patients with those cancers. Furthermore, we found that the gene SLC39A8 exhibited the lowest mutation frequency in KIRP, whereas mutations in SLC39A4 were found to significantly impact overall survival (OS), disease-free (DF), and progress-free survival (PFS) in cancer patients, particularly in those with PAAD. Additionally, immune infiltration analysis revealed that SLC39A1, SLC39A4, and SLC39A8 may function as immune regulators in cancers. This provides new insights into understanding the complex relationship between zinc homeostasis and cancer progression.
