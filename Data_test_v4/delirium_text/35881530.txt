35881530|t|Pharmacokinetics of Ribavirin in the Treatment of Lassa Fever: An Observational Clinical Study at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Edo State, Nigeria.
35881530|a|BACKGROUND: Lassa fever is endemic in large parts of West Africa. The recommended antiviral treatment is ribavirin. Two treatment regimens are currently endorsed in Nigeria: the "McCormick regimen" based on a study published in 1986 and the "Irrua regimen" constituting a simplified schedule developed at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. Evidence for the safety and efficacy of ribavirin in Lassa fever patients is poor and pharmacokinetic data for both regimens are lacking. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction-confirmed Lassa fever patients with mild to moderate disease severity were invited to participate in this prospective, observational pharmacokinetic study. Pharmacokinetics of ribavirin, clinical, virologic, and clinical laboratory parameters were assessed. RESULTS: Using a population pharmacokinetic approach, plasma concentrations of ribavirin were best described by a 3-compartment model. Drug exposure was remarkably consistent between participants. Overall, drug clearance was 28.5% lower in female compared with male participants. Median (5th-95th percentile) time above half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 37.3% (16.9%-73.1%), 16.7% (8.2%-58.5%), and 9.6% (4.9%-38.4%) on days 1, 7, and 8, respectively. Clinical laboratory parameters indicated reduction of cell damage and development of hemolytic anemia in the course of the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study characterizes the pharmacokinetics of ribavirin in the treatment of Lassa fever indicating consistent exposure across patients. Whereas only a short time interval of concentrations above the IC50 implies rather low antiviral efficacy in vivo, the prominent reduction of cell damage markers might point to indirect-potentially anti-inflammatory-effects of ribavirin. The role of ribavirin in the treatment of Lassa fever requires further scrutiny.
