38132102|t|Abstinence Restores Cardiac Function in Mice with Established Alcohol-Induced Cardiomyopathy.
38132102|a|Alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy (ACM) has a poor prognosis with up to a 50% chance of death within four years of diagnosis. There are limited studies investigating the potential of abstinence for promoting repair after alcohol-induced cardiac damage, particularly in a controlled preclinical study design. Here, we developed an exposure protocol that led to significant decreases in cardiac function in C57BL6/J mice within 30 days; dP/dt max decreased in the mice fed alcohol for 30 days (8054 +- 664.5 mmHg/s compared to control mice: 11,188 +- 724.2 mmHg/s, p < 0.01), and the dP/dt min decreased, as well (-7711 +- 561 mmHg/s compared to control mice: -10,147 +- 448.2 mmHg/s, p < 0.01). Quantitative PCR was used to investigate inflammatory and fibrotic biomarkers, while histology was used to depict overt changes in cardiac fibrosis. We observed a complete recovery of function after abstinence (dP/dt max increased from 8054 +- 664 mmHg/s at 30 days to 11,967 +- 449 mmHg/s after abstinence, p < 0.01); further, both inflammatory and fibrotic biomarkers decreased after abstinence. These results lay the groundwork for future investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying recovery from alcohol-induced damage in the heart.
