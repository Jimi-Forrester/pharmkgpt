38073392|a|BACKGROUND: The APOE genotype has emerged as the major genetic factor for AD but differs among different alleles. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the discrepant effects of APOE genotype on AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. METHODS: A total of 989 non-demented ADNI participants were included. The associations of APOEe2 and APOEe4 with CSF biomarkers were investigated using linear regression models. Interaction and subgroup analyses were used to investigate the effects of sex and age on these associations. Furthermore, we used mediation analyses to assess whether Abeta mediated the associations between APOE genotypes and tau. RESULTS: APOEe2 carriers only showed higher Abeta levels (beta [95% CI] = 0.07 [0.01, 0.13], p = 0.026). Conversely, APOEe4 carriers exhibited lower Abeta concentration (beta [95% CI] = -0.27 [-0.31, -0.24], p < 0.001), higher t-Tau (beta [95% CI] = 0.25 [0.08, 0.18], p < 0.001) and higher p-Tau (beta [95% CI] = 0.31 [0.25, 0.37], p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that APOE e2 was significantly positively associated with Abeta only in females (beta [95% CI] = 0.12 [0.04, 0.21], p = 0.005) and older people (beta [95% CI] = 0.06 [0.001, 0.12], p = 0.048). But the effects of APOE e4 were independent of gender and age. Besides, the associations of APOE e4 with t-Tau and p-Tau were both mediated by baseline Abeta. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that APOEe2 could promote Abeta clearance, while the process could be modified by sex and age. However, APOEe4 might cause the accumulation of Abeta and tau pathology independent of sex and age.
