35719138|a|Hippocampal neuronal damage likely underlies cognitive impairment in vascular dementia (VaD). PPARgamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. However, the role and the precise mechanism of how PGC-1alpha alleviates hippocampal neuronal injury remain unknown. To address this question, HT-22 cells, an immortalized hippocampal neuron cell line, with or without PGC-1alpha overexpression were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), which mimics the circumstance of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in VaD. After OGD, cell viability was assessed using the MTS assay. The mitochondrial function and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were both detected. ChIP-Seq analysis was employed to discover the underlying molecular mechanism of PGC-1alpha-mediated neuroprotective effects. Our results showed that mitochondrial membrane potentials were increased and ROS production was decreased in PGC-1alpha overexpressing cells, which increased cell viability. The further bioinformatics analysis from ChIP-Seq data indicated that PGC-1alpha may participate in the regulation of apoptosis, autophagy, and mitophagy pathways in HT-22 cells. We found that PGC-1alpha promoted the LC3-II formation and reduced the neuronal apoptosis determined by TUNEL staining. In addition, PGC-1alpha upregulated the expressions of mitochondrial antioxidants, including SOD2, Trx2, and Prx3. In summary, our findings indicate that PGC-1alpha may attenuate OGD-induced hippocampal neuronal damage by regulating multiple mechanisms, like autophagy and mitochondrial function. Thus, PGC-1alpha may be a potential therapeutic target for hippocampal damage associated with cognitive impairment.
