39177131|t|Prostaglandins in the Inflamed Central Nervous System: Potential Therapeutic Targets.
39177131|a|The global burden of neurological disorders is evident, yet there remains limited efficacious therapeutics for their treatment. There is a growing recognition of the role of inflammation in diseases of the central nervous system (CNS); among the numerous inflammatory mediators involved, prostaglandins play a crucial role. Prostaglandins are small lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid via multi-enzymatic pathways. The actions of prostaglandins are varied, with each prostaglandin having a specific role in maintaining homeostasis. In the CNS, prostaglandins can have neuroprotective or neurotoxic properties depending on their specific G-protein receptor. These G-protein receptors have varying subfamilies, tissue distribution, and signal transduction cascades. Further studies into the impact of prostaglandins in CNS-based diseases may contribute to the clarification of their actions, hopefully leading to the development of efficacious therapeutic strategies. This review focuses on the roles played by prostaglandins in neural degeneration, with a focus on Alzheimer's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in both preclinical and clinical settings. We further discuss current prostaglandin-related agonists and antagonists concerning suggestions for their use as future therapeutics.
