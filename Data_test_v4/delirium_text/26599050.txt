26599050|t|Progression of Extrapyramidal Signs in Alzheimer's Disease: Clinical and Neuropathological Correlates.
26599050|a|BACKGROUND: Extrapyramidal signs (EPS) are frequent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and core manifestation of related diseases, i.e., dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease; furthermore, Lewy bodies and AD-type pathology occur in all three conditions. OBJECTIVE: To identify clusters of EPS progression over time and their clinical and neuropathological correlates. METHODS: 3,502 AD patients with longitudinal assessment from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database were included; 394 provided neuropathological data. k-means algorithm was employed to identify clusters of EPS progression and those were compared in terms of cognitive profile, neuropsychiatric features and neuropathological findings. RESULTS: Three clusters of EPS progression were identified: no/low (n = 1,583), medium (n = 1,259), and high (n = 660) EPS burden. Compared to those with no/low and medium EPS, those with high EPS had greater cognitive and neuropsychiatric impairment, specifically hallucinations. Despite similar AD-pathology across the three clusters, the high EPS cluster had a significantly number of subjects diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies. CONCLUSIONS: Cluster analysis of EPS progression over time identified different subgroups of AD patients with distinct clinical and neuropathological features.
