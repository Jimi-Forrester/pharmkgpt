38994870|t|An integrative exploration of environmental stressors on the microbiome-gut-brain axis and immune mechanisms promoting neurological disorders.
38994870|a|The microbiome-gut-brain axis is altered by environmental stressors such as heat, diet, and pollutants as well as microbes in the air, water, and soil. These stressors might alter the host's microbiome and symbiotic relationship by modifying the microbial composition or location. Compartmentalized mutualistic microbes promote the beneficial interactions in the host leading to circulating metabolites and hormones such as insulin and leptin that affect inter-organ functions. Inflammation and oxidative stress induced by environmental stressors may alter the composition, distribution, and activities of the microbes in the microbiomes such that the resultant metabolite and hormone changes are no longer beneficial. The microbiome-gut-brain axis and immune adverse changes that may accompany environmental stressors are reviewed for effects on innate and adaptive immune cells, which may make host immunity less responsive to pathogens and more reactive to self-antigens. Cardiovascular and fluid exchanges to organs might adversely alter organ functionality. Organs, especially the brain, need a consistent supply of nutrients and clearance of debris; disruption of these exchanges by stressors, and involvement of gut microbiome are discussed regarding neural dysfunctions with Alzheimer's disease, autistic spectrum disorders, viral infections, and autoimmune diseases. The focus of this review includes the manner in which environmental stressors may disrupt gut microbiota leading to adverse immune and hormonal influences on development of neuropathology related to hyperhomocysteinemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress, and how certain therapeutics may be beneficial. Strategies are explored to lessen detrimental effects of environmental stressors on central and peripheral health navigated toward (1) understanding neurological disorders and (2) promoting environmental and public health and well-being.
