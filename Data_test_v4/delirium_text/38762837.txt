38762837|a|The periodontium is a highly organized ecosystem, and the imbalance between oral microorganisms and host defense leads to periodontal diseases. The periodontal pathogens, mainly Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, colonize the periodontal niches or enter the blood circulation, resulting in periodontal tissue destruction and distal organ damage. This phenomenon links periodontitis with various systemic conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, malignant tumors, steatohepatitis, and Alzheimer's disease. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular self-degradation process essential for eliminating internalized pathogens. Nowadays, increasing studies have been carried out in cells derived from periodontal tissues, immune system, and distant organs to investigate the relationship between periodontal pathogen infection and autophagy-related activities. On one hand, as a vital part of innate and adaptive immunity, autophagy actively participates in host resistance to periodontal bacterial infection. On the other, certain periodontal pathogens exploit autophagic vesicles or pathways to evade immune surveillance, therefore achieving survival within host cells. This review provides an overview of the autophagy process and focuses on periodontopathogen-related autophagy and their involvements in cells of different tissue origins, so as to comprehensively understand the role of autophagy in the occurrence and development of periodontal diseases and various periodontitis-associated systemic illnesses.
