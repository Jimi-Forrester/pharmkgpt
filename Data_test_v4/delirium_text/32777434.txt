32777434|t|Therapeutic options for agitation in the intensive care unit.
32777434|a|Agitation is common in the intensive care unit (ICU). There are numerous contributing factors, including pain, underlying disease, withdrawal syndrome, delirium and some medication. Agitation can compromise patient safety through accidental removal of tubes and catheters, prolong the duration of stay in the ICU, and may be related to various complications. This review aims to analyse evidence-based medical literature to improve management of agitation and to consider pharmacological strategies. The non-pharmacological approach is considered to reduce the risk of agitation. Pharmacological treatment of agitated patients is detailed and is based on a judicious choice of neuroleptics, benzodiazepines and alpha2 agonists, and on whether a withdrawal syndrome is identified. Specific management of agitation in elderly patients, brain-injured patients and patients with sleep deprivation are also discussed. This review proposes a practical approach for managing agitation in the ICU.
