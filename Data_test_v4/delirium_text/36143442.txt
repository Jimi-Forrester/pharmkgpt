36143442|a|The main problem with using MSC (mesenchymal stem cells) to treat the deficient diseases of the central nervous system is the low cell survival rate after the transplant procedure and their low ability to spontaneously differentiate into functional neurons. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of genetically modifying MSC. A co-overexpression of two genes was performed: BCLXL was supposed to increase the resistance of the cells to the toxic agents and BDNF was supposed to direct cells into the neuronal differentiation pathway. As a result, it was possible to obtain the functional overexpression of the BCLXL and BDNF genes. These cells had an increased resistance to apoptosis-inducing toxicants (staurosporine, doxorubicin and H2O2). At the same time, the genes of the neuronal pathway (CHAT, TPH1) were overexpressed. The genetically modified MSC increased the survival rate under toxic conditions, which increased the chance of surviving a transplant procedure. The obtained cells can be treated as neural cell progenitors, which makes them a universal material that can be used in various disease models. The production of neurotransmitters suggests that cells transplanted into the brain and subjected to the additional influence of the brain's microenvironment, will be able to form synapses and become functional neurons.
