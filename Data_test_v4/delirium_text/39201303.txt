39201303|t|Interconnections between the Gut Microbiome and Alzheimer's Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Potential.
39201303|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is known to accumulate amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau protein. Clinical studies have not identified pathogenesis mechanisms or produced an effective cure for AD. The Abeta monoclonal antibody lecanemab reduces Abeta plaque formation for the treatment of AD, but more studies are required to increase the effectiveness of drugs to reduce cognitive decline. The lack of AD therapy targets and evidence of an association with an acute neuroinflammatory response caused by several bacteria and viruses in some individuals has led to the establishment of the infection hypothesis during the last 10 years. How pathogens cross the blood-brain barrier is highly topical and is seen to be pivotal in proving the hypothesis. This review summarizes the possible role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of AD and feasible therapeutic approaches and current research limitations.
