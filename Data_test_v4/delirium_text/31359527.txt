31359527|a|Nardostachys chinensis Batalin (Valerianaceae) has been widely used in different traditional systems of medicine, including Islamic, Ayurvedic, Chinese, and Korean folk medicine. It has been used in traditional medicine as a tranquilizer, hepatotonic, cardiotonic, diuretic, and analgesic. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies have provided valuable scientific evidence for its traditional uses. This review aims to summarize reported traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological potential of N. chinensis while identifying potential areas of further research of plant. The review comprises literature pertaining to the pharmacological potential and phytochemistry of N. chinensis using worldwide accepted scientific databases via electronic search (Elsevier, Google Scholar, Pub Med, Scopus, Springer, Wiley online library). Moreover, data from ethno botanical text books available in library and electronic search were also included. The Plant List and Kew Herbarium Catalogue databases were used to authenticate the scientific name. Different pharmacological experiments in many in vitro and in vivo models have proved the potential of N. chinensis, namely, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antibacterial, antihypertensive, antifungal, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, aldose reductase inhibition, and antioxidant activities. The plant contains sesquiterpenenes of various varieties including aristolane, guaiane, and nardosinane types. Moreover, it also contains coumarins, phenols, lignans, neolignans, and glycosides. Reported activities suggested that there may be pharmacological potential for developing N. chinensis as a drug for infections, hypertension, cardiac diseases, Alzheimer's disease, insomnia, epilepsy, cancer, gastric, and liver diseases. More toxicological studies should be performed that will aid the progress to clinical trial studies of N. chinensis.
