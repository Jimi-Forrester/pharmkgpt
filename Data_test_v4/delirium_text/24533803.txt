24533803|t|Peptide therapeutics in neurodegenerative disorders.
24533803|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by selective and progressive degeneration of neuronal population in the brain, and associated behavioural, motor, psychiatric and cognitive impairments. Aggregation of pathogenic proteins, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, transcriptional dysfunction and apoptosis play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Therefore, novel therapies that target each of these mechanisms may be effective in abating the symptoms and slow down the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. This review offers insights into the tremendous utility and versatility of peptides such as neurotrophins, neurotrophic factors (NGF, BDNF and GDNF), neuropeptides, mitochondrial targeted antioxidants/peptides, MitoQ, neurturin, and beta-sheet breaker peptides to address the mechanisms and pathogenesis associated with neurodegenerative disorders.
