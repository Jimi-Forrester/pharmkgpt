1374440|a|In a previous study, we reported marked depletion of neurotensin-immunoreactivity (NT-IR) within selected regions of the amygdala of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The significance of these observations was partly obscured largely because we lacked a thorough understanding of the innervation pattern of neurotensin in the normal human amygdala. Accordingly, in the present study, we used a polyclonal antibody against neurotensin to characterize the distribution and morphology of neurotensin-immunoreactive neuronal elements within the human amygdaloid complex. NT-IR occurred in a topographic manner that respected the cytoarchitectural boundaries of the amygdaloid subregions as defined by Nissl staining and acetylcholinesterase histochemistry. Most NT-IR in the amygdala was contained within beaded fibers and dot-like puncta. Within the subnuclei of the amygdala, immunoreactive neuritic elements were most dense within the central nucleus followed by the medial nucleus and intercalated nuclei. The anterior amygdaloid area, basal complex, paralaminar nucleus, cortical nucleus, cortical-amygdaloid transition area, and amygdalohippocampal area contained moderate densities of immunoreactivity. The accessory basal and lateral nuclei exhibited scant NT-IR. Immunoreactive neurons were found only within the anterior amygdaloid area and the central, medial, intercalated, and lateral capsular nuclei. The distribution of NT-immunoreactive processes and cell bodies within selected regions of the amygdala provides an anatomical substrate that may explain, in part, the neuromodulatory actions of neurotensin upon autonomic, endocrine, and memory systems.
