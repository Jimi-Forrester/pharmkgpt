35321665|t|Characteristics of Lyme optic neuritis: a case report of Lyme associated bilateral optic neuritis and systematic review of the literature.
35321665|a|Optic Neuritis is rare in Lyme borreliosis. The current knowledge of optic nerve involvement in Lyme borreliosis relies solely on case reports. The aim of this systematic review was to characterize and investigate the associated factors of optic neuritis in Lyme borreliosis. We further presented a very rare case of isolated bilateral optic neuritis in a Lyme seropositive patient.
