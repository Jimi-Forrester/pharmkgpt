34088523|t|The COVID-19 conundrum: Where both the virus and treatment contribute to delirium.
34088523|a|Whereas hospitalists and intensivists are treating the life-threatening respiratory conditions that often accompany COVID-19, delirium prevention, identification, and treatment may inadvertently be taking a backseat. However, delirium identification is important as it can serve as a key marker for hospital providers to identify COVID patients at risk for poor outcomes including ICU stay and death.2 COVID delirium has been difficult to manage because some COVID treatment methods are inherently deliriogenic and some medications traditionally used to manage delirium have been rendered ineffective among this population. Inpatient neurology and psychiatry practitioners are having to postulate new treatment techniques; one such medication algorithm can be found within this piece. It is important that delirium doesn't get lost in the chaos that is management of the COVID patient.
