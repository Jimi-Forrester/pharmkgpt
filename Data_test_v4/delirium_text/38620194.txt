38620194|a|The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted regular global activities in every possible way. This pandemic, caused by the transmission of the infectious Coronavirus, is characterized by main symptoms such as fever, fatigue, cough, and loss of smell. A current key focus of the scientific community is to develop automated methods that can effectively identify COVID-19 patients and are also adaptable for foreseen future virus outbreaks. To classify COVID-19 suspects, it is required to use contactless automatic measurements of more than one symptom. This study explores the effectiveness of using Deep Learning combined with a hardware-emulated system to identify COVID-19 patients in Sri Lanka based on two main symptoms: cough and shortness of breath. To achieve this, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on Transfer Learning was employed to analyze and compare the features of a COVID-19 cough with other types of coughs. Real-time video footage was captured using a FLIR C2 thermal camera and a web camera and subsequently processed using OpenCV image processing algorithms. The objective was to detect the nasal cavities in the video frames and measure the breath cycles per minute, thereby identifying instances of shortness of breath. The proposed method was first tested on crowd-sourced datasets (Coswara, Coughvid, ESC-50, and a dataset from Kaggle) obtained online. It was then applied and verified using a dataset obtained from local hospitals in Sri Lanka. The accuracy of the developed methodologies in diagnosing cough resemblance and recognizing shortness of breath was found to be 94% and 95%, respectively.
