34744433|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of the number of hospital readmissions on the risks of further hospital readmission and death after adjustment for a range of risk factors. METHODS: We performed a multicentre prospective study of the DAMAGE cohort in the Hauts-de-France region of France. Patients aged 75 and over hospitalized initially in an acute geriatric unit (AGU) were included and followed up for 12 months. The risk of hospital readmission was analyzed using a Cox model, and its extension for recurrent events and the risk of death were analyzed using a Cox model for time-dependent variables. RESULTS: A total of 3081 patients were included (mean (SD) age: 86.4 (5.5)). In the multivariate analysis, the relative risk (95% confidence interval [CI]) of hospital readmission rose progressively to 2.66 (1.44; 5.14), and the risk of death rose to 2.01 (1.23; 3.32) after five hospital admissions, relative to a patient with no hospital readmissions. The number of hospital readmissions during the follow-up period was the primary risk factor and the best predictor of the risk of hospital readmission and the risk of death. CONCLUSION: Hospital readmission is the primary risk factor for further hospital readmissions and for death in older subjects discharged from an AGU.
