33619704|t|Seizures and Epilepsy After Stroke: Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Management.
33619704|a|Stroke is the leading cause of seizures and epilepsy in older adults. Patients who have larger and more severe strokes involving the cortex, are younger, and have acute symptomatic seizures and intracerebral haemorrhage are at highest risk of developing post-stroke epilepsy. Prognostic models, including the SeLECT and CAVE scores, help gauge the risk of epileptogenesis. Early electroencephalogram and blood-based biomarkers can provide information additional to the clinical risk factors of post-stroke epilepsy. The management of acute versus remote symptomatic seizures after stroke is markedly different. The choice of an ideal antiseizure medication should not only rely on efficacy but also consider adverse effects, altered pharmacodynamics in older adults, and the influence on the underlying vascular co-morbidity. Drug-drug interactions, particularly those between antiseizure medications and anticoagulants or antiplatelets, also influence treatment decisions. In this review, we describe the epidemiology, risk factors, biomarkers, and management of seizures after an ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. We discuss the special considerations required for the treatment of post-stroke epilepsy due to the age, co-morbidities, co-medication, and vulnerability of stroke survivors.
