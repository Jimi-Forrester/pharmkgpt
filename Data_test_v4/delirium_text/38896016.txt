38896016|a|BACKGROUND: ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 1 is mostly known as a transporter for intracellular cholesterol efflux, and a number of studies indicate that ABCG1 also functions actively in tumor initiation and progression. This review aimed to provide an overall review of how ABCG1 acts in tumor progression. METHOD: A comprehensive searching about ABCG1 and tumor was conducted up to November 2023 using proper keywords through databases including PubMed and Web of Science. RESULT: Overall, ABCG1 plays a crucial role in the development of multiple tumorigenesis. ABCG1 enhances tumor-promoting ability through conferring stem-like properties to cancer cells and mediates chemoresistance in multiple cancers. Additionally, ABCG1 may act as a kinase to phosphorylate downstream molecules and induces tumor growth. In tumor microenvironment, ABCG1 plays a substantial role in immunity response through macrophages to create a tumor-favoring circumstance. CONCLUSION: High expression of ABCG1 is usually associated with poor prognosis, which means ABCG1 may be a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis of various cancers. ABCG1-targeted therapy may provide a novel treatment for cancer patients.
