37189690|t|Risk of New-Onset Dementia in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Statin Users: A Population-Based Cohort Study.
37189690|a|Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at a higher risk for developing dementia than the general population. Clinical studies have investigated the effects of statin use on new-onset dementia (NOD) in patients with CKD; however, the findings are inconsistent. This study examines the association between the use of statins and NOD in patients with CKD. We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study using the Taiwan Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database (2003-2016). The primary outcome assessed the risk of incident dementia by estimating the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Therefore, multiple Cox regression models were conducted to analyse the association between statin use and NOD in patients with CKD. There were 24,090 participants with statin use and 28,049 participants without statin use in patients with new-diagnosed CKD; the NOD event was 1390 and 1608, respectively. There was a trend of reduction association between statin users and NOD events after adjusted sex, age, comorbidities, and concurrent medication (adjusted HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00) in the 14 years of the follow-up. Sensitivity test for the propensity score 1:1 matched analyses showed similar results (adjusted HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.02). The subgroup analysis also identified the use of statins as having a trend against developing NOD in patients with hypertension. In conclusion, statin therapy may effectively reduce the risk of NOD in patients with CKD. More studies are needed to credibly evaluate the effects of statin therapy on the prevention of NOD in patients with CKD.
