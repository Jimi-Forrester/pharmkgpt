36051545|t|The relationship between TLR4/NF-kappaB/IL-1beta signaling, cognitive impairment, and white-matter integrity in patients with stable chronic schizophrenia.
36051545|a|Objective: Previous studies have implicated intricate interactions between innate immunity and the brain in schizophrenia. Monocytic Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling, a crucial "sensor" of innate immunity, was reported to be over-activated in link with cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. As TLR4 is predominantly expressed on gliocytes prior to expression in neurons, we hypothesized that higher TLR4 levels may contribute to cognitive deterioration by affecting white matter microstructure. Methods: Forty-four patients with stable chronic schizophrenia (SCS) and 59 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in this study. The monocytic function was detected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation to simulate bacterial infection. Basal and LPS- stimulated levels of TLR4, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), and interleukin (IL)-1beta were quantified with flow cytometry. Cognitive function was assessed by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and psychopathological symptoms were evaluated by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). We employed diffusion tensor imaging with a 3-T scanner and evaluated white-matter integrity with fractional anisotropy (FA). Subcortical volume and cortical thickness were also assessed. Results: The TLR4/NF-kappaB/IL-1beta signaling pathway was activated in patients with SCS, but responded sluggishly to LPS stimulation when compared with HCs. Furthermore, monocytic TLR4 expressions were inversely correlated with cognitive function and white matter FA, but not with cortical thickness or subcortical gray matter volume in schizophrenia. Conclusion: Our findings support altered TLR4 signaling pathway activity in association with deficits in cognition and white matter integrity in schizophrenia.
