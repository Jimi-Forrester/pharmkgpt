10849910|a|Cortico-basal degeneration (CBD) or cortico-basal ganglionic degeneration is a condition characterised by selective cortical atrophy of parietal and in a lesser extent, frontal lobe associated with dysfunction of the basal ganglia. The clinical symptoms of CBD, predominantly extrapyramidal signs (bradykinesia and rigidity) and apraxia, affect often only one body side in the onset phase, with the left one being more frequent. Neuropathological studies reveal neuronal loss, gliosis, and achromasia chiefly in frontal and parietal cortex, as well as in basal ganglia and substantia nigra. Functional investigations, such as SPECT, disclose similar distribution of abnormalities (hypometabolism). The aetiology and causative treatment of CBD are unknown. The authors highlight the diagnostic difficulties in CBD including a necessity of a prolonged patient's observation in order to ascertain the differential diagnosis of other neurodegenerative disorders, in particular progressive supranuclear palsy, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
