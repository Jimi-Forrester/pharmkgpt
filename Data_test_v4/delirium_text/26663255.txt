26663255|t|Development and Application of a Virtual Screening Protocol for the Identification of Multitarget Fragments.
26663255|a|In this study, we report on a virtual ligand screening protocol optimized to identify fragments endowed with activity at multiple targets. Thanks to this protocol, we were able to identify a fragment that displays activity in the low-micromolar range at both beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta). These two structurally and physiologically unrelated enzymes likely contribute, through different pathways, to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, their simultaneous inhibition holds great potential in exerting a profound effect on AD. In perspective, the strategy outlined herein can be adapted to other target combinations.
