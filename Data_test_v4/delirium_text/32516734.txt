32516734|t|The Biogenesis and Functions of piRNAs in Human Diseases.
32516734|a|Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a novel type of small noncoding RNAs, which are 26-30 nt in length and bind to Piwi proteins. These short RNAs were originally discovered in germline cells and are considered as key regulators for germline maintenance. A growing body of evidence has now extended our views into piRNA biological significance showing that they can also regulate gene expression in somatic cells through transposon silencing, epigenetic programming, DNA rearrangements, mRNA turnover, and translational control. Mounting studies have revealed that the dysregulation of piRNAs may cause epigenetic changes and contribute to diverse diseases. This review illustrates piRNA biogenesis, mechanisms behind piRNA-mediated gene regulation, and changes of piRNAs in different diseases, especially in cancers.
