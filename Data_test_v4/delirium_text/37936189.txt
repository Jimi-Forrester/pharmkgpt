37936189|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and movement impairment. Based on theories, neuroinflammatory processes may be vital in the etiology of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Reports show that rotenone has neurotoxic, inflammatory, and motor impairment effects in PD. Sericin is a natural polymer with effective properties, such as neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effects of sericin administration on motor dysfunction by modulating inflammation and tyrosine kinase B/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (TrkB/BDNF) pathway in the rotenone-induced PD model. METHODS: Wistar male rats (3-months-old) were treated with rotenone (2 mg/kg every 48 h for 30 days) to induce a rotenone-induced PD model. Also, sericin was administered orally at dose of 200 mg/kg every 48 h for 30 days. Rotarod and bar tests were performed for motor dysfunction. The protein levels of BDNF, c-fos, TrkB, tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and catalase activity were evaluated in the striatum area. RESULTS: Results showed that sericin increased latent time in the rotarod test and decreased the time staying on the pole in the bar test compared to the PD group (P < 0.001 for both tests). Moreover, sericin treatments decreased TNF-alpha (P < 0.001) and IL-6 (P < 0.001) concentration levels and enhanced the levels of BDNF (P < 0.001), c-fos (P < 0.001), TrkB (P < 0.001) proteins and catalase activity (P < 0.05) in the striatum area compared to the PD group. CONCLUSION: These results support a protective benefit of sericin therapy in a rotenone-induced PD paradigm by reducing motor impairment, inflammatory response, and disruption of the TrkB/BDNF signaling pathway.
