35388891|a|BACKGROUND: Wearable devices have been proposed as a novel method for monitoring patients after surgery to track recovery, identify complications early, and improve surgical safety. Previous studies have used a heterogeneous range of devices, methods, and analyses. This review aimed to examine current methods and wearable devices used for monitoring after abdominal surgery and identify knowledge gaps requiring further investigation. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted given the heterogeneous nature of the evidence. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus databases were systematically searched. Studies of wearable devices for monitoring of adult patients within 30 days after abdominal surgery were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: A total of 78 articles from 65 study cohorts, with 5153 patients were included. Thirty-one different wearable devices were used to measure vital signs, physiological measurements, or physical activity. The duration of postoperative wearable device use ranged from 15 h to 3 months after surgery. Studies mostly focused on physical activity metrics (71.8 per cent). Continuous vital sign measurement and physical activity tracking both showed promise for detecting postoperative complications earlier than usual care, but conclusions were limited by poor device precision, adherence, occurrence of false alarms, data transmission problems, and retrospective data analysis. Devices were generally well accepted by patients, with high levels of acceptance, comfort, and safety. CONCLUSION: Wearable technology has not yet realized its potential to improve postoperative monitoring. Further work is needed to overcome technical limitations, improve precision, and reduce false alarms. Prospective assessment of efficacy, using an intention-to-treat approach should be the focus of further studies.
