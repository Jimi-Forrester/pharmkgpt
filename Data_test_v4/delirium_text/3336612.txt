3336612|t|Psychiatric disorders in the elderly. Psychopharmacologic management.
3336612|a|Psychiatric management of elderly patients is a challenging task because of the many age-related physiologic changes and medical problems in this population. Thorough patient evaluation is essential to rule out somatic disorders and determine underlying causes. Somatic complaints must be taken seriously, even if a patient is receiving treatment for a psychiatric disorder. Psychotropic therapy is used mainly for controlling depression, agitation, and psychotic symptoms. If psychiatric symptoms persist or become worse, psychotropics should be discontinued to prevent possible drug toxicity (eg, anticholinergic delirium) and psychiatric consultation should be requested.
