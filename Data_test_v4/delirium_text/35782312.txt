35782312|a|The discovery and development of new potent antimicrobial and antioxidant agents is an essential lever to protect living beings against pathogenic microorganisms and free radicals. In this regard, new functionalized pyrazoles have been synthesized using a simple and accessible approach. The synthesized aminobenzoylpyrazoles 3a-h and pyrazole-sulfonamides 4a-g were obtained in good yields and were evaluated in vitro for their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. The structures of the synthesized compounds were determined using IR, NMR, and mass spectrometry. The structure of the compound 4b was further confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The results of the in vitro screening show that the synthesized pyrazoles 3 and 4 exhibit a promising antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Among the tested compounds, pyrazoles 3a, 3f, 4e, 4f, and 4g have exhibited remarkable antimicrobial activity against some microorganisms. In addition, compounds 3a, 3c, 3e, 4a, 4d, 4f, and 4g have shown a significant antioxidant activity in comparison with the standard butylhydroxytoluene (BHT). Hence, compounds 3a, 4f, and 4g represent interesting dual acting antimicrobial and antioxidant agents. In fact, pyrazole derivatives bearing sulfonamide moiety (4a-g) have displayed an important antimicrobial activity compared to pyrazoles 3a-h, this finding could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the pyrazole and sulfonamide pharmacophores. Furthermore, Molecular docking results revealed a good interaction of the synthesized compounds with the target proteins and provided important information about their interaction modes with the target enzyme. The results of the POM bioinformatics investigations (Petra, Osiris, Molinspiration) show that the studied heterocycles present a very good non toxicity profile, an excellent bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics. Finally, an antiviral pharmacophore (O delta-, O delta-) was evaluated in the POM investigations and deserves all our attention to be tested against Covid-19 and its Omicron and Delta mutants.
