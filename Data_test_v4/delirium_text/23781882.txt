23781882|t|Effect of dexmedetomidine on plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor: A double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled study.
23781882|a|BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has neuro-protective effects, but the clinical mechanism remains unclear. METHOD: Forty patients were randomly divided into two groups: group A (control) and group B (treated with DEX). Plasma concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were determined in blood samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays at five time points: T1 (baseline), T2 (15 minutes after intubation and before the surgery was started), T3 (the end of surgery), T4 (10 minutes after extubation in the post-anesthesia care unit), and T5 (24 hours after the surgery). Changes in bispect (BIS) index, heart rates, and doses of anesthetics used for induction were also recorded. RESULTS: Baseline plasma concentrations of BDNF did not differ between group A and group B; 15 minutes after induction, concentrations of plasma BDNF were significantly reduced in group A. Twenty-four hours after surgery, the concentration was still higher in group B than in group A. In contrast, plasma concentrations of BDNF at other time points tested did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION: It appears that DEX could reverse the reduced plasma concentrations of BDNF caused by anesthetics, and this effect lasted for 24 hours after surgery.
