35949705|a|Given that the global population of elderly individuals is expanding and the difficulty of recovery, hip fractures will be a huge challenge and a critical health issue for all of humanity. Although people have spent more time at home during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, hip fractures show no sign of abating. Extensive studies have shown that patients with hip fracture and COVID-19 have a multifold increase in mortality compared to those uninfected and a more complex clinical condition. At present, no detailed research has systematically analyzed the relationship between these two conditions and proposed a comprehensive solution. This article aims to systematically review the impact of COVID-19 on hip fracture and provide practical suggestions. We found that hip fracture patients with COVID-19 have higher mortality rates and more complicated clinical outcomes. Indirectly, COVID-19 prevents hip fracture patients from receiving regular medical treatment. With regard to the problems we encounter, we provide clinical recommendations based on existing research evidence and a clinical flowchart for the management of hip fracture patients who are COVID-19 positive. Our study will help clinicians adequately prepare in advance when dealing with such patients and optimize treatment decisions.
