38139349|a|The discovery of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in the early 1980s by Nobel Prize winners in medicine Robin Warren and Barry Marshall led to a revolution in physiopathology and consequently in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Subsequently, H. pylori has also been linked to non-gastrointestinal diseases, such as autoimmune thrombocytopenia, acne rosacea, and Raynaud's syndrome. In addition, several studies have shown an association with cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. Our narrative review aims to investigate the connection between H. pylori infection, gut microbiota, and extra-gastric diseases, with a particular emphasis on atherosclerosis. We conducted an extensive search on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, using the keywords "H. pylori", "dysbiosis", "microbiota", "atherosclerosis", "cardiovascular disease" in the last ten years. Atherosclerosis is a complex condition in which the arteries thicken or harden due to plaque deposits in the inner lining of an artery and is associated with several cardiovascular diseases. Recent research has highlighted the role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of this group of diseases. H. pylori is able to both directly influence the onset of atherosclerosis and negatively modulate the microbiota. H. pylori is an important factor in promoting atherosclerosis. Progress is being made in understanding the underlying mechanisms, which could open the way to interesting new therapeutic perspectives.
