33729151|a|With the continuous improvement of treatment ability in intensive care unit (ICU), many critically ill and complex patients have survived due to the development of technology. However, most of them suffer from the psychological and physiological problems of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Therefore, the early identification and prevention of PICS is particularly critical. We should understand the pathophysiological mechanism of PICS, strictly implement ABCDEFG bundle management measures [including airway management (A), breath (B), reasonable analgesia and sedation treatment (C), prevention of delirium (D), early rehabilitation (E), family engagement (F), good communication (G)] during ICU hospitalization, and pay attention to reasonable nutritional support, optimizing blood glucose management, providing positive psychological intervention and support to patients through family members' encouragement and accompanying, ICU diary and other forms, following up the health status of patients transferred out/discharged from ICU, providing multi-disciplinary and professional continuing medical services, finding the entry point and timing of traditional Chinese medicine intervention, and giving full play to the advantages of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment, which can improve the quality of life of patients. This article reviews the pathophysiological mechanism, risk factors, prevention and management measures, traditional Chinese medicine syndrome differentiation and treatment of PICS, in order to improve the early identification, diagnosis and treatment of critical patients with PICS, and improve the prognosis of patients.
