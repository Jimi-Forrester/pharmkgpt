38653878|a|Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP) have a certain curative effect on hypoglycemic and neuroprotective effects, but the specific mechanism is unclear and needs to be further explored. This study aimed to clarify the mechanisms of LBP in the treatment of ICV-STZ mice model of AD from the perspectives of insulin resistance, IRS1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and synaptic protein expression. We used male C57BL/6J mice injected with STZ (3 mg/kg) in the lateral ventricle as an AD model. After treatment with LBP, the learning and memory abilities of ICV-STZ mice were enhanced, and the pathological changes in brain tissue were alleviated. LBP can regulate the expression of proteins related to the IRS1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and thereby reducing Abeta deposition and tau protein phosphorylation in the brain of ICV-STZ mice. In addition, LBP also can up-regulate the expression of synaptic proteins. The results indicated that LBP played a neuroprotective role by regulating the IRS1/PI3K/AKT pathway, inhibiting tau protein hyperphosphorylation and improving the expression levels of synapse-related proteins.
