37947589|t|SUMOylation Modulates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Levels and Acts as a Protective Mechanism in the Type 2 Model of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy.
37947589|a|Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the prevalent type of peripheral neuropathy; it primarily impacts extremity nerves. Its multifaceted nature makes the molecular mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy intricate and incompletely elucidated. Several types of post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been implicated in the development and progression of DPN, including phosphorylation, glycation, acetylation and SUMOylation. SUMOylation involves the covalent attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to target proteins, and it plays a role in various cellular processes, including protein localization, stability, and function. While the specific relationship between high blood glucose and SUMOylation is not extensively studied, recent evidence implies its involvement in the development of DPN in type 1 diabetes. In this study, we investigated the impact of SUMOylation on the onset and progression of DPN in a type 2 diabetes model using genetically modified mutant mice lacking SUMOylation, specifically in peripheral sensory neurons (SNS-Ubc9-/-). Behavioural measurement for evoked pain, morphological analyses of nerve fibre loss in the epidermis, measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and antioxidant molecules were analysed over several months in SUMOylation-deficient and control mice. Our longitudinal analysis at 30 weeks post-high-fat diet revealed that SNS-Ubc9-/- mice exhibited earlier and more pronounced thermal and mechanical sensation loss and accelerated intraepidermal nerve fibre loss compared to control mice. Mechanistically, these changes are associated with increased levels of ROS both in sensory neuronal soma and in peripheral axonal nerve endings in SNS-Ubc9-/- mice. In addition, we observed compromised detoxifying potential, impaired respiratory chain complexes, and reduced levels of protective lipids in sensory neurons upon deletion of SUMOylation in diabetic mice. Importantly, we also identified mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH2) as a SUMOylation target, the activity of which is negatively regulated by SUMOylation. Our results indicate that SUMOylation is an essential neuroprotective mechanism in sensory neurons in type 2 diabetes, the deletion of which causes oxidative stress and an impaired respiratory chain, resulting in energy depletion and subsequent damage to sensory neurons.
