37781802|t|Gout and the Prevalence of Dementia: A Nationwide Population-Based Study.
37781802|a|BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia in patients with gout is associated with a low risk of neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia. However, the prevalence of dementia in patients with gout has not yet been reported. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the prevalence of dementia among patients diagnosed with gout by utilizing the Health Insurance and Review Assessment database, a nationwide registry of the South Korean population. METHODS: Data from the Health Insurance and Review Assessment database of patients diagnosed with gout between 2011 and 2018 were extracted. The annual prevalence of dementia according to age and sex was analyzed. We investigated whether there was an association between comorbidities and gout medication in patients with both gout and dementia and in patients with only gout. RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2018, the age-adjusted prevalence of dementia per 100,000 persons ranged from 54.0 (95% confidence interval: 47.7-60.2) to 69.9 (95% confidence interval: 65.3-74.5). Compared to previous studies, the prevalence of dementia was lower in patients with gout than in the general population. Patients with both gout and dementia were more likely to be women, have a wide range of comorbidities, and be prescribed gout-related drugs, including allopurinol, febuxostat, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and steroids than patients with gout without dementia. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a relatively low prevalence of dementia in patients with gout. Gout, characterized by hyperuricemia, might be associated with a reduced risk of dementia.
