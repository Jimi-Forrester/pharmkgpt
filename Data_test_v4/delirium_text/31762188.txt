31762188|a|Abnormal generation of neurotoxic amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) 42/43 species due to mutations in the catalytic presenilin 1 (PS1) subunit of gamma-secretase is the major cause of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Deeper mechanistic insight on the generation of Abeta43 is still lacking, and it is unclear whether gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) can reduce the levels of this Abeta species. By comparing several types of Abeta43-generating FAD mutants, we observe that very high levels of Abeta43 are often produced when presenilin function is severely impaired. Altered interactions of C99, the precursor of Abeta, are found for all mutants and are independent of their particular effect on Abeta production. Furthermore, unlike previously described GSMs, the novel compound RO7019009 can effectively lower Abeta43 production of all mutants. Finally, substrate-binding competition experiments suggest that RO7019009 acts mechanistically after initial C99 binding. We conclude that altered C99 interactions are a common feature of diverse types of PS1 FAD mutants and that also patients with Abeta43-generating FAD mutations could in principle be treated by GSMs.
