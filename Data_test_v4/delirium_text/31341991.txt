31341991|a|In the Neurology Clerkship at our institution, we introduced a medical education curriculum to increase student competency in providing discharge education to patients with neurologic disease, and to increase knowledge of QI principles. The curriculum was peer-based, in that it was developed by medical students, experienced by medical student clerks, and modified over time with their feedback, which was tracked using exit surveys. Patients counseled were predominantly male (67%) and white (55%), with stroke or TIA together representing the most common diagnoses (58%). A high proportion of students (>85%) agreed that the clerkship project was effective in teaching discharge education, the risk factors for readmission, and increased confidence in providing discharge education. We conclude that medical students are poised to learn QI principals through practice-based curricula, and through practice may improve the quality and safety of care for patients with neurologic disease. This curriculum can be implemented within other services, and with different learners.
