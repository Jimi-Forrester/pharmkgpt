33585109|t|Psychotic Symptoms in Heroin Withdrawal: A Case Report.
33585109|a|Opiate withdrawal-induced severe exacerbation of psychosis after the sudden withdrawal of an opiate is a known yet uncommon clinical manifestation. We present the case of opiate withdrawal-induced psychosis in a 25-year-old married male patient without any prior psychiatric history of illness, family history, or past hospitalization records. The patient presented with psychotic symptoms such as irritability, delusions of parasitosis, and auditory and visual hallucinations at the time of hospitalization. Symptoms were in a fluctuating course and were not constant throughout the day. Through this case report, our aim is to present a rare instance of heroin-withdrawal-induced psychosis and its successful treatment with antipsychotics.
