37506882|t|First-Onset Psychosis after COVID-19 Infection: A Systematic Review of the Literature.
37506882|a|BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been an inciting factor for a wide variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including first-episode psychosis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the current literature on COVID-19 associated post-viral first-episode psychosis (FEP). METHODS: A systematic review was completed using PRISMA guidelines and identified 81 articles that met inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Articles included case reports, case series, and cohort studies with post-viral FEP occurring outside the setting of delirium, demonstrating a broad range of symptoms. CONCLUSION: This systematic review shows that post-viral FEP associated with COVID-19 follows a pattern similar to psychosis associated with other viral infections, and is an important consideration when building a differential for first-episode psychosis when delirium has been ruled out. Better understanding post-viral FEP associated with COVID-19 and other viral illnesses may help clarify aspects of underlying pathophysiology of psychotic symptoms broadly.
