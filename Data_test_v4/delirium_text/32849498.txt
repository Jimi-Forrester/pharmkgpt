32849498|a|Animal experiments and clinical trials have shown that the gut microbiota modulates host immunity and immune checkpoint-mediated responses to tumor cells. However, it remains unclear whether microbiota can also play a role in the tumor immune response of gammadeltaT cells, a kind of cell that targets cancer directly. Here, we report that microbiota dysbiosis induced by antibiotics enhanced gammadeltaT cell efficacy during tumor therapy in a mouse model. Further microbiota and metabolite analysis revealed that the alteration of gammadeltaT cell cytotoxicity might be closely associated with specific metabolites, which are produced by intestinal bacteria and stimulate gammadeltaT cells to release more cytotoxic cytokines, such as granzyme B and perforin. Among the metabolites that we analyzed, 3-indopropionic acid (IPA) showed the highest concentration in antibiotic-treated mice and can improve the cytotoxic ability of gammadeltaT cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our research determined how the gut microbiota can influence the antitumor ability of gammadeltaT cells and identified potential intermediate molecules that connect the gut microbiota and gammadeltaT cells.
