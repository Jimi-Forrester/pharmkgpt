37109584|a|BACKGROUND: Thrombolysis treatment for ischaemic stroke in patients with pre-existing disabilities, including cognitive impairment, remains controversial. Previous studies have suggested functional outcomes post-thrombolysis are worse in patients with cognitive impairment. This study aimed to compare and explore factors contributing to thrombolysis outcomes, including haemorrhagic complications, in cognitively and non-cognitively impaired patients with ischaemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 428 ischaemic stroke patients who were thrombolysed between January 2016 and February 2021 was performed. Cognitive impairment was defined as a diagnosis of dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or clinical evidence of the condition. The outcome measures included morbidity (using NIHSS and mRS), haemorrhagic complications, and mortality, and were analysed using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: The analysis of the cohort revealed that 62 patients were cognitively impaired. When compared to those without cognitive impairment, this group showed worse functional status at discharge (mRS 4 vs. 3, p < 0.001) and a higher probability of dying within 90 days (OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.85-6.01, p < 0.001). A higher risk of a fatal ICH post-thrombolysis was observed in the cognitively impaired patients, and, after controlling for covariates, cognitive impairment remained a significant predictor of a fatal haemorrhage (OR 4.79, 95% CI 1.24-18.45, p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitively impaired ischaemic stroke patients experience increased morbidity, mortality, and haemorrhagic complications following thrombolytic therapy. However cognitive status is not independently predictive of most outcome measures. Further work is required to elucidate contributing factors to the poor outcomes observed in these patients and help guide thrombolysis decision-making in clinical practice.
