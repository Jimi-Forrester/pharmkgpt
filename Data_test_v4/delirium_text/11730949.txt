11730949|a|Muscarinic M2-M5 muscarinic cholinergic receptors were investigated in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with mild cognitive impairment of the Alzheimer's type (MCIAT), probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and probable vascular dementia (VaD). [3H]-N-methyl scopolamine (NMS) in the presence of muscarinic antagonists and Mamba venom to occlude different receptor subtypes was used as radioligand. Analysis of [3H]-NMS binding curves without receptor subtype assessment resulted in a slight decrease of receptor density in AD patients. Evaluation of receptor subtypes in MCIAT and AD patients revealed a decrease of M3 receptor by more than 50%, an increase of M4 receptor expression by about 20% and no changes of M2 or M5 receptors. The expression of M2-M5 receptors was unaltered in VaD patients. Strong positive and negative correlations respectively were found between the density of lymphocyte M3 and M4 receptors and MMSE score in both MCIAT (0.78 for M3 receptor and 0.80 for M4 receptor) and AD (0.82 for M3 receptor and 0.83 for M4 receptor) patients. These findings suggest that changes in the expression of peripheral blood lymphocyte M3 and M4 receptors in AD are related to the degree of cognitive impairment. Assessment of lymphocyte muscarinic receptor subtypes may contribute to characterization of cholinergic impairment in AD.
