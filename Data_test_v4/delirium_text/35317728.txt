35317728|t|Correlation between microRNA-320 and postoperative delirium in patients undergoing tibial fracture internal fixation surgery.
35317728|a|BACKGROUND: Although the incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) in the elderly after surgery are rising as individuals are living longer, the pathogenesis of POD remains poorly understood. It has been suggested that miRNA-320 may play a role in POD based on animal study and human study. METHODS: We first carried out an animal study, and designed and conducted a human study based on the result of animal study. The aged rats were randomly assigned to five groups: the control (C), anesthesia and surgery (AS), saline (NS), agomir-320 (AG), and antagomir-320 (AT) groups. Postoperative spatial learning and memory in rats were analyzed by the Morris water maze and the open field tests. The plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteins, miRNA320 and IGF-1mRNA were measured by ELISA and qRT-PCR, respectively. A total of 240 Chinese Han patients over 65 years who underwent tibial fracture internal fixation were included in the PNDABLE study. POD cases and non-POD controls (1:1 matched) were selected by an anesthesiologist using Confusion Assessment Method. RESULTS: For Group AS, the escape latency was significantly longer and the ratio of time spent in the target quadrant was significantly reduced, APP and miR-320 were upregulated and IGF-1mRNA was downregulated compared with Group C. For Group AG, the escape latency was significantly longer and the ratio of time spent in the target quadrant was significantly reduced, APP and miR-320 were upregulated and IGF-1mRNA was downregulated compared with Group AS. For Group AT, the escape latency was significantly reduced and the ratio of time spent in the target quadrant was significantly longer, APP and miR-320 were downregulated and IGF-1mRNAwas upregulated compared with Group AS. Compared with NPOD patients, the expressions of plasma miR-320 and APP protein were increased and the expression of plasma IGF-1 mRNA was decreased in POD patients after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: MiRNA-320 might play a role in up-regulating the levels of IGF-1mRNA and APP protein, which offered a new target for POD treatment.
