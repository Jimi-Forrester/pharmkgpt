This study is conducted to investigate the responsiveness level and its effect on service quality from the hospitalized older adults' viewpoints during the COVID-19 pandemic in the south of Iran. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional descriptive-analytic study that was conducted on 386 old patients. The study instrument was a standard questionnaire that includes three sections of demographic information, World Health Organization Responsiveness, and SERVQUAL. Data were analyzed applying descriptive and inferential statistics the same as Independent T-test, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: The mean levels of responsiveness and service quality were 90.72 +- 9.38 (from 160) and 68.01 +- 8.51 (from 110) respectively. This indicates the average level of these variables from the old patients' viewpoints. There was a significant positive correlation between responsiveness and service quality (r = 0.585). According to the results of multiple linear regression, the dimensions of communication, dignity, prompt attention, primary facilities, social support, information confidentiality, right to choose, and autonomy were identified as the predictors of service quality. CONCLUSION: The average level of responsiveness and service quality perceived from the old patients' viewpoints during the COVID-19 pandemic can be considered a necessity for supportive planning among the older adults. Meanwhile, according to the impacts of responsiveness on service quality, educational programs are recommended to promote the level of healthcare providers' responsiveness.
