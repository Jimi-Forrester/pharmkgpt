24147552|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that are around 22 nucleotides in length. miRNAs play a key role in neuronal development, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity. An increasing amount of evidence indicates that miRNAs regulate the expression of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), a key enzyme in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Changes in miRNA expression as a causal factor in AD have not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that the abnormal expression of miRNAs may contribute to AD pathology, specifically through the regulation of BACE1.
