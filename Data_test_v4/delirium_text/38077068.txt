38077068|t|Traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's Disease biomarkers: A systematic review of findings from amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET).
38077068|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been discussed as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its association with dementia risk and earlier cognitive symptom onset. However, the mechanisms behind this relationship are unclear. Some studies have suggested TBI may increase pathological protein deposition in an AD-like pattern; others have failed to find such associations. This review covers literature that uses positron emission tomography (PET) of amyloid-beta and/or tau to examine subjects with history of TBI who are at risk for AD due to advanced age. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on January 9, 2023, and 24 resulting citations met inclusion criteria. Common methodological concerns included small samples, limited clinical detail about subjects' TBI, recall bias due to reliance on self-reported TBI, and an inability to establish causation. For both amyloid and tau, results were widespread but inconsistent. The regions which showed the most compelling evidence for increased amyloid deposition were the cingulate gyrus, cuneus/precuneus, and parietal lobe. Evidence for increased tau was strongest in the medial temporal lobe, entorhinal cortex, precuneus, and frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. However, conflicting findings across most regions of interest in both amyloid- and tau-PET studies indicate the critical need for future work in expanded samples and with greater clinical detail to offer a clearer picture of the relationship between TBI and protein deposition in older subjects at risk for AD.
