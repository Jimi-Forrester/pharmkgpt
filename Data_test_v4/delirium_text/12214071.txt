12214071|t|Localization of active forms of C-jun kinase (JNK) and p38 kinase in Alzheimer's disease brains at different stages of neurofibrillary degeneration.
12214071|a|The principal protein component of paired helical filaments (PHFs) in Alzheimer disease is abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau (PHF-tau). The stress activated protein kinases JNK and p38 have been shown to phosphorylate tau at some sites only seen in PHF-tau. If JNK and p38 are involved in the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau, they should be activated in neurons undergoing neurofibrillary degeneration. In the present study, we determined the intracellular and regional distribution of the active forms of JNK and p38 kinase in entorhinal, hippocampal, and temporal cortices of brains staged for neurofibrillary changes according to Braak and Braak. Neurons with tangle-like inclusions positive for active forms of JNK and p38 kinase were found to appear first in the Pre-alpha layer of the entorhinal cortex, and then extend into other brain regions co-incident with the progressive sequence of neurofibrillary changes. The intraneuronal accumulation of active forms of JNK and p38 kinase apeared to precede the deposition of amyloid in the extracellular space. These data indicate that increased activation of the stress related kinases JNK and p38 occurs very early in the disease and might be involved in the intraneuronal protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation imbalance that leads to neurofibrillary degeneration in Alzheimer disease.
