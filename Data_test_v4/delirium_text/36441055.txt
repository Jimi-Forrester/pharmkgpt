36441055|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that disrupts neuropsychological activity and hinders the development of mental capacity. Efficient AD therapy is a major challenge in biological studies. Alzheimer's condition cannot be cured with any particular medication. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of multidisciplinary collaborative nursing and cognitive stimulation therapy (MCN- CST) on daily activities, quality of life, and cognitive performance in AD patients. The inclusion/exclusion method is initially used to gather information about AD patients. Control and investigative teams were formed with its own set of functions. The control group gets a regular course of treatment, whereas, the investigation group receives MCN-CST. To ensure that our study is as practical and useful, we compare our findings to existing nursing approaches. The ANOVA and Chi-Square tests are used to assess the conditions of Alzheimer's patients. There was a scientifically significant improvement in the overall level of their medical condition after implementing MCN-CST. Nursing protocols developed MCN-CST is beneficial in improving patients' quality of life, cognitive function, and daily activities. It is encouraged to do intensive research using many samples drawn from a wider range of people.
