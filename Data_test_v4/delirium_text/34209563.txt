34209563|a|Propionic acid bacteria are the source of many metabolites, e.g., propionic acid and trehalose. Compared to microbiological synthesis, the production of these metabolites by petrochemical means or enzymatic conversion is more profitable. The components of microbiological media account for a large part of the costs associated with propionic fermentation, due to the high nutritional requirements of Propionibacterium. This problem can be overcome by formulating a medium based on the by-products of technological processes, which can act as nutritional sources and at the same time replace expensive laboratory preparations (e.g., peptone and yeast extract). The metabolic activity of P. freudenreichii was investigated in two different breeding environments: in a medium containing peptone, yeast extract, and biotin, and in a waste-based medium consisting of only apple pomace and potato wastewater. The highest production of propionic acid amounting to 14.54 g/L was obtained in the medium containing apple pomace and pure laboratory supplements with a yield of 0.44 g/g. Importantly, the acid production parameters in the waste medium reached almost the same level (12.71 g/L, 0.42 g/g) as the medium containing pure supplements. Acetic acid synthesis was more efficient in the waste medium; it was also characterized by a higher level of accumulated trehalose (59.8 mg/g d.s.). Thus, the obtained results show that P. freudenreichii bacteria exhibited relatively high metabolic activity in an environment with apple pomace used as a carbon source and potato wastewater used as a nitrogen source. This method of propioniate production could be cheaper and more sustainable than the chemical manner.
