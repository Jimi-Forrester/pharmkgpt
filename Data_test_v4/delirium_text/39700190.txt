39700190|t|A comprehensive scoping review of intergenerational dance programmes for cohorts with a generational gap.
39700190|a|INTRODUCTION: Loneliness and physical inactivity are issues that affect both young people and older adults. This can have negative health outcomes and well as high costs on health services. Physical activity can positively influence both physical and psychosocial health outcomes, however enjoyment is necessary for adherence. Combining exercise with arts-based activities can improve enjoyment for older adults and young people. Dance has been found to be a safe and enjoyable form of physical activity that can be equally or more effective than conventional exercise options. Intergenerational interventions can improve relationships between generations. The aim of this scoping review was to collate and map the available evidence for intergenerational dance. METHODS: This scoping review followed the guidance outlined by the Joanna Briggs Institute. A systematic search of nine multidisciplinary databases and four repositories was conducted. Inclusion criteria were intergenerational dance or movement to music programmes. Exclusion criteria included dance movement therapy or groups with less than one generational gap. Data were extracted and summarised using narrative synthesis and research papers were appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. RESULTS: The search identified eleven research studies, seven expert opinion/practice expertise and 13 sources from the grey literature. Dance classes were typically 11-12 weeks long. Genres varied with some programmes including co-creation through choreography. Experiences and social outcomes were the most assessed outcomes, with a lack of studies examining physical outcomes. Participants reported enjoying the programmes stating they felt proud for taking part and looked forward to sessions. The term intergenerational was not defined in any paper. CONCLUSIONS: Intergenerational dance is an emerging area of research. Many programmes run in communities but are not researched, therefore several gaps remain. More large-scale trials are needed around intergenerational dance. Definitions and descriptions of dance and intergenerational activity should be considered in future studies to ensure consistency.
