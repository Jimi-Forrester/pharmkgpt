L. taiwanensis has long been proposed to be a probiotic whereas understanding on this species is still in its infancy. Genomic information of L. taiwanensis is fairly limited. Extensive characterization of its beneficial traits is needed. RESULTS: A new strain CLG01 of L. taiwanensis was isolated from mouse Peyer's patches. We established its probiotic profile through in vitro experiments. Complete genome of this strain was also sequenced and analyzed. L. taiwanensis CLG01 showed robust tolerance to acid and a degree of tolerance to bile salt with a promising antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. In vitro treatment of mouse RAW 264.7 macrophage cells with heat-killed bacteria and bacterial supernatant of L. taiwanensis CLG01 resulted in enhancement of immune responses and upregulated expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6. The strain CLG01 also increased the IL-10 production of macrophages when co-treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Complete genome of L. taiwanensis CLG01 contained a 1.89 Mb chromosome and two plasmids. Further genomic analysis revealed the presence of genes related to its resistance to different stresses and the beneficial effects mentioned above. Moreover, biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding antimicrobial peptides, like bacteriocin, linear azol(in)e-containing peptide (LAP) and lanthipeptide, were also identified in the genome of L. taiwanensis CLG01. CONCLUSIONS: L. taiwanensis CLG01, isolated from mouse Peyer's patches, is the first L. taiwanensis strain with both phenotypes and genotypes systematically studied. These preliminary data confirmed the role of L. taiwanensis CLG01 as a potential probiotic candidate with antibacterial and immunomodulatory activity, which provide insight for further investigation to this species.
