33183177|t|Use of PADIS Assessment Tools by Critical Care Nurses: An Integrative Review.
33183177|a|The purpose of this integrative review was to evaluate the literature from January 2013 to April 2020 and to explore critical care nurses' perspectives of and intent to use recommended Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption (PADIS) patient assessment tools in adult critical care units. A literature search was performed with a total of 47 studies included in the final analysis for this review. The studies' data were organized and further reduced based on The Reasoned Action Approach behavioral theory to reflect the extent to which a nurse plans to use a PADIS assessment tool. Extracted themes were related to behavioral beliefs in patient-centered care and critical thinking; normative beliefs about communication and prioritization; and control beliefs concerning autonomy and confidence. Contextualizing the international phenomenon of variation in PADIS assessment tool use by critical care nurses provides a deeper understanding of its complexity for use in the clinical setting.
