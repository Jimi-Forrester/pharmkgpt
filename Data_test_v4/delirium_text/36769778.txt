36769778|a|BACKGROUND: We evaluated a strategy to shorten the time from admission to surgery in patients with proximal femur fractures on chronic antiplatelet therapy. We reported a 12-month follow-up on complications and quality of life (QoL). METHODS: Multicentre, open-label, randomized, parallel clinical trial. Patients were randomized to either early platelet function-guided surgery (experimental group) or delayed surgery (control group). Medical and surgical complications and QoL (EQ-5D-5L questionnaire) were assessed during the hospital stay, and after hospital discharge at 30 days, and 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: From 156 randomized patients, 143 patients underwent surgery. The mean age was 85.5 (7.8) years and 68.0% were female. After hospital discharge, 5.7% of patients had surgical wound complications and 55.9% had medical complications, with 42.7% having serious adverse events. QoL improved significantly after surgery, with the best scores at the six-month follow-up. The overall mortality was 32.2%. There were no differences between early and delayed surgery groups in any assessed outcomes. CONCLUSION: It seems safe to reduce the time of surgery under neuraxial anaesthesia in patients with hip fractures on chronic antiplatelet therapy by platelet function testing. QoL in particular improves in the first six months after surgery.
