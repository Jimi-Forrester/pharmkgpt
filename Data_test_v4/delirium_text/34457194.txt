34457194|a|BACKGROUND: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common malignancies with a poor prognosis, and its treatment remains a great challenge. Dihydrotanshinone I (DHTS) has been reported to exert antitumor effect in many cancers. However, the role of DHTS in ESCC remains unclear. AIM: To investigate the antitumor effect of DHTS in ESCC and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: CCK-8 assay and cell cycle analysis were used to detect proliferation and cell cycle in ESCC cells. Annexin V-PE/7-AAD double staining assay and Hoechst 33258 staining were used to detect apoptosis in ESCC cells. Western blot was used to detect the expression of proteins associated with the mitochondrial pathway. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) in DHTS-treated ESCC cells. ESCC cells with STAT3 knockdown and overexpression were constructed to verify the role of STAT3 in DHTS induced apoptosis. A xenograft tumor model in nude mice was used to evaluate the antitumor effect of DHTS in vivo. RESULTS: After treatment with DHTS, the proliferation of ESCC cells was inhibited in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, DHTS induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/1 phase. Annexin V-PE/7-AAD double staining assay and Hoechst 33258 staining revealed that DHTS induced obvious apoptosis in KYSE30 and Eca109 cells. At the molecular level, DHTS treatment reduced the expression of pSTAT3 and anti-apoptotic proteins, while increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins in ESCC cells. STAT3 knockdown in ESCC cells markedly promoted the activation of the mitochondrial pathway while STAT3 overexpression blocked the activation of the mitochondrial pathway. Additionally, DHTS inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a xenograft tumor mouse model. CONCLUSION: DHTS exerts antitumor effect in ESCC via STAT3-mediated activation of the mitochondrial pathway. DHTS may be a novel therapeutic agent for ESCC.
