35681684|t|The Insignificant Correlation between Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Incidence of Dementia Using an Extension Survival Cox Hazard Model and Propensity-Score Matching Analysis in a Retrospective, Population-Based Prostate Cancer Registry.
35681684|a|This study aims to evaluate the effect of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) on the incidence of dementia, after considering the time-dependent survival in patients with prostate cancer (PC) using a Korean population-based cancer registry database. After excluding patients with cerebrovascular disease and dementia before or within the 3-month-ADT and those with surgical castration, 9880 (19.3%) patients were matched into ADT and non-ADT groups using propensity-score matching (PSM) among 51,206 patients registered between 2006 and 2013. To define the significant relationship between ADT duration and the incidence of dementia, the extension Cox proportional hazard model was used with p-values < 0.05 regarded as statistically significant. The mean age and survival time were 67.3 years and 4.33 (standard deviation [SD] 2.16) years, respectively. A total of 2945 (9.3%) patients developed dementia during the study period, including Parkinson's (11.0%), Alzheimer's (42.6%), vascular (18.2%), and other types of dementia (28.2%). Despite PSM, the PC-treatment subtypes, survival rate, and incidence of dementia significantly differed between the ADT and non-ADT groups (p < 0.05), whereas the rate of each dementia subtype did not significantly differ (p = 0.069). A multivariate analysis for dementia incidence showed no significance of ADT type or use duration among patients with PC (p > 0.05), whereas old age, obesity, regional SEER stage, a history of cerebrovascular disease, and a high Charlson Comorbidity Index were significant factors for dementia (p < 0.05). Insignificant correlation was observed between ADT and the incidence of dementia based on the extension survival model with PSM among patients with PC.
