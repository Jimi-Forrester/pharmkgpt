36617786|t|Subtle Differences in Cognition in 70-Year-Olds with Elevated Cerebrospinal Fluid Neurofilament Light and Neurogranin: A H70 Cross-Sectional Study.
36617786|a|BACKGROUND: Most research on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light protein (NfL) as a marker for neurodegeneration and neurogranin (Ng) for synaptic dysfunction has largely focused on clinical cohorts rather than population-based samples. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that increased CSF levels of NfL and Ng are associated with subtle cognitive deficits in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults. METHODS: The sample was derived from the Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Studies and comprised 258 CU 70-year-olds, with a Clinical Dementia Rating score of zero. All participants underwent extensive cognitive testing. CSF levels of NfL and Ng, as well as amyloid beta1 - 42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau, were measured. RESULTS: Participants with high CSF NfL performed worse in one memory-based test (Immediate recall, p = 0.013) and a language test (FAS, p = 0.016). Individuals with high CSF Ng performed worse on the memory-based test Supra Span (p = 0.035). When stratified according to CSF tau and Abeta42 concentrations, participants with high NfL and increased tau performed worse on a memory test than participants normal tau concentrations (Delayed recall, p = 0.003). In participants with high NfL, those with pathologic Abeta42 concentrations performed worse on the Delayed recall memory (p = 0.044). In the high Ng group, participants with pathological Abeta42 concentrations had lower MMSE scores (p = 0.027). However, in regression analysis we found no linear correlations between CSF NfL or CSF Ng in relation to cognitive tests when controlled for important co-variates. CONCLUSION: Markers of neurodegeneration and synaptic pathology might be associated with subtle signs of cognitive decline in a population-based sample of 70-year-olds.
