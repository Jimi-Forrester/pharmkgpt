37790360|a|The mechanisms underlying adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) are not fully understood. AHN plays instrumental roles in learning and memory. Understanding the signals that regulate AHN has implications for brain function and therapy. Here we show that Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a protein that is highly enriched in endothelial cells and the principal component of caveolae, autonomously regulates AHN. Conditional deletion of Cav-1 in adult neural progenitor cells (nestin +) led to increased neurogenesis and enhanced performance of mice in contextual discrimination. Proteomic analysis revealed that Cav-1 plays a role in mitochondrial pathways in neural progenitor cells. Importantly, Cav-1 was localized to the mitochondria in neural progenitor cells and modulated mitochondrial fission-fusion, a critical process in neurogenesis. These results suggest that Cav-1 is a novel regulator of AHN and underscore the impact of AHN on cognition.
