38612449|t|The Role of Heat-Induced Stress Granules in the Blood-Testis Barrier of Mice.
38612449|a|Stress granules (SGs) are membraneless ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-based cellular foci formed in response to stress, facilitating cell survival by protecting against damage. Mammalian spermatogenesis should be maintained below body temperature for proper development, indicating its vulnerability to heat stress (HS). In this study, biotin tracer permeability assays showed that the inhibition of heat-induced SG assembly in the testis by 4-8 mg/kg cycloheximide significantly increased the percentage of seminiferous tubules with a damaged blood-testis barrier (BTB). Western blot results additionally revealed that the suppression of heat-induced SG assembly in Sertoli cell line, TM4 cells, by RNA inference of G3bp1/2 aggravated the decline in the BTB-related proteins ZO-1, beta-Catenin and Claudin-11, indicating that SGs could protect the BTB against damage caused by HS. The protein components that associate with SGs in Sertoli cells were isolated by sequential centrifugation and immunoprecipitation, and were identified by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that their corresponding genes were mainly involved in pathways related to proteasomes, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and DNA replication. Furthermore, a new SG component, the ubiquitin associated protein 2 (UBAP2), was found to translocate to SGs upon HS in TM4 cells by immunofluorescence. Moreover, SG assembly was significantly diminished after UBAP2 knockdown by RNA inference during HS, suggesting the important role of UBAP2 in SG assembly. In addition, UBAP2 knockdown reduced the expression of ZO-1, beta-Catenin and Claudin-11, which implied its potential role in the function of the BTB. Overall, our study demonstrated the role of SGs in maintaining BTB functions during HS and identified a new component implicated in SG formation in Sertoli cells. These findings not only offer novel insights into the biological functions of SGs and the molecular mechanism of low fertility in males in summer, but also potentially provide an experimental basis for male fertility therapies.
