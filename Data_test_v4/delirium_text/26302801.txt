26302801|a|Medical advances in the last decades have increased the average life expectancy, but also the incidence and prevalence of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases and the most prevalent type of dementia. A plethora of different mechanisms contribute to AD, among which oxidative stress plays a key role in its development and progression. So far, there are no pharmacological treatments available and the current medications are mainly symptomatic. In the last years, dietary polyphenols have gained research attention due to their interesting biological activities, and more specifically their antioxidant properties. (-)- Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a natural flavanol that has been extensively studied regarding its potential effects in AD. In this review we present the current in vitro and in vivo experimentation regarding the use of EGCG in AD. We also review the complex mechanisms of action of EGCG, not only limited to its antioxidant activity, which may explain its beneficial health effects.
