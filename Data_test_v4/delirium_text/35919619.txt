35919619|t|Selectivity profile comparison for certain gamma-butyrolactone and oxazolidinone-based ligands on a sigma 2 receptor over sigma 1: a molecular docking approach.
35919619|a|Sigma receptors (sigma1 R and sigma2 R) are pharmacologically characterized membrane-bound receptors that bind a wide range of chemical compounds. Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, schizophrenia, and neuropathic pain have all been associated with abnormal sigma2 activity. The sigma2 receptor has recently been identified as a potential therapeutic target for inhibiting the formation of amyloid plaques. Numerous laboratories are now investigating the potential of sigma2 ligands. Small molecule discovery is the focus of current research, with the goal of using target-based action to treat a variety of illnesses and ailments. Functionalized gamma-butyrolactone and oxazolidinone-based ligands, in particular, are pharmacologically important scaffolds in drug discovery research and have been thoroughly examined for sigma2 receptor efficacy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacophoric features of different sigma2 receptor ligands using in silico techniques. This study used a library of 58 compounds having a gamma-butyrolactone and oxazolidinone core. To investigate the binding characteristics of the ligands with the sigma2 receptor, a 3D homology model was developed. To understand the binding pattern of the gamma-butyrolactone and oxazolidinone based ligands, molecular docking studies were performed on both sigma1 and sigma2 receptors. Furthermore, MM/GBSA binding energy calculations were used to confirm the binding of ligands on the sigma2 over sigma1 receptor. These in silico findings will aid in the discovery of selective sigma2 ligands with good pharmacophoric properties and potency in the future.
