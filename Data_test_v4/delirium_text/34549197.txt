34549197|t|Systematic Mapping Study of AI/Machine Learning in Healthcare and Future Directions.
34549197|a|This study attempts to categorise research conducted in the area of: use of machine learning in healthcare, using a systematic mapping study methodology. In our attempt, we reviewed literature from top journals, articles, and conference papers by using the keywords use of machine learning in healthcare. We queried Google Scholar, resulted in 1400 papers, and then categorised the results on the basis of the objective of the study, the methodology adopted, type of problem attempted and disease studied. As a result we were able to categorize study in five different categories namely, interpretable ML, evaluation of medical images, processing of EHR, security/privacy framework, and transfer learning. In the study we also found that most of the authors have studied cancer, and one of the least studied disease was epilepsy, evaluation of medical images is the most researched and a new field of research, Interpretable ML/Explainable AI, is gaining momentum. Our basic intent is to provide a fair idea to future researchers about the field and future directions.
