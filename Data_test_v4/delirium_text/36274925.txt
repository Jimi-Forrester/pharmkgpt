36274925|t|Heads Up! Interlinked Amyloidogenic and Axonal Transport Pathways in Concussion-Induced Neurodegeneration.
36274925|a|Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), a condition in which brain function is transiently disrupted by a mechanical force, is a major risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative conditions. In this commentary, we summarize recent findings in human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, detailing early neuronal events following mild injury that may seed future neurodegeneration. In particular, we discuss interlinked relationships between mTBI and several biological pathways hypothesized to underlie AD progression, including amyloidogenic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), impairment of axonal transport, and the development of APP-associated axonal swellings. We also describe the implications of these findings for future mechanistic and translational studies.
