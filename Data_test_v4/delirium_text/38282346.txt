38282346|t|From Liver to Brain: How MAFLD/MASLD Impacts Cognitive Function.
38282346|a|Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MAFLD/MASLD), is a common chronic liver condition affecting a substantial global population. Beyond its primary impact on liver function, MAFLD/MASLD is associated with a myriad of extrahepatic manifestations, including cognitive impairment. The scope of cognitive impairment within the realm of MAFLD/MASLD is a matter of escalating concern. Positioned as an intermediate stage between the normal aging process and the onset of dementia, cognitive impairment manifests as a substantial challenge associated with this liver condition. Insights from studies underscore the presence of compromised executive function and a global decline in cognitive capabilities among individuals identified as being at risk of progressing to liver fibrosis. Importantly, this cognitive impairment transcends mere association with metabolic factors, delving deep into the intricate pathophysiology characterizing MAFLD/MASLD. The multifaceted nature of cognitive impairment in the context of MAFLD/MASLD is underlined by a spectrum of factors, prominently featuring insulin resistance, lipotoxicity, and systemic inflammation as pivotal contributors. These factors interplay within the intricate landscape of MAFLD/MASLD, fostering a nuanced understanding of the links between hepatic health and cognitive function. By synthesizing the available evidence, exploring potential mechanisms, and assessing clinical implications, the overarching aim of this review is to contribute to a more complete understanding of the impact of MAFLD/MASLD on cognitive function.
