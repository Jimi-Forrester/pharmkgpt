38586949|t|Ginsenosides Decrease beta-Amyloid Production via Potentiating Capacitative Calcium Entry.
38586949|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular amyloid plaques composed of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). Studies have indicated that Ca2+ dysregulation is involved in AD pathology. It is reported that decreased capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE), a refilling mechanism of intracellular Ca2+, resulting in increased Abeta production. In contrast, constitutive activation of CCE could decrease Abeta production. Panax ginseng Meyer is known to enhance memory and cognitive functions in healthy human subjects. We have previously reported that some ginsenosides decrease Abeta levels in cultured primary neurons and AD mouse model brains. However, mechanisms involved in the Abeta-lowering effect of ginsenosides remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the relationship between CCE and Abeta production by examining the effects of various ginsenosides on CCE levels. Abeta-lowering ginsenosides such as Rk1, Rg5, and Rg3 potentiated CCE. In contrast, ginsenosides without Abeta-lowering effects (Re and Rb2) failed to potentiate CCE. The potentiating effect of ginsenosides on CCE was inhibited by the presence of 2-aminoethoxydipherryl borate (2APB), an inhibitor of CCE. 2APB alone increased Abeta42 production. Furthermore, the presence of 2APB prevented the effects of ginsenosides on Abeta42 production. Our results indicate that ginsenosides decrease Abeta production via potentiating CCE levels, confirming a close relationship between CCE levels and Abeta production. Since CCE levels are closely related to Abeta production, modulating CCE could be a novel target for AD therapeutics.
