37064125|a|Background: One of the most diverse tumors is pancreatic cancer (PC), which makes predicting the prognosis challenging. PC development is directly related to hypoxia, angiogenesis, and immunotherapy. It is still unclear how the three features are related. Methods: The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were employed to obtain sequencing data for healthy pancreatic tissues and PC tissues, respectively. According to the constructed hypoxic prognostic model (HPM) and angiogenic prognostic model (APM), 4 subtypes of PC were identified. Hypoxia and angiogenesis prognostic model (HAPM) was established based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high-angiogenesis/high-hypoxia (HH) and low-angiogenesis/low-hypoxia (LL) subgroups. Base on the median risk score, PC patients were separated into high-risk and low-risk groups, and clinical traits, prognosis, percentage of immune cell infiltration, PD-1 expression, and the fraction of T-cell depletion were compared between the groups. Finally, the predictive accuracy of the tumor immune dysfunction and rejection (TIDE) and tumor inflammatory signature (TIS) models, as well as HAPM, was compared. Result: We analyzed the mRNA sequencing data from 178 PC tissues and 171 normal pancreatic tissues to obtain 9527 DEGs. We discovered 200 genes linked with hypoxia and 36 genes involved with angiogenesis through the literature. We found the core genes related with hypoxia and angiogenesis in PC by intersecting the DEGs of the HH and LL subgroups with those of PC via WGCNA. IL-17 signaling pathway, ECM-receptor interactions, cytokine receptor interactions, etc. were all enriched in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) results of core genes. HAPM has good predictive efficiency, according to an evaluation of KM survival curves and ROC curves. The external dataset also validated the model's ability to anticipate outcomes. Patients in the high- and low-risk groups were compared for PD1 expression and T-cell exclusion scores, which suggested that the model might be used to forecast which PC patients might benefit from immunotherapy. Conclusions: The probable molecular processes connecting hypoxia and angiogenesis are described in this work, and a model is developed that may be utilized to forecast the prognosis for PC patients and the benefits of immunotherapy.
