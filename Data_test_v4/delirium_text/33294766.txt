33294766|t|Exploring the Role of Maternal Nutritional Epigenetics in Congenital Heart Disease.
33294766|a|Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the major debilitating birth defects resulting in significant impact on neonatal and child mortality globally. The etiology of CHD is complex and multifactorial. Many causative genes responsible for CHDs have been identified from the familial forms previously. Still, the non-Mendelian inheritance and predominant sporadic cases have stimulated research to understand the epigenetic basis and environmental impact on the incidence of CHD. The fetal epigenetic programming affecting cardiac development is susceptible to the availability of key dietary factors during the crucial periconceptional period. This article highlights the need and importance of in-depth research in the new emerging area of maternal nutritional epigenetics and CHD. It summarizes the current research and underlines the limitations in these types of studies. This review will benefit the future research on nutrition as a modifiable environmental factor to decrease the incidence of CHD.
