31978714|a|Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is a Ca2+/calmodulin regulated Ser/Thr kinase involved in various cellular processes including cell death, autophagy and inflammation. Its dysregulation has been linked to tumour metastasis, anti-viral responses, Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. To further investigate the role of DAPK1 in these processes, we generated a DAPK1 knockout first (conditional ready) human embryonic stem (hES) cell line in which the endogenous DAPK1 can be easily restored with expression of FLPe. This cell line provides an ideal model to study the role of DAPK1 in human development and various pathologies related to DAPK1 dysregulation in vitro.
