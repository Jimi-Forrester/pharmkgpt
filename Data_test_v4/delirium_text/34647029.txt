34647029|t|A Structural Connectivity Disruption One Decade before the Typical Age for Dementia: A Study in Healthy Subjects with Family History of Alzheimer's Disease.
34647029|a|The concept of the brain has shifted to a complex system where different subnetworks support the human cognitive functions. Neurodegenerative diseases would affect the interactions among these subnetworks and, the evolution of impairment and the subnetworks involved would be unique for each neurodegenerative disease. In this study, we seek for structural connectivity traits associated with the family history of Alzheimer's disease, that is, early signs of subnetworks impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. The sample in this study consisted of 123 first-degree Alzheimer's disease relatives and 61 nonrelatives. For each subject, structural connectomes were obtained using classical diffusion tensor imaging measures and different resolutions of cortical parcellation. For the whole sample, independent structural-connectome-traits were obtained under the framework of connICA. Finally, we tested the association of the structural-connectome-traits with different factors of relevance for Alzheimer's disease by means of a multiple linear regression. The analysis revealed a structural-connectome-trait obtained from fractional anisotropy associated with the family history of Alzheimer's disease. The structural-connectome-trait presents a reduced fractional anisotropy pattern in first-degree relatives in the tracts connecting posterior areas and temporal areas. The family history of Alzheimer's disease structural-connectome-trait presents a posterior-posterior and posterior-temporal pattern, supplying new evidences to the cascading network failure model.
