34594487|a|INTRODUCTION: Remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug has shown to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), both in vitro and in vivo. The present systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to quantify the safety and tolerability of remdesivir, based on safety outcome findings from randomized controlled trials, observational studies and case reports of remdesivir in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: We have performed a systematic search in the PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library using specific keywords such as 'COVID-19' OR 'SARS CoV-2' AND 'Remdesivir'. The study endpoints include total adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), grade 3 and grade 4 AEs, mortality and drug tolerability. Statistical analysis was carried out by using Revman 5.4 software. RESULTS: Total 15 studies were included for systematic review, but only 5 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (n = 13,622) were included for meta-analysis. Visual inspection of the forest plots for remdesivir 10-day versus placebo and remdesivir 10-day versus 5-day groups revealed that there is a significant difference in SAEs [10-day remdesivir versus control (odds ratio [OR] = 0.55, 0.40-0.74) p = 0.0001; I 2 = 0%; 10-day remdesivir versus 5-day remdesivir (OR = 0.56, 0.38-0.84) p = 0.005; I 2 = 13%]. In grade 4 AEs, there is a significant difference in 10-day remdesivir versus control (OR = 0.32, 0.19-0.54) p = 0.0001; I 2 = 0%, but not in comparison to 5-day remdesivir (OR = 0.95, 0.59-1.54) p = 0.85; I 2 = 0%. But there is no significant difference in grade 3 AEs [remdesivir 10 day versus control (OR = 0.81, 0.59-1.11) p = 0.19; I 2 = 0%; 10-day remdesivir versus 5-day remdesivir (OR = 1.24, 0.86-1.80) p = 0.25; I 2 = 0%], in total AEs [remdesivir 10 day versus control (OR = 1.07, 0.66-1.75) p = 0.77; I 2 = 79%; remdesivir 10 day versus 5 day (OR = 1.08, 0.70-1.68) p = 0.73; I 2 = 54%)], in mortality [10-day remdesivir versus control (OR = 0.93, 0.80-1.08) p = 0.32; I 2 = 0%; 10-day remdesivir versus 5-day remdesivir (OR = 1.39, 0.73-2.62) p = 0.32; I 2 = 0%)] and tolerability [remdesivir 10 day versus control (OR = 1.05, 0.51-2.18) p = 0.89; I 2 = 65%, 10-day remdesivir versus 5-day remdesivir (OR = 0.86, 0.18-4.01) p = 0.85; I 2 = 78%]. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION: Ten-day remdesivir was a safe antiviral agent but not tolerable over control in the hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a need of administration cautiousness for grade 3 AEs. There was no added benefit of 10- or 5-day remdesivir in reducing mortality over placebo. To avoid SAEs, we suggest for prior monitoring of liver function tests (LFT), renal function tests (RFT), complete blood count (CBC) and serum electrolytes for those with preexisting hepatic and renal impairments and patients receiving concomitant hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. Furthermore, a number of RCTs of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients are suggested. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Ten-day remdesivir is a safe antiviral drug with common adverse events in comparison to placebo.The rate of serious adverse events and grade 3 adverse events were significantly lower in 10-day remdesivir in comparison to placebo/5-day remdesivir.There was no significant difference in the rate of tolerability and mortality reduction in 10-day remdesivir over placebo/5-day remdesivir.There were no new safety signals reported in vulnerable populations, paediatric, pregnant and lactating women.
