35198288|t|Analysis of Neurological Adverse Events Reported in VigiBase From COVID-19 Vaccines.
35198288|a|BACKGROUND: Fifteen COVID-19 vaccines have been granted emergency approval before the completion of conventional phases of clinical trials. The present study aimed to analyze the neurological adverse events (AEs) post-COVID-19 vaccination and focuses on determining the association of AEs with the vaccine. METHODOLOGY: The neurological AEs reported for COVID-19 vaccines in the WHO pharmacovigilance database (VigiBase) were extracted from the System Organ Classes - neurological disorders and investigations. Descriptive statistics are reported as percentage and frequency and the disproportionality analysis was also conducted. RESULTS:  For the neurological system, 19,529 AEs were reported. Of these, 15,638 events were reported from BNT162b2 vaccine, 2,751 from AZD1222 vaccine, 1,075 from mRNA-1273 vaccine, eight from Vero vaccine, two from Covaxin, and for 55 AEs, vaccine name was not mentioned. The reason for more AEs reported with BNT162b2 can be maximum vaccination with BNT162b2 vaccine in the study period. According to the disproportionality analysis based on IC025 value, ageusia, anosmia, burning sensation, dizziness, facial paralysis, headache, hypoaesthesia, lethargy, migraine, neuralgia, paresis, parosmia, poor sleep quality, seizure, transient ischemic attack, and tremor are some of the AEs that can be associated with the administration of the vaccine. CONCLUSION: The vaccines should be monitored for these AEs till the causality of these AEs with COVID-19 vaccines is established through further long-term follow-up studies. These neurological AEs reported in VigiBase should not be taken as conclusive and mass vaccination should be carried out to control the pandemic until a definite link of these adverse effects is established.
