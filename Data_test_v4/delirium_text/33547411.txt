33547411|a|Parkinson's disease is an age-associated neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons from the midbrain. Epidemiological studies have implicated exposures to environmental toxins like the herbicide paraquat as major contributors to Parkinson's disease etiology in both mammalian and invertebrate models. We have employed a paraquat-induced Parkinson's disease model in Drosophila as an inexpensive in vivo platform to screen therapeutics from natural products. We have identified the polymethoxyflavonoid, GardeninA, with neuroprotective potential against paraquat-induced parkinsonian symptoms involving reduced survival, mobility defects, and loss of dopaminergic neurons. GardeninA-mediated neuroprotection is not solely dependent on its antioxidant activities but also involves modulation of the neuroinflammatory and cellular death responses. Furthermore, we have successfully shown GardeninA bioavailability in the fly heads after oral administration using ultra-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Our findings reveal a molecular mechanistic insight into GardeninA-mediated neuroprotection against environmental toxin-induced Parkinson's disease pathogenesis for novel therapeutic intervention.
