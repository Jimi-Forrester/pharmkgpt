22259217|a|OBJECTIVE: In cancer patients, adjustment disorders, delirium and depression have been identified as common psychiatric disorders. Although a comparable result was reported in the National Cancer Center in Japan, the nature of patients in that hospital may differ from that in local hospitals. There is a possibility to expand the findings of psycho-oncology by evaluation of the data from a local university hospital and comparison with the National Cancer Center data. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of cancer patients who were referred to the Department of Psycho-Oncology at Saitama Medical University International Medical Center. We identified their characteristics and psychiatric diagnoses and compared these with the National Cancer Center data. RESULTS: During the study period, 765 cancer patients were referred. The numbers of inpatients and outpatients were almost the same. The most common psychiatric diagnosis was adjustment disorders (24%), followed by delirium (16%) and then major depressive disorder (12%). The rank of these three was the same as that at the National Cancer Center. Outpatients constituted more than 80% of the patients with major depressive disorder. The proportion of cancer patients with schizophrenia in this study (4.3%) was higher than that in the National Cancer Center (1.6%). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed basic information about the consultation data of cancer patients at a local university hospital in Japan. The importance of communication with outpatients was suggested. It seems that cancer treatment for patients with schizophrenia in a local hospital is also important.
