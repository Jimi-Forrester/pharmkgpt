34641631|a|Biflavonoids, composed of two monoflavonoid residues, occur naturally in angiosperms, bryophytes, ferns, and gymnosperms. More than 592 biflavonoids have been structurally elucidated, and they can be classified into two groups of C-C and C-linear fragments-C, based on whether the linker between the two residues contains an atom. As the linker can be established on two arbitrary rings from different residues, the C-C type contains various subtypes, as does the C-linear fragment-C type. Biflavonoids have a wide range of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, antidiabetic, antitumor, and cytotoxic properties, and they can be applied in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This review mainly summarizes the distribution and chemistry of biflavonoids; additionally, their bioactivities, pharmacokinetics, and synthesis are discussed.
