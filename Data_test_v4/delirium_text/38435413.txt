38435413|a|Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are increasingly used to forecast progression trajectories of cognitive decline caused by preclinical and prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many existing studies have explored the potential of these two distinct modalities with diverse machine and deep learning approaches. But successfully fusing MRI and PET can be complex due to their unique characteristics and missing modalities. To this end, we develop a hybrid multimodality fusion (HMF) framework with cross-domain knowledge transfer for joint MRI and PET representation learning, feature fusion, and cognitive decline progression forecasting. Our HMF consists of three modules: 1) a module to impute missing PET images, 2) a module to extract multimodality features from MRI and PET images, and 3) a module to fuse the extracted multimodality features. To address the issue of small sample sizes, we employ a cross-domain knowledge transfer strategy from the ADNI dataset, which includes 795 subjects, to independent small-scale AD-related cohorts, in order to leverage the rich knowledge present within the ADNI. The proposed HMF is extensively evaluated in three AD-related studies with 272 subjects across multiple disease stages, such as subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over several state-of-the-art approaches in forecasting progression trajectories of AD-related cognitive decline.
