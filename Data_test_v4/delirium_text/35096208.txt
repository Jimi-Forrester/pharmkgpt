35096208|t|Kynurenine Pathway Metabolites as Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease.
35096208|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that deteriorates cognitive function. Patients with AD generally exhibit neuroinflammation, elevated beta-amyloid (Abeta), tau phosphorylation (p-tau), and other pathological changes in the brain. The kynurenine pathway (KP) and several of its metabolites, especially quinolinic acid (QA), are considered to be involved in the neuropathogenesis of AD. The important metabolites and key enzymes show significant importance in neuroinflammation and AD. Meanwhile, the discovery of changed levels of KP metabolites in patients with AD suggests that KP metabolites may have a prominent role in the pathogenesis of AD. Further, some KP metabolites exhibit other effects on the brain, such as oxidative stress regulation and neurotoxicity. Both analogs of the neuroprotective and antineuroinflammation metabolites and small molecule enzyme inhibitors preventing the formation of neurotoxic and neuroinflammation compounds may have potential therapeutic significance. This review focused on the KP metabolites through the relationship of neuroinflammation in AD, significant KP metabolites, and associated molecular mechanisms as well as the utility of these metabolites as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. The objective is to provide references to find biomarkers and therapeutic targets for patients with AD.
