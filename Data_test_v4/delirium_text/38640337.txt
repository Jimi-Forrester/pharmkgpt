38640337|t|Role and molecular mechanism of Salvia miltiorrhiza associated with chemical compounds in the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its complications: A review.
38640337|a|Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, greatly impacting patients' quality of life. This article reviews the progress in Salvia miltiorrhiza, an ancient Chinese plant, for the treatment of DM and its associated complications. Extensive studies have been conducted on the chemical composition and pharmacological effects of S miltiorrhiza, including its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. It has demonstrated potential in preventing and treating diabetes and its consequences by improving peripheral nerve function and increasing retinal thickness in diabetic individuals. Moreover, S miltiorrhiza has shown effectiveness when used in conjunction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and statins. The safety and tolerability of S miltiorrhiza have also been thoroughly investigated. Despite the established benefits of managing DM and its complications, further research is needed to determine appropriate usage, dosage, long-term health benefits, and safety.
