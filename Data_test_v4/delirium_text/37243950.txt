37243950|t|HspB8 interacts with BAG3 in a "native-like" conformation forming a complex that displays chaperone-like activity.
37243950|a|The HspB8-BAG3 complex plays an important role in the protein quality control acting alone or within multi-components complexes. To clarify the mechanism underlying its activity, in this work we used biochemical and biophysical approaches to study the tendency of both proteins to auto-assemble and to form the complex. Solubility and Thioflavin T assays, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy analyses clearly showed the tendency of HspB8 to self-assemble at high concentration and to form oligomers in a 'native-like' conformation; otherwise, BAG3 aggregates poorly. Noteworthy, also HspB8 and BAG3 associate in a "native-like" conformation, forming a stable complex. Furthermore, the high difference between dissociation constant values of HspB8-HspB8 interaction with respect to the binding to BAG3 obtained by surface plasmon resonance confirms that HspB8 is an obligated partner of BAG3 in vivo. Lastly, both proteins alone or in the complex are able to bind and affect the aggregation of the Josephin domain, the structured domain that triggers the ataxin-3 fibrillation. In particular, the complex displayed higher activity than HspB8 alone. All this considered, we can assert that the two proteins form a stable assembly with chaperone-like activity that could contribute to the physiological role of the complex in vivo.
