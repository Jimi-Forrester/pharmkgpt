35411051|a|HuD, an RNA binding protein, plays a role in the regulation of gene expression in certain types of cells, including neuronal cells and pancreatic beta-cells, via RNA metabolism. Its aberrant expression is associated with the pathogenesis of several human diseases. To explore HuD-mediated gene regulation, stable cells expressing short hairpin RNA against HuD were established using mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a (N2a) cells, which displayed enhanced phenotypic characteristics of cellular senescence. Two approaches, RNA immunoprecipitation (RNA IP)-NanoString profiling and cytokine array, were used to subsequently identify a subset of putative HuD targets that act as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), including C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL20, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Here, we further demonstrated that HuD regulates the expression of CCL2, a SASP candidate upregulated in cells following HuD knockdown, by binding to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of Ccl2 mRNA. Downregulation of HuD increased the level of CCL2 in N2a cells and the brain tissues of HuD knockout (KO) mice. Exposure to gamma-irradiation induced cellular senescence in N2a cells and HuD knockdown facilitated stress-induced cellular senescence. Our results reveal that HuD acts as a novel regulator of CCL2 expression, and its aberrant expression may contribute to cellular senescence by regulating SASP production.
