37576000|t|Emergence delirium and postoperative delirium associated with high plasma NfL and GFAP: an observational study.
37576000|a|Background: Neuroinflammation and neuronal injury have been reported to be associated with the development of postoperative delirium in both preclinical and clinical settings. This study aimed to investigate the potential correlation between biomarkers of neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein and emergence and postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing surgery. Methods: Patients who developed emergence delirium (n = 30) and postoperative delirium (n = 32), along with their matched controls, were enrolled after obtaining ethics approval and written informed consent. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit or Confusion Assessment Method scale, and blood samples were collected before and after surgery for plasma neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein measurements using a single-molecule array. Results: The study found that in patients with emergence delirium, the increase in plasma neurofilament light chain protein levels during surgery was significantly higher than in non-delirium patients (P = 0.002). Additionally, in patients with postoperative delirium, both the increase in plasma neurofilament light chain protein levels (P < 0.001) and the increase in plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein levels during surgery (P = 0.008) were significantly higher than in non-delirium patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the increase in plasma neurofilament light chain protein was associated with emergence delirium (adjusted OR = 1.872, P = 0.005), and the increase in plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein was associated with postoperative delirium (adjusted OR = 1.419, P = 0.016). Moreover, the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification and surgical duration were also found to be associated with delirium in elderly patients. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that emergence delirium is linked to elevated levels of neurofilament light chain, a biomarker of axonal injury, during surgery. Furthermore, in addition to axonal injury, postoperative delirium was also associated with an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker of astrocyte activation.
