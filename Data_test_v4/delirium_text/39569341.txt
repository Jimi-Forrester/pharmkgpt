39569341|a|People still hold the concept of using cell-based treatments to regenerate missing neurons in high esteem. CD117+ cells are considered favorable stem cells for regenerative medicine. The objective of this research was to examine the impact of Alginate-Gelatin (Alg-Gel) hydrogel on the process of neurogenic differentiation of CD117+ cells utilizing a cytokines secretion test conducted in a laboratory setting. To achieve this objective, bone marrow-CD117+ cells were isolated using the MACS technique and then transformed into neuron cells using a neurogenic differentiation medium. The characterization of enriched CD117+ cells has been done with flow cytometry as well as immunocytochemistry. Next, the cells underwent western blotting assay to evaluate the signaling pathways. Subsequently, the culture media was obtained from both groups in order to determine cytokine levels. The study revealed that the Alg-Gel hydrogel had a notable impact on enhancing the protein expression of neuron markers such as beta-tubulin and Wnt/catenin signaling pathway components in CD117+ neurogenic differentiated cells. Furthermore, the cultured medium from the experimental group exhibited a notable abundance of IL-6 and IL-10 in comparison to the control group. The observed in vitro effects of Alg-Gel hydrogel on neurogenic differentiation of CD117+ cells are likely to be caused by the cytokines that are released.
