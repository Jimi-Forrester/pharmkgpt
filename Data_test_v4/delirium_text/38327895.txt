38327895|a|BACKGROUND: With the continuous growth of the modern elderly population, the risk of fracture increases. Hip fracture is a common type of fracture in older people. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) has significant advantages in relieving chronic pain and promoting the recovery of hip joint function. AIM: To investigate the effect of ulinastatin combined with dexmedetomidine (Dex) on the incidences of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and emergence agitation in elderly patients who underwent THA. METHODS: A total of 397 patients who underwent THA from February 2019 to August 2022. We conducted a three-year retrospective cohort study in Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital. Comprehensive demographic data were obtained from the electronic medical record system. We collected preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data. One hundred twenty-nine patients who were administered Dex during the operation were included in the Dex group. One hundred fifty patients who were intravenously injected with ulinastatin 15 min before anesthesia induction were included in the ulinastatin group. One hundred eighteen patients who were administered ulinastatin combined with Dex during the operation were included in the Dex + ulinastatin group. The patients' perioperative conditions, hemodynamic indexes, postoperative Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, Ramsay score, incidence of POCD, and serum inflammatory cytokines were evaluated. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the 24 h visual analogue scale score among the three groups, and the score in the Dex + ulinastatin group was the lowest (P < 0.05). Compared with the Dex and ulinastatin group, the MMSE scores of the Dex + ulinastatin group were significantly increased at 1 and 7 d after the operation (all P < 0.05). Compared with those in the Dex and ulinastatin groups, incidence of POCD, levels of serum inflammatory cytokines in the Dex + ulinastatin group were significantly decreased at 1 and 7 d after the operation (all P < 0.05). The observer's assessment of the alertness/sedation score and Ramsay score of the Dex + ulinastatin group were significantly different from those of the Dex and ulinastatin groups on the first day after the operation (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Ulinastatin combined with Dex can prevent the occurrence of POCD and emergence agitation in elderly patients undergoing THA.
