38167993|a|Evidence suggests that beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced phosphorylation/aggregation of tau protein plays a critical role in the degeneration of neurons and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia affecting the elderly population. Many studies have pursued a variety of small molecules, including nanoparticles conjugated with drugs to interfere with Abeta and/or tau aggregation/toxicity as an effective strategy for AD treatment. We reported earlier that FDA approved PLGA nanoparticles without any drug can attenuate Abeta aggregation/toxicity in cellular/animal models of AD. In this study, we evaluated the effects of native PLGA on Abeta seed-induced aggregation of tau protein using a variety of biophysical, structural and spectroscopic approaches. Our results show that Abeta1-42 seeds enhanced aggregation of tau protein in the presence and absence of heparin and the effect was attenuated by native PLGA nanoparticles. Interestingly, PLGA inhibited aggregation of both 4R and 3R tau isoforms involved in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in AD brains. Furthermore, Abeta seed-induced tau aggregation in the presence of arachidonic acid was suppressed by native PLGA. Collectively, our results suggest that native PLGA nanoparticles can inhibit the Abeta seed-induced aggregation of different tau protein isoforms highlighting their therapeutic implication in the treatment of AD.
