39083760|a|Objective: While there is a growing body of evidence indicating a relationship between COPD and cognitive impairment, there is a gap in evidence regarding discussions of cognitive symptoms in healthcare settings. This study investigated the extent to which individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) self-reported confusion or memory loss with healthcare professionals. Methods: A secondary analysis of 2019 BRFSS data of US adults aged 45+ with COPD (N = 107,204), using logistic regression to explore associations between socio-demographic and health-related indicators with discussion of cognitive symptoms with healthcare professionals. Results: Less than half (45.88%) of individuals reporting SCD discussed their cognitive symptoms with their healthcare provider. In the adjusted model, unemployed (AOR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.70-5.02, p < .005), retired (AOR = 3.16, 95% CI: 1.37-7.30, p < .01), and current smokers (AOR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.02-2.93, p < .05) were more likely to discuss cognitive decline with a healthcare professional than their counterparts. In contrast, males (AOR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.32-0.86, p < .05) and binge drinkers (AOR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.30-0.79, p < .01) were significantly less likely to do so when compared to their counterparts. Discussion: The study highlighted significant disparities in the likelihood of individuals with COPD discussing cognitive symptoms based on socio-demographic and health risk behaviors. Conclusion: Addressing gender disparities, occupational status, and personal health risks is crucial for improving patient-provider communication about SCD among adults with COPD.
