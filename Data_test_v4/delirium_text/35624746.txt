35624746|t|Study on the Neuroprotective, Radical-Scavenging and MAO-B Inhibiting Properties of New Benzimidazole Arylhydrazones as Potential Multi-Target Drugs for the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease.
35624746|a|Oxidative stress is a key contributing factor in the complex degenerating cascade in Parkinson's disease. The inhibition of MAO-B affords higher dopamine bioavailability and stops ROS formation. The incorporation of hydroxy and methoxy groups in the arylhydrazone moiety of a new series of 1,3-disubstituted benzimidazole-2-thiones could increase the neuroprotective activity. In vitro safety evaluation on SH-SY5Y cells and rat brain synaptosomes showed a strong safety profile. Antioxidant and neuroprotective effects were evaluated in H2O2-induced oxidative stress on SH-SY5Y cells and in a model of 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in rat brain synaptosomes, where the dihydroxy compounds 3h and 3i demonstrated the most robust neuroprotective and antioxidant activity, more pronounced than the reference melatonin and rasagiline. Statistically significant MAO-B inhibitory effects were exerted by some of the compounds where again the catecholic compound 3h was the most potent inhibitor similar to selegiline and rasagiline. The most potent antioxidant effect in the ferrous iron induced lipid peroxidation assay was observed for the three catechols-3h and 3j, 3q. The catecholic compound 3h showed scavenging capability against superoxide radicals and antioxidant effect in the iron/deoxyribose system. The study outlines a perspective multifunctional compound with the best safety profile, neuroprotective, antioxidant and MAO-B inhibiting properties.
