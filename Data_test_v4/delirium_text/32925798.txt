32925798|t|Efficacy and safety of ginkgo preparation in patients with vascular dementia: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.
32925798|a|BACKGROUND: Vascular dementia has become the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer disease. At present, there is no uniform standard for VaD treatment guidelines among countries. The efficacy of ginkgo biloba in the treatment of vascular dementia is still controversial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ginkgo biloba in the treatment of vascular dementia through meta-analysis. METHODS: Six English databases (PubMed, Web of science, Medline, EBASE, Springer Cochrane Library, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) and 4 Chinese databases (Wan fang Database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database(CNKI) and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database) will be searched normatively according to the rule of each database from the inception to August 1, 2020. Two reviewers will independently conduct article selection, data collection, and risk of bias evaluation. Any disagreement will be resolved by discussion with the third reviewer. Either the fixed-effects or random-effects model will be used for data synthesis based on the heterogeneity test. The change in the scores on mini-mental state examination, activity of daily living scale and Montreal cognitive assement will be used as the main outcome measure, Hamilton depression scale, Hastgawa dementia scale, blessed dementia scale, clinical dmentia rating scale as the secondary outcome. Treatment emergent symptom scale, general physical examination (temperature, pulse, respiration, blood pressure), Routine examination of blood, urine and stool, electrocardiogram, liver and kidney function examination as the security indexs. RevMan5.3.5 will be used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: This study will provide high-quality evidence to assess the effectiveness and safety of ginkgo preparation for vascular dementia. CONCLUSION: This systematic review will explore whether ginkgo preparation is an effective and safe intervention for vascular dementia. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval are not required for this study. The systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, presented at conferences, and will be shared on social media platforms. This review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal or conference presentation. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO CRD42020167851.
