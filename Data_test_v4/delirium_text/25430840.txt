25430840|t|Link between Alzheimer's disease and benzodiazepines suspected.
25430840|a|While the acute effects of benzodiazepines on memory and cognition are well documented, the possibility that they increase risk of dementia is still debated. This study matched 1,796 people with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's with 7,184 people over the age of 66 who did not have the condition. The researchers examined benzodiazepine use begun at least five years before the start of the study. Findings showed an association with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.
