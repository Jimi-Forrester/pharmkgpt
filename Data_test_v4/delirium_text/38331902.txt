38331902|t|Peritoneal sepsis caused by Escherichia coli triggers brainstem inflammation and alters the function of sympatho-respiratory control circuits.
38331902|a|BACKGROUND: Sepsis has a high mortality rate due to multiple organ failure. However, the influence of peripheral inflammation on brainstem autonomic and respiratory circuits in sepsis is poorly understood. Our working hypothesis is that peripheral inflammation affects central autonomic circuits and consequently contributes to multiorgan failure in sepsis. METHODS: In an Escherichia coli (E. coli)-fibrin clot model of peritonitis, we first recorded ventilatory patterns using plethysmography before and 24 h after fibrin clot implantation. To assess whether peritonitis was associated with brainstem neuro-inflammation, we measured cytokine and chemokine levels in Luminex assays. To determine the effect of E. coli peritonitis on brainstem function, we assessed sympatho-respiratory nerve activities at baseline and during brief (20 s) hypoxemic ischemia challenges using in situ-perfused brainstem preparations (PBPs) from sham or infected rats. PBPs lack peripheral organs and blood, but generate vascular tone and in vivo rhythmic activities in thoracic sympathetic (tSNA), phrenic and vagal nerves. RESULTS: Respiratory frequency was greater (p < 0.001) at 24 h post-infection with E. coli than in the sham control. However, breath-by-breath variability and total protein in the BALF did not differ. IL-1beta (p < 0.05), IL-6 (p < 0.05) and IL-17 (p < 0.04) concentrations were greater in the brainstem of infected rats. In the PBP, integrated tSNA (p < 0.05) and perfusion pressure were greater (p < 0.001), indicating a neural-mediated pathophysiological high sympathetic drive. Moreover, respiratory frequency was greater (p < 0.001) in PBPs from infected rats than from sham rats. Normalized phase durations of inspiration and expiration were greater (p < 0.009, p < 0.015, respectively), but the post-inspiratory phase (p < 0.007) and the breath-by-breath variability (p < 0.001) were less compared to sham PBPs. Hypoxemic ischemia triggered a biphasic response, respiratory augmentation followed by depression. PBPs from infected rats had weaker respiratory augmentation (p < 0.001) and depression (p < 0.001) than PBPs from sham rats. In contrast, tSNA in E. coli-treated PBPs was enhanced throughout the entire response to hypoxemic ischemia (p < 0.01), consistent with sympathetic hyperactivity. CONCLUSION: We show that peripheral sepsis caused brainstem inflammation and impaired sympatho-respiratory motor control in a single day after infection. We conclude that central sympathetic hyperactivity may impact vital organ systems in sepsis.
