31072626|t|Psychological Considerations in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.
31072626|a|BACKGROUND: In recent decades, advances in transplantation medicine, and improved posttransplant care have reduced morbidity and mortality from hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCTs). However, patients undergoing HSCT report a high prevalence of psychological distress, which can negatively impact recovery, function, and health outcomes, including mortality and higher risk of graft vs. host disease. Appropriate assessment and management of these psychological symptoms lead to better engagement with treatment and a variety of superior health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We provide a narrative review of the psychological challenges that accompany HSCT and suggest management approaches to equip psychiatric consultants involved in the care of this patient population. METHODS: We reviewed published work in PubMed, PsycInfo, and Scopus electronic databases on the common psychological challenges in HSCT, their vulnerability factors, as well as practical interventions for managing these challenges. RESULTS: We outline the phases of the HSCT hospitalization and discuss common psychological challenges, such as depression, delirium, and post-traumatic stress reactions that accompany HSCT. We suggest an approach to psychiatric consults during the HSCT hospitalization and discuss practical interventions for managing psychological challenges in this population. CONCLUSIONS: Though pharmacological and behavioral interventions have been successfully used to treat psychosocial challenges in HSCT, further research is needed to understand the optimal psychiatric assessment tools, treatment strategies, and the long-term psychiatric care needed to address psychiatric comorbidities in this growing patient population.
