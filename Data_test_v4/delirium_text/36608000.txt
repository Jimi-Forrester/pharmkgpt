36608000|t|beta-patchoulene alleviates cognitive dysfunction in a mouse model of sepsis associated encephalopathy by inhibition of microglia activation through Sirt1/Nrf2 signaling pathway.
36608000|a|BACKGROUND: Sepsis associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common but poorly understood complication during sepsis. Currently, there are no preventive or therapeutic agents available for this neurological disorder. The present study was designed to determine the potential protective effects of beta-patchoulene (beta-PAE) in a mouse model of SAE and explore the putative mechanisms underpinning the beneficial effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice by cecal ligation and puncture(CLP). Mice were administrated with beta-PAE or saline by intra-cerebral ventricle(i.c.v) injection immediately after CLP surgery. The inhibitory avoidance tests and open field tests were performed at 24h, 48h and 7days after procedures. Cytokines expression, oxidative parameters, microglia polarization and apoptosis in the brain tissue were assessed. Sirt1, Nrf2, HO-1and cleaved-caspase3 expression in hippocampus was determined by western-blotting. Further, serum cytokines expression and spleen lymphocytes apoptosis were evaluated, and survival study was performed. RESULTS: Septic mice suffered severe cognitive decline following CLP as evidenced by decreased memory latency time and lower frequency of line crossing in the behavioral tests. A high dose of beta-PAE(1mg/kg) improved the cognitive impairment in SAE mice, which was accompanied by reduced cytokines expression and oxidative stress. Immunofluorescence assay showed that beta-PAE inhibited the expression of Iba-1 and iNOS in microglia. The mechanistic study indicated that beta-PAE could promote the nuclear expression of Sirt1/Nrf2 and enhance cytoplasmic HO-1 expression. Furthermore, i.c.v administration of beta-PAE decreased the expression of serum cytokines and apoptosis in the spleen, thus leading to an improved 7-day survival of septic mice. Finally, blockade of Nrf2 activation with ML385 largely mitigated the protective effects of beta-PAE on the cognitive function, neuroinflammation and survival in SAE mice. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that beta-PAE significantly altered sepsis induced neuroinflammation and microglia activation, thus reversed the cognitive decline and improved the peripheral immune function. The neuroprotective effects were possibly mediated by the activation of Sirt1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. beta-PAE might serve as a promising therapeutic agent for SAE prevention and treatment.
