21528161|a|OBJECTIVES: The present study investigates the impact of unawareness of deficit (anosognosia) in patients with Alzheimer's disease upon professional health care burden. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with a consecutive clinical sample from an Alzheimer day-care hospital in France. SUBJECTS: 65 patients with probable AD, aged from 75 to 94 years old, consecutively admitted at the Alzheimer Day Hospital to complete a program of cognitive stimulation and psychosocial rehabilitation. MEASUREMENTS: Each patient was submitted to a standardized evaluation including clinical investigation, cerebral imagery, and neuropsychological assessment. Anosognosia of memory deficit and anosognosia of behavioral disturbances were measured as the "discrepancy scores" between patients' self-reports and family member ratings of patient memory performance and behavioral disturbances. Professional health care burden was assessed with the Professional Health Care Dementia Burden Index (PCDBI; maximal score: 12), designed for this study. Multiple linear regressions were used to examine the correlations between the PCDBI and the severity of anosognosia. RESULTS: The findings showed a significant positive correlation between the PCDBI and both anosognosia of memory impairment and behavioral abnormalities (both p at least less than 0.05). However, there was no significant correlation between the severity of the burden and the severity of cognitive decline or functional impairment (both p at least>0.05). CONCLUSION: Anosognosia in Alzheimer disease patients has a negative impact upon the professional caregivers' burden over and above the cognitive deficit and the functional impairments.
