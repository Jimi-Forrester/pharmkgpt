METHOD: Using data from six hospitals across two academic medical networks covering care occurring after initial model development, we calculated the predicted risk of delirium using a previously developed risk model applied to diagnostic, medication, laboratory, and other clinical features available in the electronic health record (EHR) at time of hospital admission. We evaluated the accuracy of these predictions against subsequent delirium diagnoses during that admission. RESULTS: Of the 5102 patients in this cohort, 716 (14%) developed delirium. The model's risk predictions produced a c-index of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.73-0.77) with 27.7% of cases occurring in the top decile of predicted risk scores. Model calibration was diminished compared to the initial COVID-19 wave. CONCLUSION: This EHR delirium risk prediction model, developed during the initial surge of COVID-19 patients, produced consistent discrimination over subsequent larger waves; however, with changing cohort composition and delirium occurrence rates, model calibration decreased. These results underscore the importance of calibration, and the challenge of developing risk models for clinical contexts where standard of care and clinical populations may shift.
