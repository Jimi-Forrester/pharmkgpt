26277875|t|Delirium Tremens Leads to Poor Outcomes for Acute Coronary Syndrome.
26277875|a|OBJECTIVES: The mortality rate for patients with delirium tremens (DT) is 5%. As these patients present with elevated cardiac indices, coexisting DT in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) likely worsens outcomes. Our aim was to examine the outcomes of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and DT in patients with ACS. METHODS: We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2000-2009) for our study. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to examine the independent association of AWS on inhospital mortality and a multivariable linear regression was used to examine the effect of AWS on inpatient length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: An estimated 2,465,852 admissions with a primary diagnosis of ACS were analyzed. Of these, 4,499 patients had AWS and 3,460 patients had DT. Adjusting for age, gender, race, insurance, hospital characteristics, Charlson's comorbidity index, stent placement and year, the inhospital mortality was significant only for DT (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.21-2.04). Inpatient LOS was 1.64 (95% CI 1.58-1.73) times higher in those with AWS and 2.33 (95% CI 2.22-2.43) times higher in DT when compared to nonalcoholics. Total hospital charges were higher for patients with AWS and DT when compared to nonalcoholics. CONCLUSIONS: Coexisting DT in ACS admissions is associated with increased mortality along with longer inpatient LOS and higher hospital costs.
