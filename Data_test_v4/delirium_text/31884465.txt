31884465|t|Costs of Inpatient Rehabilitation for Ischemic Stroke in Patients with Dementia: A Cohort Swedish Register-Based Study.
31884465|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke and dementia are frequent comorbidities. Dementia possibly increases total costs of stroke care, especially cost of institutionalization and informal medical care. However, stroke rehabilitation costs in dementia patients are understudied. OBJECTIVE: To estimate inpatient stroke rehabilitation costs for Swedish dementia patients in comparison with non-dementia patients. METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study with linked data from the Swedish Dementia Register and the Swedish Stroke Register was conducted. Patients diagnosed with dementia who suffered a first ischemic stroke between 2010 and 2014 (n = 138) were compared with non-dementia patients (n = 935). Cost analyses were conducted from a Swedish health care perspective. The difference of rehabilitation costs between the two groups was examined via simple linear regression (before and after matching by propensity scores of dementia) and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Mean inpatient rehabilitation costs for dementia and non-dementia patients were SEK 103,693/$11,932 and SEK 130,057/$14,966, respectively (median SEK 92,183/$10,607 and SEK 106,365/$12,239) (p = 0.001). Dementia patients suffered from more comorbidities and experienced lower functioning, compared to non-dementia patients. The inpatient rehabilitation cost for patients with known dementia was 0.84 times the cost in non-dementia individuals. CONCLUSION: Dementia diagnosis was significantly associated with lower inpatient stroke rehabilitation costs. This might be explained by physicians' beliefs on the limited effectiveness of rehabilitation in dementia patients. Further research on cost-effectiveness of stroke rehabilitation and patients' satisfaction with stroke rehabilitation is necessary.
