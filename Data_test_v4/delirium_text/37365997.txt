37365997|t|Management of the acute on chronic liver failure in the intensive care unit.
37365997|a|Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) reflects the development of organ failure(s) in a patient with cirrhosis and is associated with high short-term mortality. Given that ACLF has many different 'phenotypes', medical management needs to take into account the relationship between precipitating insult, organ systems involved and underlying physiology of chronic liver disease/cirrhosis. The goals of intensive care management of patients suffering ACLF are to rapidly recognize and treat inciting events (e.g. infection, severe alcoholic hepatitis and bleeding) and to aggressively support failing organ systems to ensure that patients may successfully undergo liver transplantation or recovery. Management of these patients is complex since they are prone to develop new organ failures and infectious or bleeding complications. ICU therapy parallels that applied in the general ICU population in some complications but differs in others. Given that liver transplantation in ACLF is an emerging and evolving field, multidisciplinary teams with expertise in critical care and transplant medicine best accomplish management of the critically ill ACLF patient. The focus of this review is to identify the common complications of ACLF and to describe the proper management in critically ill patients awaiting liver transplantation in our centres, including organ support, prognostic assessment and how to assess when recovery is unlikely.
