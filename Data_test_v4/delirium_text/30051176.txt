30051176|a|BACKGROUND: One of the first symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is word retrieval deficits. A systematic evaluation of word retrieval deficits can have an important predictive value for developing Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: Is the test for finding word retrieval deficits (word finding = WoFi) able to detect deficits in word retrieval and does it correlate with other dementia tests? METHODS: A word retrieval test called WoFi was developed. It is an instrument that tests word retrieval deficits based on 50 questions. A maximum of 100 points can be scored. RESULTS: The control group scored significantly better than the AD group. Using a cut-off score of 84 points WoFi could discriminate controls from subjects with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 92%. CONCLUSION: The use of WoFi was able to test for word retrieval deficits. Application required less than 15 min and test instructions are very simple. This instrument might be useful in telehealth.
