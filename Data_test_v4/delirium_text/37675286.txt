37675286|a|Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is a prevalent inflammatory disorder of the ocular surface that significantly impacts patients' vision and quality of life. The underlying mechanism of aging and MGD remains largely uncharacterized. The aim of this work is to investigate lipid metabolic alterations in age-related MGD (ARMGD) through integrated proteomics, lipidomics and machine learning (ML) approach. For this purpose, we collected samples of female mouse meibomian glands (MGs) dissected from eyelids at age two months (n = 9) and two years (n = 9) for proteomic and lipidomic profilings using the liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. To further identify ARMGD-related lipid biomarkers, ML model was established using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm. For proteomic profiling, 375 differentially expressed proteins were detected. Functional analyses indicated the leading role of cholesterol biosynthesis in the aging process of MGs. Several proteins were proposed as potential biomarkers, including lanosterol synthase (Lss), 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (Dhcr24), and farnesyl diphosphate farnesyl transferase 1 (Fdft1). Concomitantly, lipidomic analysis unveiled 47 lipid species that were differentially expressed and clustered into four classes. The most notable age-related alterations involved a decline in cholesteryl esters (ChE) levels and an increase in triradylglycerols (TG) levels, accompanied by significant differences in their lipid unsaturation patterns. Through ML construction, it was confirmed that ChE(26:0), ChE(26:1), and ChE(30:1) represent the most promising diagnostic molecules. The present study identified essential proteins, lipids, and signaling pathways in age-related MGD (ARMGD), providing a reference landscape to facilitate novel strategies for the disease transformation.
