38299236|a|Stroke, a debilitating cerebrovascular ailment, poses significant threats to human life and health. The intricate interplay between the gut-brain-microbiota axis (GBMA) and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion has increasingly become a focal point of scientific exploration, emerging as a pivotal research avenue in stroke pathophysiology. In the present review, the authors delved into the nexus between the GBMA and neuroinflammation observed post-stroke. The analysis underscored the pivotal roles of histone deacetylase 3 and neutrophil extracellular traps subsequent to stroke incidents. The influence of gut microbial compositions and their metabolites, notably short-chain fatty acids and trimethylamine N-oxide, on neuroinflammatory processes, was further elucidated. The involvement of immune cells, especially regulatory T-cells, and the intricate signaling cascades including cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes/Toll-like receptor, further emphasized the complex regulatory mechanisms of GBMA in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CI/RI). Collectively, the present review offered a comprehensive perspective on the metabolic, immune and inflammatory modulations orchestrated by GBMA, augmenting the understanding of its role in neuroinflammation following CI/RI.
