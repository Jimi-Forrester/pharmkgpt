36830563|a|Uterine leiomyomas are smooth-muscle tumors originating in the myometrium and are the most common pelvic tumors in women of reproductive age. Symptomatic tumors may result in abnormal uterine bleeding, bladder dysfunction, pelvic discomfort, and reproductive issues, such as infertility and miscarriage. There are currently few non-invasive treatments for leiomyoma, but there are no practical early intervention or preventive methods. In this study, human uterine leiomyoma and myometrial tissues were used to detect the protein and mRNA expression levels of UCHL1. To explore the effects of UCHL1 knockdown and inhibition in leiomyoma and myometrial cells, we determined the mRNA expressions of COL1A1 and COL3A1. Collagen gel contraction and wound-healing assays were performed on myometrial and leiomyoma cells. We found that UCHL1 expression was considerably higher in uterine leiomyomas than in the myometrium. COL1A1 and COL3A1 expression levels were downregulated after inhibition of UCHL1 in human leiomyoma cells. Furthermore, the elimination of UCHL1 significantly decreased the migration and contractility of leiomyoma cells. In conclusion, these results indicate that UCHL1 is involved in the growth of leiomyoma in humans. For the treatment of uterine leiomyoma, targeting UCHL1 activity may be a unique and possible therapeutic strategy.
