38617987|a|BACKGROUND: Grasping the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still a work in progress, and existing diagnostic techniques encounter various obstacles. Therefore, the discovery of dependable biomarkers is essential for early detection, tracking the disease's advancement, and steering treatment strategies. AIM: To explore the diagnostic potential of serum CXCL12, sCD22, Lp-PLA2, and their ratios in AD, aiming to enhance early detection and inform targeted treatment strategies. METHODS: The study was conducted in Dongying people's Hospital from January 2021 to December 2022. Participants included 60 AD patients (AD group) and 60 healthy people (control group). Using a prospective case-control design, the levels of CXCL12, sCD22 and Lp-PLA2 and their ratios were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit in the diagnosis of AD. The differences between the two groups were analyzed by statistical methods, and the corresponding ratio was constructed to improve the specificity and sensitivity of diagnosis. RESULTS: Serum CXCL12 levels were higher in the AD group (47.2 +- 8.5 ng/mL) than the control group (32.8 +- 5.7 ng/mL, P < 0.001), while sCD22 levels were lower (14.3 +- 2.1 ng/mL vs 18.9 +- 3.4 ng/mL, P < 0.01). Lp-PLA2 levels were also higher in the AD group (112.5 +- 20.6 ng/mL vs 89.7 +- 15.2 ng/mL, P < 0.05). Significant differences were noted in CXCL12/sCD22 (3.3 vs 1.7, P < 0.001) and Lp-PLA2/sCD22 ratios (8.0 vs 5.2, P < 0.05) between the groups. Receiver operating characteristic analysis confirmed high sensitivity and specificity of these markers and their ratios in distinguishing AD, with area under the curves ranging from 0.568 to 0.787. CONCLUSION: Serum CXCL12 and Lp-PLA2 levels were significantly increased, while sCD22 were significantly decreased, as well as increases in the ratios of CXCL12/sCD22 and Lp-PLA2/sCD22, are closely related to the onset of AD. These biomarkers and their ratios can be used as potential diagnostic indicators for AD, providing an important clinical reference for early intervention and treatment.
