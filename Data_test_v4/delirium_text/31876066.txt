31876066|t|Awareness and practices of general practitioners towards the oral-systemic disease relationship: A regionwide survey in France.
31876066|a|RATIONALE, AIM, AND OBJECTIVE: "Periodontal medicine" is based on evidence of interactions between periodontal disease and overall health. The aim of the present study was to assess awareness of oral-systemic disease relationship among French general practitioners (GPs) and clarify how this influences their practices in a wider effort to better integrate oral health concerns into global health care delivery. METHOD: GPs registered in the north of France were invited to complete an online self-administered questionnaire through local divisions of the French Medical Board. The questionnaire was divided into four sections: socio-demographic aspects, knowledge, practices, and an overview. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 253 GPs. Among these, 75% were aware of the association between periodontitis (PD) and diabetes, and 53% to 59% were aware of the impact of PD on cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, and respiratory infections. Few GPs identified PD as a possible risk factor of rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer disease (35.18% and <15%, respectively); 74.31% of GPs reported never asking their patients about their periodontal health. However, a personal history of PD and professional experiences seem to influence the medical practices of GPs to include oral examination. GPs largely self-rated their knowledge of the oral-systemic disease connection as being insufficient and were favourable to completing an up-to-date training course (86.56%). CONCLUSION: French GPs' knowledge about the association of PD with systemic diseases seems to be fair, but discrepancies in their daily clinical routine were found. Promisingly, a positive attitude was observed towards improving their knowledge of oral-systemic diseases link. These results indicate the importance to reinforce collaboration between medical doctors and oral health care specialists.
