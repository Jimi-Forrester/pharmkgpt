10480352|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia that occurs in later years. The diagnosis is confirmed by the pathological findings of betaA4-amyloid-containing neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the former being present in sufficient quantity commensurate with age. Other forms of dementia are more difficult to diagnose clinically; their pathology is noted for the lack of plaques and tangles. A patient with a family history of dementia presented with the clinical signs of Alzheimer's disease which lasted for 13 years. At autopsy the brain tissue had betaA4-amyloid-containing neuritic plaques, but no neurofibrillary tangles (i.e., the tissue was negative for staining with the tau antibody). Genetic analysis of DNA from family members revealed no linkage with chromosome 17 markers, indicating that this was not frontotemporal dementia. However, there was linkage with chromosome 3 markers. Thus, this form of Alzheimer's disease with a pathology of plaques only is linked with markers on chromosome 3.
