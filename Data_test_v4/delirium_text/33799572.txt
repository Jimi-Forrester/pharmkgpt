33799572|t|Non-Syndromic Intellectual Disability and Its Pathways: A Long Noncoding RNA Perspective.
33799572|a|Non-syndromic intellectual disability (NS-ID or idiopathic) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that represents a global health issue. Although many efforts have been made to characterize it and distinguish it from syndromic intellectual disability (S-ID), the highly heterogeneous aspect of this disorder makes it difficult to understand its etiology. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a large group of transcripts that can act through various mechanisms and be involved in important neurodevelopmental processes. In this sense, comprehending the roles they play in this intricate context is a valuable way of getting new insights about how NS-ID can arise and develop. In this review, we attempt to bring together knowledge available in the literature about lncRNAs involved with molecular and cellular pathways already described in intellectual disability and neural function, to better understand their relevance in NS-ID and the regulatory complexity of this disorder.
