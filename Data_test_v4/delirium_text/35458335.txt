35458335|t|Exploring the Impact of Chitosan Composites as Artificial Organs.
35458335|a|Chitosan and its allies have in multiple ways expanded into the medical, food, chemical, and biological industries and is still expanding. With its humble beginnings from marine shell wastes, the deacetylated form of chitin has come a long way in clinical practices. The biomedical applications of chitosan are truly a feather on its cap, with rarer aspects being chitosan's role in tissue regeneration and artificial organs. Tissue regeneration is a highly advanced and sensitive biomedical application, and the very fact that chitosan is premiering here is an authentication of its ability to deliver. In this review, the various biomedical applications of chitosan are touched on briefly. The synthesis methodologies that are specific for tissue engineering and biomedical applications have been listed. What has been achieved using chitosan and chitosan composites in artificial organ research as well as tissue regeneration has been surveyed and presented. The lack of enthusiasm, as demonstrated by the very few reports online with respect to chitosan composites and artificial organs, is highlighted, and the reasons for this lapse speculated. What more needs be done to expand chitosan and its allies for a better utilization and exploitation to best benefit the construction of artificial organs and building of tissue analogs has been discussed.
