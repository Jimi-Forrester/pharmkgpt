37108965|t|Tramadol May Increase Risk of Hip Fracture in Older Adults with Post-Traumatic Osteoarthritis.
37108965|a|Tramadol, an analgesic widely used for arthritic pain, is known to have adverse effects. This study investigated the association between the long-term use of tramadol for pain control and subsequent hip fractures in patients aged 60 years or older with posttraumatic osteoarthritis. This population-based retrospective cohort study included patients with posttraumatic osteoarthritis who received tramadol for pain control for more than 90 days within a 1-year period. A control cohort was enrolled using propensity score matching. The primary outcome was a new diagnosis of hip fracture requiring surgery. In total, 3093 patients were classified into each cohort. Tramadol use was identified as a risk factor for hip fracture (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.41; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09-1.82; p = 0.008), especially among patients aged 60-70 years (aHR: 2.11; 95% CI: 1.29-3.47; p = 0.003) and among male patients (aHR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.24-2.70; p = 0.002). This is the first cohort study focusing on the association between long-term tramadol use and hip fracture among older adults with posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Tramadol, as a long-term pain control analgesic for older adults with posttraumatic osteoarthritis, may increase the risk of hip fracture, especially among male patients and those aged 60-70 years.
