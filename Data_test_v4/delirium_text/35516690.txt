35516690|a|Introduction: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage in the continuum of cognitive decline. Multiple risk factors may be involved apart from neuropathological states such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and vascular dementia. There is scant data in the literature pertaining to our study population in Kerala, South India that provide associations between suggested risk factors and MCI. Most of the elderly present to family and primary care physicians with complaints of some form of memory impairment. Objectives: To find out the significant neuropathological comorbid conditions present in elderly patients with MCI. To assess for other risk factors in the same population- including laboratory parameters, comorbidities, and psychosocial parameters. Methods: This retrospective record-based study included a sample of 93 patients with MCI as quantified by the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE). These subjects were compared with controls (n = 97) without MCI, with respect to neuropathological diagnoses, laboratory parameters and psychosocial parameters. Results: The findings of our study were that female gender, higher depression scores, a greater number of medications taken, benzodiazepine use, higher alkaline phosphatase levels, positive fall history, loss of a spouse, and lower levels of education were associated with MCI. MCI is negatively associated with positive alcohol history. The most commonly seen proven neuropathological diagnosis was Parkinson's disease. Conclusion: The risk factors that were found in our study should be highlighted in the elderly and preventive measures should be taken to prevent the downward progression through the cognitive continuum. Prospective studies looking into mild cognitive impairment with better screening tools and proper assessment of neuropathological comorbid conditions can further elucidate the findings related to this study.
