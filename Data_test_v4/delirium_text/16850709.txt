16850709|t|Deaths: preliminary data for 2004.
16850709|a|OBJECTIVES: This report presents preliminary U.S. data on deaths, death rates, life expectancy, leading causes of death, and infant mortality for the year 2004 by selected characteristics such as age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. METHODS: Data in this report are based on a large number of deaths comprising approximately 91 percent of the demographic file and 90 percent of the medical file for all deaths in the United States in 2004. The records are weighted to independent control counts for 2004. For certain causes of death such as unintentional injuries, homicides, suicides, and respiratory diseases, preliminary and final data differ because of the truncated nature of the preliminary file. Comparisons are made with 2003 final data. RESULTS: The age-adjusted death rate for the United States decreased from 832.7 deaths per 100,000 population in 2003 to 801.0 deaths per 100,000 population in 2004. Age-adjusted death rates decreased between 2003 and 2004 for the following major causes of death: Diseases of heart, Malignant neoplasms, Cerebrovascular diseases, Chronic lower respiratory diseases, Accidents (unintentional injuries), Diabetes mellitus, Influenza and pneumonia, Septicemia, Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, and Pneumonitis due to solids and liquids. Rates increased between 2003 and 2004 for the following: Alzheimer's disease and Essential (primary) hypertension and hypertensive renal disease. Life expectancy at birth rose by 0.4 year to a record high of 77.9 years.
