38586416|t|The anti-depression effect and potential mechanism of the petroleum ether fraction of CDB: Integrated network pharmacology and metabolomics.
38586416|a|The combination of Chaidangbo (CDB) is an antidepressant traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription simplified by Xiaoyaosan (a classic antidepressant TCM prescription) through dismantling research, which has the effect of dispersing stagnated liver qi and nourishing blood in TCM theory. Although the antidepressant effect of CBD has been confirmed in animal studies, the material basis and possible molecular mechanism for antidepressant activity in CBD have not been clearly elucidated. Herein, we investigated the effects and potential mechanisms of CDB antidepressant fraction (petroleum ether fraction of CDB, PEFC) on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression-like behavior in mice using network pharmacology and metabolomics. First, a UPLC-QE/MS was employed to identify the components of PEFC. To extract active ingredients, SwissADME screening was used to the real PEFC components that were found. Potential PEFC antidepressant targets were predicted based on a network pharmacology approach, and a pathway enrichment analysis was performed for the predicted targets. Afterward, a CUMS mouse depression model was established and LC-MS-based untargeted hippocampal metabolomics was performed to identify differential metabolites, and related metabolic pathways. Finally, the protein expressions in mouse hippocampi were determined by Western blot to validate the network pharmacology and metabolomics deduction. A total of 16 active compounds were screened in SwissADME that acted on 73 core targets of depression, including STAT3, MAPKs, and NR3C1; KEGG enrichment analysis showed that PEFC modulated signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, endocrine resistance, and MAPK to exert antidepressant effects. PEFC significantly reversed abnormalities of hippocampus metabolites in CUMS mice, mainly affecting the synthesis and metabolism of glycine, serine, and threonine, impacting catecholamine transfer and cholinergic synapses and regulating the activity of the mTOR signaling pathway. Furthermore, Western blot analysis confirmed that PEFC significantly influenced the main protein levels of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways in the hippocampus of mice subjected to CUMS. This study integrated metabolomics, network pharmacology and biological verification to explore the potential mechanism of PEFC in treating depression, which is related to the regulation of amino acid metabolism dysfunction and the activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways in the hippocampus. The comprehensive strategy also provided a reasonable way for unveiling the pharmacodynamic mechanisms of multi-components, multi-targets, and multi-pathways in TCM with antidepressant effect.
