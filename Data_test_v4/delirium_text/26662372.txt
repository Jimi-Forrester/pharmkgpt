26662372|t|Probing the molecular mechanism of cerium oxide nanoparticles in protecting against the neuronal cytotoxicity of Abeta1-42 with copper ions.
26662372|a|The molecular mechanism of CeONP in protecting against neuronal cytotoxicity from amyloid peptides and copper ions was investigated systematically by photoluminescence of [Ru(phen)2dppz](2+), morphology of TEM, mass spectroscopy, cell viability assay, ROS fluorescence assay, and EPR. The results revealed that CeONPs reduced Abeta1-42 aggregation, protected from neurotoxicity of ROS induced by Cu(2+) + Abeta1-42via blocking the production of free radicals and scavenging the radicals with Ce(3+)/Ce(4+) catalytic cycles, which provides a valuable insight into CeONPs as a therapeutic intervention in oxidative damage in Alzheimer's disease.
