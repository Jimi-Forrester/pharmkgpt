27996975|a|The molecular mechanism underlying lifespan extension by resveratrol remains widely discussed. To help study this mechanism, we previously created resveratrol-enriched rice, DJ526, by transferring the resveratrol biosynthesis gene into Dongjin rice. DJ526 accumulates 1.4-1.9 mug g-1 of resveratrol in its grain and can ameliorates age-related deterioration in mice, as compared to control animals, based on assessments of motor coordination, physical strength and cutaneous tissue aging. Here, we present raw data sets, deposited in public repositories, from microarray analysis and physiological data of mice fed with DJ526 and Dongjin rice and treated with resveratrol. We also provide a method to analyze blood serum at micron levels. These data sets may help other researchers find new clues regarding the etiology of the anti-aging process and signaling pathways induced by resveratrol, rice, or DJ526.
