38129775|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence-based interventions to protect against cognitive decline among older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are urgently needed. Rehabilitation approaches to support memory and behavioral/lifestyle interventions are recognized as promising strategies for preserving or improving cognitive health, although few previous interventions have combined both approaches. This paper describes the protocol of the Brain Boosters intervention, which synergistically combines training in compensatory and healthy lifestyle behaviors and supports implementation and tracking of new behaviors with a digital application. METHODS: The study utilizes a single-site, single-blinded, randomized controlled design to compare a structured lifestyle and compensatory aid intervention to an education-only self-guided intervention. We plan to enroll 225 community-dwelling adults (25% from underrepresented groups) aged 65 + who endorse subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and low baseline levels of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Both interventions will be administered in group format, consisting of 15 two-hour classes that occur weekly for ten weeks and taper to bi-monthly and monthly, for an intervention duration of 6 months. Participants in both interventions will receive education about a variety of memory support strategies and healthy lifestyle behaviors, focusing on physical and cognitive activity and stress management. The structured intervention will also receive support in adopting new behaviors and tracking set goals aided by the Electronic Memory and Management Aid (EMMA) digital application. Primary outcomes include global cognition (composite of memory, attention, and executive function tests) and everyday function (Everyday Cognition Questionnaire). Data will be collected at baseline and outcome visits, at approximately 6, 12, and 18 months. Qualitative interviews, self-report surveys (e.g., indicators of self-determination, health literacy) and EMMA data metrics will also be used to identify what components of the intervention are most effective and for whom they work. DISCUSSION: Successful project completion will provide valuable information about how individuals with SCD respond to a compensation and preventative lifestyle intervention assisted by a digital application, including an understanding of factors that may impact outcomes, treatment uptake, and adherence. The work will also inform development, scaling, and personalization of future interventions that can delay disability in individuals at risk for ADRD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov.
