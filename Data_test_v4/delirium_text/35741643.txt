35741643|t|Shen Qi Wan Ameliorates Learning and Memory Impairment Induced by STZ in AD Rats through PI3K/AKT Pathway.
35741643|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease, and increasing evidence shows that insulin signaling has crucial roles in AD initiation and progression. In this study, we explored the effect and underlying mechanism of SQW, a representative formula for tonifying the kidney and promoting yang, on improving the cognitive function in a streptozotocin-induced model of AD rats. We investigated memory impairment in the AD rats by using the Morris water test. HE and Nissl staining were employed to observe the histomorphological changes in the hippocampal. Expression levels of NeuN and proteins related to Tau and apoptosis were measured using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, respectively. Additionally, we performed RNA sequencing, and the selected hub genes were then validated by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins were detected by Western blot. We found that SQW treatment significantly alleviated learning and memory impairment, pathological damage, and apoptosis in rats, as evidenced by an increased level of NeuN and Bcl-2, and decreased phosphorylation of Tau, Bax, and Caspase-3 protein expression. SQW treatment reversed the expression of insulin resistance-related genes (Nr4a1, Lpar1, Bdnf, Atf2, and Ppp2r2b) and reduced the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Our results demonstrate that SQW could contribute to neuroprotection against learning and memory impairment in rats induced by STZ through activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
