24339209|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive severe neurodegenerative disorder, is currently incurable, despite intensive efforts worldwide. Herein, we demonstrate that catalytic oxygenation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) might be an effective approach to treat AD. Abeta1-42 was oxygenated under physiologically-relevant conditions (pH 7.4, 37  C) using a riboflavin catalyst and visible light irradiation, with modifications at the Tyr(10) , His(13) , His(14) , and Met(35) residues. The oxygenated Abeta1-42 exhibited considerably lower aggregation potency and neurotoxicity compared with native Abeta. Photooxygenation of Abeta can be performed even in the presence of cells, by using a selective flavin catalyst attached to an Abeta-binding peptide; the Abeta cytotoxicity was attenuated in this case as well. Furthermore, oxygenated Abeta1-42 inhibited the aggregation and cytotoxicity of native Abeta.
