36672106|a|BACKGROUND: The neuroinflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) is a prevalent syndrome of brain dysfunction secondary to severe sepsis and is regulated by microglia. Triggering the receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is known to have protective functions that modulate the microglial polarization of M2 type to reduce inflammatory responses, thereby improving cognition. METHODS: We examined the effect of TREM2 on the polarization state of microglia during the progression of neuroinflammation. After consecutive intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide for 7 days, we evaluated the inflammation of a septic mice model by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and electron microscopy, and we used immunofluorescence (IF) assays and Western blotting to visualize hippocampal sections in C57BL/6 mice to assess TREM2 expression. In addition, we analyzed the state of microglia polarization with quantitative RT-PCR. RESULT: The consecutive injection of LPS for 4 days elevated systemic inflammation and caused behavioral cognitive dysfunction in the septic model. However, on Day 7, the neuroinflammation was considerably attenuated. Meanwhile, TREM2 decreased on Day 4 and increased on Day 7 in vivo. Consistently, LPS could reduce the expression of TREM2 while IFN-beta enhanced TREM2 expression in vitro. TREM2 regulated the microglial M1 phenotype's conversion to the M2 phenotype. CONCLUSION: Our aim in this study was to investigate the interconnection between microglia polarization and TREM2 in neuroinflammation. Our results suggested that IFN-beta could modulate TREM2 expression to alter the polarization state of microglia, thereby reducing LPS-induced neuroinflammation. Therefore, TREM2 is a novel potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammation.
