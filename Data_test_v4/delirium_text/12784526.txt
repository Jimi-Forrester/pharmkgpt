12784526|t|[The Dutch College of General Practitioners' practice guideline 'Delirium in elderly people'; response from clinical geriatrics].
12784526|a|Delirium in elderly people is a severe condition that requires vigorous medical attention. Therefore, the Dutch College of General Practitioners has duly chosen to develop a practice guideline 'Delirium in elderly people'. It is likely that many general practitioners are only partly familiar with delirium in elderly people because the prevalence of delirium in general practice is low. Therefore, one of the objectives of the practice guideline should be to improve the diagnostic process. However, several diagnostic issues merit further attention. For example, the guideline does not contain a diagnostic algorithm and the description of the clinical presentation of a delirium is brief. In addition, the guideline lacks a clear overview of the most important risk factors for a delirium as well as a careful description of the difference between delirium and dementia.
