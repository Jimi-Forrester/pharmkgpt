30005899|t|The Effect of a Parental Visitation Program on Emergence Delirium Among Postoperative Children in the PACU.
30005899|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of parental presence on the incidence of emergence delirium (ED) of children in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). DESIGN: A quasi-experimental pretest and post-test study with nonequivalent and nonsynchronized control groups. METHODS: About 93 children aged 3 to 6 years undergoing general anesthesia for tonsillectomy were divided into two groups: parental presence and absence. ED was recorded using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale at 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes after PACU admission. FINDINGS: ED score at each time point in the experimental group was lower than the control group, but not statistically significant. ED score in the experimental group significantly decreased over time (F = 6.98; P = .010). CONCLUSIONS: Parental visitation programs could be effective on the degree of ED in children in the PACU setting. This result may contribute to the establishment of PACU visitation program policy in South Korea.
