32977678|t|The Role of Vesicle Trafficking Defects in the Pathogenesis of Prion and Prion-Like Disorders.
32977678|a|Prion diseases are fatal and transmissible neurodegenerative diseases in which the cellular form of the prion protein 'PrPc', misfolds into an infectious and aggregation prone isoform termed PrPSc, which is the primary component of prions. Many neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and polyglutamine diseases, such as Huntington's disease, are considered prion-like disorders because of the common characteristics in the propagation and spreading of misfolded proteins that they share with the prion diseases. Unlike prion diseases, these are non-infectious outside experimental settings. Many vesicular trafficking impairments, which are observed in prion and prion-like disorders, favor the accumulation of the pathogenic amyloid aggregates. In addition, many of the vesicular trafficking impairments that arise in these diseases, turn out to be further aggravating factors. This review offers an insight into the currently known vesicular trafficking defects in these neurodegenerative diseases and their implications on disease progression. These findings suggest that these impaired trafficking pathways may represent similar therapeutic targets in these classes of neurodegenerative disorders.
