32784295|t|Effect of Times to Blood Processing on the Stability of Blood Proteins Associated with Dementia.
32784295|a|BACKGROUND: The stability of proteins in the collecting tubes after blood draw is critical to the measured concentrations of the proteins. Although the guidelines issued by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) suggest centrifugation should take place within 2 h of drawing blood, it is very difficult to follow these guidelines in hospitals or clinics. It is necessary to study the effect of times to blood processing on the stability of the proteins of interest. METHODS: In this work, the plasma proteins of interest were those relevant to dementia, such as amyloid beta 1-40 (Abeta1-40), Abeta1-42, Tau protein (Tau), and alpha-synuclein. The times to blood processing after blood draw ranged from 0.5 to 8 h. The storage temperatures of blood were room temperature (approx. 25 C) and 30 C. After storage, blood samples were centrifuged at room temperature to obtain plasma samples. Ultrasensitive immunomagnetic reduction was applied to assay these proteins in the plasma. RESULTS: The levels of plasma Abeta1-40, Tau, and alpha-synuclein did not significantly change until 8 h after blood draw when stored at room temperature. Plasma Abeta1-42 levels did not change significantly after 8 h of storage at room temperature before blood processing. Higher storage temperatures, such as 30 C, for blood samples accelerated the significant variations in the measured concentrations of Abeta1-40, Tau, and alpha-synuclein in plasma. CONCLUSION: According to these results, for clinical practice, it is suggested that blood samples be stored at room temperature for no longer than 4.5 h after blood draw until centrifugation for the assay of dementia biomarkers in plasma.
