17489097|a|Presenilins are required for the function of gamma-secretase: a multiprotein complex implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We analyzed expression of the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene. We show that ERM recognizes avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (Ets) motifs on the PS1 promoter located at -10, +90, +129 and +165, and activates PS1 transcription with promoter fragments containing or not the -10 Ets site. Using yeast two-hybrid selection we identified interactions between the chromatin remodeling factor CHD3/ZFH and the C-terminal 415 amino acids of ERM used as bait. Clones contained the C-terminal region of CHD3 starting from amino acid 1676. This C-terminal fragment (amino acids 1676-2000) repressed transcription of the PS1 gene in transfection assays and PS1 protein expression from the endogenous gene in SH-SY5Y cells. In cells transfected with both CHD3 and ERM, activation of PS1 transcription by ERM was eliminated with increasing levels of CHD3. Progressive N-terminal deletions of CHD3 fragment (amino acids 1676-2000) indicated that sequences crucial for repression of PS1 and interactions with ERM in yeast two-hybrid assays are located between amino acids 1862 and 1877. This was correlated by the effect of progressive C-terminal deletions of CHD3, which indicated that sequences required for repression of PS1 lie between amino acids 1955 and 1877. Similarly, deletion to amino acid 1889 eliminated binding in yeast two-hybrid assays. Testing various shorter fragments of ERM as bait indicated that the region essential for binding CHD3/ZFH is within the amino acid region 96-349, which contains the central inhibitory DNA-binding domain (CIDD) of ERM. N-Terminal deletions of ERM showed that residues between amino acids 200 and 343 are required for binding to CHD3 (1676-2000) and C-terminal deletions of ERM indicated that amino acids 279-299 are also required. Furthermore, data from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) indicate that CHD3/ZFH interacts with the PS1 promoter in vivo.
