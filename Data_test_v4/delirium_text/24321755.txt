24321755|a|This study aimed to investigate whether Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) and Vascular Dementia (VAD) might be associated with a distinct profile of oxidative stress (OxS) peripheral markers. Serum levels of hydroperoxides, homocysteine, advanced oxidation protein products, uric acid, thiols, and total and residual antioxidant power were assessed in 103 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 89 LOAD, 54 VAD patients and 48 Controls. Compared with Controls, a similar oxidative unbalance (high hydroperoxides and low residual antioxidant power) was observed in MCI, LOAD and, although less pronounced, VAD. Moreover, individuals with simultaneously high levels of homocysteine and uric acid, both well-known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, had a high probability to be affected by VAD (O.R.:10.50; 95% C.I.: 2.33-47.2), but not LOAD (O.R.: 3.0; 95% C.I.:0.86-10.76) compared with individuals with normal values. Our data suggest that, although they might share a common OxS-related pathogenesis, VAD and LOAD might maintain some distinctive features, with a predominance of "vascular component" in VAD compared with LOAD.
