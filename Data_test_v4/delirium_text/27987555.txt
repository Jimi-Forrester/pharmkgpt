27987555|t|Clinical Amyloid Imaging.
27987555|a|Amyloid plaques, along with neurofibrillary tangles, are a neuropathologic hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Recently, amyloid PET radiotracers have been developed and approved for clinical use in the evaluation of suspected neurodegenerative disorders. In both research and clinical settings, amyloid PET imaging has provided important diagnostic and prognostic information for the management of patients with possible AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and other challenging diagnostic presentations. Although the overall impact of amyloid imaging is still being evaluated, the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging and Alzheimer's Association Amyloid Imaging Task Force have created appropriate use criteria for the standard clinical use of amyloid PET imaging. By the appropriate use criteria, amyloid imaging is appropriate for patients with (1) persistent or unexplained MCI, (2) AD as a possible but still uncertain diagnosis after expert evaluation and (3) atypically early-age-onset progressive dementia. To better understand the clinical and economic effect of amyloid imaging, the Imaging Dementia-Evidence for Amyloid Scanning (IDEAS) study is an ongoing large multicenter study in the United States, which is evaluating how amyloid imaging affects diagnosis, management, and outcomes for cognitively impaired patients who cannot be completely evaluated by clinical assessment alone. Multiple other large-scale studies are evaluating the prognostic role of amyloid PET imaging for predicting MCI progression to AD in general and high-risk populations. At the same time, amyloid imaging is an important tool for evaluating potential disease-modifying therapies for AD. Overall, the increased use of amyloid PET imaging has led to a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of this imaging modality and how it may best be used with other clinical, molecular, and imaging assessment techniques for the diagnosis and management of neurodegenerative disorders.
