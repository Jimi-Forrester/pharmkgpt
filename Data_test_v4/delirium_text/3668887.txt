3668887|t|The relationship between pre-operative anxiety and post-operative delirium.
3668887|a|Forty five elderly patients undergoing total hip replacements were assessed one day before and two days after surgery in order to explore the relationship between pre-operative anxiety and post-operative delirium. Anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and delirium was measured by a decrease in various measures of cognitive functioning. No relationship was found and this is discussed in the light of two theories which would have predicted one. Other secondary findings are reported and discussed.
