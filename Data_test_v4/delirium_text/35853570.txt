35853570|a|BACKGROUND: Agitation is a common symptom in dementia and linked to caregiver burden, but both agitation and burden are multidimensional constructs. The current study sought to determine whether specific presentations of agitation differentially relate to aspects of caregiver burden. METHODS: Medical record data from an outpatient memory clinic were extracted for 609 persons with dementia, including caregiver-reported burden and care recipient agitation. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis yielded three domains of agitation on the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory ('Physically Aggressive', 'Physically Non-Aggressive', 'Verbally Agitated') and four domains of burden on the Zarit Burden Interview ('Impact on Life', 'Guilt/Uncertainty', 'Embarrassment/Frustration', 'Overwhelm'). Regression analyses demonstrated all domains of agitation positively predicted overall burden. Regarding specific aspects of burden, Physically Aggressive behaviours predicted Embarrassment/Frustration. Physically Non-Aggressive behaviours predicted Impact on Life and Guilt/Uncertainty. Verbally Agitated behaviours predicted all burden dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest specific aspects of agitation may differentially contribute to facets of caregiver burden.
