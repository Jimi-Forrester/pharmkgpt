596758|a|The disappearance of hysterical madness, in the second decade of our century, was related to the emergence of the tentacular concept of schizophrenia. The case of Marie-Christine, a young girl whose delirium calls to mind the imaginary in witchcraft, prompts us to question upon the pertinency of abandonning the nosological entity "hysterical madness". We are attempting to show that, thanks to the Lacanian contribution in the theory of psychose, it is now becoming possible to distinguish between the latter and hysterical madness, this through the various and different aspects of the onset of the illness, of the fundamental mechanism, of the characteristics of the delirium, of the transference, of morbid anxiety.. That is why, to us, there seems to be a perceptible difference between the delirious hysteric who cannot manage to inhabit his sexed body, and the psychotic who has not succeeded in getting a grasp on the symbolic. Moreover, it seems that there is a close continuity from ordinary hysteria to hysterical madness, so that in the latter the delirium would not be the illness itself but only a symptom.
