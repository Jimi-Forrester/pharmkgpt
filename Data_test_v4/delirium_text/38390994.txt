38390994|a|The number of elderly people is projected to double in the next 50 years worldwide, resulting in an increased prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases. Aging causes changes in brain tissue homeostasis, thus contributing to the development of neurodegenerative disorders. Current treatments are not entirely effective, so alternative treatments or adjuvant agents are being actively sought. Antioxidant properties of phenolic compounds are of particular interest for neurodegenerative diseases whose psychopathological mechanisms strongly rely on oxidative stress at the brain level. Moreover, phenolic compounds display other advantages such as the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the interesting molecular mechanisms that we reviewed in this work. We began by briefly outlining the physiopathology of neurodegenerative diseases to understand the mechanisms that result in irreversible brain damage, then we provided an overall classification of the phenolic compounds that would be addressed later. We reviewed in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as some clinical trials in which neuroprotective mechanisms were demonstrated in models of different neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), ischemia, and traumatic brain injury (TBI).
