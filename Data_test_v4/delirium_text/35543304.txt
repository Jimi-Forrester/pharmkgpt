35543304|a|INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease with a high incidence worldwide. T2DM can cause cognitive impairment, but its neuropathological basis is unclear. A variety of neuropsychiatric studies have found that abnormal functional connectivity (FC) in the central executive network (CEN), default-mode network (DMN), and salience network (SN) may be the neuropathological basis of cognitive dysfunction. The right dorsal anterior insula (dAI) is the core SN area. It plays an important role in regulating the CEN and the DMN. However, few studies have explored the relationship between cognitive impairment and FC among the right dAI, CEN, and DMN in patients with T2DM. METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate FC between the right dAI and the CEN and DMN in 44 patients with T2DM and 41 sex-, age-, and education-matched healthy controls, as well as its relationship with clinical/cognitive variables. RESULTS: In patients with T2DM, FC between the right dAI and multiple brain regions of the CEN and DMN was generally decreased, and FC strength between the right dAI and the inferior frontal gyrus negatively correlated with trail making test A score (r = -0.421, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with T2DM exhibit abnormal FC between the right dAI and the CEN and DMN. This may be one of the neuromechanisms of cognitive impairment in patients with T2DM. In addition, reduced FC between the right dAI and the right inferior frontal gyrus may be related to abnormal attention regulation in patients with T2DM.
