37546928|a|Asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AsymAD) describes the status of subjects with preserved cognition but with identifiable Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain pathology (i.e. Abeta-amyloid deposits, neuritic plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles) at autopsy. In this study, we investigated the postmortem brains of a cohort of AsymAD cases to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms of resilience to AD pathology and cognitive decline. Our results showed that AsymAD cases exhibit an enrichment of core plaques and decreased filamentous plaque accumulation, as well as an increase in microglia surrounding this last type. In AsymAD cases we found less pathological tau aggregation in dystrophic neurites compared to AD and tau seeding activity comparable to healthy control subjects. We used spatial transcriptomics to further characterize the plaque niche and found autophagy, endocytosis, and phagocytosis within the top upregulated pathways in the AsymAD plaque niche, but not in AD. Furthermore, we found ARP2, an actin-based motility protein crucial to initiate the formation of new actin filaments, increased within microglia in the proximity of amyloid plaques in AsymAD. Our findings support that the amyloid-plaque microenvironment in AsymAD cases is characterized by microglia with highly efficient actin-based cell motility mechanisms and decreased tau seeding compared to AD. These two mechanisms can potentially provide protection against the toxic cascade initiated by Abeta that preserves brain health and slows down the progression of AD pathology.
