36896172|t|Distinct roles of ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2: A pan-cancer analysis.
36896172|a|Introduction: AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 proteins, encoded by ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 genes respectively, are the receptors of adiponectin secrected by adipose tissue. Increasing studies have identified the vital role of adipose tissue in various diseases, including cancers. Hence, there is an urgent need to explore the roles of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in cancers. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis for the roles of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 via several public databases, including expression differences, prognostic value, and the correlations with tumor microenvironment, epigenetic modification, and drug sensitivity. Results: Both ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 genes are dysregulated in most cancers, but their genomic alteration frequencies are low. In addition, they are also correlated with the prognosis of some cancers. Although they are not strongly correlated with tumor mutation burden (TMB) or microsatellite instability (MSI), ADIPOR1/2 genes display a significant association with cancer stemness, tumor immune microenvironment, immune checkpoint genes (especially CD274 and NRP1), and drug sensitivity. Discussion: ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 play critical roles in diverse cancers, and it is a potential strategy to treat tumors through targeting ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2.
