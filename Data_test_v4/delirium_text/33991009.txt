33991009|t|Identification and coregulation pattern analysis of long noncoding RNAs following subacute spinal cord injury.
33991009|a|Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to play critical regulatory roles in posttranscriptional and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. However, the characteristics of many lncRNAs, particularly their expression patterns in the lesion epicenter of spinal tissues following subacute spinal cord injury (SCI), remain unclear. In this study, we determined the expression profiles of lncRNAs in the lesion epicenter of spinal tissues after traumatic SCI and predicted latent regulatory networks. Standard Allen's drop surgery was conducted on mice, and hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe the damaged area. High-throughput sequencing was performed to identify the differential expression profiles of lncRNAs. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was conducted to evaluate the quality of the sequencing results. Bioinformatics analyses, including Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, coexpression analysis, and protein-protein interaction analysis, were performed. Targeted binding of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA was predicted by TargetScan and miRanda. A total of 230 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified and preliminarily verified, and some potential regulatory networks were constructed. These findings improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying subacute SCI; differentially expressed lncRNAs are closely involved in pathophysiological processes by regulating multiple pathways. Further studies are essential for revealing the exact mechanism underlying competing endogenous RNA pathways in vivo and in vitro.
