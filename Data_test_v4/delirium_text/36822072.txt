36822072|t|Reassessing hourly neurochecks.
36822072|a|Following acute brain injury, frequent neurological examinations ("neurochecks") are commonly prescribed and form the cornerstone of many care protocols and guidelines (e.g., for intracranial hemorrhage). While these assessments are intended to identify and mitigate secondary injury, they may unintentionally contribute to additional injury related to neurocheck-associated sleep disruption. Data are lacking to define patterns of neurological decline following acute brain injury, as are data to define the short- and long-term consequences (e.g., neuropsychological sequelae) of frequent and prolonged neurochecks. A critical need exists for rigorous evaluation of neurocheck practices, perceptions, benefits and risks, along with interventions to optimize neurocheck frequency and duration.
