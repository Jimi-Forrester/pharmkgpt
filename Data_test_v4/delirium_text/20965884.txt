20965884|a|Olfactory dysfunction is a common symptom reported by patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Despite the knowledge gathered about the pathology of these diseases, little information has been generated regarding the ultrastructure modifications of the granule cells that regulate the information for odor identification. Swollen organelles and nuclear invaginations identified the exposed mice. Necrosis was evidenced at 4th week of exposure, whereas apoptosis arose at 8th week of exposure. A ruffled electron-dense membrane changes were also found. The changes observed could be explained by the reactive oxygen species generated by manganese and its effects on the membrane's structure and on the cytoskeleton's function. This study contributes to correlate metal air pollution and neurodegenerative changes with olfactory affection.
