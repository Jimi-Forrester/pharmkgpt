28484349|t|One-Year Follow-Up of Patients with a Diagnosis of First Episode Psychosis.
28484349|a|INTRODUCTION: Early diagnosis of symptoms related to psychotic disorders causes hyper responsiveness, recurrence reduction and quality of life improvement. The aim of this study was one-year follow-up of the clinical course and outcomes of hospitalized patients with first episode psychotic disorders and detection of factors affecting consequences. METHODS: This longitudinal descriptive study was conducted during 2012 to 2013 on hospitalized patients at Zare Hospital in Sari, Iran, with any psychotic symptoms and with diagnosis of first episode psychosis. The severity of psychotic symptoms was assessed via PANSS scale (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) and the global functioning through Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale on admission, discharge day, 6 and 12 months later. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and t-test in SPSS 20 software. RESULTS: Thirty two patients had complete follow-up (25 men and 7 women) (mean age of 29.37 +- 8.02). Discharge diagnosis was as 8 (25%) bipolar disorder with psychotic features, 8 (25%) not otherwise specified (NOS), 7 (22%) schizophrenia forum disorder, 7 (22%) psychotic disorder caused by abuse materials, 2 (6%) major depressive disorder with psychotic features. There was drug abuse in half of the patients. The drug abuse in the patients had a positive relationship with the recurrence of psychotic symptoms (p=0.04). CONCLUSION: A significant percentage of patients with first episode psychosis (50%) within 12 months after the primary hospitalization experienced recurrence of psychotic symptoms. Likewise, global functioning had no major improvement in the patients. It seems essential the necessity of comprehensive services after discharge, especially in patients with drug abuse, and further support of social service centers.
