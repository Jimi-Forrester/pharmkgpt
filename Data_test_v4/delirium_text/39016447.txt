39016447|a|INTRODUCTION: Physical frailty is reversible, but little is known about the sustainability of frailty remission and its impact on dementia. METHODS: Data were derived from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) (2011 to 2021). Physical frailty was assessed using the Fried frailty phenotype, and frailty transition patterns across three waves were defined. The relationship of sustained frailty remission with incident dementia was examined using Cox proportional regression, stratified by age and gender. RESULTS: Among 1931 participants, 348 (18.0%) were capable of sustained frailty remission. During the 8-year follow-up, 279 participants developed dementia. In a fully adjusted model, sustained remission was associated with a lower risk of dementia (hazard ratio = 0.66, 95% confidence interval = 0.47 to 0.93). The association was more pronounced among younger-old and male participants but not observed among their counterparts. DISCUSSION: Sustained frailty remission was associated with a reduced risk of developing dementia. Physical frailty could be an essential forewarning of dementia and a target for interventions. HIGHLIGHTS: We provided new insights into the natural progression of frailty and its impact on dementia risk using a nationally representative sample Sustained frailty remission reduced risk of incident dementia. Age and gender played a role in the frailty-dementia link, and thus individualized dementia risk screening is necessary. Physical frailty could be an essential forewarning of cognitive decline and an ideal target for interventions to prevent dementia.
