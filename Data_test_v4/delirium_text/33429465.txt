33429465|t|A retrospective study of factors associated with persistent delirium.
33429465|a|BACKGROUND: It has been reported that delirium causes various problems. Many researchers have reported the risk factors associated with the onset of delirium; however, there are few reports focused on persistent delirium. This study aimed to identify the risk factors associated with persistent delirium. METHODS: A total of 573 patients hospitalised in Nara Prefecture General Medical Centre from October 2014 through September 2017 who were referred to the psychiatry consultation service were included in this study. Persistent delirium was defined as delirium lasting for 14 days or more. A retrospective study was carried out based on the patients' records. The relationship between various background factors and persistent delirium was statistically analysed. RESULTS: Of the 573 hospitalised patients, 295 were diagnosed as having delirium. Forty-six patients with persistent delirium and 181 patients with nonpersistent delirium were included in this study. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that male gender, opioid analgesics use, non-opioid analgesics use, and low serum sodium were significantly and independently associated with persistent delirium. Ramelteon or trazodone was used significantly more in persistent delirium, although each use was not significant. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to reveal that male gender and use of analgesics were associated with persistent delirium in general hospital. However, as this is a case-control study and may contain bias, future cohort studies and intervention studies are needed. It is also necessary to investigate the relevance of the 'degree of pain' behind the use of analgesics.
