3171622|t|Cerebellar ataxia with recovery related to central pontine myelinolysis.
3171622|a|Development of severe ataxia and mild pyramidal signs without mental deterioration, tetraparesis or pseudobulbar palsy during recovery from withdrawal delirium and initial hyponatraemia are unusual clinical features consistent with central pontine myelinolysis. This diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in an alcoholic man. Clinical and electrodiagnostic improvement occurred, whereas the MRI findings remained unchanged in a follow-up study.
