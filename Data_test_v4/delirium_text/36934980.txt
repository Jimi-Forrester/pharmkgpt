36934980|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) remain high despite recent advances in both anesthesia and perioperative management. Among modifiable risk factors for postoperative complications, optimal arterial pressure during and after surgery has been under debate for years. Recent data suggest that optimizing arterial pressure to the baseline of the patient may improve outcomes. We hypothesize that optimizing the mean arterial pressure (MAP) to the baseline MAP of the patient during cardiac surgery with CPB and during the first 24 hours postoperatively may improve outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: The OPTIPAM trial (NCT05403697) will be a multicenter, randomized, open-label controlled trial testing the superiority of optimized MAP management as compared with a MAP of 65 mm Hg or more during both the intraoperative and postoperative periods in 1,100 patients scheduled for cardiac surgery with CPB. The primary composite end point is the occurrence of acute kidney injury, neurological complications including stroke or postoperative delirium, and death. The secondary end points are hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay, Day 7 and Day 90 mortality, postoperative cognitive dysfunction on Day 7 and Day 90, and quality of life at Day 7 and Day 90. Two interim analyses will assess the safety of the intervention. CONCLUSION: The OPTIPAM trial will assess the effectiveness of an individualized target of mean arterial pressure in cardiac surgery with CPB in reducing postoperative morbidity. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05403697.
