29228701|t|A systematic assessment of chemical, genetic, and epigenetic factors influencing the activity of anticancer drug KP1019 (FFC14A).
29228701|a|KP1019 ([trans-RuCl4(1H-indazole)2]; FFC14A) is one of the promising ruthenium-based anticancer drugs undergoing clinical trials. Despite the pre-clinical and clinical success of KP1019, the mode of action and various factors capable of modulating its effects are largely unknown. Here, we used transcriptomics and genetic screening approaches in budding yeast model and deciphered various genetic targets and plethora of cellular pathways including cellular signaling, metal homeostasis, vacuolar transport, and lipid homeostasis that are primarily targeted by KP1019. We also demonstrated that KP1019 modulates the effects of TOR (target of rapamycin) signaling pathway and induces accumulation of neutral lipids (lipid droplets) in both yeast and HeLa cells. Interestingly, KP1019-mediated effects were found augmented with metal ions (Al3+/Ca2+/Cd2+/Cu2+/Mn2+/Na+/Zn2+), and neutralized by Fe2+, antioxidants, osmotic stabilizer, and ethanolamine. Additionally, our comprehensive screening of yeast histone H3/H4 mutant library revealed several histone residues that could significantly modulate the KP1019-induced toxicity. Altogether, our findings in both the yeast and HeLa cells provide molecular insights into mechanisms of action of KP1019 and various factors (chemical/genetic/epigenetic) that can alter the therapeutic efficiency of this clinically important anticancer drug.
