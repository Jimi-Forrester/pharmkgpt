38558059|t|The associations between type 2 diabetes and plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in the Health and Aging Brain Study: Health Disparities (HABS-HD).
38558059|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects Latinos disproportionately. One of the reasons underlying this disparity may be type 2 diabetes (T2D) that is a risk factor for AD. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of T2D and AD blood biomarkers and the differences in these associations between Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites. This study was a secondary analysis of baseline data from the observational Health and Aging Brain Study: Health Disparities (HABS-HD) that investigated factors underlying health disparities in AD in Mexican Americans in comparison to non-Hispanic Whites. HABS-HD participants were excluded if they had missing data or were large outliers (z-scores > 4 ) on a given AD biomarker. Fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured from clinical labs. T2D was diagnosed by licensed clinicians. Plasma amyloid-beta 42 and 40 (Abeta42/42) ratio, total tau (t-tau), and neurofilament light (NfL) were measured via ultra-sensitive Simoa assays. The sample sizes were 1,552 for Abeta42/40 ratio, 1,570 for t-tau, and 1,553 for NfL. Mexican Americans were younger (66.6+-8.7 vs. 69.5+-8.6) and had more female (64.9% female vs. 55.1%) and fewer years of schooling (9.5+-4.6 vs. 15.6+-2.5) than non-Hispanic Whites. Mexican Americans differed significantly from non-Hispanic Whites in blood glucose (113.5+-36.6 vs. 99.2+-17.0) and HbA1c (6.33+-1.4 vs. 5.51+-0.6) levels, T2D diagnosis (35.3% vs. 11.1%), as well as blood Abeta42/40 ratio (.051+-.012 vs. .047+-.011), t-tau (2.56+-.95 vs. 2.33+-.90), and NfL levels (16.3+-9.5 vs. 20.3+-10.3). Blood glucose, blood HbA1c, and T2D diagnosis were not related to Abeta42/40 ratio and t-tau but explained 3.7% of the variation in NfL (p < .001). Blood glucose and T2D diagnosis were not, while HbA1c was positively (b = 2.31, p < .001, beta = 0.26), associated with NfL among Mexican Americans. In contrast, blood glucose, HbA1c, and T2D diagnosis were negatively (b = -0.09, p < .01, beta = -0.26), not (b = 0.34, p = .71, beta = 0.04), and positively (b = 3.32, p < .01, beta = 0.33) associated with NfL, respectively in non-Hispanic Whites. To conclude, blood glucose and HbA1c levels and T2D diagnosis are associated with plasma NfL levels, but not plasma Abeta and t-tau levels. These associations differ in an ethnicity-specific manner and need to be further studied as a potential mechanism underlying AD disparities.
