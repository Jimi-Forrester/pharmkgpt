35408967|t|Iron Metabolism in Aging and Age-Related Diseases.
35408967|a|Iron is a trace metal element necessary to maintain life and is also involved in a variety of biological processes. Aging refers to the natural life process in which the physiological functions of the various systems, organs, and tissues decline, affected by genetic and environmental factors. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the relationship between iron metabolism and aging-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. During aging, the accumulation of nonheme iron destroys the stability of the intracellular environment. The destruction of iron homeostasis can induce cell damage by producing hydroxyl free radicals, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, brain aging, and even organismal aging. In this review, we have briefly summarized the role of the metabolic process of iron in the body, then discussed recent developments of iron metabolism in aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and finally, explored some iron chelators as treatment strategies for those disorders. Understanding the roles of iron metabolism in aging and neurodegenerative diseases will fill the knowledge gap in the field. This review could provide new insights into the research on iron metabolism and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.
