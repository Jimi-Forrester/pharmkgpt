7145182|a|The authors have investigated the changes of kalemia and kaluria levels in 40 patients suffering from delirium tremens, and have observed during the acute stage of the illness, a swift fall of kalemia level without an increase of the kaluric excretion. The kalemic values quickly rise up again at the end of the delirium.. The authors think that an adrenergic mechanism is responsible for this quick and transient hypokalemia. The significance of this adrenergic mechanism in the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is at present widely proved.
