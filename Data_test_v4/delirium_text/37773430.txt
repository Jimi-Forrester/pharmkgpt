37773430|a|Chronic consumption of hyperpalatable and hypercaloric foods has been pointed out as a factor associated with cognitive decline and memory impairment in obesity. In this context, the integration between peripheral and central inflammation may play a significant role in the negative effects of an obesogenic environment on memory. However, little is known about how obesity-related peripheral inflammation affects specific neurotransmission systems involved with memory regulation. Here, we test the hypothesis that chronic exposure to a highly palatable diet may cause neuroinflammation, glutamatergic dysfunction, and memory impairment. For that, we exposed C57BL/6J mice to a high sugar and butter diet (HSB) for 12 weeks, and we investigated its effects on behavior, glial reactivity, blood-brain barrier permeability, pro-inflammatory features, glutamatergic alterations, plasticity, and fractalkine-CX3CR1 axis. Our results revealed that HSB diet induced a decrease in memory reconsolidation and extinction, as well as an increase in hippocampal glutamate levels. Although our data indicated a peripheral pro-inflammatory profile, we did not observe hippocampal neuroinflammatory features. Furthermore, we also observed that the HSB diet increased hippocampal fractalkine levels, a key chemokine associated with neuroprotection and inflammatory regulation. Then, we hypothesized that the elevation on glutamate levels may saturate synaptic communication, partially limiting plasticity, whereas fractalkine levels increase as a strategy to decrease glutamatergic damage.
