37511061|a|Dementia is a permanent illness characterized by mental instability, memory loss, and cognitive decline. Many studies have demonstrated an association between diabetes and cognitive dysfunction that proceeds in three steps, namely, diabetes-associated cognitive decrements, mild cognitive impairment (MCI; both non-amnesic MCI and amnesic MCI), and dementia [both vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD)]. Based on this association, this disease has been designated as type 3 diabetes mellitus. The underlying mechanisms comprise insulin resistance, inflammation, lipid abnormalities, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glycated end-products and autophagy. Moreover, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) have been demonstrated to be involved. Insulin in the brain has a neuroprotective role that alters cognitive skills and alteration of insulin signaling determines beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation, in turn promoting brain insulin resistance. In this complex mechanism, other triggers include hyperglycemia-induced overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines, which result in neuroinflammation, suggesting that antidiabetic drugs may be potential treatments to protect against AD. Among these, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are the most attractive antidiabetic drugs due to their actions on synaptic plasticity, cognition and cell survival. The present review summarizes the significant data concerning the underlying pathophysiological and pharmacological mechanisms between diabetes and dementia.
