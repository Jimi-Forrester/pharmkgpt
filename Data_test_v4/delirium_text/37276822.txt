37276822|t|Gamma neuromodulation improves episodic memory and its associated network in amnestic mild cognitive impairment: a pilot study.
37276822|a|Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a predementia stage of Alzheimer's disease associated with dysfunctional episodic memory and limited treatment options. We aimed to characterize feasibility, clinical, and biomarker effects of noninvasive neurostimulation for aMCI. 13 individuals with aMCI received eight 60-minute sessions of 40-Hz (gamma) transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) targeting regions related to episodic memory processing. Feasibility, episodic memory, and plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarkers were assessed. Neuroplastic changes were characterized by resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and neuronal excitatory/inhibitory balance. Gamma tACS was feasible and aMCI participants demonstrated improvement in multiple metrics of episodic memory, but no changes in biomarkers. Improvements in episodic memory were most pronounced in participants who had the highest modeled tACS-induced electric fields and exhibited the greatest changes in RSFC. Increased RSFC was also associated with greater hippocampal excitability and higher baseline white matter integrity. This study highlights initial feasibility and the potential of gamma tACS to rescue episodic memory in an aMCI population by modulating connectivity and excitability within an episodic memory network.
