31500906|t|Sedation and paralytic use in open abdomen patients-results from the EAST SLEEP Survey.
31500906|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with an open abdomen after trauma or emergency surgery may benefit from reduced sedation and chemical paralysis. We studied the effect of attending surgeon experience on sedation depth and paralytic use, as well as enteral nutrition and time between laparotomies. METHODS: We performed an institutional review board-approved survey (Sedation Level after Emergent ExLap without Primary Fascial Closure) of the senior and active Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma membership using Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Inc, Provo, UT). We obtained 393/1,655 responses (23.7%). Spearman's rho was used for ordinal data, and multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for trauma center level and presence of trainees in the relationship between surgeon experience and use of deep sedation. RESULTS: Surgeon experience was associated with deep sedation (Richmond Agitation and Sedation Score <=-3, P = .001) and chemical paralysis (P = .001). Surgeon experience was associated with less concern about delirium and more concern for evisceration as the reason for sedation depth (P = .001) and for paralysis (P = .001). Using multivariate logistic regression, surgeon experience was associated with deep sedation (odds ratio 3.6 [95% confidence interval 1.3, 10.4], P = .017 for >=20 years; odds ratio 3.5 [95% confidence interval 1.1, 10.4], P = .025 for 15-20 years). Trauma center level was also significant (odds ratio 7.2 for Richmond Agitation and Sedation Score <=-3 [95% confidence interval 1.7, 31.0], P = .008 for level III/IV versus level I/II). Increased surgeon experience was associated with delay of commencement of enteral feeds until return of bowel function (P = .013). Few respondents indicated willingness to extubate or mobilize open abdomen patients. Experienced surgeons were likely to wait for a defined time rather than for normalization of resuscitation markers to perform the first takeback laparotomy (P = .047) and waited longer between subsequent laparotomies (P = .004). CONCLUSION: There were significant variations in practice among respondents based on the length of time since their last residency or fellowship, including variations that deviate from current best practice for management of patients with an open abdomen.
