30040722|t|White Matter and Cognition in Traumatic Brain Injury.
30040722|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability and produces a wide range of cognitive, emotional, and physical consequences. The impact of TBI on cognition is among the most important questions in this field but remains incompletely understood. The immediate cognitive effects of concussion, while usually short-lived, may be profound and lasting in some individuals, and long-term sequelae of TBI may include dementia of several varieties including post-traumatic leukoencephalopathy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and Alzheimer's disease. Whereas the etiopathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction after TBI remains uncertain, a reasonable point to begin is a focus on the white matter of the brain, where the neuropathological lesion known as diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is routinely identified. White matter is not typically accorded the significance granted to cortical gray matter in discussions of cognitive dysfunction and dementia, but increasing evidence is accumulating to suggest that cognitive decline after TBI is a direct result of white matter injury, and that lesions in this brain component are crucial in the sequence of events leading ultimately to dementia of several types. In this review, we consider the topic of white matter and cognition in TBI, beginning with DAI and proceeding to the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction and dementia that can follow. A brief review of possible therapeutic options will also be offered, including the use of anti-inflammatory agents and the exploitation of white matter plasticity, to treat acute and post-acute injuries, and lower the incidence of dementia resulting from TBI.
