37725102|a|BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases are a common group of neurological disorders characterized by progressive loss of neuronal structure and function leading to cognitive impairment. Recent studies have shown that neuronal pyroptosis mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that, when activated within cells, triggers an inflammatory response, ultimately leading to pyroptotic cell death of neurons. Pyroptosis is a typical pro-inflammatory programmed cell death process occurring downstream of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, characterized by the formation of pores on the cell membrane by the GSDMD protein, leading to cell lysis and the release of inflammatory factors. It has been found that NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuronal pyroptosis is closely associated with the development of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, and Parkinson's disease. Therefore, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and attenuating neuronal pyroptosis could potentially serve as novel strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. RESULTS: The aim of this review is to explore the role of NLRP3 activation-mediated neuronal pyroptosis and neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases. Firstly, we extensively discuss the relationship between NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuronal pyroptosis and neuroinflammation in various neurodegenerative diseases. Subsequently, we further explore the mechanisms driving NLRP3 activation and assembly, as well as the post-translational modifications regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation. CONCLUSION: Understanding these mechanisms will contribute to a deeper understanding of the link between neuronal pyroptosis and neurodegenerative diseases, and hold significant implications for the treatment and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.
