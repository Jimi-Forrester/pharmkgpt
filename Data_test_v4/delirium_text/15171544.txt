METHODS: Seventy-five AD and 68 normal controls were genotyped for NOS III G894T polymorphism. Genotyping was carried out by PCR-RFLP methods. RESULTS: There were two genotypes of NOS III, GG and GT, in either AD patients or normal controls. The frequencies of these two genotypes were 78.7% and 21.3% in AD patients and 82.4% and 17.6% in normal controls, respectively. No association was found between AD and NOS III genotype (P > 0.05). There were two alleles, G and T, in AD patients and normal controls. The frequencies of these two alleles were 89.3% and 10.7% in AD patients and 91.2% and 8.8% in normal controls, respectively, indicating that there was no association between AD and NOS III allels (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There was no association between AD and NOS III G894T polymorphism in Chinese Han population.
