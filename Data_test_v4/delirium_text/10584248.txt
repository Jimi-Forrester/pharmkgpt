10584248|a|INTRODUCTION: The use of neurotrophic factors for the treatment of degenerative disorders of the nervous system opens up promising new perspectives. DEVELOPMENT: Nerve growth factor (NGF) represents the most known and studied trophic factor, which acts on sensory and sympathetic neurons of the peripheral nervous system, and on basal forebrain and striatal cholinergic neurons of the central nervous system. The specificity and trophic actions of NGF on these neuronal populations and its efficacy at preventing neurodegeneration have led to its proposal of evaluation in the treatment of neurological diseases such as: Alzheimer's disease, diabetic neuropathies and Huntington's diseases. Preclinical and clinical studies carried out in animal models and patients with diagnosis of these diseases have revealed satisfactory results. The difficulties of the NGF central chronic infusion, and the NGF detrimental effects arising from the stimulation of other sensitive neuronal population have stimulated active efforts for the development of more efficacious delivery strategies. Besides, it has also promoted further studies on the relation between the neuropathological stage, the dose and the effects of NGF administration. CONCLUSION: The NGF is a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
