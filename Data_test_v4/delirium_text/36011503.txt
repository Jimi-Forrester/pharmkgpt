36011503|t|Impacts of Landscape Type, Viewing Distance, and Permeability on Anxiety, Depression, and Stress.
36011503|a|Contact with nature is beneficial for mental health, including anxiety and stress. Exposure to virtual nature also has similar restorative traits with real nature. However, previous studies on the restorative environment mostly focus on ordinary people while caring less about patients with depressive disorders. Thus, the restorative impacts of virtual nature on patients with depression warrant examination. This research aims to study the restorative effects of virtual reality (VR) landscape type, viewing distance, and permeability on anxiety, depression, and stress in patients with depression. Study A revealed that the perceived restorative level of landscape type varies greatly: grassland > forest > water > undergrowth > urban square. Additionally, natural environments with higher openness, more green elements, more blue sky, and more sunshine exposure had higher restorative levels on perceived depression, anxiety, and stress relief. Study B found that the grassland landscape with a higher viewing distance and a medium vegetation edge permeability provides more restorative impacts for patients with depression.
