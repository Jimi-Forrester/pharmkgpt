9250173|t|Presenilin-1 is associated with Alzheimer's disease amyloid.
9250173|a|Mutations in presenilin (PS)-1 and -2, located on chromosome 14 and 1 respectively, are the major association with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). FAD has also been linked to mutations in the amyloid beta precursor protein (beta PP), and the presence of the apolipoprotein E4 allele is a risk factor for late-onset AD. The role of PS in FAD and in sporadic AD is unclear. We previously reported the presence of a PS-1 carboxyl-terminal epitope in neuritic plaques (Wisniewski T, Palha JA, Ghiso J, Frangione B: S182 protein in Alzheimer's disease neuritic plaques. Lancet 1995, 346:1366). In the present study, we examined a number of biochemically different cerebral and systemic amyloidoses, finding the PS-1 carboxy epitope only in association with amyloid beta (A beta) lesions. We confirm the presence of this epitope ultrastructurally in neuritic plaques. In addition, biochemical and amino acid sequence data are presented for an association of the 18-kd carboxy fragment of PS-1 with neuritic plaques with a start at residue 300. Three of the proteins with linkage to AD have now been found as components of neuritic plaques. It remains to be determined whether all of these proteins are involved in the same or different pathological pathway(s) and which of these proteins is the most important for the common, late-onset form of AD.
