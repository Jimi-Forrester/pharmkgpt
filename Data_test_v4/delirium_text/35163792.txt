35163792|t|DMSO and TMAO-Differences in Interactions in Aqueous Solutions of the K-Peptide.
35163792|a|Interactions between a solvent and their co-solute molecules in solutions of peptides are crucial for their stability and structure. The K-peptide is a synthetic fragment of a larger hen egg white lysozyme protein that is believed to be able to aggregate into amyloid structures. In this study, a complex experimental and theoretical approach is applied to study systems comprising the peptide, water, and two co-solutes: trimethylamide N-oxide (TMAO) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Information about their interactions in solutions and on the stability of the K-peptide was obtained by FTIR spectroscopy and differential scanning microcalorimetry. The IR spectra of various osmolyte-water-model-peptide complexes were simulated with the DFT method (B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)). The FTIR results indicate that both solutes are neutral for the K-peptide in solution. Both co-solutes affect the peptide to different degrees, as seen in the shape of its amide I band, and have different influences on its thermal stability. DFT calculations helped simplify the experimental data for easier interpretation.
