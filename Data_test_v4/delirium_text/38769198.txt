38769198|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are part of the central nervous system (CNS) disorders that indicate their presence with neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, and increased oxidative stress. Several pathophysiological factors and biomarkers are involved in this inflammatory process causing these neurological disorders. The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) is an inflammation element, which induced transcription and appears to be one of the important players in physiological procedures, especially nervous disorders. NF-kappaB can impact upon series of intracellular actions and induce or inhibit many inflammation-related pathways. Multiple reports have focused on the modification of NF-kappaB activity, controlling its expression, translocation, and signaling pathway in neurodegenerative disorders and injuries like Alzheimer's disease (AD), spinal cord injuries (SCI), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Curcumin has been noted to be a popular anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory substance and is the foremost natural compound produced by turmeric. According to various studies, when playing an anti-inflammatory role, it interacts with several modulating proteins of long-standing disease signaling pathways and has an unprovocative consequence on pro-inflammatory cytokines. This review article determined to figure out curcumin's role in limiting the promotion of neurodegenerative disease via influencing the NF-kappaB signaling route. Preclinical studies were gathered from plenty of scientific platforms including PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Google Scholar to evaluate this hypothesis. Extracted findings from the literature review explained the repressing impact of Curcumin on the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and, occasionally down-regulating the cytokine expression. Yet, there is an essential need for further analysis and specific clinical experiments to fully understand this subject.
