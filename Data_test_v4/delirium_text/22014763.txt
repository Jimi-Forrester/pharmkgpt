22014763|a|AIMS: To observe the incidence of delirium in elderly hip fracture patients and search for the potential risk factors. METHODS: Patients over 60 years were included in this study. Gender, age, education level, fracture type, organic dysfunction, cognitive dysfunction, comorbidity, medication, time from admission to surgery, and pain intensity were collected and analyzed, together with laboratory assessments and surgery including surgery type, time in surgery and blood loss in surgery. RESULTS: 16 in 123 patients developed delirium. The incidence rate of delirium was 13% in the period of 6 days after surgery. Pain intensity and cognitive dysfunction were the risk factors. CONCLUSION: Pain intensity and cognitive impairment after hip fracture were found as the risk factors for development of delirium in elder Chinese patients. Prevention and management of delirium needs pain management pre- and post-operatively.
