36358901|t|New Multifunctional Agents for Potential Alzheimer's Disease Treatment Based on Tacrine Conjugates with 2-Arylhydrazinylidene-1,3-Diketones.
36358901|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered a modern epidemic because of its increasing prevalence worldwide and serious medico-social consequences, including the economic burden of treatment and patient care. The development of new effective therapeutic agents for AD is one of the most urgent and challenging tasks. To address this need, we used an aminoalkylene linker to combine the well-known anticholinesterase drug tacrine with antioxidant 2-tolylhydrazinylidene-1,3-diketones to create 3 groups of hybrid compounds as new multifunctional agents with the potential for AD treatment. Lead compounds of the new conjugates effectively inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE, IC50 0.24-0.34 microM) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE, IC50 0.036-0.0745 microM), with weak inhibition of off-target carboxylesterase. Anti-AChE activity increased with elongation of the alkylene spacer, in agreement with molecular docking, which showed compounds binding to both the catalytic active site and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE, consistent with mixed type reversible inhibition. PAS binding along with effective propidium displacement suggest the potential of the hybrids to block AChE-induced beta-amyloid aggregation, a disease-modifying effect. All of the conjugates demonstrated metal chelating ability for Cu2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+, as well as high antiradical activity in the ABTS test. Non-fluorinated hybrid compounds 6 and 7 also showed Fe3+ reducing activity in the FRAP test. Predicted ADMET and physicochemical properties of conjugates indicated good CNS bioavailability and safety parameters acceptable for potential lead compounds at the early stages of anti-AD drug development.
