30596058|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of memantine in the acute treatment of geriatric with bipolar disorder (BD) hospitalized for mania. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study conducted on 70 patients older than 60 years with BD in the acute phase of mania. Oral sodium valproate was prescribed in both groups. The intervention group received memantine tablet and the placebo group received a placebo tablet based on a same procedure. Severity of mania, cognitive changes, and quality of life (QoL) were assessed and recorded 4 and 8 weeks after the beginning of the study. The collected data were analyzed with SPSS (version 20) using independent samples t-test, analysis of variance in repeated observations, Chi-squared test, and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Mania severity score had no significant difference at the beginning of the study, but 4 and 8 weeks after the intervention, it was reduced significantly in both groups (P < 0.001) that was higher in memantine group (P = 0.038). The mean increase in score of cognitive variations was 6.74 in the memantine group and 3.62 in the placebo group with a nonsignificant difference (P = 0.125). The scores of each dimension of QoL in the two groups showed that in all four dimensions, the patient's physical, psychological, social, and environmental status increased significantly by time (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this study, memantine as an adjuvant to administration of sodium valproate may have a significant effect on decreasing the intensity of mania in the long run.
