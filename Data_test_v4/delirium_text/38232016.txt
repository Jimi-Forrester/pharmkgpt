38232016|a|Tissue accidents provide numerous pathways for pathogens to invade and flourish, causing additional harm to the host tissue while impeding its natural healing and regeneration. Essential oils (EOs) exhibit rapid and effective antimicrobial properties without promoting bacterial resistance. Clove oils (CEO) demonstrate robust antimicrobial activity against different pathogens. Chitosan (CS) is a natural, partially deacetylated polyamine widely recognized for its vast antimicrobial capacity. In this study, we present the synthesis of four membrane formulations utilizing CS, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and glycerol (Gly) incorporated with CEO and nanobioglass (n-BGs) for applications in subdermal tissue regeneration. Our analysis of the membranes' thermal stability and chemical composition provided strong evidence for successfully blending polymers with the entrapment of the essential oil. The incorporation of the CEO in the composite was evidenced by the increase in the intensity of the band of C-O-C in the FTIR; furthermore, the increase in diffraction peaks, as well as the broadening, provide evidence that the introduction of CEO perturbed the crystal structure. The morphological examination conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the incorporation of CEO resulted in smooth surfaces, in contrast to the porous morphologies observed with the n-BGs. A histological examination of the implanted membranes demonstrated their biocompatibility and biodegradability, particularly after a 60-day implantation period. The degradation process of more extensive membranes involved connective tissue composed of type III collagen fibers, blood vessels, and inflammatory cells, which supported the reabsorption of the composite membranes, evidencing the material's biocompatibility.
