37052336|t|Enteric Glia and Brain Astroglia: Complex Communication in Health and Disease along the Gut-Brain Axis.
37052336|a|Several studies have provided interesting evidence about the role of the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain in the onset and development of several pathologic conditions, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), neurodegenerative diseases, and related comorbidities. Indeed, patients with IBD can experience neurologic disorders, including depression and cognitive impairment, besides typical intestinal symptoms. In parallel, patients with neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease, are often characterized by the occurrence of functional gastrointestinal disorders. In this context, enteric glial cells and brain astrocytes are emerging as pivotal players in the initiation/maintenance of neuroinflammatory responses, which appear to contribute to the alterations of intestinal and neurologic functions observed in patients with IBD and neurodegenerative disorders. The present review was conceived to provide a comprehensive and critical overview of the available knowledge on the morphologic, molecular, and functional changes occurring in the enteric glia and brain astroglia in IBDs and neurologic disorders. In addition, our intent is to identify whether such alterations could represent a common denominator involved in the onset of comorbidities associated with the aforementioned disorders. This might help to identify putative targets useful to develop novel pharmacologic approaches for the therapeutic management of such disturbances.
