25599006|t|DASH and Mediterranean-type Dietary Patterns to Maintain Cognitive Health.
25599006|a|There is growing consensus that as the US population ages, nearly a third will experience stroke, dementia or even both. Thus, interest in the role that diet may play in preserving cognitive abilities continues to grow especially in absence of truly effective treatments for dementia, of which Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form. The purpose of this review is to examine whether two a priori dietary patterns influence the rate of cognitive decline or the onset of dementia. Evidence from neuropathology reports of those who have died with AD or with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or without cognitive impairment suggests that often the pathological hallmarks of AD---amyloid deposition and presence of tangles are present along with vascular lesions. Hypertension and stroke are strongly associated with incident dementia. Thus, it is possible that lifestyle approaches designed to prevent or reduce cardiovascular risk factors, conditions or diseases may also provide added benefits for brain health.
