33391429|a|Immunotherapies, such as monoclonal antibody therapy and checkpoint inhibitor therapy, have shown inspiring clinical effects for the treatment of cancer. Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells therapy was an efficacious therapeutic approach treating hematological malignancies and encouraging results have been achieved. Three kinds of CAR-T cell therapies, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel), Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), were approved for clinical application in 2017 and Tecartus (brexucabtagene autoleucel) was approved in 2020. Despite some progress have been made in treating multiple hematologic tumors, threats still remain for the application of CAR-T cell therapy considering its toxicities and gaps in knowledge. To further comprehend present research status and trends, the review concentrates on CAR-T technologies, applications, adverse effects and safety measures about CAR-T cell therapy in hematological neoplasms. We believe that CAR-T cell therapy will exhibit superior safety and efficacy in the future and have potential to be a mainstream therapeutic choice for the elimination of hematologic tumor.
