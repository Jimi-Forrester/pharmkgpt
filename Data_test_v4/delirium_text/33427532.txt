33427532|a|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that is highly expressed in the brain. It influences neuronal survival, growth and acts as a control centre for neurotransmitters. It also plays a crucial role in learning and memory. Current evidence indicates that BDNF may be a possible neurotrophic factor that controls cognitive functions under normal and neuropathological conditions. Recent findings indicate a reduction in cognitive performance in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This relationship between cognitive performance and AD is important for investigating both the time they overlap and the pathophysiological mechanism in each case. Therefore, this study reviewed the existing knowledge about BDNF and cognitive performance in the AD population. The findings support the idea that this tropic factor may be a potential biomarker for evaluating the changes in cognitive performance in AD.
