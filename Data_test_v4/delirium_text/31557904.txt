31557904|t|Highly Sensitive Micropatterned Interdigitated Electrodes for Enhancing the Concentration Effect Based on Dielectrophoresis.
31557904|a|The concentration effect of dielectrophoresis (DEP) enables detection of biomolecules with high sensitivity. In this study, microstructures were patterned between the interdigitated microelectrodes (IMEs) to increase the concentration effect of DEP. The microstructures increased the electric field gradient (     E 2   ) between the IMEs to approximately 6.61-fold higher than in the bare IMEs with a gap of 10 mum, resulting in a decreased optimal voltage to concentrate amyloid beta 42 (Abeta42, from 0.8 Vpp to 0.5 Vpp) and tau-441 (from 0.9 Vpp to 0.6 Vpp) between the IMEs. Due to the concentration effect of DEP, the impedance change in the optimal condition was higher than the values in the reference condition at 2.64-fold in Abeta42 detection and at 1.59-fold in tau-441 detection. This concentration effect of DEP was also verified by counting the number of gold (Au) particles which conjugated with the secondary antibody. Finally, an enhanced concentration effect in the patterned IMEs was verified by measuring the impedance change depending on the concentration of Abeta42 and tau-441. Our results suggest that microstructures increase the concentration effect of DEP, leading to enhanced sensitivity of the IMEs.
