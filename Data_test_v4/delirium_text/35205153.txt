35205153|t|Angiogenin Levels and Their Association with Cardiometabolic Indices Following Vitamin D Status Correction in Saudi Adults.
35205153|a|Angiogenin (ANG), a multifunctional protein known to induce blood vessel formation, is a potential biomarker for cardiovascular diseases; however, whether it is affected by vitamin D supplementation is not known. This interventional study in vitamin D-deficient Saudi adults was designed to investigate it. A total of 100 vitamin D-deficient Saudi adults aged 30-50 years were randomly selected to undergo 6-month vitamin D supplementation. Circulating levels of fasting glucose, lipids, vitamin D, apolipoproteins (AI, AII, B, CI, CII, CIII, E, and H), and ANG were measured using commercially available assays at baseline and after six months. Overall, vitamin D levels increased significantly post intervention. With this, levels of apo-CIII and apo-E significantly increased (p-values of 0.001 and 0.009, respectively) with a significant parallel decrease in apo-B (p = 0.003). ANG levels were significantly positively associated with most apolipoproteins and inversely correlated with HDL-cholesterol. Post intervention, the changes in ANG levels were positively correlated with apo-E (r = 0.32; p < 0.01 in all subjects and r = 0.40; p < 0.05 in males). Vitamin D supplementation may modestly affect ANG levels. The association observed between ANG and apo-E is worthy of further investigation since both biomarkers have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders.
