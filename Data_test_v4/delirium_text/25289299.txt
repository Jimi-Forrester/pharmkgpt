25289299|a|SUMMARY: Symmetry is a topic of utmost importance when interviewing a patient who comes asking for cosmetic surgery. We must warn that asymmetry is "the normal." There is no perfect symmetry in the human body, and this overstated search can be sign of psychological and psychiatric disorders. Sometimes multiple procedures are needed to improve a breast's symmetry and appearance. To give an extra intraoperative view, the authors have developed a new instrument to be used during the mammoplasty (reduction or augmentation) surgery.
