37375041|t|Exopolysaccharides Producing Bacteria: A Review.
37375041|a|Bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) are essential natural biopolymers used in different areas including biomedicine, food, cosmetic, petroleum, and pharmaceuticals and also in environmental remediation. The interest in them is primarily due to their unique structure and properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, higher purity, hydrophilic nature, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer, antibacterial, and immune-modulating and prebiotic activities. The present review summarizes the current research progress on bacterial EPSs including their properties, biological functions, and promising applications in the various fields of science, industry, medicine, and technology, as well as characteristics and the isolation sources of EPSs-producing bacterial strains. This review provides an overview of the latest advances in the study of such important industrial exopolysaccharides as xanthan, bacterial cellulose, and levan. Finally, current study limitations and future directions are discussed.
