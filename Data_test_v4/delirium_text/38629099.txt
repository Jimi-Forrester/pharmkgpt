38629099|a|Objectives: The effects of Crocus sativus, safranal, and pioglitazone on aerosolized paraquat (PQ)-induced systemic changes were examined. Materials and Methods: Control (Ctrl) and PQ groups of rats were exposed to saline or PQ (27 and 54 mg/m3, PQ-L and PQ-H) aerosols eight times on alternate days. Nine PQ-H groups were treated with dexamethasone (0.03 mg/kg/day, Dexa), two doses of C. sativus extract (20 and 80 mg/kg/day, CS-L and CS-H), safranal (0.8 and 3.2 mg/kg/day, Saf-L and Saf-H), pioglitazone (5 and 10 mg/kg/day, Pio-L and Pio-H), and the combination of low dose of the pioglitazone and extract or safranal (Pio + CS and Pio + Saf) after the end of PQ exposure. Results: Interferon-gamma (INF-gamma), interleukin 10 (IL-10), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and thiol serum levels were reduced, but tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), malondialdehyde (MDA), and total and differential WBC were increased in both PQ groups (P<0.05 to P<0.001). All measured variables were improved in all treated groups (P<0.05 to P<0.001). The effects of high dose of C. sativus and safranal on measured parameters were higher than dexamethasone (P<0.05 to P<0.001). The effects of Pio + CS and Pio + Saf treatment on most variables were significantly higher than three agents alone (P<0.05 to P<0.001). Conclusion: C. sativus and safranal improved inhaled PQ-induced systemic inflammation and oxidative stress similar to those of dexamethasone and showed synergic effects with pioglitazone suggesting the possible PPARgamma receptor-mediated effects of the plant and its constituent.
