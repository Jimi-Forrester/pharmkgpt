35002135|t|Knowledge, Awareness, and Attitude Towards Dementia Amongst Medical Undergraduate Students: Can a Sensitization Program Help?
35002135|a|BACKGROUND: Current undergraduate medical academic curriculum does not emphasize on evaluation and management of dementia. The knowledge and attitude of medical students towards patients with dementia in India has not been ascertained previously. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude of final year medical students about dementia and Alzheimer's disease. We also aimed to assess if a dedicated sensitization cum teaching session by a group of interns doctors guided by a neurologist could help improve students' knowledge and awareness towards dementia or not. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 82 consenting final year medical students answered questionnaires of Alzheimer Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS) and Dementia Attitude Scale (DAS) at a baseline level. A sensitization cum teaching session by intern doctors was conducted to enhance students' knowledge about dementia. A post sensitization reassessment of students was done to assess impact of the session. RESULTS: The ADKS score was 57% at baseline which was increased to 71% post sensitization program. The mean DAS score was 3.2 at baseline which was reported to be 3.4 after sensitization program. Students reported significant improvement in their knowledge level but did not show the same improvement in their attitude and comfort level in caring for dementia after the sensitization program. Students were still not comfortable dealing with patients with dementia. CONCLUSION: Medical students lack significant knowledge and training about dementia. Patient contact and practical training for basic assessment and care of dementia needs to be incorporated in the current academic curriculum. Dedicated sensitization sessions on dementia care can help improve the gap. Practical exposure to management of patients with dementia would be required to enhance the comfort level and attitude of students towards dementia.
