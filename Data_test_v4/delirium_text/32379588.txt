32379588|a|Peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) are accompanied with neuropathic pain and functional disability. Despite improvements in surgical repair techniques in recent years, the functional recovery is yet unsatisfied. Indeed a successful nerve repair depends not only on the surgical strategy but also on the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in traumatic nerve injury. In contrast to all strategies suggested for nerve repair, pharmacotherapy is a cheap, accessible and non-invasive treatment that can be used immediately after nerve injury. This study aimed to review the effects of some pharmacological agents on the nerve regeneration after traumatic PNI evaluated by functional, histological and electrophysiological assessments. In addition, some cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for their therapeutic actions, restricted to neural tissue, are suggested. These findings can not only help to find better strategies for peripheral nerve repair, but also to identify the neuropathic effects of various medications and their mechanisms of action.
