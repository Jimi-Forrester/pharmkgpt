25233613|t|CSF in Alzheimer's disease.
25233613|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain amyloidosis that injures brain regions involved in memory consolidation and other cognitive functions. Neuropathologically, the disease is characterized by accumulation of a 42-amino acid protein called amyloid beta, and N-terminally truncated fragments thereof, in extracellular senile plaques together with intraneuronal inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal and axonal degeneration and loss. Clinical chemistry tests for these pathologies have been developed for use on cerebrospinal fluid samples. Here, we review what these markers have taught us on the disease process in AD and how they can be implemented in routine clinical chemistry. We also provide an update on new marker development and ongoing analytical standardization effort.
