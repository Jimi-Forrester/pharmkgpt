26829940|t|LPS alters pattern of sickness behavior but does not affect glutathione level in aged male rats.
26829940|a|Behavioral symptoms of sickness, such as fever and motor activity are a coordinated set of changes that develop during infection. The aim of study was to compare the sickness behaviour (SB) in healthy old and young rats treated with pyrogenic dose of endotoxin and to check their glutathione level. Before experimentation male Wistar rats were selected according to standard body mass, motor activity, and white blood cells count. Intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli was used to provoke SB. The level of liver glutathione, interleukin (IL) -6, deep body temperature (Tb) and motor activity were measured. Glutathione level in old and young rats did not differ significantly. In both young and old rats LPS administration provoked fever (the mean value of Tb was 38.06 +- 0.01  C in old rats, and 38.19 +- 0.06  C in young rats). LPS injection affected night-time activity in both groups (12 h averages were 1.56 +- 0.40 counts in old LPS-treated rats vs 2.74 +- 0.53 counts in not-treated old rats and 3.44 +- 0.60 counts for young LPS-treated vs 4.28 +- 0.57 counts for young not-treated rats). The injection of LPS provoked an elevation of plasma IL-6 concentration (from values below the lowest detectable standard in not-treated groups of animals to 6322.82 +- 537.00 pg/mL in old LPS-treated rats and 7415.62 +- 451.88 pg/mL in young LPS-treated rats). Based on these data, we conclude that good health of aged rats prevents decrease in the glutathione level. Old rats are still able to develop SB in response to pyrogenic dose of LPS, although its components have changed pattern compared to young animals.
