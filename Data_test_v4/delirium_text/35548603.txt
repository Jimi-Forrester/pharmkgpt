35548603|a|Chicken gallbladder has long been considered to be worthless and discarded as waste. The main composition of chicken bile is taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), which is the isomeride of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). TUDCA has been effectively used for treatment of many diseases. In this paper, 7alpha- and 7beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH) were co-immobilised on modified chitosan microspheres, and used as recyclable biocatalyst for the catalysis of chicken bile. The catalytic reaction reached equilibrium within 4 h compared with 1 h using TCDCA as substrate. After four continuous batch reactions, the conversion of TCDCA was lower than 40% and TUDCA yield was about 15% for the catalysis of chicken bile. TUDCA yield was approximately 62% after equilibrium and the content of TUDCA in reaction product was as high as 33.16%. Furthermore, the experiments showed that activity of enzymes were significantly inhibited by bilirubin, Cu2+ and Ca2+ in complex substrate. The research described not only widens the utilization of chicken bile, but also provides a clean way for the preparation of TUDCA.
