35898725|a|Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) compounds have recently garnered attention for the regulation of immune cell infiltration and the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Liuwei Dihuang Pill (LDP) has potential in this regard; however, its specific molecular mechanism currently remains unclear. Therefore, we adopted a bioinformatics approach to investigate the infiltration patterns of different types of immune cells in AD and explored the molecular mechanism of LDP intervention, with the aim of providing a new basis for improving the clinical immunotherapy of AD patients. We found that M1 macrophages showed significantly different degrees of infiltration between the hippocampal tissue samples of AD patients and healthy individuals. Four immune intersection targets of LDP in the treatment of AD were identified; they were enriched in 206 biological functions and 30 signaling pathways. Quercetin had the best docking effect with the core immune target PRKCB. Our findings suggest that infiltrated immune cells may influence the course of AD and that LDP can regulate immune cell infiltration through multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway approaches, providing a new research direction regarding AD immunotherapy.
