37876925|a|Background: EBV infection has long been postulated to trigger multiple sclerosis (MS) and anti-EBV antibodies showed a consistent presence in MS patients. Previous reports from our group have shown that the EBV infects different brain cells. Entry of the virus in neuronal cells is assisted by several host factors including membrane cholesterol. By using an inhibitor, methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD), we evaluated the role of membrane cholesterol in EBV infection and pathogenesis. Methodology: The membrane cholesterol depleted cells were infected with EBV and its latent genes expression were assessed. Further, EBV-mediated downstream signalling molecules namely STAT3, RIP, NF-kB and TNF-alpha levels was checked at protein level along with spatial (periphery and nucleus) and temporal changes in biomolecular fingerprints with Raman microspectroscopy (RS). Results: Upon treatment with MbetaCD, lmp1 and lmp2a suggested significant downregulation compared to EBV infection. Downstream molecules like STAT3 and RIP, exhibited a decrease in protein levels temporally upon exposure to MbetaCD while NF-kB levels were found to be increased. Further, the intensity of the Raman spectra exhibited an increase in triglycerides and fatty acids in the cytoplasm of EBV-infected LN-229 cells compared to MbetaCD+EBV. Likewise, the Raman peak width of cholesterol, lipid and fatty acids were found to be reduced in EBV-infected samples indicates elevation in the cholesterol specific moieties. In contrast, an opposite pattern was observed in the nucleus. Moreover, the ingenuity pathway analysis revealed protein molecules such as VLDLR, MBP and APP that are associated with altered profile of cholesterol, fatty acids and triglycerides with infection-related CNS disorders. Conclusion: Taken together, our results underline the important role of membrane cholesterol over EBV entry/pathogenesis in astroglia cells which further trigger/exacerbate virus-associated neuropathologies. These results likely to aid into the prognosis of neurological disease like MS.
