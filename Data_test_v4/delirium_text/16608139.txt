16608139|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many elderly people with Alzheimer's disease experience weight loss. Illness and inadequate regain after a period of illness are considered as contributory causes of progressive weight loss in psychogeriatric patients. We studied whether early use of a liquid nutrition supplement immediately after onset of acute illness from infection can prevent weight loss in elderly psychogeriatric nursing home residents. METHODS: Randomised controlled trial of 5 weeks after the onset of illness. Thirty-four psychogeriatric nursing home residents (aged > or =65 yrs) completed the study period. A liquid nutrition supplement (200 ml) once daily immediately after diagnosis of infection or standard treatment (enriched food after referral to a dietician) were provided. Body weight, mid-upper arm circumference, calf circumference, triceps skin fold thickness, dietary energy intake, and need for care were measured. RESULTS: Weight change during the study period was significantly different between the standard (-0.4 kg) and supplement (+0.8 kg) groups (p = 0.040). No significant differences were observed in changes of mid-upper arm circumference, triceps skin fold thickness, calf circumference or energy intake between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Early provision of a liquid nutrition supplement immediately after onset of acute illness from infection leads to weight gain in elderly psychogeriatric nursing home residents.
