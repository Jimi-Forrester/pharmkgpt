24970188|t|Biophysical Characterization of alpha-Synuclein and Rotenone Interaction.
24970188|a|Previous studies revealed that pesticides interact with alpha-synuclein and accelerate the rate of fibrillation. These results are consistent with the prevailing hypothesis that the direct interaction of alpha-synuclein with pesticides is one of many suspected factors leading to alpha-synuclein fibrillation and ultimately to Parkinson's disease. In this study, the biophysical properties and fibrillation kinetics of alpha-synuclein in the presence of rotenone were investigated and, more specifically, the effects of rotenone on the early-stage misfolded forms of alpha-synuclein were considered. The thioflavine T (ThT) fluorescence assay studies provide evidence that early-phase misfolded alpha-synuclein forms are affected by rotenone and that the fibrillation process is accelerated. Further characterization by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) shows that rotenone increases the amount of ordered secondary structure in this intrinsically disordered protein. Morphological characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) provide visualization of the differences in the aggregated alpha-synuclein species developing during the early kinetics of the fibrillation process in the absence and presence of rotenone. We believe that these data provide useful information for a better understanding of the molecular basis of rotenone-induced misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein.
