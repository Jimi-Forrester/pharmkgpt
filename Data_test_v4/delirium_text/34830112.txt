34830112|t|Angptl2 is a Marker of Cellular Senescence: The Physiological and Pathophysiological Impact of Angptl2-Related Senescence.
34830112|a|Cellular senescence is a cell fate primarily induced by DNA damage, characterized by irreversible growth arrest in an attempt to stop the damage. Senescence is a cellular response to a stressor and is observed with aging, but also during wound healing and in embryogenic developmental processes. Senescent cells are metabolically active and secrete a multitude of molecules gathered in the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP includes inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and metalloproteinases, with autocrine and paracrine activities. Among hundreds of molecules, angiopoietin-like 2 (angptl2) is an interesting, although understudied, SASP member identified in various types of senescent cells. Angptl2 is a circulatory protein, and plasma angptl2 levels increase with age and with various chronic inflammatory diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetes, heart failure and a multitude of age-related diseases. In this review, we will examine in which context angptl2 was identified as a SASP factor, describe the experimental evidence showing that angptl2 is a marker of senescence in vitro and in vivo, and discuss the impact of angptl2-related senescence in both physiological and pathological conditions. Future work is needed to demonstrate whether the senescence marker angptl2 is a potential clinical biomarker of age-related diseases.
