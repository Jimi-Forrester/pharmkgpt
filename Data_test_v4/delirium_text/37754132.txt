37754132|t|Recent Progresses in Optical Biosensors for Interleukin 6 Detection.
37754132|a|Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is pleiotropic cytokine with pathological pro-inflammatory effects in various acute, chronic and infectious diseases. It is involved in a variety of biological processes including immune regulation, hematopoiesis, tissue repair, inflammation, oncogenesis, metabolic control, and sleep. Due to its important role as a biomarker of many types of diseases, its detection in small amounts and with high selectivity is of particular importance in medical and biological fields. Laboratory methods including enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs) and chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs) are the most common conventional methods for IL-6 detection. However, these techniques suffer from the complexity of the method, the expensiveness, and the time-consuming process of obtaining the results. In recent years, too many attempts have been conducted to provide simple, rapid, economical, and user-friendly analytical approaches to monitor IL-6. In this regard, biosensors are considered desirable tools for IL-6 detection because of their special features such as high sensitivity, rapid detection time, ease of use, and ease of miniaturization. In this review, current progresses in different types of optical biosensors as the most favorable types of biosensors for the detection of IL-6 are discussed, evaluated, and compared.
