31333367|a|INTRODUCTION: Sufentanil sublingual tablet system (SSTS) (Zalviso ) is a sublingual system for patient controlled analgesia, demonstrated to be an effective strategy for pain control after major abdominal and orthopedic surgery. We present a prospective observational study on the use of SSTS for the management of postoperative pain after thoracic surgery. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of Zalviso  in reducing pain scores and increasing respiratory ability during postoperative period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: There were about 40 patients underwent video assisted thoracoscopy were included in the study. All the enrolled patients signed the informed consent were educated to the use of the device. Pain numeric rating scale values (NRS) were recorded at awakening from anesthesia (T0) and during the next hours, both at rest and with cough. We evaluate the time to obtain a mean NRS value <=3 and difference in pain scores between first and subsequent measurements as the primary outcomes. The ability to use incentive spirometer and eventual drug adverse effect were evaluated as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: All patients in recovery room experienced moderate to severe pain. Pain score at rest and coughing decreased to a mean NRS value <=3 (mild pain) respectively after 2 and 6 hours and the pain score difference continued to increase significantly after repeated measurements. 67.5% of patients resumed the original spirometric ability in pod 1; 9.5% in pod 2; 12% in pod 3. Only three patients out of forty (7,5%) experienced nausea; one patient (2,5%) had a vomiting episode. CONCLUSION: Our study showed SSTS as an effective option for postoperative pain management in thoracic surgery, improving pain scores and respiratory ability.
