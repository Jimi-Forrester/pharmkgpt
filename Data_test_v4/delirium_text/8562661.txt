8562661|t|Psychiatric status after human fetal mesencephalic tissue transplantation in Parkinson's disease.
8562661|a|This report describes the prospective and systematic psychiatric assessment of nine patients who received transplantation of human fetal mesencephalic tissue into the caudate nucleus for treatment of Parkinson's disease. Unlike adrenal medullary transplantation, which often causes psychosis or delirium, this procedure appeared to have few perioperative sequelae. On longer-term follow-up, there was some statistical evidence of deterioration in psychiatric status, as manifested primarily in depressive and nonspecific emotional and behavioral symptoms. This group effect was partly attributable to the occurrence of discrete episodes of illness (major depression and panic disorder with agoraphobia) in some patients, but it was unclear whether such episodes occurred more often than would ordinarily be expected in Parkinson's disease. Differences in the neurobiological effects of fetal mesencephalic and adrenal medullary grafts may account for differences in the psychiatric sequelae of patients receiving these procedures.
