34547994|t|Different Sides of Depression in the Elderly: An In-depth View on the Role of Abeta Peptides.
34547994|a|BACKGROUND: Late-onset depression (LOD) is the most common neuropsychiatric disorder associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), often associated with structural and functional brain changes, neuropsychological impairments and negative family history for affective disorders. LOD could be a risk factor or a prodromal phase of AD; this has led to the investigation of the link between depression and amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides by measuring Abeta levels in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brains of elderly depressed subjects. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to clarify the complex relationship between depression, Abeta peptides and AD. METHODS: We evaluated all articles published up to 2019 in PubMed in which Abeta was measured in serum (or plasma), CSF or brain in elderly with Major Depressive Disorder or depressive symptoms evaluated with standard scales. RESULTS: Low plasma Abeta42 levels are strongly associated with depression severity. Plasma Abeta40 levels are higher in younger depressed, drug-resistant and those with more severe symptoms. CSF Abeta42 levels are lower in depressed than controls. PET-detected global and region-specific increases in Abeta deposition are sometimes associated with LOD, cognitive impairment, anxiety but not with Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)/CVD risk factors. Elderly depressed with CVDs/CVD risk factors have more frequently high plasma Abeta40 levels and drug-resistance; those without Conclusion: Two specific Abeta profiles emerge in the depressed elderly. One is associated with Abeta42 reductions in plasma and CSF, possibly reflecting increased brain amyloid deposition and prodromal AD. The other one is characterized by high plasma Abeta40 levels, cerebrovascular disease and is clinically associated with increased AD risk.
