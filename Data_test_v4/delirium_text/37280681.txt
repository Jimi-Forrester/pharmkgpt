37280681|a|Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, such as graphene, black phosphorus and transition metal dichalcogenides, have attracted increasing attention in biology and biomedicine. Their high mechanical stiffness, excellent electrical conductivity, optical transparency, and biocompatibility have led to rapid advances. Neuroscience is a complex field with many challenges, such as nervous system is difficult to repair and regenerate, as well as the early diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases are also challenged. This review mainly focuses on the application of 2D nanomaterials in neuroscience. Firstly, we introduced various types of 2D nanomaterials. Secondly, due to the repairment and regeneration of nerve is an important problem in the field of neuroscience, we summarized the studies of 2D nanomaterials applied in neural repairment and regeneration based on their unique physicochemical properties and excellent biocompatibility. We also discussed the potential of 2D nanomaterial-based synaptic devices to mimic connections among neurons in the human brain due to their low-power switching capabilities and high mobility of charge carriers. In addition, we also reviewed the potential clinical application of various 2D nanomaterials in diagnosing and treating neurodegenerative diseases, neurological system disorders, as well as glioma. Finally, we discussed the challenge and future directions of 2D nanomaterials in neuroscience.
