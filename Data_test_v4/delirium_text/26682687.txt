26682687|t|Multifunctional Effect of Human Serum Albumin Reduces Alzheimer's Disease Related Pathologies in the 3xTg Mouse Model.
26682687|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the prevalent dementia in the elderly, involves many related and interdependent pathologies that manifests simultaneously, eventually leading to cognitive impairment and death. No treatment is currently available; however, an agent addressing several key pathologies simultaneously has a better therapeutic potential. Human serum albumin (HSA) is a highly versatile protein, harboring multifunctional properties that are relevant to key pathologies underlying AD. This study provides insight into the mechanism for HSA's therapeutic effect. In vivo, a myriad of beneficial effects were observed by pumps infusing HSA intracerebroventricularly, for the first time in an AD 3xTg mice model. A significant effect on amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology was observed. Abeta1-42, soluble oligomers, and total plaque area were reduced. Neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cell line confirmed that the reduction in Abeta1-42 toxicity was due to direct binding rather than other properties of HSA. Total and hyperphosphorylated tau were reduced along with an increase in tubulin, suggesting increased microtubule stability. HSA treatment also reduced brain inflammation, affecting both astrocytes and microglia markers. Finally, evidence for blood-brain barrier and myelin integrity repair was observed. These multidimensional beneficial effects of intracranial administrated HSA, together or individually, contributed to an improvement in cognitive tests, suggesting a non-immune or Abeta efflux dependent means for treating AD.
