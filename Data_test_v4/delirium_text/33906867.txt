33906867|t|New-onset psychosis due to COVID-19.
33906867|a|This is a case report of a middle-aged man with no psychiatric history who presented with severe anxiety and psychotic symptoms from COVID-19. Following his discharge from intensive care unit, he was unable to sleep, was increasingly agitated and was observed hitting his head off the walls, causing haematomas. He remained highly anxious and developed paranoid delusions and auditory and tactile hallucinations, needing admission to a psychiatric ward. Treatment with antipsychotic medication gradually improved his symptoms in a few weeks. This case report highlights the new onset of psychosis due to COVID-19 infection. It demonstrates the importance of early identification and treatment of neuropsychiatric complications within an acute hospital setting. Furthermore, there is a need for research in this area to help in the prevention and treatment of such psychiatric complications due to COVID-19.
