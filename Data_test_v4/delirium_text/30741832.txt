30741832|t|Effect of esmolol and lidocaine on agitation in awake phase of anesthesia among children: a double-blind, randomized clinical study.
30741832|a|BACKGROUND: Sevoflurane is widely used to anesthetize children because of its rapid action with minimal irritation of the airways. However, there is a high risk of agitation after emergence from anesthesia. Strabismus surgery, in particular, can trigger agitation because patients have their eyes covered in the postoperative period. The aim of this study was to determine whether or not esmolol and lidocaine could decrease emergence agitation in children. METHODS: Eighty-four patients aged 3 to 9 years undergoing strabismus surgery were randomly assigned to a control group (saline only), a group that received intravenous lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg, and a group that received intravenous esmolol 0.5 mg/kg and lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg. Agitation was measured using the objective pain score, Cole 5-point score, and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale score at the end of surgery, on arrival in the recovery room, and 10 and 30 min after arrival. RESULTS: The group that received the combination of esmolol and lidocaine showed lower OPS and RASS scores than the other two groups when patients awoke from anesthesia (OPS = 0 (0-4), RASS = -4 [(-5)-1]) and were transferred to the recovery room (OPS = 0 (0-8), RASS = -1 [(-5)-3]) (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the severity of agitation among the three groups at other time points (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: When pediatric strabismus surgery is accompanied by sevoflurane anesthesia, an intravenous injection of esmolol and lidocaine could alleviate agitation until arrival in the recovery room.
