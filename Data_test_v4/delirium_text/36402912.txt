36402912|a|Cinnamon aqueous extract's active substance base remains unclear and its mechanisms, mainly the therapeutic target of anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related GABAergic synaptic dysfunction, remain unclear. Here, 30 chemical components were identified in the aqueous extract of cinnamon using LC/MS; secondly, we explored the brain-targeting components of the aqueous extract of cinnamon, and 17 components had a good absorption due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limitation; thirdly, further clustering analysis of active ingredient targets by network pharmacology showed that the GABA pathway with GABRG2 as the core target was significantly enriched; then, we used prominent protein-protein interactions (PPI), relying on a protein-metabolite network, and identified the GABRA1, GABRB2 and GABRA5 as the closest targets to GABRG2; finally, the affinity between the target and its cognate active compound was predicted by molecular docking. In general, we screened five components, methyl cinnamate, propyl cinnamate, ( +)-procyanidin B2, procyanidin B1, and myristicin as the brain synapse-targeting active substances of cinnamon using a systematic strategy, and identified GABRA1, GABRB2, GABRA5 and GABRG2 as core therapeutic targets of cinnamon against Alzheimer's disease-related GABAergic synaptic dysfunction. Exploring the mechanism of cinnamon' activities through multi-components and multiple targets strategies promise to reduce the threat of single- target and symptom-based drug discovery failure.
