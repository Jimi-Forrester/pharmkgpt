35754598|t|Relation of hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia to bipolar and psychotic disorders.
35754598|a|Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is characterized by hypercalcemia and an elevated level of serum parathyroid hormone. PHPT leads to hypercalcemia and presents with renal, skeletal, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Neuropsychiatric manifestations of PHPT such as psychotic, depressive, and anxiety disorders are rare. Delirium may also be present in patients with PHPT. Parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with physically symptomatic PHPT, but it remains unclear if parathyroidectomy is indicated for its psychiatric manifestations. It is unclear if parathyroidectomy should be performed as a treatment for medication-refractory psychiatric symptoms or deferred until psychiatric symptoms have been better controlled. We present two cases of hyperparathyroidism (HPT)-associated hypercalcemia-one with lithium-associated HPT-in which psychiatric manifestations resolved with parathyroidectomy.
