37266849|t|GluN2B subunit selective N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ligands: Democratizing recent progress to assist the development of novel neurotherapeutics.
37266849|a|N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play essential roles in vital aspects of brain functions. NMDARs mediate clinical features of neurological diseases and thus, represent a potential therapeutic target for their treatments. Many findings implicated the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs in various neurological disorders including epilepsy, ischemic brain damage, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although a large amount of information is growing consistently on the importance of GluN2B subunit, however, limited recent data is available on how subunit-selective ligands impact NMDAR functions, which blunts the ability to render the diagnosis or craft novel treatments tailored to patients. To bridge this gap, we have focused on and summarized recently reported GluN2B selective ligands as emerging subunit-selective antagonists and modulators of NMDAR. Herein, we have also presented an overview of the structure-function relationship for potential GluN2B/NMDAR ligands with their binding sites and connection to CNS functionalities. Understanding of design rules and roles of GluN2B selective compounds will provide the link to medicinal chemists and neuroscientists to explore novel neurotherapeutic strategies against dysfunctions of glutamatergic neurotransmission.
