36078974|a|Psoriasis is one of the most common dermatoses, which shortens patients' lives because of the wide comorbidity. However, little is known about its association with neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). We aimed to investigate whether psoriatics are at increased risk of NDs. Sixty patients with plaque-type psoriasis were enrolled into the study. Serum concentrations of tau protein (MAPT), neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NrCAM) and neprilysin (NEP), which are NDs biomarkers and have been hardly studied in psoriasis before, were measured before and after 12 weeks of treatment with acitretin or methotrexate. NrCAM and NEP concentrations were significantly lower in patients than controls, whereas MAPT higher (all p < 0.05). There was no association between these markers and psoriasis severity, BMI or disease duration. After the treatment the concentration of NrCAM and NEP significantly increased and MAPT decreased (p < 0.001, p < 0.05, p < 0.01, respectively). Methotrexate had significant influence on the concentrations of all markers, hence it seems to have neuroprotective properties. Psoriasis severity and duration do not seem to affect the risk of neurodegenerative process. Our results suggest that NDs could be considered as another comorbidity of psoriasis and that further research are needed in order to establish their definite association.
