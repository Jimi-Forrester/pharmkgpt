39585088|a|PURPOSE: Anticholinergic drugs can cause adverse events (AEs) in older adults. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can detect prescriptions with a high anticholinergic load. Our starting hypothesis was that the anticholinergic load could be reduced by combining a CDSS with a strategy for generating pharmacist interventions. The objective of the present study was to assess the impact of this combination on the change over time in the anticholinergic load in hospitalized older adults. METHODS: This prospective, single-centre study was divided into two 6-week periods. During the interventional period, a pharmacist analyzed the alerts generated by the CDSS for 30 targeted anticholinergic drugs and decided whether to issue a pharmacist intervention. A control period corresponds to standard care. The primary endpoint of the study is the delta of the anticholinergic load between the alert and hospital discharge; the secondary endpoint is the incidence of anticholinergic adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Of the 144 alerts generated, 87 were considered to be relevant (36 in the interventional period and 51 in the control period). A significant difference was observed between the delta anticholinergic load between the experimental and control periods (1.61 vs. 0.67, p-value = 0.0115). For the targeted drugs (n = 94) over the 87 alerts, 46.8% were for antihistamines and 21.3% were for desloratadine. Of the 36 pharmacist interventions sent by the pharmacist, 19 (52.8%) were accepted. The most deprescribed drug class was the antihistamine class (n = 7), and the most deprescribed drug was amitriptyline (n = 5). Among these 87 patients with alerts, the correlation between the anticholinergic load and the number of AEs was not statistically significant (p = 0.887). The most common AE affecting the peripheral nervous system was constipation (28.6%), and the most common AE affecting the central nervous system was confusion (29.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the combination of specific CDSS rules with pharmacist-mediated risk management procedures could further reduce the anticholinergic load in hospitalized older adults, relative to routine care. It remains to be determined whether this reduction in the anticholinergic load has an impact on the incidence of peripheral and central anticholinergic AEs, and thus the health of these patients.
