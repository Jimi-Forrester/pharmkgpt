34218085|t|Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitors based on a diphenylsulfide-benzoylpiperidine scaffold.
34218085|a|Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is an enzyme belonging to the endocannabinoid system that mainly metabolizes the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Numerous studies have shown the involvement of this enzyme in various pathological conditions such as pain, cancer progression, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, thus encouraging the development of new MAGL modulators. In this context, we developed new diphenylsulfide-benzoylpiperidine derivatives characterized by a high enzymatic MAGL inhibition activity in the low nanomolar range, a reversible mechanism of action and selectivity. The three most active compounds (15-17) induced an appreciable inhibition of cell viability in a panel of nine cancer cell lines, with IC50 values ranging between 0.32 and 10 muM, thus highlighting their potential as novel anticancer agents.
