7644039|a|The rate of cognitive decline, measured by psychometric testing, is widely used to track the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As an alternative approach, we studied clinical measures as markers of the progression of dementia in 343 community-dwelling patients with probable AD enrolled in the multi-center Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) project. Subjects received standardized evaluations at entry and at annual follow-up. Decline on the Clinical Dementia Rating, loss of instrumental activities of daily living, failure to recall three words on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and decline of the total MMSE score to below 10 were high-risk milestones, with cumulative frequencies exceeding 50% at 3 years. Loss of dressing and toileting activities occurred at intermediate rates, while loss of eating ability was rare. The risk of reaching clinical milestones and the annual rate of cognitive decline on the MMSE were directly correlated. Clinical milestones are useful indices of the progression of dementia in patients with AD.
