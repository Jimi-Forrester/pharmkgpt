32529881|a|OBJECTIVE: Postoperative delirium (POD) has rarely been investigated in breast cancer patients. Herein, we assessed the association between serum levels of the inflammatory biomarker translocator protein (TP) and the occurrence of POD in breast cancer patients. METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, TP levels were detected in preoperative and postoperative serum samples from 152 elderly breast cancer patients, samples from 152 healthy elderly women, and samples from 152 elderly women with benign breast diseases. The relationship between serum TP levels and POD was investigated using multivariate analysis. RESULTS: TP levels in postoperative patient serum samples were significantly higher than in preoperative patient serum samples and serum from women in the two control groups. Postoperative serum TP levels were independently correlated with serum C-reactive protein levels and the occurrence of POD. Postoperative serum TP levels had a high discriminatory ability for POD under the receiver operating characteristic curve. CONCLUSIONS: Increased postoperative serum TP levels are independently associated with the degree of inflammatory response and the risk of POD in elderly breast cancer patients, substantializing TP as an inflammatory biomarker that can efficiently discriminate POD after breast cancer surgery.
