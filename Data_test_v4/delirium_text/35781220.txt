35781220|a|Methamphetamine (METH) can cause neurotoxicity and increase the risk of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. This study aimed to investigate the effect of moderate-intensity interval training (MIIT) on gene expression and antioxidant status of the hippocampus of METH-dependent rats. Thirty-two male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four equal groups (n = 8): saline, METH, MIIT, and METH + MIIT. METH was injected intraperitoneally at 5 mg/kg for 21 days. The MIIT(interval running) was performed on the treadmill 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Morris water maze test was performed to measure learning and memory. Then, the hippocampal tissue was extracted to evaluate changes in gene expression and biochemical enzymes. The data were analyzed using one-way and two-way ANOVA methods at p < 0.05. The results showed that METH injection significantly reduced spatial memory and antioxidant enzymes and increased the expression of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), tau, and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) genes compared to the saline group. MIIT significantly increased spatial memory and antioxidant enzymes. However, it reduced alpha-syn, CDK5, tau, and p-tau expression. Thus, this study depicted that methamphetamine-dependent rats with memory deficits have lower antioxidant enzyme levels and higher expression of alpha-syn, CDK5, tau, and p-tau genes, and that an 8-week MIIT may have beneficial effects on the memory impairments as well as antioxidant status and gene expression in male rats.
