29567592|t|Training students to detect delirium: An interprofessional pilot study.
29567592|a|AIM: The purpose of this paper is to report nursing student knowledge acquisition and attitude after completing and interprofessional simulation with medical students. INTRODUCTION: The IOM has challenged healthcare educators to teach teamwork and communication skills in interprofessional settings. Interprofessional simulation provides a higher fidelity experience than simulation in silos. Simulation may be particularly useful in helping healthcare workers gain the necessary skills to care for psychiatric clients. Specifically, healthcare providers have difficulty differentiating between dementia and delirium. Recognizing this deficit, an interprofessional simulation was created using medical students in their neurology rotation and senior nursing students. METHOD: Twenty-four volunteer nursing students completed a pre-survey to assess delirium knowledge and then completed an education module about delirium. Twelve of these students participated in a simulation with medicine students. Pre and Post Kid SIM Attitude questionnaires were completed by all students participating in the simulation. After the simulations were complete, all twenty-four students were asked to complete the post-survey regarding delirium knowledge. RESULTS: While delirium knowledge scores improved in both groups, the simulation group scored higher, but the difference did not reach significance. The simulation group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in attitudes toward simulation, interprofessional education, and teamwork post simulation compared to their pre-simulation scores. CONCLUSION: Nursing students who participated in an interprofessional simulation developed a heightened appreciation for learning communication, teamwork, situational awareness, and interprofessional roles and responsibilities. These results support the use of interprofessional simulation in healthcare education.
