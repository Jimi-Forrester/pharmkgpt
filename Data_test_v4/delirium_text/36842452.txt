36842452|a|OBJECTIVES: To validate the hypothesis that apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 modifies the effect of possible anticholinergic drugs (PACDs) on incident dementia among older adults. DESIGN: A population-based prospective study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Dementia-free older adults in an urban community in Shanghai, China. METHODS: At baseline, PACDs were defined according to the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale. Standard daily dose (SDD) of PACDs was calculated. A battery of neuropsychological tests was used to assess cognition and the consensus diagnosis was conducted for incident dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multivariate Cox regression models were used to examine the association between PACD use and the risk of dementia and AD in APOE epsilon4 carriers and noncarriers. RESULTS: We followed 1406 dementia-free participants for a median of 5.3 years and defined 117 incident dementia cases, among which 89 were AD. Only in APOE epsilon4 carriers was PACD use associated with incident dementia [hazard ratio (HR) 5.71; 95% CI 2.04-15.94] and AD (HR 5.73; 95% CI 1.77-18.54); SDD was positively associated with incident dementia (HR 2.42; 95% CI 1.32-4.44) and AD (HR 2.16; 95% CI 1.06-4.41). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Using PACDs requires judicious consideration for the potential risk of dementia and AD in older adults carrying APOE epsilon4.
