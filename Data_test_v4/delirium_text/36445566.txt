36445566|a|BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of knowledge about the effects of COronaVIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19) on long-term frailty development or progression over time. AIM: This study aims to assess transitions in frailty status in older adults who survived hospitalization for COVID-19. METHODS: This is a longitudinal panel study. A multidisciplinary outpatient follow-up service was established since summer 2020, for the evaluation of individuals discharged alive, after hospitalization due to COVID-19. Frailty status was assessed in-hospital and at follow-up using the clinical frailty scale (CFS). Main patients' characteristics, including health, functional, cognitive, and psychological status were collected. RESULTS: A total of 177 patients aged 65 years and older were evaluated until June 2022. They were predominantly male, with a median age of 70 (Q1-Q3 67-75) years and a median body mass index of 27.5 (Q1-Q3 24.9-30.6) kg/m2 at hospital admission. The median follow-up time was 6.3 (Q1-Q3 3.7-10.9) months. Sixty-one patients (34.5%) scored worse at CFS follow-up compared to hospital admission, and twenty-two patients (12.4%) became frail. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study shows that one out of three older patients previously hospitalized for COVID-19 had an unfavorable transition in CFS score during a median follow-up of nearly 6 months. Specific interventions to prevent frailty development or progression should be considered for patients at risk. Further studies are required to confirm our findings.
