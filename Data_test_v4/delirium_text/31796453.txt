31796453|a|This case report presents the case of a 29 weeks pregnant woman in her late twenties who was seen at the emergency department of a hospital with a seizure of unknown cause. By anamnesis and hetero-anamnesis the use of illicit gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) was revealed. Examination showed dilated pupils, sweating, tremor, tachycardia and bradyphrenic thinking. Subsequently, the seizure was indicated as a severe illicit GHB withdrawal symptom. Thereafter, treatment had to be decided on in the absence of evidence-based and practiced-based guidelines and treatment options for this specific patient population. Initially diazepam was started, which was later on substituted by sodium oxybate. Despite the critical professional situation the patient gave birth to a healthy daughter after 37 weeks of pregnancy.
