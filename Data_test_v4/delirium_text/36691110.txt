36691110|a|Chronic binge-like drinking is a risk factor for age-related dementia, however, the lasting and irreversible effect of alcohol on the brain remains elusive. Transcriptomic changes in brain cortices revealed pro-ageing hallmarks upon chronic ethanol exposure and these changes predominantly occur in neurons. The changes are attributed to a prioritized ethyl alcohol oxidation in these cells via the NADPH-dependent cytochrome pathway. This hijacks the folate metabolism of the 1-carbon network which supports the pathway choice of DNA repair via the non-cell cycle-dependent mismatch repair networks. The lost-in-function of such results in the de-inactivation of the less preferred cell cycle-dependent homologous recombination (HR) repair, forcing these post-mitotic cells to re-engage in a cell cycle-like process. However, mature neurons are post-mitotic. Therefore, instead of successfully completing a full round of cell cycle which is necessary for the completion of HR-mediated repair; these cells are arrested at checkpoints. The resulting persistence of repair intermediates induces and promotes the nuclear accumulation of p21 and cyclin B-a trigger for permanent cell cycle exits and irreversible senescence response. Supplementation of bioactive 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate simultaneously at times with ethyl alcohol exposure supports the fidelity of the 1-carbon network and hence the activity of the mismatch repair. This prevents aberrant and irreversible cell cycle re-entry and senescence events of neurons. Together, our findings offer a direct connection between binge-drinking behaviour and its irreversible impact on the brain, which makes it a potential risk factor for dementia.
