33217265|a|INTRODUCTION: Cerebral malaria, a syndrome of altered consciousness, is a rare and severe neurologic complication resulting from Plasmodium falciparum. Historically, cerebral malaria has been seen more frequently in children rather than adults. To complicate the diagnosis, cerebral malaria has few specific symptoms and neurologic findings can vary with each case. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a 61-year-old male who returned from the Democratic Republic of Congo and presented to the emergency department with dehydration, fatigue, and intermittent confusion. He was ultimately diagnosed with cerebral malaria caused by P. falciparum. CONCLUSION: Even with close monitoring and appropriate treatment, cerebral malaria carries a severe risk of long-term neurocognitive deficits and a high mortality rate.
