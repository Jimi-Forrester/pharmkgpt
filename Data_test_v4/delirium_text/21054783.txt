21054783|a|Markers for caspase activation and apoptosis have been shown in brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and AD-mouse models. In neurons, caspase activation is associated with elevated amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) production. Caspases cleave numerous substrates including presenilin-1 (PS1). The cleavage takes place in the large cytosolic loop of PS1-C-terminal fragment (PS1CTF), generating a truncated PS1CTF lacking half of the loop domain (caspCTF). The loop has been shown to possess important regulatory functions with regard to Abeta(40)  and Abeta(42)  production. Previously, we have demonstrated that gamma-secretase complexes are active during apoptosis regardless of caspase cleavage in the PS1CTF-loop. Here, a PS1/PS2-knockout mouse blastocyst-derived cell line was used to establish stable or transient cell lines expressing either caspCTF or full-length CTF (wtCTF). We show that caspCTF restores gamma-secretase activity and forms active gamma-secretase complexes together with Nicastrin, Pen-2, Aph-1 and PS1-N-terminal fragment. Further, caspCTF containing gamma-secretase complexes have a sustained capacity to cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch, generating APP and Notch intracellular domain, respectively. However, when compared to wtCTF cells, caspCTF cells exhibit increased intracellular production of Abeta(42)  accompanied by increased intracellular Abeta(42) /Abeta(40)  ratio without changing the Abeta secretion pattern. Similarly, induction of apoptosis in wtCTF cells generate a similar shift in intracellular Abeta pattern with increased Abeta(42) /Abeta(40)  ratio. In summary, we show that caspase cleavage of PS1 generates a gamma-secretase complex that increases the intracellular Abeta(42) /Abeta(40)  ratio. This can have implications for AD pathogenesis and suggests caspase inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents.
