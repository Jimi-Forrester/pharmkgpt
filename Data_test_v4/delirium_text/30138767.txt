30138767|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, although Abeta alone may be insufficient to cause impairments. Modifiable health factors, including sleep, may mitigate functional symptoms of neurodegeneration. We assessed whether sleep moderated the relationship between Abeta and cognitive performance in 41 older adults, mean age 83 years. Sleep measures included actigraphy-assessed wake after sleep onset and total sleep time. Cognitive performance was assessed with memory recall, cognitive flexibility, and verbal fluency. Memory recall was assessed with the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure task, cognitive flexibility with the Trail Making test, and verbal fluency with FAS word generation. Abeta was assessed with a global measure of Pittsburgh Compound B. Wake after sleep onset moderated the relationship between Abeta and memory, with a stronger positive association for Abeta and forgetting in those with poorer sleep. These results suggest a possible protective role of sleep in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
