31316720|t|Mitochondrial Dysfunctions: A Thread Sewing Together Alzheimer's Disease, Diabetes, and Obesity.
31316720|a|Metabolic disorders are severe and chronic impairments of the health of many people and represent a challenge for the society as a whole that has to deal with an ever-increasing number of affected individuals. Among common metabolic disorders are Alzheimer's disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. These disorders do not have a univocal genetic cause but rather can result from the interaction of multiple genes, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Mitochondrial alterations have emerged as a feature common to all these disorders, underlining perhaps an impaired coordination between cellular needs and mitochondrial responses that could contribute to their development and/or progression.
