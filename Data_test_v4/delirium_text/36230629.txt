36230629|a|Chimeric antigen receptor-engineered (CAR) T cells are emerging powerful therapies for patients with refractory/relapsed B-cell lymphomas. [18F]FDG PET/CT plays a key role during staging and response assessment in patients with lymphoma; however, the evidence about its utility in CAR-T therapies for lymphomas is limited. This review article aims to provide an overview of the role of PET/CT during CAR-T cell therapy in B-cell lymphomas, focusing on the prognostic value of metabolic parameters, as well as on response assessment. Data from the literature report on the use of [18F]FDG PET/CT at the baseline with two scans performed before treatment started focused on the time of decision (TD) PET/CT and time of transfusion (TT) PET/CT. Metabolic tumor burden is the most studied parameter associated with disease progression and overall survival, making us able to predict the occurrence of adverse effects. Instead, for post-therapy evaluation, 1 month (M1) PET/CT seems the preferable time slot for response assessment and in this setting, the Deauville 5-point scale (DS), volumetric analyses, SUVmax, and its variation between different time points ( SUVmax) have been evaluated, confirming the usefulness of M1 PET/CT, especially in the case of pseudoprogression. Additionally, an emerging role of PET/CT brain scans is reported for the evaluation of neurotoxicity related to CAR-T therapies. Overall, PET/CT results to be an accurate method in all phases of CAR-T treatment, with particular interest in assessing treatment response. Moreover, PET parameters have been reported to be reliable predictors of outcome and severe toxicity.
