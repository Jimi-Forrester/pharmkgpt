39212377|a|Gut microbiome plays a vital role in the intestinal ecosystem and has close association with metabolites. Due to the development of metabolomics and microbiomics, recent studies have observed that alteration of either the gut microbiome or metabolites may have effects on the progression of pancreatitis. Several new treatments based on the gut microbiome or metabolites have been studied extensively in recent years. Gut microbes, such as Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, and Lactobacillus, and metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, vitamin, hydrogen sulfide, and alcohol, have different effects on pancreatitis. Some preliminary studies about new intervention measures were based on the gut microbiome and metabolites such as diet, prebiotic, herbal medicine, and fecal microbiota transplantation. This review aims to summarize the recent advances about the gut microbiome, metabolites, and pancreatitis in order to determine the potential beneficial role of the gut microbiome and metabolites in pancreatitis.
