36552106|a|Objectives: To determine the short- and medium-term therapeutic effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on restless legs syndrome (RLS) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to study the optimal position of activated contacts for RLS symptoms. Methods: We preoperatively and postoperatively assessed PD Patients with RLS undergoing STN-DBS. Additionally, we recorded the stimulation parameters that induced RLS or relieved RLS symptoms during a follow-up. Finally, we reconstructed the activated contacts' position that reduced or induced RLS symptoms. Results: 363 PD patients were enrolled. At the 1-year follow-up, we found that the IRLS sum significantly decreased in the RLS group (preoperative 18.758 +- 7.706, postoperative 8.121 +- 7.083, p < 0.05). The results of the CGI score, MOS sleep, and RLS QLQ all showed that the STN-DBS improved RLS symptoms after one year. Furthermore, the activated contacts that relieved RLS were mainly located in the central sensorimotor region of the STN. Activated contacts in the inferior sensorimotor part of the STN or in the substantia nigra might have induced RLS symptoms. Conclusions: STN-DBS improved RLS in patients with PD in one year, which reduced their sleep disorders and increased their quality of life. Furthermore, the central sensorimotor region part of the STN is the optimal stimulation site.
