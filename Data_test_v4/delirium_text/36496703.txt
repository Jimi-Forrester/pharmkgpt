36496703|t|Promoting Effect and Potential Mechanism of Lactobacillus pentosus LPQ1-Produced Active Compounds on the Secretion of 5-Hydroxytryptophan.
36496703|a|5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is an important substance thought to improve depression. It has been shown that Lactobacillus can promote the secretion of 5-HTP in the body and thus ameliorate depression-like behavior in mice. However, the mechanism by which Lactobacillus promotes the secretion of 5-HTP is unclear. In this study, we investigated the promoting effect and mechanism of Lactobacillus, isolated from Chinese fermented foods, on the secretion of 5-HTP. The results showed that Lactobacillus (L.) pentosus LPQ1 exhibited the strongest 5-HTP secretion-promoting effect ((9.44 +- 0.69)-fold), which was dependent on the mixture of compounds secreted by L. pentosus LPQ1 (termed SLPQ1). In addition, the results of the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses indicated that SLPQ1 alters the TNF and oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathways. Moreover, the SLPQ1 ultrafiltration fraction (>10 kDa) showed a similar 5-HTP promoting effect as SLPQ1. Furthermore, reverse-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (RPLC-MS/MS) identified 29 compounds of >10 kDa in SLPQ1, including DUF488 domain-containing protein, BspA family leucine-rich repeat surface protein, and 30S ribosomal protein S5, which together accounted for up to 62.51%. This study reports new findings on the mechanism by which L. pentosus LPQ1 promotes 5-HTP production in some cell lines in vitro.
