37206405|t|Cascade autohydrolysis of Alzheimer's Abeta peptides.
37206405|a|Protein/peptide self-assembly into amyloid structures associates with major neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Soluble assemblies (oligomers) of the Abeta peptide and their aggregates are perceived as neurotoxic species in AD. While screening for synthetic cleavage agents that could break down such aberrant assemblies through hydrolysis, we observed that the assemblies of Abeta oligopeptides, containing the nucleation sequence Abeta14-24 (H14QKLVFFAEDV24), could act as cleavage agents by themselves. Autohydrolysis showed a common fragment fingerprint among various mutated Abeta14-24 oligopeptides, Abeta12-25-Gly and Abeta1-28, and full-length Abeta1-40/42, under physiologically relevant conditions. Primary endoproteolytic autocleavage at the Gln15-Lys16, Lys16-Leu17 and Phe19-Phe20 positions was followed by subsequent exopeptidase self-processing of the fragments. Control experiments with homologous d-amino acid enantiomers Abeta12-25-Gly and Abeta16-25-Gly showed the same autocleavage pattern under similar reaction conditions. The autohydrolytic cascade reaction (ACR) was resilient to a broad range of conditions (20-37  C, 10-150 muM peptide concentration at pH 7.0-7.8). Evidently, assemblies of the primary autocleavage fragments acted as structural/compositional templates (autocatalysts) for self-propagating autohydrolytic processing at the Abeta16-21 nucleation site, showing the potential for cross-catalytic seeding of the ACR in larger Abeta isoforms (Abeta1-28 and Abeta1-40/42). This result may shed new light on Abeta behaviour in solution and might be useful in the development of intervention strategies to decompose or inhibit neurotoxic Abeta assemblies in AD.
