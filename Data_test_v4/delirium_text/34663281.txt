34663281|a|OBJECTIVE: This systematic review assesses the association of tooth loss (TL), as the exposure, with morbidity and mortality by diabetes mellitus (DM) status, as the outcome, in older adults. BACKGROUND: Individuals with DM have higher prevalence of severe TL and increased risk of developing morbidities and mortality. No systematic review has evaluated the association between TL with morbidity and mortality by DM status. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Comprehensive searches used multiple publication databases containing reports published between 01/01/2000 and 04/21/2021. Two authors independently evaluated included studies for quality and risk of bias using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for cohort and Center for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) critical appraisal sheet for cross-sectional studies, while a third author arbitrated decisions to resolve disagreements. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria: eight cross-sectional and five cohort. Qualitative review of the included studies indicated TL is associated with increased incidence and prevalence of DM. TL is also associated with DM-related morbidities including greater prevalence of heart disease, diabetic retinopathy, metabolic syndrome; poorer health-related quality of life; poorer survival of participants with chronic kidney disease; and increased medical expenditure. Overall, the quality of the evidence reviewed was medium, as per the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2011 Levels of Evidence. CONCLUSIONS/PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This review found significant associations of TL with prevalence and incidence of DM and adverse DM-related outcomes. An interprofessional team-care approach that includes an oral health component could benefit the prevention and management of DM.
