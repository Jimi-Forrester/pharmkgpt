36551230|t|New Insights into lncRNAs in Abeta Cascade Hypothesis of Alzheimer's Disease.
36551230|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, but its pathogenesis is not fully understood, and effective drugs to treat or reverse the progression of the disease are lacking. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abnormally expressed and deregulated in AD and are closely related to the occurrence and development of AD. In addition, the high tissue specificity and spatiotemporal specificity make lncRNAs particularly attractive as diagnostic biomarkers and specific therapeutic targets. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs in AD is essential for developing new treatment strategies. In this review, we discuss the unique regulatory functions of lncRNAs in AD, ranging from Abeta production to clearance, with a focus on their interaction with critical molecules. Additionally, we highlight the advantages and challenges of using lncRNAs as biomarkers for diagnosis or therapeutic targets in AD and present future perspectives in clinical practice.
