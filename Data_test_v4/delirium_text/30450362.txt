30450362|a|Neurophotonics is an exploding field that spans the intersection of light and neurons for fundamental discovery and clinical translation. Optical technologies have significantly impacted brain research by probing into the mysteries of the brain, modulating brain activity, and improving patient care. Based on a discussion held at the International Conference on Biophotonics 2017, a group of leading researchers brainstormed to identify areas of unmet need in neuroscience and medicine, where biophotonics research could have the highest affect. We present two areas of future growth that spans basic research and clinical needs: management of chronic pain and interventional neuroimmunology. There are many directions within these areas that could be pursued for the ultimate goal of improved understanding of the brain and enhanced care of patients with neurological disorders.
