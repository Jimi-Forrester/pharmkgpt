33443846|t|Perioperative Multidisciplinary Delirium Prevention: A Longitudinal Case Report.
33443846|a|Postoperative delirium is associated with accelerated cognitive decline, mortality, and high health care costs. The importance of perioperative risk identification is increasingly recognized but optimal prevention strategies are still evolving. We review the case of an at-risk 79-year-old who had 3 lumbar spine surgeries within a year, 2 of which were complicated by postoperative delirium and one which was not. We discuss how a comprehensive preoperative cognitive assessment successfully informed perioperative decision making, including anesthetic management and postoperative multimodal delirium prevention strategies by geriatric medicine. The case exemplifies how coordinated interdisciplinary team management may reduce postoperative delirium in high-risk individuals.
