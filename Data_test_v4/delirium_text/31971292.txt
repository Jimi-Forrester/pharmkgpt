31971292|a|BACKGROUND: Mediastinal radiation therapy (MRT) is a widely used therapy for thoracic malignancies. This therapy has the potential to cause cardiovascular injuries, which may require surgery. The primary aim of this study is to identify the perioperative outcomes of cardiac surgery in patients with a history of MRT. Second, potential predictors of mortality and adverse events were identified. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted among 59 patients with prior MRT who underwent cardiac surgery between December 2009 and March 2015. Included surgeries consisted of procedures through median- and ministernotomy. Baseline, perioperative, and follow-up data were obtained and analyzed. RESULTS: The majority of patients had a history of breast cancer (n = 43), followed by Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 10) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 3). Preoperative estimated mortality with the Euroscore II was 3.4%. Overall 30-day mortality was 6.8% (n = 4), with a total in-hospital mortality of 10.2% (n = 6). Postoperatively, nine rethoracotomies (15.3%) had to be performed. During a mean follow-up of 53 months, an additional 10 patients (16.9%) died, of which 60% (n = 6) as a result of cancer-related events. Cox proportional modeling showed no differences in mortality between primary malignancies (P  > .05). CONCLUSION: This study shows that cardiac surgery after mediastinal radiotherapy is associated with increased short- and long-term mortality when compared to preoperative mortality risks predicted by the Euroscore II. Surgery-related events caused all short-term mortality cases, while malignancy-related events were the main cause of death during the follow-up. Mortality was higher in patients with a previous stroke and a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate.
