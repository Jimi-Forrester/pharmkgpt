38834246|a|BACKGROUND: Supporting ageing in place, quality of life and activity engagement are public health priorities for people living with dementia, but little is known about the needs and experiences of community-dwelling people with rarer forms of dementia with lesser known symptoms. Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a rare form of dementia usually caused by Alzheimer's disease but which is characterised by diminished visual processing (rather than a dominant memory problem), which poses challenges for maintaining independence and accessing appropriate support. METHODS: This study used a comparative qualitative design and focussed ethnographic methods to explore experiential differences in activity engagement for 10 people with the most common, memory-led presentation of Alzheimer's disease and 10 people with posterior cortical atrophy within their everyday home environments. RESULTS: While the data collection revealed much rich variation in individual and contextual factors, some tentative high-level differences in the experiences of everyday activities could be drawn out, seemingly attributable to the different diagnoses' differing dominant symptoms. These included people with posterior cortical atrophy being less likely to use environmental cues to initiate activities, and more likely to withhold from asking for support because of preserved insight into the impact of this on carers. This lack of initiation of activities could be misinterpreted as apathy. People with posterior cortical atrophy also were discouraged from engaging in activities by disorientation within the home, and difficulties localising, identifying and manipulating objects. People with the more common, memory-led presentation of Alzheimer's disease exhibited more memory-based difficulties with engaging with activities such as forgetting planned activities, where to locate the items required for an activity and the steps involved. Despite these distinct symptom-led challenges, all participants and their family members demonstrated resourcefulness and resilience in making creative adaptations to support continued engagement in everyday activities, supporting the widely reported management strategies of people with dementia of the Alzheimer's type more generally. CONCLUSIONS: These findings offer helpful insights into some the differing impacts dementia related visual and memory impairments can have on everyday activity engagement, which will be helpful for others navigating these challenges and the health and social care practitioners working with people affected by these conditions. The findings also highlight the vast individual variation in the multitude of individual and contextual factors involved in everyday activity engagement, and suggest important areas for future work utilising methods which are similarly high in ecological validity and accessibility as the home-based focussed ethnographic methods utilised here.
