36284351|t|Myelin repair in Alzheimer's disease: a review of biological pathways and potential therapeutics.
36284351|a|This literature review investigates the significant overlap between myelin-repair signaling pathways and pathways known to contribute to hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We discuss previously investigated therapeutic targets of amyloid, tau, and ApoE, as well as other potential therapeutic targets that have been empirically shown to contribute to both remyelination and progression of AD. Current evidence shows that there are multiple AD-relevant pathways which overlap significantly with remyelination and myelin repair through the encouragement of oligodendrocyte proliferation, maturation, and myelin production. There is a present need for a single, cohesive model of myelin homeostasis in AD. While determining a causative pathway is beyond the scope of this review, it may be possible to investigate the pathological overlap of myelin repair and AD through therapeutic approaches.
