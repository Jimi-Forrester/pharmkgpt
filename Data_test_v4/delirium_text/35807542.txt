35807542|t|Natural Products Inhibitors of Monoamine Oxidases-Potential New Drug Leads for Neuroprotection, Neurological Disorders, and Neuroblastoma.
35807542|a|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are an important class of drugs prescribed for treatment of depression and other neurological disorders. Evidence has suggested that patients with atypical depression preferentially respond to natural product MAOIs. This review presents a comprehensive survey of the natural products, predominantly from plant sources, as potential new MAOI drug leads. The psychoactive properties of several traditionally used plants and herbal formulations were attributed to their MAOI constituents. MAO inhibitory constituents may also be responsible for neuroprotective effects of natural products. Different classes of MAOIs were identified from the natural product sources with non-selective as well as selective inhibition of MAO-A and -B. Selective reversible natural product MAOIs may be safer alternatives to the conventional MAOI drugs. Characterization of MAO inhibitory constituents of natural products traditionally used as psychoactive preparations or for treatment of neurological disorders may help in understanding the mechanism of action, optimization of these preparations for desired bioactive properties, and improvement of the therapeutic potential. Potential therapeutic application of natural product MAOIs for treatment of neuroblastoma is also discussed.
