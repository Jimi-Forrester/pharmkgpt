34575380|t|Sepsis and Cognitive Assessment.
34575380|a|Sepsis disproportionally affects people over the age of 65, and with an exponentially increasing older population, sepsis poses additional risks for cognitive decline. This review summarizes published literature for (1) authorship qualification; (2) the type of cognitive domains most often assessed; (3) timelines for cognitive assessment; (4) the control group and analysis approach, and (5) sociodemographic reporting. Using key terms, a PubMed database review from January 2000 to January 2021 identified 3050 articles, and 234 qualified as full text reviews with 18 ultimately retained as summaries. More than half (61%) included an author with an expert in cognitive assessment. Seven (39%) relied on cognitive screening tools for assessment with the remaining using a combination of standard neuropsychological measures. Cognitive domains typically assessed were declarative memory, attention and working memory, processing speed, and executive function. Analytically, 35% reported on education, and 17% included baseline (pre-sepsis) data. Eight (44%) included a non-sepsis peer group. No study considered sex or race/diversity in the statistical model, and only five studies reported on race/ethnicity, with Caucasians making up the majority (74%). Of the articles with neuropsychological measures, researchers report acute with cognitive improvement over time for sepsis survivors. The findings suggest avenues for future study designs.
