38968048|a|This manuscript reviews the significant skin manifestations of Lewy body disease, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, and the diagnostic utility of skin biopsy. Besides classic motor and cognitive symptoms, non-motor manifestations, particularly dermatologic disorders, can play a crucial role in disease presentation and diagnosis. This review explores the intricate relationship between the skin and Lewy body disease. Seborrheic dermatitis, autoimmune blistering diseases (bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus), rosacea, and melanoma are scrutinized for their unique associations with Parkinson's disease, revealing potential links through shared pathophysiological mechanisms. Advances in diagnostic techniques allow the identification of promising biomarkers such as alpha-synuclein in samples obtained by skin punch biopsy. Understanding the dermatologic aspects of Lewy body disease not only contributes to its holistic characterization but also holds implications for innovative diagnostic approaches.
