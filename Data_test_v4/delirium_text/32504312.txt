32504312|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible progressive neurodegenerative disorder recognized by accumulation of amyloid-plaques (APs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and eventually loss of memory. Glia maturation factor (GMF), a neuroinflammatory protein first time isolated and cloned in our laboratory plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. However, no studies have been reported on whether anti-GMF antibody administration could downregulate neuroinflammation and attenuate amyloid pathology in AD brain. We investigated the potential effect of single dose of (2 mg/kg b.wt/mouse) intravenously (iv) injected with anti-GMF antibodyon cognitive function, neuroprotection, neuroinflammation and Abeta load in the brain of 9-month-old 5XFAD mice. Following 4 weeks of anti-GMF antibody delivery in mice, we found reduced expression of GMF, astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and microglial ionizing calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) as well as improvement inneuroinflammatory response via inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) production and amyloid pathology in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal CA1 region of 5XFAD mice. Correspondingly, blockade of GMF function with anti-GMF antibody improved spatial learning, memory, and long-term recognition memory in 5XFAD mice. The present study demonstrates that the immune checkpoint blockade of GMF function with anti-GMF antibody coordinates anti-inflammatory effects to attenuate neurodegeneration in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region of 5XFAD mouse brain. Further, our data suggest, that pharmacological immune neutralization of GMF is a promising neuroprotective strategy totherapeutically target neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD.
