25663070|t|Interaction of Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, the causative agent of proliferative kidney disease, with host proteins in the kidney of Salmo trutta.
25663070|a|Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae (Myxozoa) is the causative agent of proliferative kidney disease in various species of salmonids which are found in Europe and North America. Less information about the interactions of T. bryosalmonae proteins with salmonid proteins during parasite development is known. In this study, anti-T. bryosalmonae monoclonal antibody-linked to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated spin columns were used to purify parasite and host proteins from the kidneys of infected and non-infected brown trout (Salmo trutta) Linnaeus, 1758. The samples were next analyzed by electrospray ionization coupled to mass spectrometry to identify proteins that may be involved in the infection and proliferation of T. bryosalmonae within the brown trout host. A total of 6 parasite proteins and 40 different host proteins were identified in this analysis. The identified host proteins function in various processes, which include host defense, enzymatic, and structural components. In conjunction with modern molecular based tools, such siRNA, gene replacement, or gene disruption, this data can ultimately be used to develop novel control methods for T. bryosalmonae, based on the proteins or pathways identified in this study.
