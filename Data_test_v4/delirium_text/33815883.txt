33815883|t|Sleep Disorders in Stroke: An Update on Management.
33815883|a|Stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality all over the world. Due to an aging population, the incidence of stroke is rising significantly, which has led to devastating consequences for patients. In addition to traditional risk factors such as age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and atrial fibrillation, sleep disorders, as independent modifiable risk factors for stroke, have been highlighted increasingly. In this review, we provide an overview of common types of current sleep disturbances in cerebrovascular diseases, including insomnia, hypersomnia, breathing-related sleep disorders, and parasomnias. Moreover, evidence-based clinical therapeutic strategies and pitfalls of specific sleep disorders after stroke are discussed. We also review the neurobiological mechanisms of these treatments as well as their effects on stroke. Since depression after stroke is so prevalent and closely related to sleep disorders, treatments of post-stroke depression are also briefly mentioned in this review article.
