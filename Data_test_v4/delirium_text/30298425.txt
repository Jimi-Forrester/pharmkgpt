30298425|a|The association between subjective memory complaints (SMCs) and depressive symptoms has been widely reported and both have been regarded as risk factors for dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although SMCs arise as early as in middle age, the exact neural correlates of comorbid depressive symptoms among individuals who are middle-aged and with SMCs have not yet been well investigated. Because rich-club organization of the brain plays a key role in the pathophysiology of various neuropsychiatric disorders, the investigation of rich club organization may provide insight regarding the neurobiological mechanisms of depressive symptoms in SMCs. In the current study, we compared the rich-club organization in the structural brain connectivity between individuals who have SMCs along with depressive symptoms (SMCD) and individuals with SMCs but without depressive symptoms (SMCO). A total of 53 individuals with SMCD and 91 individuals with SMCO participated in the study. For all participants, high-resolution, T1-weighted images and diffusion tensor images were obtained, and the network analysis was performed. Individuals with SMCD had lower connectivity strength between the precuneus and other rich-club nodes than those with SMCO, which was significant after adjusting for potential confounders. Our findings suggest that disruptions of rich-club connectivity strength of the precuenus are associated with depressive symptoms in middle-aged individuals with SMCs. Given that the precuneus is one of the commonly affected regions in the early stages of AD, our findings may imply that the concomitant depressive symptoms in middle-aged individuals with SMCs could reflect structural alterations related to AD.
