19183775|a|Anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease have to date proved disappointing, including a large study of low-dose prednisone, but higher dose steroids significantly reduced amyloid secretion in a small series of nondemented patients. In addition, there is a case report of a patient with amyloid angiopathy who had complete remission from two doses of dexamethasone, and very high dose steroids are already used for systemic amyloidosis. This paper presents the hypothesis that pulse-dosed intrathecal methylprednisolone or dexamethasone will produce detectable slowing of Alzheimer's progression, additive to that obtained with cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. A protocol based on treatment regimens for multiple sclerosis and central nervous system lupus is outlined, to serve as a basis for formulating clinical trials. Ultimately intrathecal corticosteroids might become part of a multi-agent regimen for Alzheimer's disease and also have application for other neurodegenerative disorders.
