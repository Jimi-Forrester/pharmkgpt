39769345|a|Synaptic pathology is crucial in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), and numerous studies show a correlation between synaptic proteins and the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease. Due to the fact that altered synaptic function is considered a core feature of the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders, synaptic proteins, such as neurogranin, may serve as a biomarker of these diseases. Neurogranin is a postsynaptic protein located in the cell bodies and dendrites of neurons, foremost in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. It has been established that neurogranin is involved in synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation. Literature data indicate that cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin may be useful as a biomarker for more accurate diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, the diagnostic value of cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin in most common neurodegenerative diseases is examined.
