36554633|t|Preventive Care and Outcomes of Interprofessional Medicare Annual Wellness Visits for Older Adults.
36554633|a|As we anticipate a growing population of older adults, we will see an increase in chronic conditions such as dementia and falls. To meet these public health needs, we must systematically provide screening, education, preventive care, and supportive care for older patients and their caregivers in a primary care setting. This will require a workforce trained in providing for the complex medical and psychosocial needs of an older adult population in an interprofessional and collaborative fashion. By integrating geriatric screening tools into an interdisciplinary Annual Wellness Visit teaching clinic, we were able to successfully improve rates of geriatric screening for dementia, depression, falls, medication reconciliation and advance care planning. We also saw improvements in patient care and satisfaction and provided the opportunity for interprofessional collaboration and education for students in medicine, nursing, pharmacy and social work.
