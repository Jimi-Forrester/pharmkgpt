30236807|t|A photoelectrochemical sensor for highly sensitive detection of amyloid beta based on sensitization of Mn:CdSe to Bi2WO6/CdS.
30236807|a|A high sensitivity photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor for amyloid beta (Abeta) detection, which has great neurotoxic effect on the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), was presented based on the sensitization of Mn2+ doped CdSe (Mn:CdSe) to Bi2WO6/CdS electrode. Bi2WO6 was synthesized successfully with a unique flower-like amorphous structure, providing a merit to load functional CdS for obtaining an expected PEC response. Mn:CdSe was used to label Abeta for acquiring Mn:CdSe-Abeta bioconjugate and enhancing the detection sensitivity via the competitive immunoreaction of Mn:CdSe-Abeta and Abeta with antibody immobilized on Bi2WO6/CdS electrode. The doped of Mn2+ in CdSe nanoparticles could induce energy defect that impeded the recombination of photo-generated charges, and greatly enhanced PEC response for ultrasensitive detection of Abeta. The proposed immunosensor for Abeta showed a linear range of 0.2 pg mL-1-50 ng mL-1 with a detection limit of 0.068 pg mL-1, also with good stability, high selectivity, and acceptable reproducibility. The sensitization of Mn:CdSe provided a new way for preparation of highly sensitive protein biosensors.
