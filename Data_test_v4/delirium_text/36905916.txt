36905916|t|C-glycosides analogues of the okadaic acid central fragment exert neuroprotection via restoration of PP2A-phosphatase activity: A rational design of potential drugs for Alzheimer's disease targeting tauopathies.
36905916|a|Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is an important Ser/Thr phosphatase that participates in the regulation of multiple cellular processes. This implies that any deficient activity of PP2A is the responsible of severe pathologies. For instance, one of the main histopathological features of Alzheimer's disease is neurofibrillary tangles, which are mainly comprised by hyperphosphorylated forms of tau protein. This altered rate of tau phosphorylation has been correlated with PP2A depression AD patients. With the goal of preventing PP2A inactivation in neurodegeneration scenarios, we have aimed to design, synthesize and evaluate new ligands of PP2A capable of preventing its inhibition. To achieve this goal, the new PP2A ligands present structural similarities with the central fragment C19-C27 of the well-established PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid (OA). Indeed, this central moiety of OA does not exert inhibitory actions. Hence, these compounds lack PP2A-inhibiting structural motifs but, in contrast, compete with PP2A inhibitors, thus recovering phosphatase activity. Proving this hypothesis, most compounds showed a good neuroprotective profile in neurodegeneration models related to PP2A impairment, highlighting derivative 10, named ITH12711, as the most promising one. This compound (1) restored in vitro and cellular PP2A catalytic activity, measured on a phospho-peptide substrate and by western-blot analyses, (2) proved good brain penetration measured by PAMPA, and (3) prevented LPS-induced memory impairment of mice in the object recognition test. Thus, the promising outcomes of the compound 10 validate our rational approach to design new PP2A-activating drugs based on OA central fragment.
