23493386|t|The Effects of Progesterone on Glial Cell Line-derived Neurotrophic Factor Secretion from C6 Glioma Cells.
23493386|a|OBJECTIVES: Progesterone is a steroid hormone whose biology has been greatly studied within the confines of reproductive function. In recent years, the neuroprotective effects of progesterone have attracted growing interest. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), is a neurotrophic factor which plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of distinct sets of central and peripheral neurons. In the present study, we investigated the potential implication of GDNF in the neuroprotective action of progesterone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cultured rat C6 glioma cells were treated with progesterone (100 nm, 1 microM, and 10 microM) or its vehicle. After 24, 36, 48 and 72 hr, GDNF protein levels were measured in the cell-conditioned media and cell lysates using a GDNF ELISA kit. Cell numbers were determined by a cell-counting assay kit. RESULTS: Forty-eight hr treatment with progesterone (10 microM) resulted in a significant elevation of GDNF secretion from C6 glioma cells that remained elevated up to 72 hr. The intracellular content of GDNF and cell numbers were not affected by progesterone treatment. CONCLUSION: Stimulation of GDNF release from glial cells appears as a potential mechanism through which progesterone exerts its neuroprotective effects.
