36834685|t|Hot Spots for the Use of Intranasal Insulin: Cerebral Ischemia, Brain Injury, Diabetes Mellitus, Endocrine Disorders and Postoperative Delirium.
36834685|a|A decrease in the activity of the insulin signaling system of the brain, due to both central insulin resistance and insulin deficiency, leads to neurodegeneration and impaired regulation of appetite, metabolism, endocrine functions. This is due to the neuroprotective properties of brain insulin and its leading role in maintaining glucose homeostasis in the brain, as well as in the regulation of the brain signaling network responsible for the functioning of the nervous, endocrine, and other systems. One of the approaches to restore the activity of the insulin system of the brain is the use of intranasally administered insulin (INI). Currently, INI is being considered as a promising drug to treat Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. The clinical application of INI is being developed for the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases and improve cognitive abilities in stress, overwork, and depression. At the same time, much attention has recently been paid to the prospects of using INI for the treatment of cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injuries, and postoperative delirium (after anesthesia), as well as diabetes mellitus and its complications, including dysfunctions in the gonadal and thyroid axes. This review is devoted to the prospects and current trends in the use of INI for the treatment of these diseases, which, although differing in etiology and pathogenesis, are characterized by impaired insulin signaling in the brain.
