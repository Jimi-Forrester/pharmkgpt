34953303|a|Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) may be a suitable, simple, and cost-effective brain imaging technique for detecting divergent neuronal patterns at an early stage of neurodegeneration. In course of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD), a deficit in visual-spatial processing, located in the parietal cortex, is a reliable risk factor. Earlier, we established the application of the clock-hand-angle-discrimination task (ADT) during fNIRS to identify neuronal correlates of the visual-spatial processing in a healthy elderly sample. In this analysis, we aimed to measure and find out differences in the hemodynamic response in MCI participants compared to matched healthy controls. As expected, MCI participants showed more errors over all conditions of pointer length and a higher reaction time in the long and middle pointer length condition. Moreover, results revealed a significant reduction of cortical activation in MCI patients. There was a generally increased activity in both the right as compared to the left hemisphere and the superior parietal brain region as compared to the inferior parietal brain region in both groups. In summary, fNIRS can be implemented in the measurement of visual-spatial processing in MCI patients and healthy elderly based on ADT. MCI participants had difficulties to cope with the ADT. Since neuronal hypoactivity occurs with concomitant behavioral deficits, an additional analysis was performed on a subgroup of MCI patients who performed as well as the control group in behavior. This subgroup analysis also showed a hypoactivation of the parietal cortex, without evidence of a compensatory activation. Therefore, we assume that MCI patients are characterized by a deficit in the parietal cortex. Overall, these findings confirm our hypothesis that hemodynamic deficits in visual-spatial processing, localized in the parietal cortex, are reliable and early diagnostic markers for cognitive decline in risk groups for the development of AD.
