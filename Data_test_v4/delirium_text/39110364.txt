39110364|t|Predictors of the onset of low handgrip strength in Europe: a longitudinal study of 42,183 older adults from 15 countries.
39110364|a|OBJECTIVES: A low handgrip strength (HGS) is a significant risk factor for multiple diseases. However, most relevant studies investigate the complications of a low HGS, while the risk potential of causative factors of low HGS remain poorly characterized. METHODS: We investigated the potentials of quality of life, depression, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, frailty, and difficulties performing daily activities in predicting low HGS (<= 27 kg for men, <= 16 kg for women) in European older adults aged 50 or above from 15 countries (n = 42,183). All data was collected from four successive waves of survey of health, ageing, and retirement in Europe (SHARE) conducted between 2013 and 2020. Logistic models are applied, and estimated effects are presented as odds ratios and probabilities. RESULTS: Collectively, 3016 participants (men; n = 1395; 7.38%, women; n = 1621, 6.97%) developed low HGS during the 6.5 years study period. After adjusting for covariables, we identified an advancing age (1.6-48.1% points higher risk of low HGS), male gender (1.0%-point higher risk of low HGS), lower quality of life (1.6%-point higher), and stroke (1.5%-points) as significant risk factors for low HGS. We also found a dose-dependent association of Euro-D depression scores with the risk of low HGS, as the higher scores were associated with between 0.6- and 2.3%-points higher risk of developing low HGS than participants without depression. Among physical performance indicators, difficulty climbing stairs (2.0%-points higher low HGS risk) or rising from a chair (0.7%-points) were significantly associated with developing low HGS. Lastly, frailty (0.9%-points higher risk of low HGS) and the fear of falling down (1.6%-points higher risk) also increased the risk of developing low HGS. CONCLUSION: Altogether, we report several risk factors for developing low HGS. Our observations may help evaluating and monitoring high-risk population for developing low HGS in pre-clinical settings.
