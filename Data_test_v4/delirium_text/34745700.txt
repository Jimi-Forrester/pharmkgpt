34745700|t|Practice Variability in Screening and Treating Pediatric Critical Illness Delirium: Survey.
34745700|a|The best practice in pediatric delirium (PD) screening and treatment is still unknown. Current recommendations come from small studies and adult data. In this article, we surveyed the Pediatric Critical Care Medicine fellowship directors on PD screening and treatment practices in their centers. We reported high variability in the screening and treatment practices for PD in large academic medical centers in the United States. The Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium tool is the most commonly used tool for screening, and quetiapine is the most commonly used pharmacologic agent. A national guideline on PD screening, prevention, and treatment is needed to standardize practice and provide guidance.
