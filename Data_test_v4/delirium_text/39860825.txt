39860825|t|Developing a Health Support System to Promote Care for the Elderly.
39860825|a|In light of the demographic shift towards an aging population, there is an increasing prevalence of dementia among the elderly. The negative impact on mental health is preventing individuals from taking proper care of themselves. For individuals requiring hospital care, those receiving home care, or as a precaution for a specific individual, it is advantageous to utilize monitoring equipment to track their biological parameters on an ongoing basis. This equipment can minimize the risk of serious accidents or severe health hazards. The objective of the present research project is to design an armband with an accurate location tracking system. This is of particular importance for individuals with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, who frequently leave their homes and are unable to find their way back. The proposed armband also includes a fingerprint identification system that allows only authorized personnel to use it. Furthermore, in hospitals and healthcare facilities the biometric identification system can be used to trace periodic medical or nursing visits. This process improves the reliability and transparency of healthcare. The test results indicate that the armband functions in accordance with the desired design specifications, with performance evaluation of the main features including fall detection, where a hit rate of 100% was obtained, a fingerprint recognition test demonstrating accuracy from 88% to 100% on high-quality samples, and a GPS tracking test determining position with a difference of between 1.8 and 2.1 m. The proposed solution may be of benefit to healthcare professionals, supported housing providers, elderly people as target users, or their family members.
