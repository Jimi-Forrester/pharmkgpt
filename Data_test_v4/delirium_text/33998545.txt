33998545|t|Cortical Thickness and Its Association with Clinical Cognitive and Neuroimaging Markers in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy.
33998545|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) contributes to brain neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, but the relationship between these two processes is incompletely understood. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine cortical thickness and its association with cognition and neurodegenerative biomarkers in CAA. METHODS: Data were collected from the Functional Assessment of Vascular Reactivity study and the Calgary Normative Study. In total, 48 participants with probable CAA, 72 cognitively normal healthy controls, and 24 participants with mild dementia due to AD were included. Participants underwent an MRI scan, after which global and regional cortical thickness measurements were obtained using FreeSurfer. General linear models, adjusted for age and sex, were used to compare cortical thickness globally and in an AD signature region. RESULTS: Global cortical thickness was lower in CAA compared to healthy controls (mean difference (MD) -0.047 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.088, -0.005, p = 0.03), and lower in AD compared to CAA (MD -0.104 mm, 95% CI -0.165, -0.043, p = 0.001). In the AD signature region, cortical thickness was lower in CAA compared to healthy controls (MD -0.07 mm, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.01, p = 0.02). Within the CAA group, lower cortical thickness was associated with lower memory scores (R2 = 0.10; p = 0.05) and higher white matter hyperintensity volume (R2 = 0.09, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: CAA contributes to neurodegeneration in the form of lower cortical thickness, and this could contribute to cognitive decline. Regional overlap with an AD cortical atrophy signature region suggests that co-existing AD pathology may contribute to lower cortical thickness observed in CAA.
