38219301|t|ICU admission Braden score independently predicts delirium in critically ill patients with ischemic stroke.
38219301|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is a common and severe complication in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute ischemic stroke, exacerbating cognitive and physical impairments. It prolongs hospitalization, increases healthcare costs, and raises mortality risk. Early prediction is crucial because it facilitates prompt interventions that could possibly reverse or alleviate the detrimental consequences of delirium. Braden scores, traditionally used to assess pressure injury risk, could also signal frailty, providing an early warning of delirium and aiding in prompt and effective patient management. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between the Braden score and delirium. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of adult ischemic stroke patients in the ICU of a tertiary academic medical center in Boston from 2008 to 2019 was performed. Braden scores were obtained on admission for each patient. Delirium, the primary study outcome, was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit and a review of nursing notes. The association between Braden score and delirium was determined using Cox proportional hazards modeling, with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated. RESULTS: The study included 3,680 patients with a median age of 72 years, of whom 1,798 were women (48.9 %). The median Braden score at ICU admission was 15 (interquartile range 13-17). After adjustment for demographics, laboratory tests, severity of illness, and comorbidities, the Braden score was inversely associated with the risk of delirium (adjusted HR: 0.94, 95 % CI: 0.92-0.96, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The Braden score may serve as a convenient and simple screening tool to identify the risk of delirium in ICU patients with ischemic stroke. IMPLICATION FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: The use of the Braden score as a predictor of delirium in ischemic stroke patients in the ICU allows early identification of high-risk patients. This facilitates timely intervention, thereby improving patient outcomes and potentially reducing healthcare costs.
