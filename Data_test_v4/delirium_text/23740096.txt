23740096|t|SorLA is a molecular link for retromer-dependent sorting of the Amyloid precursor protein.
23740096|a|Deficiency in the retromer sorting pathway is known to be associated with the onset of Alzheimer disease (AD), and has been suggested to involve regulation of Amyloid precursor protein (APP) trafficking. Absence of the APP sorting receptor sorLA is also associated to AD, as amyloidogenic processing of APP is increased due to missorting. Reduced activity of either retromer or sorLA thus both lead to enhanced amyloidogenic APP processing, and these pathways are therefore important factors for understanding the development of AD. It is therefore key to outline the neuronal APP trafficking in order to determine the mechanisms that influence AD onset.
