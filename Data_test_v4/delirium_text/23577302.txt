23577302|t|A review on the role of quinones in renal disorders.
23577302|a|Quinones are electron and proton carriers that play a primary role in the aerobic metabolism of virtually every cell in nature. Most physiological quinones are benzoquinones. They undergo highly regulated redox reactions in the mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. Important consequences of these electron transfer reactions are the production of and protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Quinones have been extensively studied for both their cytotoxic as well as cellular protective properties and they have been particularly useful in rational drug design. The role of quinones in medicine is explored in this literature review with a particular focus on renal diseases. Due to their high basal metabolism and detoxification role, the kidneys are particularly sensitive to oxidative stress. Regardless of the underlying etiology, ROS plays an important role in both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Depending on the oxidative state of the kidney, quinones can be nephrotoxoic or nephro-protective. Many factors play a role in the interaction between quinones and the kidney and the consequences of this are just beginning to be explored.
