20381711|a|The multifactorial model of delirium was developed to explain the interrelationship between predisposing and precipitating factors for delirium. Although validated among hospitalized patients, this model has never been tested among long-term care residents with dementia. We undertook this secondary data analysis to investigate the combined effect of predisposing and precipitating factors on the likelihood of having delirium among this population. Delirium was defined as meeting the Confusion Assessment Method criteria for definite or probable delirium. Risk factors considered in the study were those found significantly associated with delirium in the original study. Participants (N=155) were classified into risk groups. Prevalence of delirium for the low, moderate, and high predisposing risk groups were 32%, 78.4%, and 98.1%, respectively, and 37.9%, 67.2%, and 86.8% for the precipitating factors risk groups. When both variables were included in the same model, only predisposing factors remained statistically associated with delirium. Predisposing factors play a key role in the likelihood of having delirium among this population. Increased awareness of these factors among nurses could improve the care of these residents by targeting modifiable risk factors.
