36625964|a|Based on a large number of pre-existing documented electronic health records (EHR), we developed a machine learning (ML) algorithm for detection of dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia. The aim of our study was to prospectively apply this algorithm in two large patient cohorts. The tool was integrated in the hospital information system of a secondary care hospital in Austria. Based on existing data such as diagnoses, laboratory, and medication, dysphagia risk was predicted automatically, and patients were stratified into three risk groups. Patients' risk groups and risk factors were visualized in a web application. Prospective predictions of 1270 admissions to geriatric or internal medicine departments were compared with the occurrence of dysphagia or aspiration pneumonia of routinely documented events. The discriminative performance for internal medicine patients (n = 885) was excellent with an AUROC of 0.841, a sensitivity of 74.2%, and a specificity of 84.1%. For the smaller geriatric cohort (n = 221), the AUROC was 0.758, sensitivity 44.4%, and specificity 93.0%. For both cohorts, calibration plots showed a slight overestimation of the risk. This is the first study to evaluate the performance of a ML-based prediction tool for dysphagia in a prospective clinical setting. Future studies should validate the predictions on data of systematic dysphagia screening by specialists and evaluate user satisfaction and acceptance. The ML-based dysphagia prediction tool achieved an excellent performance in the internal medicine cohort. More data are needed to determine the performance in geriatric patients.
