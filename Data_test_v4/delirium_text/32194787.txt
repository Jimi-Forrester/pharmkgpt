32194787|a|Despite extensive research in the cancer field, cancer remains one of the most prevalent diseases. There is an urgent need to identify specific targets that are safe and effective for the treatment of cancer. In recent years, cancer metabolism has come into the spotlight in cancer research. Lipid metabolism, especially cholesterol metabolism, plays a critical role in membrane synthesis as well as lipid signaling in cancer. This review focuses on the contribution of the de novo cholesterol synthesis pathway to tumorigenesis, cancer progression and metastasis. In conclusion, cholesterol metabolism could be an effective target for novel anticancer treatment.
