The aim of this study was to assess whether the individualization of the indication for postoperative recovery from pulmonary surgery in ICU beds was associated with more perioperative complications. METHOD: retrospective analysis of medical records of patients undergoing anatomic lung resections for cancer in a tertiary hospital. The sample was divided into: Group-I, composed of surgeries performed between March/2019 and February/2020, pre-pandemic, and Group-II, composed of surgeries performed between March/2020 and February/2021, pandemic period in Brazil. We analyzed demographic data, surgical risks, surgeries performed, postoperative complications, length of stay in the ICU and hospital stay. Preventive measures of COVID-19 were adopted in group-II. RESULTS: 43 patients were included, 20 in group-I and 23 in group-II. The groups did not show statistical differences regarding baseline demographic variables. In group-I, 80% of the patients underwent a postoperative period in the ICU, compared to 21% in group-II. There was a significant difference when comparing the average length of stay in an ICU bed (46 hours in group-I versus 14 hours in group-II - p<0.001). There was no statistical difference regarding postoperative complications (p=0.44). CONCLUSIONS: the individualization of the need for ICU use in the immediate postoperative period resulted in an improvement in the institutional care flow during the COVID-19 pandemic, in a safe way, without an increase in surgical morbidity and mortality, favoring the maintenance of essential cancer treatment.
