38570746|a|BACKGROUND: Elder abuse is a worldwide problem with serious consequences for individuals and society. To effectively deal with elder abuse, a timely identification of signals as well as a systematic approach towards (suspected) elder abuse is necessary. This study aimed to develop and test the acceptability and appropriateness of ERASE (EldeR AbuSE) in the emergency department (ED) setting. ERASE is an early warning tool for elder abuse self-administered by the healthcare professional in patients >= 70 years. METHODS: A systematic literature review was previously conducted to identify potential available instruments on elder abuse for use in the ED. Furthermore, a field consultation in Dutch hospitals was performed to identify practice tools and potential questions on the recognition of elder abuse that were available in clinical practice. Based on this input, in three subsequent rounds the ERASE tool was developed. The ERASE tool was tested in a pilot feasibility study in healthcare professionals (n = 28) working in the ED in three Dutch hospitals. A semi-structured online questionnaire was used to determine acceptability and appropriateness of the ERASE tool. RESULTS: The systematic literature review revealed seven screening instruments developed for use in the hospital and/or ED setting. In total n = 32 (44%) hospitals responded to the field search. No suitable and validated instruments for the detection of elder abuse in the ED were identified. The ERASE tool was developed, with a gut feeling awareness question, that encompassed all forms of elder abuse as starting question. Subsequently six signalling questions were developed to collect information on observed signs and symptoms of elder abuse and neglect. The pilot study showed that the ERASE tool raised the recognition of healthcare professionals for elder abuse. The tool was evaluated acceptable and appropriate for use in the ED setting. CONCLUSIONS: ERASE as early warning tool is guided by an initial gut feeling awareness question and six signalling questions. The ERASE tool raised the recognition of healthcare professionals for elder abuse, and was feasible to use in the ED setting. The next step will be to investigate the reliability and validity of the ERASE early warning tool.
