30899050|t|Amyloid beta in nasal secretions may be a potential biomarker of Alzheimer's disease.
30899050|a|We investigated the level of amyloid beta (Abeta) in nasal secretions of patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD) using interdigitated microelectrode (IME) biosensors and determined the predictive value of Abeta in nasal secretions for ADD diagnosis. Nasal secretions were obtained from 35 patients with ADD, 18 with cognitive decline associated with other neurological disorders (OND), and 26 cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. Capacitance changes in IMEs were measured by capturing total Abeta (DeltaCtAbeta). After 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid (EPPS) was injected, additional capacitance changes due to the smaller molecular weight Abeta oligomers disassembled from the higher molecular weight oligomeric Abeta were determined (DeltaCoAbeta). By dividing two values, the capacitance ratio (DeltaCoAbeta/DeltaCtAbeta) was determined and then normalized to the capacitance change index (CCI). The CCI was higher in the ADD group than in the OND (p = 0.040) and CU groups (p = 0.007). The accuracy of the CCI was fair in separating into the ADD and CU groups (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.718, 95% confidence interval = 0.591-0.845). These results demonstrate that the level of Abeta in nasal secretions increases in ADD and the detection of Abeta in nasal secretions using IME biosensors may be possible in predicting ADD.
