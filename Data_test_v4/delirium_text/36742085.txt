36742085|t|Peduncular Hallucinosis 7 Months After Pontine Hemorrhage With Hypertrophic Olivary Degeneration: A Case Report.
36742085|a|Peduncular hallucinosis is a rare type of hallucination, wherein patients see colorful and vivid images. It usually appears after damage to the midbrain, pons, or thalamus. We report the case of a 56-year-old man with peduncular hallucinosis after conservative care for spontaneous pontine hemorrhage, 7 months prior to presentation. He was treated with atypical antipsychotics, which resolved the symptoms. We suggest that it is important to consider peduncular hallucinosis in patients after injuries in subcortical areas and the brainstem. Additionally, we found changes in the hypertrophic olivary degeneration using magnetic resonance imaging, and we suggest the possibility of their correlation with peduncular hallucinosis.
