33785139|t|Serotonin modulation of hippocampal functions: From anatomy to neurotherapeutics.
33785139|a|The hippocampal region receives a dense serotoninergic innervation originating from both medial and dorsal raphe nuclei. This innervation regulates hippocampal activity through the activation of distinct receptor families that are expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, terminals of several afferent neurotransmitter systems, and glial cells. Preclinical and clinical studies indicate that hippocampal dysfunctions are involved in learning and memory deficits, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy and mood disorders such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic syndrome disorder, whereas the hippocampus participates also in the therapeutic mechanisms of numerous medicines. Not surprisingly, several drugs acting via 5-HT mechanisms are efficacious to some extent in some diseases and the link between 5-HT and the hippocampus although clear remains difficult to untangle. For this reason, we review reported data concerning the distribution and the functional roles of the 5-HT receptors in the hippocampal region in health and disease. The impact of the 5-HT systems on the hippocampal function is such that the research of new 5-HT mechanisms and drugs is still very active. It concerns notably drugs acting at the 5-HT1A,2A,2C,4,6 receptor subtypes, in addition to the already existing drugs including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
