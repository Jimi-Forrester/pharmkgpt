36741662|t|Challenges in Anesthesia in Wilson's Disease: A Systematic Review of the Existing Literature.
36741662|a|Wilson's disease (WD) is a disorder of copper metabolism presenting with a wide variety of organ dysfunctions affecting predominantly the neurological, hepatic, and hematological systems. Due to its multi-systemic nature, administering anesthesia to a patient with WD is challenging and requires an in-depth knowledge of the disease pathophysiology. A systematic search for literature pertaining to the anesthetic management of patients with WD yielded 19 case reports, which we have included in this review to explore and summarize peri-operative concerns and the safe anesthesia practices in this condition.
