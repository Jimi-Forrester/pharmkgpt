34939434|a|Development and feasibility of an intervention to reduce physical restraints in hospitals: A mixed methods study Abstract. Background: Physical restraints (PR) are regularly used in people with dementia or delirium in general hospital settings. There is no clear evidence for the effectiveness of PR, but their use is associated with an increased risk for harm. Therefore, a restraint-free care is recommended. Aim: Development and feasibility test of an intervention to reduce PR in general hospital settings. Methods: Systematic literature reviews and theory-guided modelling of an intervention involving relevant clinical stakeholders and mixed methods study in two wards of a university hospital (geriatric traumatology and neurology). Results: The complex intervention comprises the following components: qualification of multipliers, interprofessional education about PR reduction, regular audit and feedback meetings, and the support regarding the aim of the intervention from nursing and medical leaders. The results of the feasibility test indicate that the intervention is feasible and helpful, but the interprofessional approach was not implemented as planned. An important barrier hampering PR reduction was the high workload. The results on the prevalence of PR could not be interpreted due to a very low number of measures applied. Conclusion: The complex intervention with a multiplier approach for preventing PR use was judged as feasible, but there is a need for further development to strengthen interprofessional cooperation. The feasibility of the intervention should also be tested in other departments.
