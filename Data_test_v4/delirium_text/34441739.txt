34441739|t|Single and Repeated Oral Dose Toxicity and Genotoxicity of the Leaves of Butterbur.
34441739|a|Butterbur (Petasites japonicus (Siebold & Zucc.) Maxim) leaves are available to consumers in the marketplace, but there is no guarantee that they are safe for human consumption. Previously, we demonstrated that hot water extracts of P. japonicus leaves (KP-1) had anti-inflammatory properties and attenuated memory impairment. However, data regarding KP-1 toxicity are lacking. This study assessed the safety of KP-1 by examining oral and genotoxic effects using in vivo and in vitro tests, respectively. In a single oral dose toxicity and two-week repeated oral dose toxicity study, we observed no toxicologically significant clinical signs or changes in hematology, blood chemistry, and organ weights at any dose during the experiment. Following a thirteen-week repeated oral dose, toxicity, hyperkeratosis, and squamous cell hyperplasia of the limiting ridge in the stomach were observed. The no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) was found to be 1250 mg/kg/day in male and female rats. However, hyperkeratosis and hyperplasia were not considered to be of toxicological significance when extrapolating the NOAEL to humans because the limiting ridge in the stomach is species-specific to rats. Therefore, in our study, the NOAEL was considered to be 5000 mg/kg/day when the changes in the stomach's limiting ridge were discounted. Moreover, in vitro bacterial reverse mutations and chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells and the in vivo micronucleus in Institute of cancer research (ICR) mice assays showed that KP-1 possessed no mutagenicity. Although additional research is required, these toxicological evaluations suggest that KP-1 could be safe for human consumption.
