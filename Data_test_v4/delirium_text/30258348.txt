30258348|t|Alzheimer's Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Mendelian Randomization Study.
30258348|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. In recent years, multiple pathway analyses of AD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted, and provided strong support for immune pathways in AD. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease. It is reported that antirheumatic drugs had protective effect on dementia in RA patients. However, observational studies have reported a controversial inverse relationship between AD and RA. In addition, Mendelian randomization studies have also been performed to evaluate the association of RA with AD. However, these studies reported inconsistent association of RA with AD. Until now, it is still unclear that AD is a causally associated with RA. Here, we performed a Mendelian randomization study to investigate the causal association of AD with RA. We analyzed the large-scale AD GWAS dataset (74,046 individuals) and RA GWAS dataset (58,284 individuals) from the European descent. However, we did not identify any significant association of AD with RA using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis (IVW), weighted median regression and MR-Egger regression.
