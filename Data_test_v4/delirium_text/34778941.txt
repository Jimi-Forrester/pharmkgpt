34778941|a|INTRODUCTION: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) therapy offers a potentially curative option for patients with relapsed and refractory hematologic malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Patient-reported experiences with CAR T therapy are limited and have not been well characterized. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore patient descriptions of key domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in DLBCL patients treated with CAR T therapy. METHODS: A targeted literature review was initially conducted to inform the development of the interview guide comprising predetermined open-ended questions. Two focus groups were conducted with a total of 18 patients with DLBCL identified from patient advisory boards. Focus group sessions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. MAXQDA 18.2.0 qualitative data analysis software was utilized to facilitate a constant-comparative coding process to identify key concepts. RESULTS: Eight domain impairments (social functioning, emotional functioning, fatigue, physical functioning, cognitive functioning, role functioning, sleep, and pain/discomfort) were identified from the qualitative analysis and endorsed by DLBCL patients treated with CAR T. Compared with before CAR T therapy, patients reported increased impairment in every domain during or immediately after CAR T therapy. This impairment improved for each domain 6 months after CAR T therapy except for pain/discomfort. Compared with before CAR T therapy, improvement in impairment for each domain was observed 6 months after CAR T therapy except for fatigue, sleep, and pain/discomfort. CONCLUSION: This study provides meaningful information regarding the impact of CAR T therapy on HRQoL in patients with DLBCL throughout their treatment journey. Health care professionals and investigators can utilize these data in examining existing patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures that are used in DLBCL clinical trials and to better understand the needs of DLBCL survivors.
