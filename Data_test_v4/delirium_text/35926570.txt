35926570|t|Acute Occupational and Physical Therapy for Patients With COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
35926570|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe the function of patients with COVID-19 admitted to an acute care hospital early in the pandemic and to characterize change in function among those admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and to non-critical care services. DESIGN: This descriptive, retrospective cohort study examined patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to a tertiary care medical center during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. Included patients were stratified into 4 cohorts based on whether or not they received therapy during their hospitalization and whether or not their hospitalization included time in the ICU. Data on demographic characteristics, functional impairments, medical interventions, and functional outcomes were collected. SETTING: Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 432 adult patients were included in this study (N=432). RESULTS: ICU patients receiving therapy were more likely to have impaired cognition, impaired strength, and impaired sensation than non-ICU patients receiving therapy. Patients made improvements from evaluation to discharge on the Functional Status Score for the ICU, Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care Daily Activity, and AM-PAC Basic Mobility Short Forms. CONCLUSION: Patients admitted with COVID-19 experienced significant functional impairments but also demonstrated improvement during the course of their hospitalizations. This study can facilitate health care provider awareness of the detrimental functional effects of COVID-19 and the potential role of rehabilitation services for these patients.
