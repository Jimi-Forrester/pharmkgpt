9813282|a|The amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is an approximately 4 kD secreted protein normally found in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Abeta is invariably deposited as insoluble amyloid fibrils in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and there is increasing evidence that Abeta deposition plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. Abeta is released from the larger beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) through cleavage on the amino and carboxyl side of Abeta by proteolytic activities referred to as beta and gamma secretase, respectively. betaAPP is also cleaved at Abeta16 by a third protease, alpha secretase, which may prevent amyloid deposition by bisecting the Abeta peptide. Tacrine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, has been shown to improve memory and cognitive functions in some patients with AD, and we have previously demonstrated that it significantly reduces the levels of the secretion of soluble betaAPP fragments (sAPP) in cultured cells. In this study, we extended our studies by analysis of Abeta40 and Abeta42 and report that in a human neuroblastoma cell line tacrine reduced the levels of total Abeta, Abeta40 and Abeta42 in addition to sAPP. These inhibitory results cannot be attributed to a reduction in total betaAPP synthesis as tacrine treatment did not cause a significant change in the rate of betaAPP synthesis. Furthermore, significant toxicity was not observed in tacrine-treated cultures as determined by analysis of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the conditioned media. Taken together, these results suggest that tacrine affects the processing of betaAPP by alterations in betaAPP trafficking and/or increased intracellular proteolysis. This study raises the possibility that tacrine may aid in the treatment of AD due to its effects on betaAPP processing as well as by its effects on the cholinergic pathway.
