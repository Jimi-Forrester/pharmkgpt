31005822|a|Aberrant interactions of metal ions with amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) can potentiate Alzheimer's disease (AD) by participating in the aggregation process of Abeta and in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Metallothionein-3 (MT3), which is aberrantly expressed in AD brains, is believed to play an important role in the AD progression due to its ability of maintaining metal homeostasis and scavenging ROS. However, the related molecular mechanism is not clear. In this work, the metal-dependent interactions of MT3 beta-domain (betaMT3) with amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) were systematically studied. The results showed that Zn3-betaMT3 has a higher affinity to Abeta (Kd: ~0.7 muM) than Cu4-betaMT3 (Kd: ~22 muM). In Zn3-betaMT3, both Pro7 and Pro9 face outwards with their five-member rings in parallel, favoring their binding with aromatic residues via CH/pi interactions. Two aromatic residues (Phe4 and Tyr10) in Abeta were identified as the specific binding sites for betaMT3. Based on these, we posit a characteristic in-situ protection role of Zn-MT3 in inhibiting the Cu2+-induced Abeta neurotoxicity, in which stable Zn-MT3/Abeta complex forms via the Zn3-betaMT3/Abeta interaction and effectively prevents the formation of Cu-Abeta in high viscosity physiological fluids. Our results provide the mechanistic pathway and the specific roles of betaMT3 in its protective bioactivity against AD progression, which means significant for elucidating the function of MT3 in AD neuropathology and for designing a MT3-related therapeutic strategy for AD.
