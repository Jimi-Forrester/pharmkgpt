37058842|a|Peroxynitric acid (PNA), a reactive oxygen nitrogen species, has attracted attention in life science because of its unique properties such as high bacteriacidal activity. Since the bactericidal activity of PNA could be related to its reaction with amino acid residues, we speculate that PNA can be used for protein modifications. In this study, PNA was applied to inhibit aggregation of amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta42), which is thought to cause Alzheimer's disease (AD). We demonstrated for the first time that PNA could inhibit the aggregation and cytotoxicity of Abeta42. Since PNA could inhibit aggregation of other amyloidogenic proteins such as amylin and insulin, our study shed a light on a novel strategy for the prevention of various diseases caused by amyloids.
