Early diagnosis is mandatory. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with the presence of secondary neoplastic cells in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with suspected carcinomatous meningitis (CM) Methods: Cross-sectional study involving adult patients with solid cancer diagnosis and suspected CM between 2004 and 2014 at Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires. All included patients had at least one lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. CM cases were defined by the presence of neoplastic cells in CFS. We evaluated the association of each factor (cancer characteristics, clinical engagement of central nervous system, CSF analysis) with CM using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: We included 77 patients: mean age was 62 years (SD 13.1), 58.4% (45) were female. The most common oncologic disease was lung cancer 29.9% (23), followed by breast 23.4% (18) cancer. CM was detected in 23.4% (18) patients. In univariate analysis, glychorrachia, the CSF leukocyte count, the meningeal involvement on MRI, headache and delirium were significantly associated with MC. In the multivariate model that included the variables significantly associated in the crude analysis, the only variable that remained significantly associated with MC was the glychorrachia (OR 0.93 95%CI 0.9 - 0.97, p <0.001). DISCUSSION: These results suggest that as the glychorrachia increases, the probability of having MC decreases. These findings are consistent with previous studies.
