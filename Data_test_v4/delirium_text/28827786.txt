28827786|a|To examine the pathogenic role of alpha-synuclein (alphaS) in Parkinson's Disease, we have generated induced Pluripotent Stem Cell lines from early onset Parkinson's Disease patients with SNCA A53T and SNCA Triplication mutations, and in this study have differentiated them to PSC-macrophages (pMac), which recapitulate many features of their brain-resident cousins, microglia. We show that SNCA Triplication pMac, but not A53T pMac, have significantly increased intracellular alphaS versus controls and release significantly more alphaS to the medium. SNCA Triplication pMac, but not A53T pMac, show significantly reduced phagocytosis capability and this can be phenocopied by adding monomeric alphaS to the cell culture medium of control pMac. Fibrillar alphaS is taken up by pMac by actin-rearrangement-dependent pathways, and monomeric alphaS by actin-independent pathways. Finally, pMac degrade alphaS and this can be arrested by blocking lysosomal and proteasomal pathways. Together, these results show that macrophages are capable of clearing alphaS, but that high levels of exogenous or endogenous alphaS compromise this ability, likely a vicious cycle scenario faced by microglia in Parkinson's disease.
