35034773|t|Lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegeneration: emerging concepts and methods.
35034773|a|The understanding of lysosomes has come a long way since the initial discovery of their role in degrading cellular waste. The lysosome is now recognized as a highly dynamic organelle positioned at the crossroads of cell signaling, transcription, and metabolism. Underscoring its importance is the observation that, in addition to rare monogenic lysosomal storage disorders, genes regulating lysosomal function are implicated in common sporadic neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Developing therapies for these disorders is particularly challenging, largely due to gaps in knowledge of the underlying molecular and cellular processes. In this review, we discuss technological advances that have propelled deeper understanding of the lysosome in neurodegeneration, from elucidating the functions of lysosome-related disease risk variants at the level of the organelle, cell, and tissue, to the development of disease-specific biological models that recapitulate disease manifestations. Finally, we identify key questions to be addressed to successfully bridge the gap to the clinic.
