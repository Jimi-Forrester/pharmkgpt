31580163|a|Introduction: Adverse immune activation contributes to many central nervous system (CNS) disorders. All main CNS cell types express toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4). This receptor is critical for a myriad of immune functions such as cytokine secretion and phagocytic activity of microglia; however, imbalances in TLR 4 activation can contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Areas covered: We considered available evidence implicating TLR 4 activation in the following CNS pathologies: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, multiple systems atrophy, and Huntington's disease. We reviewed studies reporting effects of TLR 4-specific antagonists and agonists in models of peripheral and CNS diseases from the perspective of possible future use of TLR 4 ligands in CNS disorders. Expert opinion: TLR 4-specific antagonists could suppress neuroinflammation by reducing overproduction of inflammatory mediators; however, they may interfere with protein clearance mechanisms and myelination. Agonists that specifically activate myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88)-independent pathway of TLR 4 signaling could facilitate beneficial glial phagocytic activity with limited activity as inducers of proinflammatory mediators. Deciphering the disease stage-specific involvement of TLR 4 in CNS pathologies is crucial for the future clinical development of TLR 4 agonists and antagonists.
