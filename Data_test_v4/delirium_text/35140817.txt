35140817|t|The Relationship between Cadherin Polymorphisms and the Risk of Delayed Encephalopathy after Acute Carbon Monoxide Poisoning in the Chinese Han Population.
35140817|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between cadherin gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the risk of delayed encephalopathy after acute carbon monoxide poisoning (DEACMP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 416 patients with DEACMP and 754 patients with acute carbon monoxide poisoning (ACMP) were recruited. We used the Sequenom MassARRAY  system to detect cadherin gene SNPs related to DEACMP. Using different genetic analysis models, we evaluated the relationship between the cadherin gene polymorphisms and risk of DEACMP. RESULTS: We found that rs1944294 in the N-cadherin (CDH2) gene showed significant differences in genotype frequencies between the two groups under codominant and dominant inheritance models. Similarly, rs2513796 in the cadherin-17 (CDH17) gene showed significant differences under the codominant, dominant, and overdominant genetic models. And the T allele frequency of rs1944294 in the DEACMP group was significantly higher than that in the ACMP group (P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Cadherin gene SNPs (rs1944294, rs2513796) are associated with an increased risk of DEACMP in the Chinese population.
