34078488|t|Trichuris muris and comorbidities - within a mouse model context.
34078488|a|Trichuris muris is a mouse intestinal parasitic nematode that inhabits the large intestine of its host and induces a strong immune response. The effects of this strong anti-parasite response can be found locally within the intestinal niche and also systemically, having effects on multiple organs. Additionally, the anti-parasite response can have multiple effects on infectious organisms and on microbiota that the host is harbouring. It has been shown that Th1 responses induced by T. muris can affect progression of bowel inflammation, cause colitic-like intestinal inflammation, reduce barrier function and intestinal mucosal responses. In the brain, T. muris can exacerbate stroke outcome and other neurological conditions. In the lung, T. muris can suppress airway inflammation and alter immune responses to other parasites. Additionally, T. muris induced responses can inhibit anti-tumour immunity. Although this parasite maintains a localized niche in the large intestine, its effects can be far-reaching and substantially impact other infections through modulation of bystander immune responses.
