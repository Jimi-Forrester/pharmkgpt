36278356|t|Amyloid PET: A Questionable Single Primary Surrogate Efficacy Measure on Alzheimer Immunotherapy Trials.
36278356|a|Using amyloid PET imaging as a single primary surrogate efficacy measure in Alzheimer's disease immunotherapy trials, as happened when the FDA granted accelerated approval of aducanumab, is unjustified. In vivo evidence indicates that PET quantification of amyloid deposition is distorted and misrepresents effects of anti-amyloid treatments due to lack of specificity of the PET imaging probe, effects of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, spill-over from high white matter signals, and questionable quantification models. Before granting approval to other immunotherapy candidates, the FDA should require rigorous evidence of all imaging claims and irrefutable documentation that proposed treatments are clinically effective and harmless to patients.
