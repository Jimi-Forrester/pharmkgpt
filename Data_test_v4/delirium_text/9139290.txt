9139290|a|Geriatric patients are subject to mental disorders that are due to the physiologic effects of medical illness or are substance induced. Elders are at increased risk for such syndromes because of the higher rates of physical illnesses and resultant polypharmacy as well as aging-related susceptibility to disruption of brain functioning. This article reviews psychiatric syndromes that are due to general medical conditions or are substance induced, focusing on the more common, acute conditions of delirium and psychotic, mood, and anxiety disorders that are due to general medical conditions. The ultimate goal of patient care must be accurate diagnosis with resultant optimal, appropriate treatment and improvement in functioning leading to the better well-being of the elderly patient.
