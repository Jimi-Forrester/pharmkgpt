33255603|a|Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is an acute neurological disorder resulting from thiamine deficiency, commonly found in alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients. Liver transplantation (LT) could represent a risk factor for the onset of WE in AUD patients, due to the onset of chronic depletion of thiamine in this population and the high metabolic demand of surgery and the postoperative period. However, few data are available about the risk of the onset of WE in AUD patients after LT. Here we report three cases of AUD patients who developed WE with confusion and delirium after LT. Prompt parenteral administration of thiamine led to a rapid improvement of the clinical condition and a complete remission of neurological symptoms after 3-4 days. In addition, a search of the available English literature was conducted in order to perform a review of the possible association between the onset of WE and LT in AUD patients. A prophylactic treatment regimen based on the administration of thiamine could be suggested in AUD patients before and after LT. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal regimen of thiamine in the prevention of WE in this setting.
