30102630|a|BACKGROUND: Antipsychotics (APs) are known to exacerbate symptoms of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and may even cause urinary retention. The anticholinergic effects of APs and their dopamine D2- and alpha-receptor blockade may lead to voiding dysfunction of BPH patients. The objective of our study was to investigate whether the use of APs is associated with an increased risk of initiating medication for BPH in men with Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: Data from the nationwide MEDALZ (MEDication use and ALZheimer's disease) cohort, including all community-dwelling persons diagnosed with AD in Finland, were utilized. Register-based data included medication dispensing, comorbidities, and hospital discharge diagnoses. Men who initiated APs (n = 4579) were 1:1 matched with men who did not initiate APs (n = 4579), according to time since AD diagnoses and age. The risk of starting BPH medication was investigated with Cox regression. RESULTS: Among AP users, BPH medication was initiated to 345 persons (7.5%). Antipsychotic use was not associated with risk of initiating BPH medication (comorbidity-adjusted hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-1.15) compared with no use of APs. In addition, no risk was found when AP drug substances were analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS: Use of APs did not increase the risk of initiating medication for BPH in men with AD.
