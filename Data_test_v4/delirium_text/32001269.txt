32001269|t|Progesterone attenuates Abeta25-35-induced neuronal toxicity by activating the Ras signalling pathway through progesterone receptor membrane component 1.
32001269|a|AIMS: Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) has been reported to mediate the neuroprotective effect of progesterone, but the exact mechanism has not been elucidated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the signalling pathway downstream of PGRMC1 in progesterone-induced neuroprotection. Recognition of the mechanism of progesterone opens novel perspectives for the treatment of diseases of the nervous system. MAIN METHODS: The PGRMC1 protein level was knocked down in rat primary cortical neurons, and Abeta25-35 was used to establish an Alzheimer's disease cell model. The neuroprotective effect of progesterone was assessed by Hoechst 33258 staining and a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Then, proteomic and bioinformatic methods were used to analyse the proteins altered in response to PGRMC1 silencing to identify target proteins and signalling pathways involved in PGRMC1-mediated progesterone-induced neuroprotection. These findings were further verified by using signalling pathway inhibitors and western blotting. KEY FINDINGS: The neuroprotective effect of progesterone was significantly attenuated with PGRMC1 silencing. The expression of many proteins in the Ras signalling pathway was significantly changed in response to PGRMC1 silencing. FTI-277 inhibited progesterone-induced neuroprotection. Progesterone increased the expression of total Ras and Grb2. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings provide new perspectives for understanding the mechanism of and role of PGRMC1 in progesterone-induced neuroprotection. The Ras signalling pathway is the signalling pathway downstream of PGRMC1 in the mediation of progesterone-induced neuroprotection.
