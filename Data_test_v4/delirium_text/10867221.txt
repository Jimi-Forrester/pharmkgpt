10867221|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular dementia (CVD) are two major causes of senile dementia in elderly individuals. Mounting evidence from epidemiological, clinical, and neuropathological studies suggests that there is considerable overlap between AD and CVD with respect to risk factors, prevalence, and pathological changes. Although our lack of understanding on the important contribution of vascular disturbance to pathogenesis of AD has further hindered our understanding of AD, data on the roles of cerebrovascular diseases and systemic vascular diseases in AD need to be carefully analyzed to avoid misinterpretation. Here, we review studies on the cerebral vasculature, cardiac vasculature, and apoE that lead us to contend that vascular abnormalities are likely an important mechanism underlying dementia. Because early and aggressive intervention is available to prevent and treat a number of vascular diseases, therapies that attenuate vascular risk factors could be valuable in preventing and treating AD.
