33193379|t|The Roles of H19 in Regulating Inflammation and Aging.
33193379|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that long non-coding RNA H19 correlates with several aging processes. However, the role of H19 in aging remains unclear. Many studies have elucidated a close connection between H19 and inflammatory genes. Chronic systemic inflammation is an established factor associated with various diseases during aging. Thus, H19 might participate in the development of age-related diseases by interplay with inflammation and therefore provide a protective function against age-related diseases. We investigated the inflammatory gene network of H19 to understand its regulatory mechanisms. H19 usually controls gene expression by acting as a microRNA sponge, or through mir-675, or by leading various protein complexes to genes at the chromosome level. The regulatory gene network has been intensively studied, whereas the biogenesis of H19 remains largely unknown. This literature review found that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and an imprinting gene network (IGN) might link H19 with inflammation. Evidence indicates that EMT and IGN are also tightly controlled by environmental stress. We propose that H19 is a stress-induced long non-coding RNA. Because environmental stress is a recognized age-related factor, inflammation and H19 might serve as a therapeutic axis to fight against age-related diseases.
