38540208|t|The Iron Metabolism with a Specific Focus on the Functioning of the Nervous System.
38540208|a|Iron is the micronutrient with the best-studied biological functions. It is widely distributed in nature, and its involvement in the main metabolic pathways determines the great importance of this metal for all organisms. Iron is required for cellular respiration and various biochemical processes that ensure the proper functioning of cells and organs in the human body, including the brain. Iron also plays an important role in the production of free radicals, which can be beneficial or harmful to cells under various conditions. Reviews of iron metabolism and its regulation can be found in the literature, and further advances in understanding the molecular basis of iron metabolism are being made every year. The aim of this review is to systematise the available data on the role of iron in the function of the nervous system, especially in the brain. The review summarises recent views on iron metabolism and its regulatory mechanisms in humans, including the essential action of hepcidin. Special attention is given to the mechanisms of iron absorption in the small intestine and the purpose of this small but critically important pool of iron in the brain.
