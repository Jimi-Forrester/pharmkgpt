3281669|a|Hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis in patients of Dutch origin is an autosomal-dominant type of amyloidosis restricted to the small vasculature of the brain and clinically characterized by recurrent strokes. Amyloid fibrils from the leptomeninges of two patients were isolated and the primary structure determined. The complete sequence of the amyloid protein shows homology to the vascular (beta-protein) and plaque amyloid (A4-protein) obtained from Alzheimer's Disease. However, it is three residues shorter (39 instead of 42) than that reported for the plaque amyloid. The difference at the carboxy terminal may reflect specific degradation that occurs in the vessel wall and not in the brain parenchyma.
