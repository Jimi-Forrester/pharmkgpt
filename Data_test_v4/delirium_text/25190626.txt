25190626|a|Metabolic dysfunction exacerbates Alzheimer's disease (AD) incidence and progression. Here we report that activation of the AMPK pathway, a common target in the management of diabetes, results in gender-divergent cognitive effects in a murine model of the disease. Specifically, our results show that activation of AMPK increases memory dysfunction in males but is protective in females, suggesting that gender considerations may constitute an important factor in medical intervention of diabetes as well as AD.
