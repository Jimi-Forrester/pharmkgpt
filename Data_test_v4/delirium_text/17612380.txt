17612380|a|OBJECTIVE: Aluminium has lately been implicated as one of the possible causal factors contributing to Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders due to this metal is conducive to oxidative stress in the brain. According to different researches, it has been suggested that silicon may interfere in the toxico-kinetic of this metal. The present study has examined the effect of beer consumption as a source of silicon on the bioavailability of aluminium and the possible role of beer consumption in averting aluminium's neurotoxicity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a three-day study, male mice were subjected to acute exposure to aluminium while being given two types of beer, i.e., alcoholic and non-alcoholic beer, to drink at two intake levels, one equivalent to moderate to low consumption in humans (0.5 l/d; 27.5 g alcohol/d) and another equivalent to moderate to high consumption in humans (1 l/d; 55 g alcohol/day). Aluminium and silicon were determined by ICP-MS and ICP-OES, respectively. RESULTS: The results obtained seem indicate that at moderately high levels of alcoholic beer intake the silicon present in the beer was able to reduce aluminium uptake in the digestive tract, increasing its excretion by faecal route. In addition, a possible interaction of both elements at level of distribution and renal excretion is suggested. CONCLUSION: In consequence, moderate beer consumption, possibly affording a protective factor for the toxic effect of aluminium, one of the environmental factors for Alzheimer's disease.
