30632503|t|Expression signatures of long non-coding RNA and mRNA in human traumatic brain injury.
30632503|a|Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a key role in craniocerebral disease, although their expression profiles in human traumatic brain injury are still unclear. In this regard, in this study, we examined brain injury tissue from three patients of the 101st Hospital of the People's Liberation Army, China (specifically, a 36-year-old male, a 52-year-old female, and a 49-year-old female), who were diagnosed with traumatic brain injury and underwent brain contusion removal surgery. Tissue surrounding the brain contusion in the three patients was used as control tissue to observe expression characteristics of lncRNAs and mRNAs in human traumatic brain injury tissue. Volcano plot filtering identified 99 lncRNAs and 63 mRNAs differentially expressed in frontotemporal tissue of the two groups (P < 0.05, fold change > 1.2). Microarray analysis showed that 43 lncRNAs were up-regulated and 56 lncRNAs were down-regulated. Meanwhile, 59 mRNAs were up-regulated and 4 mRNAs were down-regulated. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses revealed 27 signaling pathways associated with target genes and, in particular, legionellosis and influenza A signaling pathways. Subsequently, a lncRNA-gene network was generated, which showed an absolute correlation coefficient value > 0.99 for 12 lncRNA-mRNA pairs. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed different expression of the five most up-regulated mRNAs within the two groups, which was consistent with the microarray results. In summary, our results show that expression profiles of mRNAs and lncRNAs are significantly different between human traumatic brain injury tissue and surrounding tissue, providing novel insight regarding lncRNAs' involvement in human traumatic brain injury. All participants provided informed consent. This research was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR-TCC-13004002) and the protocol version number is 1.0.
