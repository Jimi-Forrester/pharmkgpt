37945652|a|We recently reported accelerated cognitive decline in Europeans aged > 70 years with low circulating adropin levels. Adropin is a small, secreted peptide that is highly expressed in the human nervous system. Expression profiling indicate relationships between adropin expression in the human brain and pathways that affect dementia risk. Moreover, increased adropin expression or treatment using synthetic adropin improves cognition in mouse models of aging. Here we report that low circulating adropin concentrations associate with poor cognition (worst quintile for a composite score derived from the MMSE and semantic fluency test) in late-middle aged community-dwelling African Americans (OR = 0.775, P < 0.05; age range 45-65 y, n = 352). The binomial logistic regression controlled for sex, age, education, cardiometabolic disease risk indicators, and obesity. Previous studies using cultured cells from the brains of human donors suggest high expression in astrocytes. In snRNA-seq data from the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) of human donors, adropin expression is higher in astrocytes relative to other cell types. Adropin expression in all cell-types declines with advance age, but is not affected by dementia status. In cultured human astrocytes, adropin expression also declines with donor age. Additional analysis indicated positive correlations between adropin and transcriptomic signatures of energy metabolism and protein synthesis that are adversely affected by donor age. Adropin expression is also suppressed by pro-inflammatory factors. Collectively, these data indicate low circulating adropin levels are a potential early risk indicator of cognitive impairment. Declining adropin expression in the brain is a plausible link between aging, neuroinflammation, and risk of cognitive decline.
