36612066|t|Endosomal Sorting Protein SNX27 and Its Emerging Roles in Human Cancers.
36612066|a|SNX27 belongs to the sorting nexin (SNX) family of proteins that play a critical role in protein sorting and trafficking in the endocytosis pathway. This protein family is characterized by the presence of a Phox (PX) domain; however, SNX27 is unique in containing an additional PDZ domain. Recently, SNX27 has gained popularity as an important sorting protein that is associated with the retromer complex and mediates the recycling of internalized proteins from endosomes to the plasma membrane in a PDZ domain-dependent manner. Over 100 cell surface proteins have been identified as binding partners of the SNX27-retromer complex. However, the roles and underlying mechanisms governed by SNX27 in tumorigenesis remains to be poorly understood. Many of its known binding partners include several G-protein coupled receptors, such as beta2-andrenergic receptor and parathyroid hormone receptor, are associated with multiple pathways implicated in oncogenic signaling and tumorigenesis. Additionally, SNX27 mediates the recycling of GLUT1 and the activation of mTORC1, both of which can regulate intracellular energy balance and promote cell survival and proliferation under conditions of nutrient deprivation. In this review, we summarize the structure and fundamental roles of SNX proteins, with a focus on SNX27, and provide the current evidence indicating towards the role of SNX27 in human cancers. We also discuss the gap in the field and future direction of SNX27 research. Insights into the emerging roles and mechanism of SNX27 in cancers will provide better development strategies to prevent and treat tumorigenesis.
