38710218|t|Neuropathic pain in cats: Mechanisms and multimodal management.
38710218|a|PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: Chronic pain is a significant welfare concern in cats, and neuropathic pain, which arises from aberrant processing of sensory signals within the nervous system, is a subcategory of this type of pain. To comprehend this condition and how multimodal pharmacotherapy plays a central role in alleviating discomfort, it is crucial to delve into the anatomy of nociception and pain perception. In addition, there is an intricate interplay between emotional health and chronic pain in cats, and understanding and addressing the emotional factors that contribute to pain perception, and vice versa, is essential for comprehensive care.Clinical approach:Neuropathic pain is suspected if there is abnormal sensation in the area of the distribution of pain, together with a positive response to trial treatment with drugs effective for neuropathic pain. Ideally, this clinical suspicion would be supported by confirmation of a lesion at this neurolocalisation using diagnostic modalities such as MRI and neuroelectrophysiology. Alternatively, there may be a history of known trauma at that site. A variety of therapies, including analgesic, anti-inflammatory and adjuvant drugs, and neuromodulation (eg, TENS or acupuncture), can be employed to address different facets of pain pathways.Aim:This review article, aimed at primary care/ general practitioners, focuses on the identification and management of neuropathic pain in cats. Three case vignettes are included and a structured treatment algorithm is presented to guide veterinarians in tailoring interventions.Evidence base:The review draws on current literature, where available, along with the author's extensive experience and research.
