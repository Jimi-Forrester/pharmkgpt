28762175|a|Mutations in genes that encode RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have emerged as critical determinants of neurological diseases, especially motor neuron disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). RBPs are involved in all aspects of RNA processing, controlling the life cycle of RNAs from synthesis to degradation. Hallmark features of RBPs in neuron dysfunction include misregulation of RNA processing, mislocalization of RBPs to the cytoplasm, and abnormal aggregation of RBPs. Much progress has been made in understanding how ALS-associated mutations in RBPs drive pathogenesis. Here, we focus on several key RBPs involved in ALS-TDP-43, HNRNP A2/B1, HNRNP A1, FUS, EWSR1, and TAF15-and review our current understanding of how mutations in these proteins cause disease.
