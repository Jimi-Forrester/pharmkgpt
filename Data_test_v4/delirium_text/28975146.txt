28975146|a|INTRODUCTION: The plasma concentration of beta-amyloid (Abeta) has been considered another biomarker of Alzheimer's disease and was reportedly associated with cortical Abeta accumulation. METHODS: We analyzed 28 subjects with apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4; E4 group) and 89 subjects without ApoE4 (non-E4 group) to determine the association between cortical Abeta accumulation by standard uptake value ratio with [18F]florbetapir positron emission tomography and plasma Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42. RESULTS: Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 correlated significantly with mean regional [18F]florbetapir standard uptake value ratio in the non-E4 group (R2 = 0.06, P = .02) but not in the E4 group, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 in the non-E4 group showed sensitivity (92.9%) and specificity (45.9%) with a cutoff value of 0.150 for Abeta positivity. DISCUSSION: We verified that the correlation between Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 and Abeta accumulation differed according to ApoE phenotype. The high sensitivity of plasma Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 for Abeta positivity in non-E4 subjects indicated a possible role of plasma Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 as a screening biomarker before amyloid positron emission tomography in clinical settings.
