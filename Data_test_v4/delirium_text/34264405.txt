34264405|a|BACKGROUND: Actinomycetes associated with marine sponge represent a promising source of bioactive compounds. Herein, we report the isolation, identification, and bioactivity evaluation of Streptomyces sp. NMF6 associated with the marine sponge Diacarnus ardoukobae. RESULTS: Results showed that the strain belonged to the genus Streptomyces, and it was designated as Streptomyces sp. NMF6 with the GenBank accession number MW015111. Ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract of the strain NMF6 demonstrated a promising antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Vibrio damsela, and Candida albicans and a strong antioxidant activity, which were confirmed by DPPH, ferric-reducing power, and phosphomolybdenum assays; results are expressed as ascorbic acid equivalents. NMF6 extract also demonstrated cytotoxicity against breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Hep-G2), and human colon carcinoma cell line (HCT-116); the selectivity index values were < 2. The extract showed promising antiviral activity against HSV-1, CoxB4, and hepatitis A viruses at concentrations that were nontoxic to the host cells, with the selectivity index values being 13.25, 9.42, and 8.25, respectively. GC-MS analysis of the extract showed the presence of 20 compounds, with bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate being the major component (48%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the marine sponge-associated Streptomyces sp. NMF6 strain is a potential source of bioactive compounds that could be developed into therapeutic agents.
