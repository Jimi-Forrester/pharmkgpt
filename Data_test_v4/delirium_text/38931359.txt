38931359|t|Harnessing the Power of Polyphenols: A New Frontier in Disease Prevention and Therapy.
38931359|a|There are a wide variety of phytochemicals collectively known as polyphenols. Their structural diversity results in a broad range of characteristics and biological effects. Polyphenols can be found in a variety of foods and drinks, including fruits, cereals, tea, and coffee. Studies both in vitro and in vivo, as well as clinical trials, have shown that they possess potent antioxidant activities, numerous therapeutic effects, and health advantages. Dietary polyphenols have demonstrated the potential to prevent many health problems, including obesity, atherosclerosis, high blood sugar, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and neurological diseases. In this paper, the protective effects of polyphenols and the mechanisms behind them are investigated in detail, citing the most recent available literature. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on the role of polyphenols in preventing and managing chronic diseases. The cited publications are derived from in vitro, in vivo, and human-based studies and clinical trials. A more complete understanding of these naturally occurring metabolites will pave the way for the development of novel polyphenol-rich diet and drug development programs. This, in turn, provides further evidence of their health benefits.
