17245616|a|Gliotransmission is a process in which astrocytes are dynamic elements that influence synaptic transmission and synaptogenesis. The best-known gliotransmitters are glutamate and ATP. However, in the past decade, it has been demonstrated that D-serine, a D-amino acid, acts as a gliotransmitter in glutamatergic synapses. The physiological relevance of D-serine is sustained by the way in which it modulates the action of glutamatergic neurotransmission, neuronal migration and long-term potentiation (LTP). In addition, the synthesis and degradation mechanisms of D-serine have been proposed as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and related disorders. In the present review, detailed information is provided about the physiological and physiopathological relevance of D-serine, including metabolic and regulation aspects.
