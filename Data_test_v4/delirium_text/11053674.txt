11053674|t|Modeling Alzheimer's disease in transgenic mice: effect of age and of presenilin1 on amyloid biochemistry and pathology in APP/London mice.
11053674|a|In transgenic mice that overexpress mutant Amyloid Precursor Protein [V717I], or APP/London (APP/Lo) (1999a. Early phenotypic changes in transgenic mice that overexpress different mutants of Amyloid Precursor Protein in brain. J. Biol. Chem. 274, 6483-6492; 1999b. Premature death in transgenic mice that overexpress mutant Amyloid precursor protein is preceded by severe neurodegeneration and apoptosis. Neuroscience 91, 819-830) the AD related phenotype of plaque and vascular amyloid pathology is late (12-15 months). This typical and diagnostic pathology is thereby dissociated in time from early symptoms (3-9 months) that include disturbed behavior, neophobia, aggression, glutamate excitotoxicity, defective cognition and decreased LTP. The APP/Lo transgenic mice are therefore a very interesting model to study early as well as late pathology, including the effect of age. In ageing APP*Lo mice, brain soluble and especially "insoluble" amyloid peptides dramatically increased, while normalized levels of secreted APPsalpha and APPsbeta, as well as cell-bound beta-C-stubs, remained remarkably constant, indicating normal alpha- and beta-secretase processing of APP. In double transgenic mice, i.e. APP/LoxPS1, clinical mutant PS1[A246E] but not wild-type human PS1 increased Abeta, and plaques and vascular amyloid developed at age 6-9 months. The PS1 mutant caused increasing Abeta42 production, while ageing did not. Amyloid deposits are thus formed, not by overproduction of Abeta, but by lack of clearance and/or degradation in the brain of ageing APP/Lo transgenic mice. The clearance pathways of the cerebral amyloid peptides are therefore valuable targets for fundamental research and for therapeutic potential. Although hyper-phosphorylated protein tau was evident in swollen neurites around the amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary pathology is not observed and the "tangle" aspect of AD pathology is therefore still missing from all current transgenic "amyloid" models. Also the "ApoE4" risk for late onset AD remains a problem for modeling in transgenic mice. We have generated transgenic mice that overexpress human ApoE4 (2000. Expression of Human Apolipoprotein E4 in neurons causes hyperphosphorylation of Protein tau in the brains of transgenic mice. Am. J. Pathol. 156 (3) 951-964) or human protein tau (1999. Prominent axonopathy in the brain and spinal cord of transgenic mice overexpressing four-repeat human tau protein. Am. J. Pathol. 155, 2153-2165) in their neurons. Both develop a similar although not identical axonopathy, with progressive degeneration of nerves and with muscle wasting resulting in motoric problems. Remarkably, ApoE4 transgenic mice are, like the tau transgenic mice, characterized by progressive hyper-phosphorylation of protein tau also in motor neurons which explains the motoric defects. Further crossing with the APP/Lo transgenic mice is ongoing to yield "multiple" transgenic mouse strains to study new aspects of amyloid and tau pathology.
