34244459|t|Regulation and functional consequences of mGlu4 RNA editing.
34244459|a|Metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGlu4) is one of eight mGlu receptors within the Class C G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. mGlu4 is primarily localized to the presynaptic membrane of neurons where it functions as an auto and heteroreceptor controlling synaptic release of neurotransmitter. mGlu4 is implicated in numerous disorders and is a promising drug target; however, more remains to be understood about its regulation and pharmacology. Using high-throughput sequencing, we have validated and quantified an adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing event that converts glutamine 124 to arginine in mGlu4; additionally, we have identified a rare but novel K129R site. Using an in vitro editing assay, we then validated the pre-mRNA duplex that allows for editing by ADAR enzymes and predicted its conservation across the mammalian species. Structural modeling of the mGlu4 protein predicts the Q124R substitution to occur in the B helix of the receptor that is critical for receptor dimerization and activation. Interestingly, editing of a receptor homodimer does not disrupt G protein activation in response to the endogenous agonist, glutamate. Using an assay designed to specifically measure heterodimer populations at the surface, however, we found that Q124R substitution decreased the propensity of mGlu4 to heterodimerize with mGlu2 and mGlu7 Our study is the first to extensively describe the extent and regulatory factors of RNA editing of mGlu4 mRNA transcripts. In addition, we have proposed a novel functional consequence of this editing event that provides insights regarding its effects in vivo and expands the regulatory capacity for mGlu receptors.
