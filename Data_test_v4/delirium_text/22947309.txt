22947309|t|Do Alzheimer-specific microstructural changes in mild cognitive impairment predict conversion?
22947309|a|Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that provides information on the fiber architecture of the brain by measuring water diffusion. Prior work has shown that neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) alters this architecture. Since the conversion rate to AD is much higher for MCI patients than for normal healthy people, it is important to identify biomarkers with a predictive value on this conversion. In this study, we applied tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) on datasets of 15 healthy controls, 15 AD patients, and 17 MCI patients. Of these MCI patients eight remained stable, whereas nine developed AD within the first 12-18 months of follow-up investigations. Analysis using TBSS combined with a maximum likelihood regression with random effects of the fornix, the corpus callosum, and the cingulum identified significant differences between these two types of MCI patients in fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (DR). Thus, DTI reveals Alzheimer-specific changes in those MCI subjects that later convert, although they were clinically identical to the other MCI-patients at the time the data were acquired. This finding could lead to early identification of AD and thereby aid early clinical intervention.
