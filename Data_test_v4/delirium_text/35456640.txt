35456640|a|This study aimed to design a hybrid oral liposomal delivery system for selenium nanoparticles (Lip-SeNPs) to improve the bioavailability of selenium. Thiolated chitosan, a multifunctional polymer with mucoadhesive properties, was used for surface functionalization of Lip-SeNPs. Selenium nanoparticle (SeNP)-loaded liposomes were manufactured by a single step microfluidics-assisted chemical reduction and assembling process. Subsequently, chitosan-N-acetylcysteine was covalently conjugated to the preformed Lip-SeNPs. The Lip-SeNPs were characterized in terms of composition, morphology, size, zeta potential, lipid organization, loading efficiency and radical scavenging activity. A co-culture system (Caco-2:HT29-MTX) that integrates mucus secreting and enterocyte-like cell types was used as a model of the human intestinal epithelium to determine adsorption, mucus penetration, release and transport properties of Lip-SeNPs in vitro. Thiolated Lip-SeNPs were positively charged with an average size of about 250 nm. Thiolated Lip-SeNPs tightly adhered to the mucus layer without penetrating the enterocytes. This finding was consistent with ex vivo adsorption studies using freshly excised porcine small intestinal tissues. Due to the improved mucoadhesion and retention in a simulated microenvironment of the small intestine, thiolated Lip-SeNPs might be a promising tool for oral selenium delivery.
