33197702|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Recognition and documentation of delirium is a challenge in the hospital. Education programs lack standardized screening tools. The presence of dementia or depression contribute to poor recognition of delirium. Many front-line healthcare workers attribute delirium to dementia, often misidentifying or delaying a correct diagnosis and in turn, treatment. Unrecognized and untreated delirium is costly. Non-pharmacologic interventions improve patient outcomes and decrease costs. Without delirium education, nurses are vulnerable to injury and low job satisfaction when caring for delirious patients. We describe an education program improving recognition and attitudes towards patients experiencing delirium. DESIGN: An education program about screening, documenting, and treating delirium. SETTING: A large Veterans Health System Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare professionals(n = 389) participated in the education program. 355 Nurses and patient-care assistants took the pre and post-test, and 43 returned the post program follow-up survey. A delirium education program with three steps; 1) self-directed online module; 2) dementia simulation experience; and 3) a multi-station delirium skills fair. Pre and post-tests were conducted after step 2, as well as a four-month follow-up survey. MEASUREMENTS: Changes in attitude toward patients with cognitive impairment and their abilities. Self-assessment of attitudes toward patients with delirium. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in pre and post-testing suggested increased understanding of the experience and abilities of people experiencing cognitive impairment . The four-month follow-up survey showed a continued understanding of the importance of recognizing, documenting, and treating delirium. CONCLUSION: Nursing Education about delirium that includes instruction on a standardized screening tool, documentation, and non-pharmacologic interventions improved knowledge and recognition of delirium and may have changed attitudes surrounding delirium in the hospital.
