34455354|a|BACKGROUND: Few studies have highlighted multiple psychosocial and physical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection after recovery. However, the data from developing countries is limited. AIM: To evaluate psychological morbidity, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), fatigue, and perceived stigma among patients with COVID-19 after recovery from the acute phase of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In a cross-sectional online survey, 206 adult patients (age>18 years), recovered from COVID-19 infection completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), 4 items self-designed questionnaire evaluating cognitive deficits and self-designed questionnaire to evaluate perceived stigma. Additionally, they completed the information about demographic and clinical information. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and PTSD in the study sample was 24.8 %, 23.8 %, and 30 % respectively. About three-fifths of the participants (61.2 %) had at least one fatigue symptom as per the FSS with the mean FSS score being 32.10 +- 15.28. About one-fourth of the participants (23.7 %) reported "feeling confused and always feeling mentally foggy", and 38 % of patients reported experiencing at least one cognitive problem. The level of felt stigma related to self was seen in 31.1 %, 20 % reported stigma related to family, and 50 % reported stigma in relation to neighbors and society. Those reporting higher PTSD scores had higher anxiety and depressive scores, reported more fatigue and stigma, and had a higher level of cognitive deficits. A higher fatigue score was also associated with higher anxiety, depression, and cognitive deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that a significant proportion of patients after recovery from COVID-19 experience psychological morbidities, fatigue, cognitive problems, and stigma. Efforts should be made to take care of these issues in routine post-COVID follow-up care.
