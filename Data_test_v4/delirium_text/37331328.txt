37331328|a|Despite the recent advances in dialysis technology, mortality rate of chronic uremic patients still remains excessively high: of note, in comparison to age- and sex-matched healthy controls, this frail population shows a higher incidence of infections, cancer, cognitive decline, and, in particular, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) that represent nowadays the first cause of mortality. Several traditional and nontraditional factors contribute to this increased risk for MACE and accelerated cellular senescence: among these, inflammation has been shown to play a key role. The costimulatory pathway CD40-CD40 Ligand (CD40L) is harmfully activated during inflammation and uremia-associated clinical complications: in particular, the soluble form of CD40L (sCD40L) can bind to the CD40 receptor triggering a cascade of detrimental pathways in immune and nonimmune cells. In this narrative review, we summarize the current concepts of the biological role of the CD40-CD40L pathway in uremia-associated organ dysfunction, focusing on the above-described main causes of mortality. Moreover, we discuss the interaction of the CD40-CD40L pathway with extracellular vesicles, microparticles recently identified as new uremic toxins. The biological effects of sCD40L in MACE, cognitive decline, infections, and cancer will be also briefly commented. Last, based on recent studies and ongoing clinical trials, we herein describe the modulatory activity of adsorptive dialysis membranes in polymethylmethacrylate on CD40-CD40L detrimental activation.
