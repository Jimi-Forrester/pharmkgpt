34208020|a|Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a widespread neurotropic virus establishing a life-long latent infection in neurons with periodic reactivations. Recent studies linked HSV-1 to neurodegenerative processes related to age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Here, we explored whether recurrent HSV-1 infection might accelerate aging in neurons, focusing on peculiar marks of aged cells, such as the increase in histone H4 lysine (K) 16 acetylation (ac) (H4K16ac); the decrease of H3K56ac, and the modified expression of Sin3/HDAC1 and HIRA proteins. By exploiting both in vitro and in vivo models of recurrent HSV-1 infection, we found a significant increase in H4K16ac, Sin3, and HDAC1 levels, suggesting that the neuronal response to virus latency and reactivation includes the upregulation of these aging markers. On the contrary, we found a significant decrease in H3K56ac that was specifically linked to viral reactivation and apparently not related to aging-related markers. A complex modulation of HIRA expression and localization was found in the brain from HSV-1 infected mice suggesting a specific role of this protein in viral latency and reactivation. Overall, our results pointed out novel molecular mechanisms through which recurrent HSV-1 infection may affect neuronal aging, likely contributing to neurodegeneration.
