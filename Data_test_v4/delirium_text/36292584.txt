36292584|t|Melatonin Function and Crosstalk with Other Phytohormones under Normal and Stressful Conditions.
36292584|a|Melatonin was discovered in plants in the late nineties, but its role, signaling, and crosstalk with other phytohormones remain unknown. Research on melatonin in plants has risen dramatically in recent years and the role of this putative plant hormone under biotic and abiotic stress conditions has been reported. In the present review, we discuss the main functions of melatonin in the growth and development of plants, its role under abiotic stresses, such as water stress (waterlogging and drought), extreme temperature (low and high), salinity, heavy metal, and light-induced stress. Similarly, we also discuss the role of melatonin under biotic stresses (antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal effects). Moreover, the present review meticulously discusses the crosstalk of melatonin with other phytohormones such as auxins, gibberellic acids, cytokinins, ethylene, and salicylic acid under normal and stressful conditions and reports melatonin receptors and signaling in plants. All these aspects of melatonin suggest that phytomelatonin is a key player in crop improvement and biotic and abiotic stress regulation.
