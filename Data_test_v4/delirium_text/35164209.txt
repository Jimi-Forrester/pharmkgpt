35164209|a|Protein aggregation and amyloidogenesis have been associated with several neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's etc. Unfortunately, there are still no proper drugs and no effective treatment available. Due to the unique properties of noble metallic nanoparticles, they have been used in diverse fields of biomedicine like drug designing, drug delivery, tumour targeting, bio-sensing, tissue engineering etc. Small-sized silver nanoparticles have been reported to have anti-biotic, anti-cancer and anti-viral activities apart from their cytotoxic effects. The current study was carried out in a carefully designed in-vitro to observe the anti-amyloidogenic and inhibitory effects of biologically synthesized green silver nanoparticles (B-AgNPs) on human serum albumin (HSA) aggregation taken as a model protein. We have used different biophysical assays like thioflavin T (ThT), 8-Anilino-1-naphthalene-sulphonic acid (ANS), Far-UV CD etc. to analyze protein aggregation and aggregation inhibition in vitro. It has been observed that the synthesized fluorescent B-AgNPs showed inhibitory effects on protein aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner reaching a plateau, after which the effect of aggregation inhibition was significantly declined. We also observed meaningful chaperone-like aggregation-inhibition activities of as-synthesized florescent B-AgNPs in astrocytes.
