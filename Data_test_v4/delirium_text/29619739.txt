29619739|a|The critical pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta), the main constituent of amyloid plaques. beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) undergoes amyloidogenic cleavage by beta- and gamma-secretase generating Abeta at endosomes or non-amyloidogenic processing by alpha-secretase precluding the production of Abeta at the plasma membrane. Recently, several natural products have been widely researched on the prevention of Abeta accumulation for AD treatment. We previously reported that Lycoris chejuensis K. Tae et S. Ko (CJ), which originated from Jeju Island in Korea, improved the disrupted memory functions and reduced Abeta production in vivo. Here, we further explored the effect of its active component, 7-deoxy-trans-dihydronarciclasine (coded as E144), on Abeta generation and the underlying mechanism. Our results showed that E144 reduced the level of APP, especially its mature form, in HeLa cells overexpressing human APP with the Swedish mutation. Concomitantly, E144 decreased the levels of Abeta, sAPPbeta, sAPPalpha, and C-terminal fragment. In addition, administration of E144 normalized the behavioral deficits in Tg2576 mice, an APP transgenic mouse model of AD. E144 also decreased the Abeta and APP levels in the cerebral cortex of Tg2576 mice. Thus, we propose that E144 could be a potential drug candidate for an anti-amyloid disease-modifying AD therapy.
