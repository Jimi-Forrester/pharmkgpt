33240076|a|Recent research regards the electroencephalogram (EEG) as a promising method to study real-time brain dynamic changes in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but a deeper understanding is needed to discern coincident pathophysiology, patterns of changes, and diagnosis. This review summarized recent research on EEG characterization related to the cognitive and motor functions in PD patients and discussed its potential to be used as diagnostic biomarkers. Thirty papers out of 220 published from 2010 to 2020 were reviewed. Movement abnormalities and cognitive decline are related to changes in EEG spectrum and event-related potentials (ERPs) during typical oddball paradigms and/or combined motor tasks. Abnormalities in beta and delta frequency bands are, respectively the main manifestation of dyskinesia and cognitive decline in PD. The review showed that PD patients have noteworthy changes in specific EEG characterizations, however, the underlying mechanism of the interrelation between gait and cognitive is still unclear. Understanding the specific nature of the relationship is essential for development of novel invasive clinical diagnostic and therapeutic methods.
