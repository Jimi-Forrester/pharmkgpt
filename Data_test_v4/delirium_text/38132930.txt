38132930|t|Therapeutic Potential of Marine-Derived Cyclic Peptides as Antiparasitic Agents.
38132930|a|Parasitic diseases still compromise human health. Some of the currently available therapeutic drugs have limitations considering their adverse effects, questionable efficacy, and long treatment, which have encouraged drug resistance. There is an urgent need to find new, safe, effective, and affordable antiparasitic drugs. Marine-derived cyclic peptides have been increasingly screened as candidates for developing new drugs. Therefore, in this review, a systematic analysis of the scientific literature was performed and 25 marine-derived cyclic peptides with antiparasitic activity (1-25) were found. Antimalarial activity is the most reported (51%), followed by antileishmanial (27%) and antitrypanosomal (20%) activities. Some compounds showed promising antiparasitic activity at the nM scale, being active against various parasites. The mechanisms of action and targets for some of the compounds have been investigated, revealing different strategies against parasites.
