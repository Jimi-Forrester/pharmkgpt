38860660|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) pose significant challenges for Indigenous populations, necessitating urgent research. Limited evidence suggests that high rates of ADRD among Indigenous peoples are associated with social determinants of health (SDOH), such as education, income, health literacy, religion, and social engagement. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Collaborating with a Northern Plains tribe, participants were recruited 123 self-identified Indigenous women aged 40-70 through a comprehensive recruitment strategy. Employing the SDOH framework, the research assessed cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease knowledge (ADK), utilizing the Ascertain Dementia 8 and Alzheimer's disease knowledge scales (ADK-30). The investigation examined the relationships between selected SDOH variables and cognitive impairment status. RESULTS: More than half of the participants showed signs of cognitive impairment, which correlated with lower income and education levels. Increased knowledge about Alzheimer's disease, particularly in terms of treatment management and its life impact subscales, was associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment. Conversely, higher levels of depressive symptoms and participation in religious activities were linked to increased odds of cognitive impairment. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings underscore the importance of culturally grounded tools and SDOH frameworks tailored to Indigenous contexts in addressing ADRD disparities. Future research should integrate historical and cultural factors to advance health equity within Indigenous communities, ultimately mitigating the impact of ADRD and promoting overall well-being.
