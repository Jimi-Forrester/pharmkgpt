38807220|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common neurologic disorder among elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery, which leads to various negative outcomes. Sleep disorder is considered an important cause of POD. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the Chinese traditional five-element music intervention could reduce POD by improving sleep quality in elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. METHODS: A total of 132 patients aged 65 to 90 years who underwent non-cardiac surgery were randomized to two groups: the intervention (n = 60) and the control group (n = 63). Patients in the intervention group were subjected to the Chinese traditional five-element music intervention during the perioperative, while patients in the control group had no music intervention. POD was evaluated using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) in the first 5 days after surgery. The Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) was used to assess subjective sleep quality. The levels of nocturnal melatonin and cortisol in saliva were measured on the preoperative and the first 2 postoperative days. RESULTS: The incidence of POD within 5 days was 27.0% in the control group and 11.7% in the intervention group. Preoperative PSQI and MMSE scores were associated with POD. The RCSQ scores on the first postoperative day were significantly decreased in the two groups compared to the preoperative day. Compared to the control group, the RCSQ scores showed a significant improvement in the intervention group on the first postoperative day. Compared to the control group, the level of saliva melatonin in the intervention group showed a significant increase on the first postoperative day. However, there was no statistical difference in cortisol levels between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese traditional five-element music intervention decreased the incidence of POD in elderly patients who underwent noncardiac surgery via improving sleep quality, which may be associated with increased levels of melatonin.
