39245972|t|Generalized and visual anosognosia, Anosodiaphoria after bifrontal injury: symptom length and cognitive outcomes after one year from first report documented.
39245972|a|IMPORTANCE: GAAB Syndrome was recently discovered and coined by Rodriguez, Azariah, Ritter, et al.. (2024). It is characterized by bifrontal brain injury, visual pathway damage involving bilateral enucleation, generalized and visual anosognosia and lack of emotional processing with visual anosognosia being more prominent in the clinical presentation of the patient given the context of bilateral enucleation. The syndrome was not explained by delirium nor by amnesia, not either by multiple shunt adjustments or psychological denial. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical presentation and syndrome length of the patient one year after injury. Results show that most of the syndrome symptoms are resolved after nine months, with just visual anosognosia not resolving completely. The patient improved cognitively as shown by the same tests one year later.
