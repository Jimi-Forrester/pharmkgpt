26390609|a|The review conducts clinical morphological and pathogenetic parallels between Alzheimer's disease and age-related macular degeneration. The common embryology, anatomy and physiology of the brain and eye create the preconditions for the emergence of the friendly processes, including pathological aggregation of beta-amyloid and neurodegeneration. Based upon the data the authors justify the need for a thorough ophthalmic status study in the daily practice of an ophthalmologist. According to the authors this is promising for the early diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease.
