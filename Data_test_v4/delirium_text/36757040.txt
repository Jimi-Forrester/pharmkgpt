36757040|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease and featured by cognitive impairment. Procyanidins have been shown to have a potential protective effect against neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying mechanism is not comprehensive enough. OBJECTIVE: To further investigate the effects of procyanidins from lotus seedpod (LSPC) on cognition in AD. METHODS: The APP/PS1 transgenic mice were administered with LSPC (100 mg/kg body weight) for five months. The Morris water maze test was used to assess learning and memory function, the long-term potentiation (LTP) was measured and the expression of Abeta, pCREB/CREB and BDNF were quantified by western blot. RESULTS: LSPC significantly ameliorated cognitive dysfunction, reduced Abeta deposition and reversed remarkable reduction of the phosphorylation of CREB and the expression of BDNF, and then enhanced the effect of LTP in APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSION: These results revealed that LSPC could ameliorate cognitive impairment through CREB-BDNF pathway mediated the enhancement of LTP in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
