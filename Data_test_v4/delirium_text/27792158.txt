27792158|t|Macrolactins from Marine-Derived Bacillus subtilis B5 Bacteria as Inhibitors of Inducible Nitric Oxide and Cytokines Expression.
27792158|a|In order to find new natural products with anti-inflammatory activity, chemical investigation of a 3000-meter deep-sea sediment derived bacteria Bacillus subtilis B5 was carried out. A new macrolactin derivative was isolated and identified as 7,13-epoxyl-macrolactin A (1). Owing to the existence of the epoxy ring, 1 exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the expression of inducible nitric oxide and cytokines, compared with previously isolated known macrolactins (2-5). Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis showed that the new compound significantly inhibited the mRNA expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrated that the new compound reduced the mRNA expression level of IL-1beta in a concentration-dependent manner.
