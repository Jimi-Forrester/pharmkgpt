32669514|t|The Association between Frailty and Abdominal Symptoms: A Hospital-based Cross-sectional Study.
32669514|a|Objective The association between frailty and abdominal symptoms has not been evaluated. Methods We conducted a hospital-based, retrospective cross-sectional study of consecutive outpatients >=65 years old at the Department of Gastroenterology, Juntendo Tokyo Koto Geriatric Medical Center from 2017 to 2019. Patients were included in the study if all of the following information was available from their medical records: patient's profile, the evaluation of osteoporosis, sarcopenia, frailty, nutritional status, findings of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and questionnaire results for abdominal symptoms [Frequency Scale for the Symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (FSSG) and Constipation Scoring System (CSS)]. We divided the subjects into frailty and non-frailty groups and investigated the risk factors for frailty. Results Of the 313 eligible study subjects [134 men (42.8%) and 179 women (57.2%); mean age, 75.7+-6.0 years; mean body mass index, 22.8+-3.6 kg/m2], frailty was noted in 71 cases (22.7%). In a univariate analysis, an older age (p<0.001), female gender (p=0.010), successful eradication of Helicobacter pylori (p=0.049), proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use (p<0.001), laxative/prokinetics use (p=0.008), sarcopenia (p<0.001), osteoporosis (p<0.001), hypozincemia (p=0.002), hypoalbuminemia (p<0.001), low lymphocytes (p=0.004), a high CONUT score (p<0.001), a high FSSG score (p=0.001), and a high CSS score (p<0.001) were significantly associated with frailty. A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that an older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.24, p<0.001], PPI use (OR 2.42; 95% CI 1.18-4.98, p=0.016), sarcopenia (OR 7.35; 95% CI 3.30-16.40, p<0.001), hypozincemia (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.92-0.99, p=0.027), a high FSSG score (OR 1.08; 95% CI 1.01-1.16, p=0.021), and a high CSS score (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.03-1.23, p=0.007) were significantly associated with frailty. Conclusion Advanced age, PPI user, sarcopenia, hypozincemia, a high FSSG score, and high CSS score are associated with frailty.
