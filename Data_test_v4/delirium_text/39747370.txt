39747370|a|The primary cilium is a hair-like organelle that hosts molecular machinery for various developmental and homeostatic signaling pathways. Its alteration can cause rare ciliopathies such as the Bardet-Biedl and Joubert syndromes, but is also linked to Alzheimer's disease, clinical depression, and autism spectrum disorder. These afflictions are caused by disturbances in a wide variety of genes but a common phenotype amongst them is cognitive impairment. While cilia-mediated neural function has been widely examined in early neurodevelopment, their function in the adult brain is not well understood. To help elucidate the role of cilia in neural activity, we temporally induced the ablation of IFT88, a gene encoding the intraflagellar transport 88 protein which is neccessary for ciliogenesis, in adult mice before performing memory-related behavioral assays and electroencephalogram/electromyogram (EEG/EMG) recordings. Inducible IFT88 KO mice exhibited severe learning deficits in trace fear conditioning and Morris water maze tests. They had strongly affected brainwave activity both under isoflurane induced anesthesia and during normal activity. And additionally, inducible IFT88 KO mice had altered sleep architecture and attenuated phase-amplitude coupling, a process that underlies learning and memory formation. These results highlight the growing significance of primary cilia for healthy neural function in the adult brain.
