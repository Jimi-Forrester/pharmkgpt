36354991|t|Synthesis of Water-Soluble Sulfonated Chitin Derivatives for Potential Antioxidant and Antifungal Activity.
36354991|a|Chitin is a natural renewable and useful biopolymer limited by its insolubility; chemical derivatization can enhance the solubility and bioactivity of chitin. The purpose of this study was to synthesize novel water-soluble chitin derivatives, sulfo-chitin (SCT) and sulfopropyl-chitin (SPCT), as antioxidant and antifungal agents. The target derivatives were characterized by means of elemental analysis, FTIR, 13C NMR, TGA and XRD. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of the chitin derivatives was estimated by free radical scavenging ability (against DPPH-radical, hydroxyl-radical and superoxide-radical) and ferric reducing power. In addition, inhibitory effects against four fungi were also tested. The findings show that antioxidant abilities and antifungal properties were in order of SPCT > SCT > CT. On the basis of the results obtained, we confirmed that the introduction of sulfonated groups on the CT backbone would help improve the antioxidant and antifungal activity of CT. Moreover, its efficacy as an antioxidant and antifungal agent increased as the chain length of the substituents increased. This derivatization strategy might provide a feasible way to broaden the utilization of chitin. It is of great significance to minimize waste and realize the high-value utilization of aquatic product wastes.
