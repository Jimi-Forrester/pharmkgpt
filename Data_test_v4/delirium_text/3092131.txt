3092131|a|We reviewed 81 patients with dementia and autopsy findings of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to identify patients with seizures or myoclonus after onset of dementia. Eight (10%) had seizures, and eight others (10%) had myoclonus. The incidence of seizures was 10 times more than expected in a reference population. Seizures occurred in any stage of AD, but myoclonus was often a late manifestation. Both seizures and myoclonus, individually or together, are manifestations of AD and may be seen at any time in the course of the illness.
