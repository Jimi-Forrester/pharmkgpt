36272201|t|Preclinical evaluation of new C-11 labeled benzo-1,4-dioxane PET radiotracers for brain alpha2C adrenergic receptors.
36272201|a|As one of the nine subtypes of adrenergic receptors (ARs) in the brain, alpha2C-ARs play essential roles in emotion and memory, and are implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, Alzheimer's disease, substance use disorder, and schizophrenia. A recently developed alpha2C-AR specific positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, [11C]ORM-13070, showed promise for imaging alpha2C-ARs in the brain. Herein, we prepared highly potent C-11 labeled benzo-1,4-dioxane derivatives and compared them with [11C]ORM-13070, aiming to improve the specific binding signal, as evaluated by in vivo rodent brain PET imaging.  2022 Elsevier Inc.
