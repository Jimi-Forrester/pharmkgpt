38036382|a|INTRODUCTION: The primary objective is to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the triggers of psychopathology and on the delusional content of patients with psychotic symptoms treated during the first three months of the pandemic in a tertiary hospital in Madrid. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational and retrospective study of all patients attending the psychiatric emergency room (ER) between 11th March and 11th June 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were included. The chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test were performed to compare categorical variables. The level of statistical significance was set at P<.05. RESULTS: In the first month of the pandemic, COVID-19 conditioned the delirious content of 38.5% of the admitted patients and acted as a direct trigger for 46.2% of consultations. In the second week it affected 100.0% of the patients in both cases. Subsequently, a progressive and significant decrease was observed, with COVID-19 being the triggering factor for 17.6% and 11.5% of consultations in the second and third months of the pandemic respectively. Similarly, it was the main determinant of the delusional content in 13.7% and 3.8% of cases respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The current pandemic affects delirium's pathoplasty. The delusional content of patients admitted with psychotic symptoms is quickly conditioned, which may be related to the radical change in their life, without transition or prior preparation. The patient's environmental context and events have a huge impact on the dynamics and characteristics of mental disorders.
