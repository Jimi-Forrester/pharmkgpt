39099649|a|The adoption and growth of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology, especially through the use of Pearson's correlation (PC) for constructing brain functional networks (BFN), has significantly advanced brain disease diagnostics by uncovering the brain's operational mechanisms and offering biomarkers for early detection. However, the PC always tends to make for a dense BFN, which violates the biological prior. Therefore, in practice, researchers use hard-threshold to remove weak connection edges or introduce l 1-norm as a regularization term to obtain sparse BFNs. However, these approaches neglect the spatial neighborhood information between regions of interest (ROIs), and ROI with closer distances has higher connectivity prospects than ROI with farther distances due to the principle of simple wiring costs in resent studies. Thus, we propose a neighborhood structure-guided BFN estimation method in this article. In detail, we figure the ROIs' Euclidean distances and sort them. Then, we apply the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) to find out the top K neighbors closest to the current ROIs, where each ROI's K neighbors are independent of each other. We establish the connection relationship between the ROIs and these K neighbors and construct the global topology adjacency matrix according to the binary network. Connect ROI nodes with k nearest neighbors using edges to generate an adjacency graph, forming an adjacency matrix. Based on adjacency matrix, PC calculates the correlation coefficient between ROIs connected by edges, and generates the BFN. With the purpose of evaluating the performance of the introduced method, we utilize the estimated BFN for distinguishing individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the healthy ones. Experimental outcomes imply this method attains better classification performance than the baselines. Additionally, we compared it with the most commonly used time series methods in deep learning. Results of the performance of K-nearest neighbor-Pearson's correlation (K-PC) has some advantage over deep learning.
