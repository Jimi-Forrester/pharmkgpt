34159765|a|The number of older people undergoing surgery in the UK is increasing, partly due to an ageing population and advances in surgical techniques. However, outcomes for older patients who have undergone surgery are suboptimal when compared with younger people, especially following emergency surgery. To minimise the risk of adverse events affecting older people following surgery, it is essential that nurses understand how to manage common challenges for this patient group such as delirium, pain, reduced mobility and inadequate hydration.
