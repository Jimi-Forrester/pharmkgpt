37533659|t|Wernicke Encephalopathy: An Updated Narrative Review.
37533659|a|Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) and Korsakoff Syndrome (KS) are distinct neurological disorders that may have overlapping clinical features. Due to the overlap, they are collectively known as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. WE is related to diencephalic and mesencephalic dysfunction due to thiamine. WE typically manifests as confusion, ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, and gait ataxia (Wernicke's triad), although they may not consistently occur together. Although WE mostly occurs in alcoholics, other etiologies, such as post-bariatric surgery, must be considered. Early diagnosis and therapy by intravenous thiamine are essential to prevent WE complications and to reduce morbidity and mortality. Therefore, physicians' and patients' awareness of WE is essential for early diagnosis and therapy. Accordingly, this narrative review aimed to provide an update on WE by reviewing articles published between April 2015 to April 2022 about the etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and WE management updates. EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Google, and Scopus search engines were used to conduct the literature search.
