37603460|a|The decline in cognitive function and the prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders are among the most serious threats to health in old age. The prevalence of dementia has reached 50 million people worldwide and has become one of the major public health problems. The causes of age-related cognitive impairment are multiple, complex, and difficult to determine. However, type 2 diabetes (T2D) is linked to an enhanced risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. Human studies have shown that patients with T2D exhibit dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. This dysbiosis may contribute to the development of insulin resistance and increased plasma lipopolysaccharide concentrations. Metformin medication mimics some of the benefits of calorie restriction and physical activity, such as greater insulin sensitivity and decreased cholesterol levels, and hence may also have a positive impact on aging in humans. According to recent human investigations, metformin might partially restore gut dysbiosis related to T2D. Likewise, some studies showed that metformin reduced the risk of dementia and improved cognition, although not all studies are concordant. Therefore, this review focused on those human studies describing the effects of metformin on the gut microbiome (specifically the changes in taxonomy, function, and circulating metabolomics), the changes in cognitive function and their possible bidirectional implications.
