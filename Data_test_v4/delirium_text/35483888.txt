35483888|a|Due to the increasing number of cases of Alzheimer's disease and the relatively moderate success with the available symptomatic and causal pharmacological therapies, there is a considerable need to explore non-pharmacological treatment options. In the field of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), various methods have been investigated, particularly transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial electrical stimulation. In addition, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently being researched as an innovative method for targeted neuromodulation. Both non-invasive and invasive approaches aim to modulate neuronal activity and improve cognitive-mnestic functions. Secondary mechanisms such as long-term potentiation in NIBS or neurogenesis in DBS could also achieve long-term positive effects. Preclinical and clinical studies have already shown promising results in patients in early stages of Alzheimer's disease. However, inconsistent study and stimulation protocols and small sample sizes make it difficult to assess efficacy. Further research is warranted to enable the use of non-invasive or invasive neuromodulatory approaches in clinical practice in the near future.
