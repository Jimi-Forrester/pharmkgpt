35432358|t|O-GlcNAcylation and Its Role in Cancer-Associated Inflammation.
35432358|a|Cancer cells, as well as surrounding stromal and inflammatory cells, form an inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote all stages of carcinogenesis. As an emerging post-translational modification (PTM) of serine and threonine residues of proteins, O-linked-N-Acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) regulates diverse cancer-relevant processes, such as signal transduction, transcription, cell division, metabolism and cytoskeletal regulation. Recent studies suggest that O-GlcNAcylation regulates the development, maturation and functions of immune cells. However, the role of protein O-GlcNAcylation in cancer-associated inflammation has been less explored. This review summarizes the current understanding of the influence of protein O-GlcNAcylation on cancer-associated inflammation and the mechanisms whereby O-GlcNAc-mediated inflammation regulates tumor progression. This will provide a theoretical basis for further development of anti-cancer therapies.
