26154303|a|The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of delirium among geriatric patients with hip fractures and to examine the influence of delirium on rehabilitation outcomes. A prospective study was carried out among 95 hip fracture patients admitted to an orthopedic geriatric rehabilitation ward. At admission, the following data were gathered: sociodemographic data, prefracture Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Mini-Mental State Examination, comorbidities, and medication. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method. The severity of delirium among patients with a positive score on the Confusion Assessment Method was assessed using the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R-98). Rehabilitation outcomes were evaluated by comparing FIM and ADL at admission and at discharge. The research findings showed that the prevalence of delirium among patients was 30%. In addition, a significant difference was found between patients who developed delirium and those who did not. Patients who developed delirium were mostly Jewish, with lower ADL levels at admission, more significant renal failure, lower levels of FIM, and lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Furthermore, FIM at discharge and delta FIM were lower among patients who developed delirium than among those who did not. The research conclusions indicated that the functional recovery of patients with delirium is slower. Therefore, it is important to adjust the therapeutic approach to these patients.
