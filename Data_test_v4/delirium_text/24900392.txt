24900392|t|"It Ain't Over 'til It's Over" (a) -The Search for Treatments and Cures for Alzheimer's Disease.
24900392|a|In the neuroscience landscape, there is no condition with higher unmet medical and societal need than Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are significant opportunities to improve upon symptomatic treatments in AD, and as yet, there are no treatments to modify (slow, stop, or prevent) underlying disease progression. Our goals are to discover new symptomatic AD therapies with improved efficacy and longevity; to complete definitive studies that refute or prove the amyloid hypothesis, potentially opening multiple avenues to new therapeutic modalities; and to initiate tests of novel mechanisms that can prevent tau pathology and neurodegeneration. It's a critical time in the testing of novel AD therapeutics-let's hope we succeed.
