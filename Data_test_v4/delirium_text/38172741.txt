38172741|a|BACKGROUND: Hospitalization in individuals with dementia can be associated with negative and unintended outcomes. Research indicates that people with dementia experience more hospital admissions in comparison to individuals without dementia. This study aims to assess the survival time of individuals with dementia who experience unplanned hospitalization and examine the factors that are associated with mortality in this population. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from older adults with dementia who survived unplanned hospitalizations at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2016. The association between factors and mortality were analyzed using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-one cases were included. The mean age of the study population was 80.07 (SD 7.49) years, and the majority were female (56.91%). The median survival time of the studied cohort was 3.06 years (95% CI 3.14-3.60). The multivariable analysis revealed that older age (aHR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.05), a diagnosis of mixed-type dementia (aHR = 3.45, 95% CI 1.17-10.14), higher Charlson comorbidity index score (aHR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.04-1.36), higher serum creatinine level (aHR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.10-1.66), insertion of endotracheal tube (aHR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.07-3.54), and readmission within 30 days (aHR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.18-2.98) were associated with an increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We identified several notable predictors of mortality. Healthcare providers can use the findings of this study to identify patients who may be at higher risk of mortality and develop targeted interventions which may improve patient outcomes.
