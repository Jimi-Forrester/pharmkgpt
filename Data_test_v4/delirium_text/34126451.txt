34126451|t|Hispanic ethnicity and in-hospital morbidity and mortality outcomes in Alzheimer's Disease: A U.S. National Study 2005-2015.
34126451|a|BACKGROUND: Hispanics are one of the largest and fastest-growing population in the United States. Having been reported as one of the high-risk ethnicities to develop Alzheimer's Disease (AD) makes elder Hispanics one of the significant groups of AD in the country, indicating a need to study the disparities in Hispanics vs. non-Hispanics patients. We aimed to determine the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality outcomes of AD in Hispanics. METHODS: We surveyed Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) from 2005 to 2015 to identify patients older than 50 years who were admitted for any reason and had AD diagnosis. Prevalence, demographics, age brackets, in-hospital deaths, disease severity, and hospital length of stay (LOS) were compared between the Hispanics and Non-Hispanics. RESULTS: Among 14,135,560 Hispanic discharges, 2.76% had AD, compared with 207,515,260 discharges in Non-Hispanic with 2.61% AD, p < 0.001. Hispanics had significantly more AD in all age brackets, especially over 90 years of age, p < 0.001. A significantly higher prevalence of AD in both Hispanic Females (3.27% vs. 3.10%) and Males (2.17% vs. 2.04%) was noticed, p < 0.001. In northeast and south regions of the country and urban hospitals, AD was more among Hispanics (p < 0.001). Hispanic patients were younger (81.8 +- 7.77 vs. 82.6 +- 7.50, p < 0.001), had longer LOS (6.41 +- 7.72 vs. 6.08 +- 7.05, p < 0.001), had higher hospital charges ($45,989 vs. $37,688, p < 0.001). Hispanic AD patients had higher disease severity and mortality risk (p < 0.001). However, the inpatient mortality was not different between the Hispanic and non-Hispanics. Multivariate analysis showed that Hispanics had the highest AD prevalence in the inpatient setting (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.37-1.39, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of AD was significantly higher in inpatient Hispanics than non-Hispanics. Hispanic AD patients had a younger age compared with non-Hispanic AD. Disease severity and mortality risks were higher in Hispanics with AD than non-Hispanics with AD. However, no difference was seen in mortality rate during admission in Hispanics vs. non-Hispanics.
