35601305|t|Exploration of the Detailed Structure-Activity Relationships of Isatin and Their Isomers As Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors.
35601305|a|Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is a protein with a key function in the catabolism of neuroamines in both central and peripheral parts of the body. MAO-A and -B are two isozymes of this enzyme which have emerged to be considered as a drug target for the treatment of neurodenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Isatin is an endogenous small fragment, reversible inhibitor for MAO enzymes and is more selective for MAO-B than -A. Isatin is responsible for increasing the dopamine level in the brain by the inhibition of an MAO enzyme. The very few selective and reversible inhibitors existing for MAO proteins and the intensity of neurological diseases in humanity have opened a new door for researchers. Isatin has a polypharmacological profile in medicinal chemistry, is a reversible inhibitor for both the MAOs, and shows high selectivity potent inhibition for MAO-B. In this review, we discuss isatins and their analogues phthalide and phthalimide with structure-activity relationships (SARs), and this comprehensive information accelerates the ideas for design and development of a new class of MAO inhibitors for neurodegenerative diseases.
