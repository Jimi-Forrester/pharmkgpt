27236884|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe analgesic and sedative effect of acupuncture combined with medicine (ACM) on patients undergiong cardiac surgery. METHODS: A total of 50 patients with cardiac surgery from January 2012 to October 2014 were randomly assigned to the conventional analgesia group (group A) and the ACM analgesia group (group B), 25 in each group. Patients in group A were subjected to analgesia and sedation by injecting dexmedetomidine, while patients in group B were subjected to analgesia and sedation by electro-acupuncture [EA, Shenting (GV24); Yintang (EX-HN3)] combined with injection of dexmedetomidine. Morphine hydrochloride injection was performed when analgesia and sedation effect was ineffective in the two groups. The indicators of patients at different time points in the two groups were observed, such as static and dynamic VAS scores, SAS scores, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2). The injection dosage of dexmedetomidine and morphine hydrochloride, analgesia satisfaction rate, sedation satisfaction rate, the incidences of adverse reactions during treatment such as bradycardia and low blood pressure, mechanical ventilation time, ICU time, and hospitalization expense were observed and recorded in the two groups. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in static and dynamic VAS scores, SAS score, MAP, HR and SpO2 between the two groups at different time points (P > 0.05). The injection dosage of dexmedetomidine and morphine hydrochloride was significantly reduced in group B than in group A (P < 0.05). The analgesia satisfaction rate of patients in group B was much higher than that in group A (P < 0.05). The incidence of bradycardia also obviously decreased more in group B than in group A (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in patients' sedation satisfaction rate, incidences of low blood pressure, delirium, vomiting; mechanical ventilation time, ICU time, or hospitalization expense between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The analgesia method of ACM could reduce the dosage of traditional analgesic drugs and the occurrence of partial adverse reactions.
