37568528|t|Clinical Features and Outcomes of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Observational Study.
37568528|a|BACKGROUND: An alarming number of COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases, have developed acute kidney injury (AKI). AIM: The study aimed to assess the frequency, risk factors, and impact of AKI on mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The study was a retrospective observational study conducted in the MICU. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for AKI and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: During the study period, 465 consecutive COVID-19 patients were admitted to the MICU. The patients' characteristics were median age, 64 [54-71] years; median SAPSII, 31 [24-38]; and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), 244 (52.5%). The overall ICU mortality rate was 49%. Two hundred twenty-nine (49.2%) patients developed AKI. The factors independently associated with AKI were positive fluid balance (OR, 2.78; 95%CI [1.88-4.11]; p < 0.001), right heart failure (OR, 2.15; 95%CI [1.25-3.67]; p = 0.005), and IMV use (OR, 1.55; 95%CI [1.01-2.40]; p = 0.044). Among the AKI patients, multivariate analysis identified the following factors as independently associated with ICU mortality: age (OR, 1.05; 95%CI [1.02-1.09]; p = 0.012), IMV use (OR, 48.23; 95%CI [18.05-128.89]; p < 0.001), and septic shock (OR, 3.65; 95%CI [1.32-10.10]; p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: The present study revealed a high proportion of AKI among critically ill COVID-19 patients. This complication seems to be linked to a severe cardiopulmonary interaction and fluid balance management, thus accounting for a poor outcome.
