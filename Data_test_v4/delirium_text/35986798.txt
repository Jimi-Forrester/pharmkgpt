35986798|t|A systematic review of radiomics in pancreatitis: applying the evidence level rating tool for promoting clinical transferability.
35986798|a|BACKGROUND: Multiple tools have been applied to radiomics evaluation, while evidence rating tools for this field are still lacking. This study aims to assess the quality of pancreatitis radiomics research and test the feasibility of the evidence level rating tool. RESULTS: Thirty studies were included after a systematic search of pancreatitis radiomics studies until February 28, 2022, via five databases. Twenty-four studies employed radiomics for diagnostic purposes. The mean +- standard deviation of the adherence rate was 38.3 +- 13.3%, 61.3 +- 11.9%, and 37.1 +- 27.2% for the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS), the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) checklist, and the Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) guideline for preprocessing steps, respectively. The median (range) of RQS was 7.0 (- 3.0 to 18.0). The risk of bias and application concerns were mainly related to the index test according to the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. The meta-analysis on differential diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis versus pancreatic cancer by CT and mass-forming pancreatitis versus pancreatic cancer by MRI showed diagnostic odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of, respectively, 189.63 (79.65-451.48) and 135.70 (36.17-509.13), both rated as weak evidence mainly due to the insufficient sample size. CONCLUSIONS: More research on prognosis of acute pancreatitis is encouraged. The current pancreatitis radiomics studies have insufficient quality and share common scientific disadvantages. The evidence level rating is feasible and necessary for bringing the field of radiomics from preclinical research area to clinical stage.
