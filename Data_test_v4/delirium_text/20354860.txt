20354860|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent form of dementia worldwide. The increasing incidence of AD is due to the dramatic rise in life expectancy. Generally, AD shows a multifactorial etiology and manifests itself only at an older age. However, a small percentage of cases have a monogenic cause, are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, and begin much earlier. In these cases, molecular analysis and genetic consultation may make sense.
