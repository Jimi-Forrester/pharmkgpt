8149195|a|The likelihood of a man being admitted to a general hospital for liver disease, myocardial infarction, other cardiovascular disease, upper gastrointestinal disease and acute trauma increases progressively as admitted alcohol intake increases, commencing at an admitted consumption of 30/g per day. Heavy drinkers are also more likely than light drinkers to be admitted for respiratory disorders, presumably because of the connection with smoking. In addition to these and other medical conditions linked to alcohol use, there are admissions directly related to alcohol dependence and its complications such as fits, or delirium. Trends in general hospital discharges for alcohol dependence, psychosis and misuse for the 1980's have been examined in Scotland and found to have increased, in a period when discharges for alcohol disorders from psychiatric hospitals have decreased (Figs 1-3). Changes in diagnostic practices are unlikely to account for such a large change, but a shift from psychiatric to general hospital may have contributed.
