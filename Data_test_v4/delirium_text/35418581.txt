35418581|t|Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) sprout prevents high-fat diet-induced cognitive impairment by improving mitochondrial function.
35418581|a|This study was performed to evaluate the improvement effect of the ethyl acetate fraction from peanut (Arachis hypogaea) sprout (EFPS) on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced cognitive deficits in C57BL/6 mice. Mice were randomly divided four groups (n = 13) as control (normal chow), HFD, EFPS 20 (20 mg/kg of body weight; intragastric administration) and EFPS 50 (50 mg/kg of body weight; intragastric administration) groups. HFD was provide for 15 weeks excepting control group. EFPS ameliorated cognitive dysfunction in Y-maze, passive avoidance test and Morris water maze test. EFPS significantly improved glucose tolerance and serum lipid profile, and reduced body weight. EFPS ameliorated oxidative stress by regulating MDA levels and SOD activity in liver and brain tissues. In addition, EFPS restored brain mitochondrial dysfunction related to energy metabolism. Moreover, the bioactive compounds of EFPS were identified as di-caffeic acid, caffeic acid, dihydrokaempferol-hexoside, di-p-coumaroyl tartaric acid isomer and group B soyasaponins using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight (UPLC-Q-TOF) mass spectrometry. These results show that EFPS can improve cognitive functions in HFD-induced diabetic mice.
