38928345|t|Exploring the Potential Role of Oligodendrocyte-Associated PIP4K2A in Alzheimer's Disease Complicated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus via Multi-Omic Analysis.
38928345|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are two common diseases that affect the elderly population worldwide. The identification of common genes associated with AD and T2DM holds promise for potential biomarkers and intriguing pathogenesis of these two complicated diseases. This study utilized a comprehensive approach by integrating transcriptome data from multiple cohorts, encompassing both AD and T2DM. The analysis incorporated various data types, including blood and tissue samples as well as single-cell datasets, allowing for a detailed assessment of gene expression patterns. From the brain region-specific single-cell analysis, PIP4K2A, which encodes phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase type 2 alpha, was found to be expressed mainly in oligodendrocytes compared to other cell types. Elevated levels of PIP4K2A in AD and T2DM patients' blood were found to be associated with key cellular processes such as vesicle-mediated transport, negative regulation of autophagosome assembly, and cytosolic transport. The identification of PIP4K2A's potential roles in the cellular processes of AD and T2DM offers valuable insights into the development of biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy, especially in the complication of these two diseases.
