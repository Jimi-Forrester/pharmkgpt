36412643|t|Organophosphate Insecticide Toxicity in Neural Development, Cognition, Behaviour and Degeneration: Insights from Zebrafish.
36412643|a|Organophosphate (OP) insecticides are used to eliminate agricultural threats posed by insects, through inhibition of the neurotransmitter acetylcholinesterase (AChE). These potent neurotoxins are extremely efficacious in insect elimination, and as such, are the preferred agricultural insecticides worldwide. Despite their efficacy, however, estimates indicate that only 0.1% of organophosphates reach their desired target. Moreover, multiple studies have shown that OP exposure in both humans and animals can lead to aberrations in embryonic development, defects in childhood neurocognition, and substantial contribution to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Motor Neurone Disease. Here, we review the current state of knowledge pertaining to organophosphate exposure on both embryonic development and/or subsequent neurological consequences on behaviour, paying particular attention to data gleaned using an excellent animal model, the zebrafish (Danio rerio).
