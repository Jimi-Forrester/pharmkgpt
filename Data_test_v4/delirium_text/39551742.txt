39551742|a|Amyloid beta42 (Abeta42) plays a decisive role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. The Abeta42 peptide can aggregate into various supramolecular structures, with oligomers being the most toxic form. However, different Abeta species that cause different effects have been described. Many cell death pathways can be activated in connection with Abeta action, including apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, oxidative stress, ferroptosis, alterations in mitophagy, autophagy, and endo/lysosomal functions. In this study, we used a model of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and applied two different Abeta42 preparations for 2 and 4 days. Although we found no difference in the shape and size of Abeta species prepared by two different methods (NaOH or NH4OH for Abeta solubilization), we observed strong differences in their effects. Treatment of cells with NaOH-Abeta42 mainly resulted in damage of mitochondrial function and increased production of reactive oxygen species, whereas application of NH4OH-Abeta42 induced necroptosis and first steps of apoptosis, but also caused an increase in protective Hsp27. Moreover, the two Abeta42 preparations differed in the mechanism of interaction with the cells, with the effect of NaOH-Abeta42 being dependent on monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) content, whereas the effect of NH4OH-Abeta42 was independent of GM1. This suggests that, although both preparations were similar in size, minor differences in secondary/tertiary structure are likely to strongly influence the resulting processes. Our work reveals, at least in part, one of the possible causes of the inconsistency in the data observed in different studies on Abeta-toxicity pathways.
