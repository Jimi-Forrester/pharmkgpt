METHODS: The primary cultured hippocampal neurons prepared from the fetal tissue of mice were divided into six groups and treated with DMSO, Abeta(42-1), alpha-syn, Abeta(1-42), alpha-syn plus Abeta(42-1) and alpha-syn plus Abeta(1-42), respectively. After incubation for 24 h, the synapsin I content was calculated by immunofluorescence and the synaptic vesicle recycling was monitored by FM1-43 staining. Furthermore, the expression of cysteine string protein-alpha (CSPalpha) detected by western blot was also conducted. RESULTS: Either Abeta(1-42) or alpha-syn alone could induce a significant synapses dysfunction through reducing the content of synapsin I, inhibiting the synaptic vesicle recycling as well as down-regulating the expression of CSPalpha compared with the controls (P<0.05). However, simultaneous intervention with both alpha-syn and Abeta(1-42) aggravated these effects in cultured hippocampal neurons compared with the treatment with alpha-syn (synapsin I content: P<0.001; synaptic vesicle recycling: P=0.007; CSPalpha expression: P<0.001) or Abeta(1-42) (synapsin I number: P<0.001; synaptic vesicle recycling: P=0.007 CSPalpha expression: P<0.001) alone. CONCLUSION: There was synergistic effect between Abeta and alpha-syn on synapses dysfunction through reducing the synapsin I content, inhibiting the synaptic vesicle recycling and down-regulating the expression of CSPalpha in several neurodegenerative diseases.
