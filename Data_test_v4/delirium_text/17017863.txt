17017863|t|Oxidative stress: apoptosis in neuronal injury.
17017863|a|Apoptosis has been well documented to play a significant role in cell loss during neurodegenerative disorders, such as stroke, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been implicated in the cellular damage during these neurodegenerative disorders. These ROS can react with cellular macromolecular through oxidation and cause the cells undergo necrosis or apoptosis. The control of the redox environment of the cell provides addition regulation in the signal transduction pathways which are redox sensitive. Recently, many researches focus on the relationship between apoptosis and oxidative stress. However, till now, there is no clear and defined mechanisms that how oxidative stress could contribute to the apoptosis. This review hopes to make clear that generation of ROS during brain injury, particularly in ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's Disease, and the fact that oxidative state plays a key role in the regulation and control of the cell survival and cell death through its interaction with cellular macromolecules and signal transduction pathway, and ultimately helps in developing an unique therapy for the treatment of these neurodegenerative disorders.
