39289644|t|Delirium in nursing home residents: is there a role of antidepressants? A cross sectional study.
39289644|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is strongly associated with poor health outcomes, yet it is frequently underdiagnosed. Limited research on delirium has been conducted in Nursing Homes (NHs). Our aim is to assess delirium prevalence and its associated factors, in particular pharmacological prescription, in this care setting. METHODS: Data from the Italian "Delirium Day" 2016 Edition, a national multicenter point-prevalence study on patients aged 65 and older were analyzed to examine the associations between the prevalence of delirium and its subtypes with demographics and information about medical history and pharmacological treatment. Delirium was assessed using the Assessment test for delirium and cognitive impairment (4AT). Motor subtype was evaluated using the Delirium Motor Subtype Scale (DMSS). RESULTS: 955 residents, from 32 Italian NHs with a mean age of 84.72 +- 7.78 years were included. According to the 4AT, delirium was present in 260 (27.2%) NHs residents, mainly hyperactive (35.4%) or mixed subtypes (20.7%). Antidepressant treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was associated with lower delirium prevalence in univariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of delirium in NHs highlights the need to systematically assess its occurrence in this care settings. The inverse association between SSRIs and delirium might imply a possible preventive role of this class of therapeutic agents against delirium in NHs, yet further studies are warranted to ascertain any causal relationship between SSRIs intake and reduced delirium incidence.
