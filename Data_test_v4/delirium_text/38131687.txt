38131687|t|Evaluating Nutritional Risk Factors for Delirium in Intensive-Care-Unit Patients: Present Insights and Prospects for Future Research.
38131687|a|Malnutrition, hypercatabolism, and metabolic changes are well-established risk factors for delirium in critically ill patients. Although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood, there is mounting evidence suggesting that malnutrition can cause a variety of changes that contribute to delirium, such as electrolyte imbalances, immune dysfunction, and alterations in drug metabolism. Therefore, a comprehensive metabolic and malnutrition assessment, along with appropriate nutritional support, may help to prevent or ameliorate malnutrition, reduce hypercatabolism, and improve overall physiological function, ultimately lowering the risk of delirium. For this aim, bioelectrical impedance analysis can represent a valuable strategy. Further research into the underlying mechanisms and nutritional risk factors for delirium is crucial to developing more effective prevention strategies. Understanding these processes will allow clinicians to personalize treatment plans for individual patients, leading to improved outcomes and quality of life in the intensive-care-unit survivors.
