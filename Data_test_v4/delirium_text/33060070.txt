33060070|a|OBJECTIVE: Glucose disposal by insulin-responsive tissues maintains the body glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance leads to a risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Insulin stimulates the translocation of glucose transporter isoform 4 (GLUT4) vesicles from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane to facilitate glucose uptake. However, the underlying mechanisms of GLUT4 vesicle translocation are not well defined. Here we show the role of huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) in GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes and the pathogenesis of T2DM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The parameters for glucose metabolism including body weight, glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance were assessed in wild-type (WT) and Hap1+/- mice. HAP1 protein expression was verified in adipose tissue. Hap1 mRNA and protein expression was monitored in adipose tissue of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetic mice. Insulin-stimulated GLUT4 vesicle translocation and glucose uptake were detected using immunofluorescence techniques and quantified in primary adipocytes from Hap1-/- mice. The interaction between HAP1 and GLUT4 was assessed by immunofluorescence colocalization and co-immunoprecipitation in HEK293 cells and adipose tissue. The role of sortilin in HAP1 and GLUT4 interaction was approved by co-immunoprecipitation and RNA interference. RESULTS: The expression of Hap1 mRNA and protein was detected in WT mouse adipose tissue and downregulated in adipose tissue of HFD-induced diabetic mice. Hap1+/- mice exhibited increased body weight, pronounced glucose tolerance and significant insulin intolerance compared with the WT mice. HAP1 colocalized with GLUT4 in mouse adipocytes and cotransfected HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the insulin-stimulated GLUT4 vesicle translocation and glucose uptake were defective in Hap1-/- adipocytes. Finally, sortilin mediated the interaction of HAP1 and GLUT4. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that HAP1 formed a protein complex with GLUT4 and sortilin, and played a critical role in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes. Its downregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes.
