35638055|a|Background: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has a major effect on morbidity and mortality in neurosurgical patients. However, identifying risk factors that may be useful in practice is a challenge. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence and determine the predictors of VTE in patients undergoing neurosurgery. Materials and methods: This retrospective, single-center cohort study was conducted on adult patients admitted to a private hospital for a primary elective neurosurgical procedure between January 2015 and December 2020. Univariate analysis was used to examine clinical factors, and multivariable regression analysis was used to identify predictors of VTE. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) curve demonstrated the fitting model and discrimination power. Results: A total of 350 patients who underwent neurological surgery were identified. There were 26 patients (7.4%) with VTE. The final predictors were found to be statistically significant in the multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, including non-Asian populations (p value < 0.001, odds ratio [OR]: 6.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.20-16.89), lack of postoperative ambulation (p value = 0.009, OR: 9.25, 95% CI = 1.17-48.83), and septic shock complication (p value = 0.001, OR: 5.36, 95% CI = 1.46-19.62). The AUROC was 0.708 (95% CI 0.61-0.80). Conclusion: Although the incidence of VTE in patients receiving neurosurgery is minimal, it is also higher in non-Asian patients, those who lack of postoperative ambulation, and patients with septic shock complications. This approach may be useful to predict thromboembolism in neurosurgical patients. External validation of the prognostic model requires more investigation.
