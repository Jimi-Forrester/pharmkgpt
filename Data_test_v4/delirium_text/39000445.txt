39000445|a|Both hypertension and aging are known to increase the vulnerability of the brain to neurovascular damage, resulting in cognitive impairment. The present study investigated the efficacy of the antihypertensive drug losartan on age- and hypertension-associated cognitive decline and the possible mechanism underlying its effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Losartan was administered (10 mg/kg, i.p. for 19 days) to 3- and 14-month-old SHRs. Age-matched Wistar rats were used as controls. Working memory, short-term object recognition, and spatial memory were assessed using the Y-maze, object recognition test (ORT) and radial arm maze (RAM) test. The expression of markers associated with aging, oxidative stress, and memory-related signaling was assessed in the frontal cortex (FC) and hippocampus. Motor activity measured over 24 h was not different between groups. Middle-aged vehicle-treated SHRs showed poorer performance in spontaneous alternation behavior (SAB) and activity in the first Y-maze test than their younger counterparts, suggesting age-related reduced "decision making" and reactivity in a novel environment. Losartan improved the age- and hypertension-induced decline in short-term recognition and spatial memory measured in the ORT and the second Y-maze test, particularly in the middle-aged rats, but was ineffective in the young adult rats. Changes in memory and age-related markers such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) and increased oxidative stress were observed in the hippocampus but not in the FC between young adult and middle-aged vehicle-treated SHRs. Losartan increased CREB expression while reducing Abeta1-42 levels and concomitant oxidative stress in middle-aged SHRs compared with vehicle-treated SHRs. In conclusion, our study highlights the complex interplay between hypertension, aging, and cognitive impairment. It suggests that there is a critical time window for therapeutic intervention with angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers.
