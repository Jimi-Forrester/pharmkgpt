38299785|a|The ageing process is associated with alterations of systemic trace element (TE) homeostasis increasing the risk, e.g. neurodegenerative diseases. Here, the impact of long-term modulation of dietary intake of copper, iron, selenium, and zinc was investigated in murine cerebellum. Four- and 40-wk-old mice of both sexes were supplied with different amounts of those TEs for 26 wk. In an adequate supply group, TE concentrations were in accordance with recommendations for laboratory mice while suboptimally supplied animals received only limited amounts of copper, iron, selenium, and zinc. An additional age-adjusted group was fed selenium and zinc in amounts exceeding recommendations. Cerebellar TE concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma-tandem mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the expression of genes involved in TE transport, DNA damage response, and DNA repair as well as selected markers of genomic stability [8-oxoguanine, incision efficiency toward 8-oxoguanine, 5-hydroxyuracil, and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites and global DNA (hydroxy)methylation] were analysed. Ageing resulted in a mild increase of iron and copper concentrations in the cerebellum, which was most pronounced in the suboptimally supplied groups. Thus, TE changes in the cerebellum were predominantly driven by age and less by nutritional intervention. Interestingly, deviation from adequate TE supply resulted in higher manganese concentrations of female mice even though the manganese supply itself was not modulated. Parameters of genomic stability were neither affected by age, sex, nor diet. Overall, this study revealed that suboptimal dietary TE supply does not substantially affect TE homeostasis in the murine cerebellum.
