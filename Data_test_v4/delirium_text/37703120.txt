37703120|a|PURPOSE: Perform content validation of a decannulation protocol for tracheostomized adult patients. METHODS: To validate the content of the protocol developed by speech therapists, the Delphi technique was used. The 11 items of the protocol were judged by experts through rounds via e-mail and were classified as adequate, partially adequate or inadequate, in addition to providing comments and suggestions on each item. 30 speech therapists, 30 respiratory physiotherapists and 30 physicians responsible for the tracheostomy and decannulation procedure were invited. The percentage of agreement adopted was >= 80% and the process was interrupted when this percentage was obtained in all items. RESULTS: At the end of the process, 24 professionals participated in the third round, being 46% speech therapists, 29% physiotherapists and 25% physicians. After the experts' suggestions and comments, two items were kept as they were in the initial protocol, seven were reformulated, six were included and two were excluded. The final version of the protocol included: identification, absence of abundant secretions, characteristics of the secretion, effective cough, ability to remove secretions, tolerate the deflated cuff, aptitude in the decannulation process, level of consciousness, change of cannula to a smaller caliber, absence of current/active infection, spontaneous and effective swallowing of saliva, use of a speech valve, aptitude for occlusion of the cannula, assessment of aptitude for decannulation and objective examinations. CONCLUSION: Through the Delphi Technique, the content of the instrument was validated, with substantial changes occurring. The next stage of instrument validation is obtaining evidence of validity in relation to the internal structure.
