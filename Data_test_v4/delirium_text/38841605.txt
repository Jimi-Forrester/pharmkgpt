38841605|t|Ayurvedic Medicine: A Traditional Medical System and Its Heavy Metal Poisoning.
38841605|a|Ayurveda is one of the oldest and most widely practiced traditional medical systems in the world. The ancient knowledge in this traditional medical system has yet to be fully explored. The interaction of rich knowledge from various traditional systems of medicine can open new pathways in the herbal drug discovery process. Apart from other hurdles in discovering plant-based medicines, the lack of knowledge of the differences and similarities between the theoretical doctrines of these systems is the greatest impediment to their convergence. Rasashastra is an Ayurvedic medicine section that deals with formulations that include minerals/metals, particularly Parad (mercury). According to the Ayurvedic Formulary of India, the most widely used heavy metals are mercury, arsenic, and lead. However, contemporary scientists are concerned about the use of heavy metals in Ayurvedic preparation. In this review article, we will discuss Ayurvedic medicine and the toxic effects of heavy metals.
