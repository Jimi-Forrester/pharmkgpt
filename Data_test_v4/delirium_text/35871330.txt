35871330|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies of hippocampal function and volume related to episodic memory deficits in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) have produced mixed results including increased or decreased activity and volume. However, most of them have not included biomarkers, such as amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition which is the hallmark for early identification of the Alzheimer's disease continuum. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of Abeta deposition, functional hippocampal activity and structural volume in aMCI patients and healthy elderly controls (HC) using a new functional MRI (fMRI) ecological episodic memory task. METHODS: Forty-six older adults were included, among them Abeta PET PIB positive (PIB+) aMCI (N = 17), Abeta PET PIB negative (PIB-) aMCI (N = 15), and HC (N = 14). Hippocampal volume and function were analyzed using Freesurfer v6.0 and FSL for news headlines episodic memory fMRI task, and logistic regression for group classification in conjunction with episodic memory task and traditional neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: The aMCI PIB+ and PIB-patients showed significantly worse performance in relation to HC in most traditional neuropsychological tests and within group difference only on story recall and the ecological episodic memory fMRI task delayed recall. The classification model reached a significant accuracy (78%) and the classification pattern characterizing the PIB+ included decreased left hippocampal function and volume, increased right hippocampal function and volume, and worse episodic memory performance differing from PIB-which showed increased left hippocampus volume. CONCLUSION: The main findings showed differential neural correlates, hippocampal volume and function during episodic memory in aMCI patients with the presence of Abeta deposition.
