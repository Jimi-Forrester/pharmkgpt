27617996|t|LC-MS Supported Studies on the in Vitro Metabolism of both Enantiomers of Flubatine and the in Vivo Metabolism of (+)-[(18)F]Flubatine-A Positron Emission Tomography Radioligand for Imaging alpha4beta2 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors.
27617996|a|Both enantiomers of [(18)F]flubatine are promising radioligands for neuroimaging of alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) by positron emission tomography (PET). To support clinical studies in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, a detailed examination of the metabolism in vitro and in vivo has been performed. (+)- and (-)-flubatine, respectively, were incubated with liver microsomes from mouse and human in the presence of NADPH (beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2'-phosphate reduced tetrasodium salt). Phase I in vitro metabolites were detected and their structures elucidated by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry). Selected metabolite candidates were synthesized and investigated for structural confirmation. Besides a high level of in vitro stability, the microsomal incubations revealed some species differences as well as enantiomer discrimination with regard to the formation of monohydroxylated products, which was identified as the main metabolic pathway in this assay. Furthermore, after injection of 250 MBq (+)-[(18)F]flubatine (specific activity > 350 GBq/mumol) into mouse, samples were prepared from brain, liver, plasma, and urine after 30 min and investigated by radio-HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography with radioactivity detection). For structure elucidation of the radiometabolites of (+)-[(18)F]flubatine formed in vivo, identical chromatographic conditions were applied to LC-MS/MS and radio-HPLC to compare samples obtained in vitro and in vivo. By this correlation approach, we assigned three of four main in vivo radiometabolites to products that are exclusively C- or N-hydroxylated at the azabicyclic ring system of the parent molecule.
