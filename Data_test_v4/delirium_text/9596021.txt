9596021|a|This study evaluated cognitive test performance in African-American and European-American Alzheimer's disease patients with equivalent years of education. Group differences were negligible on a variety of memory, language, and attentional measures, including several widely used neuropsychological tests. Differences between racial groups observed in earlier studies may have stemmed, in part, from differences in education, which may itself serve as a proxy for other potentially important sociologic and health variables.
