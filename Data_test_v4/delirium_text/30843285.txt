30843285|t|A systematic review of MEG-based studies in Parkinson's disease: The motor system and beyond.
30843285|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is accompanied by functional changes throughout the brain, including changes in the electromagnetic activity recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG). An integrated overview of these changes, its relationship with clinical symptoms, and the influence of treatment is currently missing. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the MEG studies that have examined oscillatory activity and functional connectivity in the PD-affected brain. The available articles could be separated into motor network-focused and whole-brain focused studies. Motor network studies revealed PD-related changes in beta band (13-30 Hz) neurophysiological activity within and between several of its components, although it remains elusive to what extent these changes underlie clinical motor symptoms. In whole-brain studies PD-related oscillatory slowing and decrease in functional connectivity correlated with cognitive decline and less strongly with other markers of disease progression. Both approaches offer a different perspective on PD-specific disease mechanisms and could therefore complement each other. Combining the merits of both approaches will improve the setup and interpretation of future studies, which is essential for a better understanding of the disease process itself and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying specific PD symptoms, as well as for the potential to use MEG in clinical care.
