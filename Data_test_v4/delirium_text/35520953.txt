35520953|a|Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) antibody encephalitis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by reduced synaptic activity of the NMDAr due to circulating antibodies that target the NR1 subunit. Few cases of anti-NMDAR encephalitis during pregnancy have been described. The permeation of anti-NR1 antibodies through the placenta can be instrumental in the development of complications in newborns. We describe a case of a young woman suffering from anti-NMDAR encephalitis during the first trimester of pregnancy and focus on diagnostic and therapeutic management.
