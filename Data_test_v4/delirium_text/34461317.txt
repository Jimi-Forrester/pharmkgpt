We assessed the associations of urinary levels of nicotine and its metabolites with cognitive function. METHODS: A total of 553 elder adults at high risk of cognitive impairment and 2212 gender- and age-matched individuals at low risk of cognitive impairment were selected at a ratio of 1: 4 from the remained individuals (n = 6771) who completed the baseline survey of the Shenzhen Ageing-Related Disorder Cohort, after excluding those with either Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's syndrome or stroke as well as those with missing data on variables (including active and passive smoking status, Mini-Cog score). Urinary levels of nicotine and its metabolites and cognitive function for all individuals were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and assessed using the Mini-Cog test, respectively. Associations of urinary levels of nicotine and its metabolites with cognitive function were analyzed by conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: Individuals in the highest tertile of urinary OHCotGluc (OR: 1.52, 95%CI: 1.19-1.93) or NNO (OR: 1.50, 95%CI: 1.16-1.93) levels as well as in the second tertile of urinary  Nic level (OR: 1.43, 95%CI: 1.13-1.82) were at higher risk of cognitive impairment compared with those in the corresponding lowest tertile. Restricted cubic spline models revealed the non-linear dose-response relationships between urinary levels of OHCotGluc, NNO or  Nic and the risk of cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary levels of OHCotGluc, NNO or  Nic exhibited a non-linear dose-response relationship with cognitive function in the urban elderly.
