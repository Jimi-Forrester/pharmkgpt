21280074|t|5-lipoxygenase as an endogenous modulator of amyloid beta formation in vivo.
21280074|a|OBJECTIVE: The 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) enzymatic pathway is widely distributed within the central nervous system, and is upregulated in Alzheimer's disease. However, the mechanism whereby it may influence the disease pathogenesis remains elusive. METHODS: We evaluated the molecular mechanism by which 5-LO regulates amyloid beta (Abeta) formation in vitro and in vivo by pharmacological and genetic approaches. RESULTS: Here we show that 5-LO regulates the formation of Abeta by activating the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), which in turn increases transcription of the gamma-secretase complex. Preventing CREB activation by pharmacologic inhibition or dominant negative mutants blocks the 5-LO-dependent elevation of Abeta formation and the increase of gamma-secretase mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, 5-LO targeted gene disruption or its in vivo selective pharmacological inhibition results in a significant reduction of Abeta, CREB and gamma-secretase levels. INTERPRETATION: These data establish a novel functional role for 5-LO in regulating endogenous formation of Abeta levels in the central nervous system. Thus, 5-LO pharmacological inhibition may be beneficial in the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.
