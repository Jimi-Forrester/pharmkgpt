39766011|t|Clinical Presentation and Integrated Management of Pressure Injuries in the Emergency Hospital Setting: A Plastic Surgeon's Perspective.
39766011|a|Background: Pressure injuries are localized areas of tissue damage or necrosis that occur when pressure is applied to the skin for prolonged periods, often over bony prominences, often the sacrum, heels, ischial tuberosities, and greater trochanters. The pathophysiology is complex, involving a combination of mechanical forces, ischemia, and tissue hypoxia. Methods: We conducted a 2-year retrospective study aiming to assess the clinical characteristics, risk factors, and management of pressure injuries in patients admitted to an emergency hospital who underwent a plastic surgery examination. Results: This study included 176 patients with clinically diagnosed pressure ulcers, with findings showing 28.52% of cases as stage III and 35.57% as stage IV. Common sites included the sacrum (40.94%), ischium (15.1%), and heel (14.43%). The median patient age was 76 years, with 47.15% between 60 and 80 years and 36.93% >= 80 years, often presenting with comorbidities increasing the risk of pressure injuries, such as cardiovascular disease (71.59%), diabetes (18.18%) and obesity (9.66%). Important risk factors included neurological diseases (46.02%), spinal cord injuries (14.7%), and nutritional deficiencies, as indicated by anemia (10.43g/dL; 95% CI [10.04; 10.82]), low serum albumin (2.56 g/dL; 95% CI [2.43; 2.69]) and proteins (5.54 g/dL; 95% CI [5.34; 5.73]). Mortality was significant, at 36.93%, with 23.3% occurring within the first 7 days of hospitalization due to the patients' critical condition. Decision-making for surgical intervention considered the patient's general status, comorbidities, and ulcer severity. Surgical treatment consisted of seriate debridement, negative pressure vacuum therapy, and/or coverage using skin grafting, local advancement, or rotation flaps. Conclusions: The key question for a plastic surgeon to consider is how pressure ulcers should be managed. Various debridement and covering techniques should be tailored to the wound's characteristics, considering patient comorbidities and general health condition.
