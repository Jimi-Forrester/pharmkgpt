37386798|a|Psychotic symptoms are increasingly recognized as a distinguishing clinical feature in patients with dementia due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP). Within this group, carriers of the C9orf72 repeat expansion are particularly prone to develop delusions and hallucinations. The present retrospective study sought to provide novel details about the relationship between FTLD-TDP pathology and the presence of psychotic symptoms during life. We found that FTLD-TDP subtype B was more frequent in patients with psychotic symptoms than in those without. This relationship was present even when corrected for the presence of C9orf72 mutation, suggesting that pathophysiological processes leading to the development of subtype B pathology may increase the risk of psychotic symptoms. Within the group of FTLD-TDP cases with subtype B pathology, psychotic symptoms tended to be associated with a greater burden of TDP-43 pathology in the white matter and a lower burden in lower motor neurons. When present, pathological involvement of motor neurons was more likely to be asymptomatic in patients with psychosis.
