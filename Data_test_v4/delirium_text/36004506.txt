36004506|t|Single-molecule imaging reveals Tau trapping at nanometer-sized dynamic hot spots near the plasma membrane that persists after microtubule perturbation and cholesterol depletion.
36004506|a|Accumulation of aggregates of the microtubule-binding protein Tau is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. While Tau is thought to primarily associate with microtubules, it also interacts with and localizes to the plasma membrane. However, little is known about how Tau behaves and organizes at the plasma membrane of live cells. Using quantitative, single-molecule imaging, we show that Tau exhibits spatial and kinetic heterogeneity near the plasma membrane of live cells, resulting in the formation of nanometer-sized hot spots. The hot spots lasted tens of seconds, much longer than the short dwell time (~ 40 ms) of Tau on microtubules. Pharmacological and biochemical disruption of Tau/microtubule interactions did not prevent hot spot formation, suggesting that these are different from the reported Tau condensation on microtubules. Although cholesterol removal has been shown to reduce Tau pathology, its acute depletion did not affect Tau hot spot dynamics. Our study identifies an intrinsic dynamic property of Tau near the plasma membrane that may facilitate the formation of assembly sites for Tau to assume its physiological and pathological functions.
