34680129|t|Relationship between Cerebrospinal Fluid Matrix Metalloproteinases Levels and Brain Amyloid Deposition in Mild Cognitive Impairment.
34680129|a|This study aimed to explore whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and their inhibitors (TIMPs) were associated with brain amyloid deposition, cortical glucose metabolism, and white matter lesions (WMLs) in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A total of 33 individuals with amnestic MCI (mean age, 75.6 years) underwent 11C-Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET), 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, and CSF analysis. PET uptake of the frontal and temporoparietal lobes and posterior cingulate gyrus was assessed using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. WMLs were assessed by the Fazekas scale. CSF levels of MMPs and TIMPs were measured with bead-based multiplex assays. After adjusting for covariates, multiple linear regression analysis showed that CSF levels of MMP-2 were negatively correlated with global PiB uptake (p = 0.035), especially in the parietotemporal lobe and posterior cingulate gyrus (p = 0.016 and p = 0.041, respectively). Moreover, CSF levels of MMP-7 were positively correlated with the severity of WMLs (p = 0.033). CSF levels of MMP-2 and MMP-7 are associated with brain amyloid deposition and severity of WMLs, respectively. These findings provide valuable insights into the role of MMPs in amyloid beta catabolism and blood-brain barrier integration at the MCI stage.
