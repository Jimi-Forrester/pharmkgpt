31825337|t|[Differential diagnosis of neurological conditions in cardiac patients on the first day after cardiac, ascending aortic and aortic arch surgery and repair of internal carotid arteries].
31825337|a|The review is devoted to analysis of current trends in interdisciplinary approach to the differential diagnosis of patients' conditions on the first day after cardiac, ascending aortic and aortic arch surgery and repair of internal carotid arteries (neurological disorders, delirium, cognitive dysfunction, psycho-emotional disorders, postoperative sedation). This approach is valuable to determine the prognosis and timely treatment. The basic concepts reflecting the discussion between neurologists, cardiovascular surgeons, anesthetists, radiation diagnostics specialists and rehabilitators are summarized. The authors concluded that timely and correct differential diagnosis of the states on the first postoperative day using current tests and interdisciplinary approach to the treatment of patients with postoperative impaired consciousness or neurological/psycho-emotional dysfunction can improve their quality of life and efficiency of medical care.
