34235635|t|Brain Acetyl-CoA Production and Phosphorylation of Cytoskeletal Proteins Are Targets of CYP46A1 Activity Modulation and Altered Sterol Flux.
34235635|a|Cholesterol and 24-hydroxycholesterol are the most abundant brain sterols and represent the substrate and product, respectively, of cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1), a CNS-specific enzyme. CYP46A1 controls cholesterol elimination and turnover in the brain, the two processes that determine the rate of brain sterol flux through the plasma membranes and thereby the properties of these membranes. Brain sterol flux is decreased in Cyp46a1-/- mice compared to wild-type mice and increased in 5XFAD mice (a model of Alzheimer's disease) when they are treated with a small dose of efavirenz, a CYP46A1 activator. Herein, we first assessed the brain proteome (synaptosomal fractions) and phospho-proteome (synaptosomal fractions and brain homogenates) of efavirenz-treated and control 5XFAD mice. Then, based on the pattern of protein abundance change, we conducted acetyl-CoA measurements (brain homogenates and mitochondria) and metabolic profiling (brain homogenates). The phospho-proteomics datasets were used for comparative analyses with the datasets obtained by us previously on mice with the same changes (efavirenz-treated and control 5XFAD mice from a different treatment paradigm) or with changes in the opposite direction (Cyp46a1-/- vs wild-type mice) in brain sterol flux. We found that CYP46A1 activity or the rate of brain sterol flux affects acetyl-CoA-related metabolic pathways as well as phosphorylation of cytoskeletal and other proteins. Knowledge of the key roles of acetyl-CoA and cytoskeletal phosphorylation in cell biology expands our understanding of the significance of CYP46A1-mediated cholesterol 24-hydroxylation in the brain and provides an additional explanation for why CYP46A1 activity modulations are beneficial in mouse models of different brain diseases.
