36278352|t|A Conceptual Study on the Peripheral Clearance of Brain-Derived alpha-Synuclein in Humans.
36278352|a|BACKGROUND: Abnormal intracellular expression and aggregation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is the histopathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases especially Parkinson's disease. However, safe and efficient approaches to clear alpha-syn remain unavailable. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the process of peripheral catabolism of brain-derived alpha-syn. METHODS: Thirty patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) (left accessory pathways) who underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) were enrolled in this study. Blood was collected via catheters from superior vena cava (SVC), inferior vena cava (IVC) proximal to the hepatic vein (HV), the right femoral vein (FV), and femoral artery (FA) simultaneously during RFCA. Plasma alpha-syn levels of AVRT patients and soluble alpha-syn levels of the brain samples were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. RESULTS: The alpha-syn concentrations in different locations of veins were divided by time-matched arterial alpha-syn concentrations to generate the venous/arterial (V/A) ratio. The V/A ratio of alpha-syn from the SVC was 1.204 (1.069-1.339, 95% CI), while the V/A ratio of alpha-syn from IVC was 0.831 (0.734-0.928, 95% CI), suggesting that brain-derived alpha-syn in the arterial blood was physiologically cleared while going through the peripheral organs and tissues. And it was estimated that about half of brain soluble alpha-syn could efflux and be cleared in the periphery. Moreover, the glomerular filtration rate was found correlated with V-A difference (FA-ICV) (p = 0.0272). CONCLUSION: Under physiological conditions, brain-derived alpha-syn could efflux into and be catabolized by the peripheral system. The kidney may play a potential role in the clearance of alpha-syn.
