12239221|t|A CD36-initiated signaling cascade mediates inflammatory effects of beta-amyloid.
12239221|a|beta-Amyloid accumulation is associated with pathologic changes in the brain in Alzheimer's disease and has recently been identified in plaques of another chronic inflammatory disorder, atherosclerosis. The class B scavenger receptor, CD36, mediates binding of fibrillar beta-amyloid to cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, including brain macrophages (microglia). In this study, we demonstrate that in microglia and other tissue macrophages, beta-amyloid initiates a CD36-dependent signaling cascade involving the Src kinase family members, Lyn and Fyn, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase, p44/42. Interruption of this signaling cascade, through targeted disruption of Src kinases downstream of CD36, inhibits macrophage inflammatory responses to beta-amyloid, including reactive oxygen and chemokine production, and results in decreased recruitment of microglia to sites of amyloid deposition in vivo. The finding that engagement of CD36 by beta-amyloid initiates a Src kinase-dependent production of inflammatory mediators in cells of the macrophage lineage reveals a novel receptor-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling pathway of potential therapeutic importance.
