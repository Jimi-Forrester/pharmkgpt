33105491|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are a group of neurological diseases caused by the progressive degeneration of neurons and glial cells in the brain and spinal cords. Usually there is a selective loss of specific neuronal cells in a restricted brain area from any neurodegenerative diseases, such as dopamine (DA) neuron death in Parkinson disease (PD) and motor neuron loss in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or a widespread degeneration affecting many types of neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD). As there is no effective treatment to stop the progression of these neurodegenerative diseases, stem cell-based therapies have provided great potentials for these disorders. Currently transplantation of different stem cells or their derivatives has improved neural function in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases by replacing the lost neural cells, releasing cytokines, modulation of inflammation, and mediating remyelination. With the advance in somatic cell reprogramming to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) and directly induced neural stem cells or neurons, pluripotent stem cell can be induced to differentiate to any kind of neural cells and overcome the immune rejection of the allogeneic transplantation. Recent studies have proved the effectiveness of transplanted stem cells in animal studies and some clinical trials on patients with NDs. However, some significant hurdles need to be resolved before these preclinical results can be translated to clinic. In particular, we need to better understand the molecular mechanisms of stem cell transplantation and develop new approaches to increase the directed neural differentiation, migration, survival, and functional connections of transplanted stem cells in the pathological environment of the patient's central nerve system.
