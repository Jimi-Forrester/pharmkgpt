35599489|t|The Correlations of Plasma Liver-Type Fatty Acid-Binding Protein with Amyloid-beta and Tau Levels in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.
35599489|a|BACKGROUND: The dysregulation of lipid metabolism plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP, also known as FABP1) is critical for fatty acid transport and may be involved in AD. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the FABP1 level is altered in patients with AD, and its associations with levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a Chinese cohort consisting of 39 cognitively normal controls and 47 patients with AD. The levels of FABP1 in plasma, and Abeta and tau in CSF, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A single-molecule array (SIMOA) was used to detect plasma Abeta levels. RESULTS: The level of plasma FABP1 was significantly elevated in the AD group (p = 0.0109). Further analysis showed a positive correlation of FABP1 with CSF total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels. Besides, plasma FABP1/Abeta42 (AUC = 0.6794, p = 0.0071) and FABP1/t-tau (AUC = 0.7168, p = 0.0011) showed fair diagnostic efficacy for AD. When combined with other common AD biomarkers including plasma Abeta42, Abeta40, and t-tau, both FABP1/Abeta42 and FABP1/t-tau showed better diagnostic efficacy than using these biomarkers alone. Among all AUC analyses, the combination of plasma FABP1/t-tau and Abeta42 had the highest diagnostic value (AUC = 0.8075, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that FABP1 may play a role in AD pathogenesis and be worthy of further investigation in the future.
