36155511|a|We examined amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration biomarker effects on cognition in a Southeast-Asian cohort of 84 sporadic young-onset dementia (YOD; age-at-onset <65 years) patients. They were stratified into A+N+, A- N+, and A- N- profiles via cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta1-42 (A), phosphorylated-tau (T), MRI medial temporal atrophy (neurodegeneration- N), and confluent white matter hyperintensities cerebrovascular disease (CVD). A, T, and CVD effects on longitudinal Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were evaluated. A+N+ patients demonstrated steeper MMSE decline than A- N+ (beta = 1.53; p = 0.036; CI 0.15:2.92) and A- N- (beta = 4.68; p = 0.001; CI 1.98:7.38) over a mean follow-up of 1.24 years. Within A- N+, T- CVD+ patients showed greater MMSE decline compared to T+CVD- patients (beta = - 2.37; p = 0.030; CI - 4.41:- 0.39). A+ results in significant cognitive decline, while CVD influences longitudinal cognition in the A- sub-group.
