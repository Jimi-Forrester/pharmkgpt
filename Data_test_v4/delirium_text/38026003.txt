38026003|a|The neonatal period represents a critical stage for the establishment and development of the gut microbiota, which profoundly influences the future health trajectory of individuals. This review examines the importance of intestinal microbiota in humans and dogs, aiming to elucidate the distinct characteristics and variations in the composition between these two species. In humans, the intestinal microbiota contributes to several crucial physiological processes, including digestion, nutrient absorption, immune system development, and modulation of host metabolism. Dysbiosis, an imbalance or disruption of the gut microbial community, has been linked to various disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and even neurological conditions. Furthermore, recent research has unveiled the profound influence of the gut-brain axis, emphasizing the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, impacting cognitive function and mental health. Similarly, alterations in the canine intestinal microbiota have been associated with gastrointestinal disorders, including chronic enteropathy, such as inflammatory bowel disease, food allergies, and ulcerative histiocytic colitis. However, our understanding of the intricacies and functional significance of the intestinal microbiota in dogs remains limited. Understanding the complex dynamics of the intestinal microbiota in both humans and dogs is crucial for devising effective strategies to promote health and manage disease. Moreover, exploring the similarities and differences in the gut microbial composition between these two species can facilitate translational research, potentially leading to innovative therapeutic interventions and strategies to enhance the well-being of both humans and dogs.
