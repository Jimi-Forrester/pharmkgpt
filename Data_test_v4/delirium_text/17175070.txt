17175070|t|Lack of association of hepatic lipase polymorphisms with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
17175070|a|Several polymorphisms in hepatic lipase (LIPC) are similar to apoE4 because they associate with cholesterol concentrations and, for rs6084, coronary artery disease (CAD). Since apoE4 is also a primary genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), LIPC single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s represent excellent candidates for LOAD association studies. Because this issue has not been addressed previously, we evaluated LIPC SNP association with LOAD. In a population from the Religious Orders Study (ROS), rs6084 was nominally associated with LOAD odds (p=0.015 by chi(2) test). However, this association was not confirmed in two subsequent series based at the University of Kentucky (UKY, p=0.15) or the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville (MCJ, p=0.97). Hence, rs6084 is not consistently associated with LOAD.
