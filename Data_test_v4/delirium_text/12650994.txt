12650994|a|Alzheimer's disease and normal aging may impair retrograde transport of nerve growth factor (NGF) from cortical areas to basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. We demonstrate a relationship between performance in a spatial reference memory task and NGF distribution in the aged rat brain. In addition, exogenous NGF restored endogenous NGF distribution in cognitively impaired aged rats. These data suggest that NGF administration restores utilization of endogenous growth factor in the brain of cognitively impaired aged rats.
