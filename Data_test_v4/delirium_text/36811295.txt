36811295|t|Paths to hippocampal damage in NMOSD.
36811295|a|AIMS: Many patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) suffer from cognitive impairment affecting memory, processing speed, and attention, and suffer from depressive symptoms. Since some of these manifestations could trace back to the hippocampus, several magnetic resonance imaging studies have been performed in the past, with a number of groups describing volume loss of the hippocampus in NMOSD patients, while others did not observe such changes. Here, we addressed these discrepancies. METHODS: We performed pathological and MRI studies on the hippocampi of NMOSD patients, combined with detailed immunohistochemical analysis of hippocampi from experimental models of NMOSD. RESULTS: We identified different pathological scenarios for hippocampal damage in NMOSD and its experimental models. In the first case, the hippocampus was compromised by the initiation of astrocyte injury in this brain region and subsequent local effects of microglial activation and neuronal damage. In the second case, loss of hippocampal volume was seen by MRI in patients with large tissue-destructive lesions in the optic nerves or the spinal cord, and the pathological work-up of tissue derived from a patient with such lesions revealed subsequent retrograde neuronal degeneration affecting different axonal tracts and neuronal networks. It remains to be seen whether remote lesions and associated retrograde neuronal degeneration on their own are sufficient to cause extensive volume loss of the hippocampus, or whether they act in concert with small astrocyte-destructive, microglia-activating lesions in the hippocampus which escape detection by MRI, either due to their small size or due to the chosen time window for examination. CONCLUSIONS: Different pathological scenarios can culminate in hippocampal volume loss in NMOSD patients.
