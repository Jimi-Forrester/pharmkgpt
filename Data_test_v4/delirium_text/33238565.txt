33238565|t|Low Tongue Strength and the Number of Teeth Present Are Associated with Cognitive Decline in Older Japanese Dental Outpatients: A Cross-Sectional Study.
33238565|a|To mitigate the impact of dementia, initiating early intervention is important. This study aims to investigate the associations between deterioration in oral function and cognitive decline in older outpatients whose oral health was maintained in the dental clinic. This study included 50 outpatients aged >=65 years. We used the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-J) to assess cognitive decline. Oral function was evaluated by tongue pressure, masticatory performance, and swallowing ability. A full-mouth periodontal examination was conducted, and the occlusal support and number of teeth were recorded. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cognitive decline (MoCA-J score <= 25 points) were calculated using logistic regression models. The age, number of teeth, tongue pressure, and masticatory performance were significantly correlated with cognitive decline (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analyses revealed that cognitive decline was independently associated with age (OR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.03-1.52; p = 0.024), number of teeth (OR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.76-1.00; p = 0.047), and lower tongue pressure (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.77-0.98; p = 0.022). Lower tongue pressure and a small number of remaining teeth may be associated with cognitive decline in Japanese outpatients.
