29318512|t|Health status of older cancer survivors-results of the PolSenior study.
29318512|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to characterize health status of older cancer survivors using data from the population-based PolSenior study. METHODS: We compared cancer survivors and non-cancer subjects according to comorbidities, functional status, mental health, and sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: There were 286 (5.8%) cancer survivors in a population of 4943 adults aged 65 years and older. The mean age of cancer survivors was 79.4 +- 8.2 years and the median time since cancer diagnosis was 8.5 years (Q1-Q3: 4-16 years). After adjustment for age, sex, education, marital status, and number of comorbidities, compared with a non-cancer population, cancer survivors were more likely to experience falls (OR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.04-1.83), and to report poor health (OR = 1.49; 95%CI: 1.83-2.06), but cancer survivorship was not associated with impairments in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Age and university education, but neither the time from cancer diagnosis nor the number of comorbidities, were associated with impairments in cancer survivors. Three or more chronic diseases were found in over 50% of cancer survivors and in 38% of the non-cancer population (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors over the age of 65 years have a higher prevalence of falls, are more likely to report poor health status, and have a higher number of chronic conditions than the non-cancer population, but they maintain independence in IADLs. Advanced age and elementary education are associated with increased occurrence of functional impairments in older cancer survivors IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Older cancer survivors may require preventive services to reduce the risk of functional decline.
