29499939|a|Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is a kind of non-coding RNA (ncRNA), with a length of 200 nt to 100 kb, that lacks a significant open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein. lncRNAs are widely implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, such as epigenetic regulation, cell cycle regulation, cell differentiation regulation, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, through their interactions with chromatin, protein, and other RNAs. Numerous studies have suggested that lncRNAs are closely linked with the occurrence and development of a variety of diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases, of which the etiologies are complicated and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Determining the roles of lncRNA in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases will not only deepen understanding of the physiological and pathological processes that occur in those diseases but also provide new ideas and solutions for their diagnosis and prevention. This review aims to highlight the progress of lncRNA research in the pathological and behavioral changes of neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we focus on how lncRNA dysfunctions are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
