36993868|t|Shared and disease-specific glial gene expression changes in neurodegenerative diseases.
36993868|a|We found evolutionarily conserved astrocyte and microglia subpopulations shared across multiple brain regions. We reveal similarities and differences between Alzheimer's disease glia and Parkinson's disease glia, as well as regional variance linked to disease pathology and neurodegeneration.
