35911542|a|Background: Older people with high cardiovascular risk, including those without cardiovascular diseases, are an at-risk population for dementia. Regular physical activity is generally recommended to maintain brain health; however, the optimal intensity of physical activity for maintaining brain volume in older adults with cardiovascular risk remains unclear. We examined the associations between intensity-specific physical activity and brain volume stratified by absolute cardiovascular risk level in older adults without cardiovascular diseases. Methods and results: This cross-sectional study involved 725 community-dwelling older Japanese adults without cardiovascular diseases. We estimated absolute cardiovascular risk using the World Health Organization risk estimation charts, which include variables such as age, sex, diabetes mellitus, smoking, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol, and stratified cardiovascular risk level into three risk categories: low (<= 9%), moderate (10-14%), and high (>=15%). We measured daily physical activity using a triaxial accelerometer, and calculated the average time spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) and light intensity physical activity (LPA). We performed brain T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and calculated the volume of the cortical gray matter, subcortical gray matter, and cerebral white matter, using the FreeSurfer software. In the overall sample, multivariable linear regression analysis showed that greater MVPA was significantly associated with greater volume of the cortical gray matter and cerebral white matter, and greater LPA was significantly associated with greater volume of the cerebral white matter. Additionally, in the analysis of the sample stratified by absolute cardiovascular risk level, cerebral white matter volume was significantly associated with both MVPA and LPA in the high cardiovascular risk group. Conclusions: The association between physical activity and brain volume differed according to cardiovascular risk level in community-dwelling older adults. In a population at high cardiovascular risk, maintaining or increasing LPA might be a practical and achievable strategy for healthy brain aging.
