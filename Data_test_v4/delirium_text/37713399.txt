37713399|t|Neuroprognostication value of serum neurofilament light chain for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
37713399|a|BACKGROUND: Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a novel biomarker for the assessment of neurological function after cardiac arrest (CA). Although meta-analysis has confirmed its predictive value, it has not conducted a more detailed analysis of its research. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between serum NfL level and neurological prognosis in patients with spontaneous circulation recovery after CA, and subgroup analysis was conducted according to sample collection time, time to assess neurological function, study design, whether TTM was received, the method of specimen determination, and the presence of neurological disease in patients. To analyze the influence of these factors on the predictive value of serum NfL. METHODS: Published Cochrane reviews and an updated, extended search of MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, ClinicalKey, CINAHL, and Web of Science for relevant studies until March 2022 were assessed through inclusion and exclusion criteria. The standard mean difference and 95% confidence interval were calculated using the random-effects model or fixed-effects model to assess the association between one variable factor NfL level and the outcome of CA patients. Subgroup analysis according to sample collection time was performed. The prognosis analysis and publication bias were also assessed using Egger's and Begg's tests. RESULTS: Among 1209 related articles for screening, 6 studies (1360 patients) met the inclusion criteria and were selected for meta-analysis. The level of serum NfL in the good prognosis group (CPC1-2, CPC: cerebral performance category score) was significantly lower than that in the poor prognosis group (CPC3-5)SMD(standardized mean difference) = 0.553, 95%CI(confidence interval) = 0.418-0.687, I2 = 65.5% P<0.05). And this relationship also exists at each sampling time point (NfL specimens were collected on admission: SMD:0.48,95%CI:0.24-0.73; Samples were collected 24 hours after CA: SMD:0.60,95%CI:0.32-0.88;Specimens were obtained 48 hours after CA: SMD:0.51, 95%CI:0.18-0.85;Specimens were obtained 72 hours after CA: SMD:0.59, 95%CI:0.38-0.81). CONCLUSION: NfL may play a potential neuroprognostication role in postcardiac arrest patients with spontaneous circulation, regardless of when the sample was collected after CA.
