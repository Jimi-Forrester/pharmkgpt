35020769|a|BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis patients who undergo surgery have a high risk of postoperative complications. The aim of this study was to determine whether colon cancer surgery can be safely performed in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included 1372 patients who underwent elective curative resection surgery for colon cancer between April 2016 and March 2020. RESULTS: Of the total patients, 19 (1.4%) underwent hemodialysis, of whom 19 (100%) had poor performance status and 18 had comorbidities (94.7%). Minimally invasive surgery was performed in 78.9% of hemodialysis patients. The postoperative complication rate was significantly higher in hemodialysis than non-hemodialysis patients (36.8% vs. 15.5%, p = 0.009). All postoperative complications in the hemodialysis patients were infectious type. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant association of hemodialysis with complications (odds ratio, 2.9362; 95%CI, 1.1384-7.5730; p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: Despite recent advances in perioperative management and minimally invasive surgery, it is necessary to be aware that short-term complications can still occur, especially infectious complications in hemodialysis patients.
