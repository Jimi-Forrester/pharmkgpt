38323266|a|Background: Organophosphorus (OP) and carbamate poisoning are significant concerns in developing nations. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the ChE check mobile, a cholinesterase-rapid bedside diagnostic test, in the diagnosis and management of OP and carbamate poisoning. Materials and methods: We conducted this prospective observational study, involving patients with OP and carbamate poisoning over 1 year (June 2016 to June 2017) at a single tertiary care center. Levels of RBC cholinesterase (E-AChE), butyl cholinesterase (BChE), and various other determinants were systematically coded and analyzed. Results: The study population (n = 60) consisted primarily of males (n = 43; 71.7%), with a mean age of 30.6 (SD: 13.7) years. Monocrotophos (n = 10; 20.4%) and carbofuran (n = 4; 8.1%) were the commonest OP and carbamate compounds, respectively. The median initial atropinization dose was 10 (IQR: 0, 61.5) mg, with a median total administered atropine dose of 116 (IQR: 32, 320) mg. A significant negative correlation was found between E-AChE levels and both the initial atropinization dose (rho: -0.653, p-value < 0.001) and total atropine requirement (rho: -0.659, p-value < 0.001) during admission. An E-AChE cut-off of 4 units/g hemoglobin provided an area under the curve of 0.73 (sensitivity: 80.0%, specificity: 68.6%, p-value < 0.001) for predicting moderate to severe peradeniya organophosphorus poisoning. Conclusion: The check mobile device can be a valuable tool for prognosticating patients. There was a significant correlation between low E-AChE levels and the atropine requirement and severity.
