35878793|t|Role of Shankhpushpi (Convolvulus pluricaulis) in neurological disorders: An umbrella review covering evidence from ethnopharmacology to clinical studies.
35878793|a|C. pluricaulis Choisy (C. pluricaulis), a perennial herb aka C. microphyllus Sieb. and C. Prostratus Forsk. is being used as a traditional folk medicine for a variety of ailments. In this article, we collected information about C. pluricaulis through electronic search using PubMed, SciFinder, Google Scholar, and Web of Science as well as network pharmacology is done. This comprehensive review sheds light on the plant profile, phytochemistry, neuropharmacological, and toxicological data of C. pluricaulis. The crude herb and its metabolites have exhibited a wide range of in vitro and in vivo neuropharmacological effects, including memory enhancement, anxiolytic, tranquilizing, anti-depressant, anti-stress, neurodegenerative, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, analgesic, sedative, anti-convulsant, and Alzheimer's disease-reversing effects. Network pharmacology results indicate that compounds from C. pluricaulis interact with various proteins, neuro synapses, signaling pathways, and serotonergic synapse which plays a crucial role in neurotransmission, Alzheimer's disease, long-term depression, addictions to alcohol, cognitive disorders, psychological conditions, and increasing serotonin concentration in synapses.
