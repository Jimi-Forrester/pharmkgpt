36174432|a|PURPOSE: Few quality improvement tools specific to patients with persistent or chronic critical illness exist to aid delivery of high-quality care. Using experience-based co-design methods, we sought consensus from key stakeholders on the most important actionable processes of care for inclusion in a quality improvement checklist. METHODS: Item generation methods: systematic review, semi-structured interviews (ICU survivors and family) members, touchpoint video creation, and semi-structured interviews (ICU clinicians). Consensus methods: modified online Delphi and a virtual meeting using nominal group technique methods. RESULTS: We enrolled 138 ICU interprofessional team, patients, and family members. We obtained consensus on a quality improvement checklist comprising 11 core domains: patient and family involvement in decision-making; patient communication; physical comfort and complication prevention; promoting self-care and normalcy; ventilator weaning; physical therapy; swallowing; pharmacotherapy; psychological issues; delirium; and appropriate referrals. An additional 27 actionable processes are contained within 6 core domains that provide more specific direction on the actionable process to be targeted. CONCLUSIONS: Using a highly collaborative and methodologically rigorous process, we generated a quality improvement checklist of actionable processes to improve patient and family-centred care considered important by key stakeholders. Future research is needed to understand optimal implementation strategies and impact on outcomes and experience.
