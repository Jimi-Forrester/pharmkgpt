31572642|t|Pimavanserin in Parkinson's Disease-induced Psychosis: A Literature Review.
31572642|a|Pimavanserin was approved for treating Parkinson's disease (PD) psychosis, based upon 21 completed studies. This review article is to understand PD psychosis and assess the efficacy and safety of pimavanserin. A literature search was carried out using the keyword "pimavanserin" and cross-referencing it with PD, psychosis, efficacy, safety and clinical trial. Participants in pimavanserin group were associated with a 5.79-point decrease in symptoms for PD psychosis (SAPS-PD) scale compared to the 2.73-point decrease seen in the placebo group (P < .001). There were statistically significant improvements in the persecutory delusions, ideas of reference, and global ratings of delusions in pimavanserin group. Pimavanserin was well tolerated with no significant adverse events or worsening of motor function. Pimavanserin at 34 mg daily was shown to be effective for PD-induced psychosis in past clinical trials.
