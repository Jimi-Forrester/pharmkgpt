33024810|t|Anosognosia in dementia: A review of current assessment instruments.
33024810|a|INTRODUCTION: Anosognosia is a common but underrated symptom in dementia and has significant impact on both patients and caregivers. A proper evaluation of anosognosia is therefore desirable. There are three common methods to determine anosognosia: (1) clinical rating, (2) patient-caregiver discrepancies, and (3) prediction of performance discrepancies. Each of them includes different instruments. This review gives an overview of the current instruments used for the assessment of anosognosia in patients with dementia and aims to determine the most suitable instrument for routine use in clinical practice. METHODS: A search of the literature in PubMed was performed. Furthermore, electronic databases (PsycINFo, ClinicalKey, and Cochrane Library) and reference lists were searched for additional articles. RESULTS: Forty-six articles were included in this study, comprising 10 clinical rating instruments, 25 patient-caregiver discrepancy instruments, and 14 prediction-performance discrepancy instruments. For every publication, the aims of the study, the included population, the assessment instrument used, the assessed domains, and the psychometric properties of the assessment instruments are described. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is no consensus on the most suitable method to determine anosognosia in dementia. We recommend the Clinical Insight Rating scale and the Abridged Anosognosia Questionnaire-Dementia as the most appropriate for routine use in clinical practice.
