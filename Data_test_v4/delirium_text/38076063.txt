38076063|a|The brain is a complex organ demonstrated by the occurrence of specific types of functional lipids. Despite some studies focusing on providing the animal brain lipid signature, there are limited studies focusing on the comprehensive and regiospecific characterization of multiple animal brain lipidome. Herein we characterized about 294 lipid molecular species from six different lipid classes in different portions of the brain after fixation from mammals of different habitats, fully-aquatic (n = 6), semi-aquatic (n = 6), and terrestrial (n = 4), using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The untargeted brain lipid profiling revealed a significant difference in total lipid levels between fully-aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial mammals. The polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol esters are abundant in brain tissue of semi-aquatic followed by fully-aquatic mammals whereas phosphatidylethanolamines are profoundly high in terrestrial species. The regiospecific analysis revealed a predominance of sphingolipids in all the groups but no significant differences were observed between the different portions of the brain such as the cerebellum, cortex, pons, spinal cord, and thalamus. Interestingly the multivariate analysis showed almost the same lipid compositions in the spinal cord and thalamus of terrestrial mammals. Overall, this is the first report to compare the comprehensive brain-lipidome among different mammalian groups inhabiting three distinct habitats. These results indicate that the brain lipid composition is specific to the animal habitat.
