32557251|a|PURPOSE: Hip fractures in older persons are associated with reduced mobility and loss of independence. Few studies address the nutritional status and mobility in the early phase after hip fracture. The objective of the present study was, therefore, to investigate weight changes and their effect on mobility during the first two months following hip fracture in community-dwelling older persons without dementia. METHODS: Patients (> 60 years) admitted for a first hip fracture were recruited from two tertiary referral hospitals in Bergen, Norway. The patients' weights and dietary intakes were determined in the hospital and at home after two months. Mobility was assessed based on the New Mobility Score (NMS) (scale 0-9, with values > 5 regarded as sufficient mobility). RESULTS: We included 64 patients (median age 80 years, 48 women, 16 men) with information on weight collected in the hospital. Follow-up measurements were available for 32 patients, corresponding to an attrition rate of 50%. The patients had a median weight loss of 1.8 kg (IQR = - 3.7, 0 kg). Most of them had reduced mobility at two months after the surgery [median NMS = 5 (IQR = 3-6)]. Both age and the weight change after surgery were predictors of the NMS at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Bodyweight loss was observed in three out of four patients in the early phase after hip fracture and was associated with decreased mobility measured by the NMS. The results should be interpreted with caution as half of the patients dropped out of the study and did not participate in the follow-up visit.
