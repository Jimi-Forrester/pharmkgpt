8965973|t|[Extrapyramidal signs in Alzheimer's disease].
8965973|a|Extrapyramidal signs were assessed in 112 patients satisfying NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease. They were present in 50% of the patients. The most common features of them were bradykinesia and rigidity. Resting tremor was rarely encountered. There were no significant differences in age of onset, symptom duration, presence of primitive reflexes and psychotic symptoms between cases with and without extrapyramidal signs, while the presence of extrapyramidal signs was associated with statistically significant greater dementia severity.
