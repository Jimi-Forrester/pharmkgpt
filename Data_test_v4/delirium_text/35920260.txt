35920260|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) drugs in therapy are limited to acetylcholine esterase inhibitors and memantine. Newly developed drugs against a single target structure have an insufficient effect on symptomatic AD patients. Results: Novel aromatically anellated pyridofuranes have been evaluated for inhibition of AD-relevant protein kinases cdk1, cdk2, gsk-3b and Fyn. Best activities have been found for naphthopyridofuranes with a hydroxyl function as part of the 5-substituent and a hydrogen or halogen substituent in the 8-position. Best results in nanomolar ranges were found for benzopyridofuranes with a 6-hydroxy and a 3-alkoxy substitution or an exclusive 6-alkoxy substituent. Conclusion: First lead compounds were identified inhibiting two to three kinases in nanomolar ranges to be qualified as an innovative approach for AD multitargeting.
