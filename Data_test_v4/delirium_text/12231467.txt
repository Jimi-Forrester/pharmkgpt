12231467|a|Stimulation of serotonin receptor subtypes 5-HT(2A) or 5-HT(2C) in stably transfected 3T3 cells by dexnorfenfluramine (DEXNOR) or serotonin increases secretion of the APP metabolite APP(s). It is not known whether activation of these receptors can also affect APP metabolism in vivo. We examined the effects of a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of DEXNOR on APP(s) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of guinea pigs. These levels were significantly (P<0.05) increased by a single dose of DEXNOR (1-4 mg/kg); those of the APP metabolites Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) were unaffected. The DEXNOR-induced (1 mg/kg) increases in CSF APP(s) were suppressed by ritanserin (1 mg/kg) but not by ketanserin (2 mg/kg). When given alone, ritanserin did not affect CSF levels of APP(s), Abeta(1-40), or Abeta(1-42). Chronic treatment with DEXNOR for 9 days (1 mg/kg bid, i.p.) increased CSF APP(s) levels, measured 2 h after the last injection (P<0.05), and decreased those of CSF Abeta(1-42) (P<0.05). Neither hippocampal nor cortical levels of the APP holoprotein (APP(h)), nor body weight, were affected by DEXNOR. Chronic administration of mCPP (1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine) (2 mg/kg bid, i.p.), a 5-HT(2B/2C) agonist, for 9 days also increased CSF APP(s) levels (P<0.5) when measured 2 h after the drug's last administration; hippocampal and cortical APP(h) levels were unaffected. However, mCPP also caused a significant decrease in body weight gain. These data indicate that the pharmacological activation of 5-HT(2C) receptors can stimulate CSF APP(s) secretion and reduce Abeta production in vivo. Hence 5-HT(2C) receptors, which apparently are localized to the brain, may represent useful targets for the development of treatments for Alzheimer's disease.
