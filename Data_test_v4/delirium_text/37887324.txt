37887324|a|Cerebral injury is a leading cause of long-term disability and mortality. Common causes include major cardiovascular events, such as cardiac arrest, ischemic stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative as well as neuroinflammatory disorders. Despite improvements in pharmacological and interventional treatment options, due to the brain's limited regeneration potential, survival is often associated with the impairment of crucial functions that lead to occupational inability and enormous economic burden. For decades, researchers have therefore been investigating adjuvant therapeutic options to alleviate neuronal cell death. Although promising in preclinical studies, a huge variety of drugs thought to provide neuroprotective effects failed in clinical trials. However, utilizing medical gases, noble gases, and gaseous molecules as supportive treatment options may offer new perspectives for patients suffering neuronal damage. This review provides an overview of current research, potentials and mechanisms of these substances as a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of cerebral injury.
