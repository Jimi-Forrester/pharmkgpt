20842634|t|His-tag binding by antibody C706 mimics beta-amyloid recognition.
20842634|a|Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by extracellular deposits of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques. Aggregation of the Abeta(42) peptide leading to plaque formation is believed to play a central role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies can reduce amyloid plaques and could possibly be used for immunotherapy. We have developed a monoclonal antibody C706, which recognizes the human Abeta peptide. Here we report the crystal structure of the antibody Fab fragment at 1.7 A resolution. The structure was determined in two crystal forms, P2(1) and C2. Although the Fab was crystallized in the presence of Abeta(16), no peptide was observed in the crystals. The antigen-binding site is blocked by the hexahistidine tag of another Fab molecule in both crystal forms. The poly-His peptide in an extended conformation occupies a crevice between the light and heavy chains of the variable domain. Two consecutive histidines (His4-His5) stack against tryptophan residues in the central pocket of the antigen-binding surface. In addition, they form hydrogen bonds to the acidic residues at the bottom of the pocket. The mode of his-tag binding by C706 resembles the Abeta recognition by antibodies PFA1 and WO2. All three antibodies recognize the same immunodominant B-cell epitope of Abeta. By similarity, residues Phe-Arg-His of Abeta would be a major portion of the C706 epitope.
