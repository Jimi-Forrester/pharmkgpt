37901077|t|Markers of schizophrenia at the prosody/pragmatics interface. Evidence from corpora of spontaneous speech interactions.
37901077|a|The speech of individuals with schizophrenia exhibits atypical prosody and pragmatic dysfunctions, producing monotony. The paper presents the outcomes of corpus-based research on the prosodic features of the pathology as they manifest in real-life spontaneous interactions. The research relies on a corpus of schizophrenic speech recorded during psychiatric interviews (CIPPS) compared to a sampling of non-pathological speech derived from the LABLITA corpus of spoken Italian, which has been selected according to comparability requirements. Corpora has been intensively analyzed in the Language into Act Theory (L-AcT) frame, which links prosodic cues and pragmatic values. A cluster of linguistic parameters marked by prosody has been considered: utterance boundaries, information structure, speech disfluency, and prosodic prominence. The speech flow of patients turns out to be organized into small chunks of information that are shorter and scarcely structured, with an atypical proportion of post-nuclear information units (Appendix). It is pervasively scattered with silences, especially with long pauses between utterances and long silences at turn-taking. Fluency is hindered by retracing phenomena that characterize complex information structures. The acoustic parameters that give rise to prosodic prominence (f0 mean, f0 standard deviation, spectral emphasis, and intensity variation) have been measured considering the pragmatic roles of the prosodic units, distinguishing prominences within the illocutionary units (Comment) from those characterizing Topic units. Patients show a flattening of the Comment-prominence, reflecting impairments in performing the illocutionary activity. Reduced values of spectral emphasis and intensity variation also suggest a lack of engagement in communication. Conversely, Topic-prominence shows higher values for f0 standard deviation and spectral emphasis, suggesting effort when defining the domain of relevance of the illocutionary force. When comparing Topic and Comment-prominences of patients, the former consistently exhibit higher values across all parameters. In contrast, the non-pathological group displays the opposite pattern.
