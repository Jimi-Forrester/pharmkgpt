27406263|a|BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a major lipid carrier that supports lipid transport and injury repair in the brain. The APOE epsilon4 allele is associated with depression, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia; however, the precise molecular mechanism through which ApoE4 influences the risk of disease development remains unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we investigated the potential effects of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) on ApoE3 and ApoE4 target replacement (ApoE3-TR and ApoE4-TR) mice. RESULTS: All ApoE-TR mice exposed to CUMS at 3 months old recovered from a depression-like state by the age of 12 months. Of note, ApoE4-TR mice, unlike age-matched ApoE3-TR mice, displayed impaired spatial cognitive abilities, loss of GABAergic neurons, decreased expression of Reelin, PSD95, SYN and Fyn, and reduced phosphorylation of NMDAR2B and CREB. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that early-life stress may mediate cognitive impairment in middle-age ApoE4-TR mice through sustained reduction of GABAergic neurons and Reelin expression, which might further diminish the activation of the Fyn/NMDAR2B signaling pathway.
