37984441|a|Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular process that allows degradation of large macromolecules. p62/SQSTM1 is a key adaptor protein that interacts both with material to be degraded and with LC3 at the autophagosome, enabling degradation of cargos such as protein aggregates, lipid droplets and damaged organelles by selective autophagy. Dysregulation of autophagy contributes to the pathogenesis of many diseases. In this study we investigated if the interaction of p62/SQSTM1 with LC3B could be regulated. We purified full-length p62/SQSTM1 and established an in vitro assay that measures the interaction with LC3B. We used the assay to determine the role of the different domains of p62/SQSTM1 in the interaction with LC3B. We identified a mechanism of regulation of p62/SQSTM1 where the ZZ and the PB1 domains regulate the exposure of the LIR-sequence to enable or inhibit the interaction with LC3B. A mutation to mimic the phosphorylation of a site on the ZZ domain leads to increased interaction with LC3B. Also, a small compound that binds to the ZZ domain enhances interaction with LC3B. Dysregulation of these mechanisms in p62/SQSTM1 could have implications for diseases where autophagy is affected. In conclusion, our study highlights the regulated nature of p62/SQSTM1 and its ability to modulate the interaction with LC3B through a LIR-sequence Accessibility Mechanism (LAM). Furthermore, our findings suggest the potential for pharmacological modulation of the exposure of LIR, paving the way for future therapeutic strategies. This article is protected by copyright.
