36903595|t|Development of a Rapid LC-MS/MS Method for Simultaneous Quantification of Donepezil and Tadalafil in Rat Plasma: Its Application in a Pharmacokinetic Interaction Study after Oral Administration in Rats.
36903595|a|This study aimed to establish a simple and sensitive analytical method to simultaneously quantify donepezil (DPZ) and tadalafil (TAD) in rat plasma using lansoprazole (LPZ) as an internal standard (IS) by using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The fragmentation pattern of DPZ, TAD, and IS was elucidated using multiple reaction monitoring in electrospray ionization positive ion mode for the quantification of precursor to production at m/z 380.1   91.2 for DPZ, m/z 390.2   268.1 for TAD, and m/z 370.3   252.0 for LPZ. The extracted DPZ and TAD from plasma using acetonitrile-induced protein precipitation was separated using Kinetex C18 (100 x 2.1 mm, 2.6 microm) column with a gradient mobile phase system consisting of 2 mM ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min for 4 min. The selectivity, lower limit of quantification, linearity, precision, accuracy, stability, recovery, and matrix effect of this developed method was validated according to the guidelines of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety of Korea. The established method achieved acceptance criteria in all validation parameters, ensuring reliability, reproducibility, and accuracy, and was successfully implemented in a pharmacokinetic study on the co-administration of DPZ and TAD orally in rats.
