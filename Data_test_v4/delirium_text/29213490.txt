29213490|a|INTRODUCTION: The aims of this study were to survey neurodegenerative changes detected by abnormal protein deposits in the Entorhinal Cortex (EC) of subjects aged 50 years or older and to correlate these findings with suspected dementia, as detected by the IQCODE (Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly). METHODS: Fourteen brains were submitted to the immunohistochemistry technique for different proteins (beta-amyloid, tau, alpha-synuclein and phospho-TDP-43) and data obtained compared with IQCODE scores. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of the individuals exhibited IQCODE results compatible with dementia, being classified into the demented group (DG): 87.5% of patients had neuropathological findings corresponding to Alzheimer's-like brain pathology (ALBP). Of the patients in the non-demented group (NDG), 16.7% met neuropathological criteria for ALBP. All individuals in the DG showed deposits of more than one kind of protein in the EC. The most common association was hyperphosphorylated tau and beta-amyloid protein (87.5%). DISCUSSION: Most individuals with dementia had neuropathological findings of ALBP, as did one individual with no signs of dementia, characterizing a preclinical stage. The results of this study suggest that deposits of a single type of anomalous protein are normal findings in an aging brain, while more than one kind of protein or the combined presence of anomalous protein deposits indicate the presence of dementia.
