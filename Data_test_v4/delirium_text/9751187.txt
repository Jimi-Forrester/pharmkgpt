9751187|a|Mutations in the presenilin genes PS1 and PS2 cause the most common form of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease. The influence of PS1 mutations on the generation of endogenous intracellular amyloid beta-protein (A beta) species was assessed using a highly sensitive immunoblotting technique with inducible mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro 2a) cell lines expressing the human wild-type (wt) or mutated PS1 (M146L or delta exon 10). The induction of mutated PS1 increased the intracellular levels of two distinct A beta species ending at residue 42 that were likely to be A beta1-42 and its N-terminally truncated variant(s) A beta x-42. The induction of mutated PS1 resulted in a higher level of intracellular A beta1-42 than of intracellular A beta x-42, whereas extracellular levels of A beta1-42 and A beta x-42 were increased proportionally. In addition, the intracellular generation of these A beta42 species in wt and mutated PS1-induced cells was completely blocked by brefeldin A, whereas it exhibited differential sensitivities to monensin: the increased accumulation of intracellular A beta x-42 versus inhibition of intracellular A beta1-42 generation. These data strongly suggest that A beta x-42 is generated in a proximal Golgi, whereas A beta1-42 is generated in a distal Golgi and/or a post-Golgi compartment. Thus, it appears that PS1 mutations enhance the degree of 42-specific gamma-secretase cleavage that occurs in the normal beta-amyloid precursor protein processing pathway (a) in the endoplasmic reticulum or the early Golgi apparatus prior to beta-secretase cleavage or (b) in the distinct sites where A beta x-42 and A beta1-42 are generated.
