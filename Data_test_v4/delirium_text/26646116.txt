26646116|t|Validation of Neuropsychological Tests to Screen for Dementia in Chinese Patients With Parkinson's Disease.
26646116|a|To compare the accuracy of different neuropsychological tests and their combinations for deriving reliable cognitive indices for dementia diagnosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). One hundred forty consecutive patients with PD were recruited and administrated an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests. Discriminant analysis and receiver-operator characteristic curve were used to evaluate their correct classifications and validity. Patients with PD having dementia (PDD; 23.5%) performed significantly worse in all tests than patients without dementia. Age of onset, disease duration, Hoehn-Yahr grade, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III scores, and education were associated with dementia in patients with PD. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Block Design (BD) showed better specificity and sensitivity when used alone, and combined use of MMSE and BD further increased the validity. Our results indicated that the accuracy of MMSE was better in dementia diagnosis of Chinese patients with PD, and combined use of MMSE and BD could further increase the validity of dementia diagnosis.
