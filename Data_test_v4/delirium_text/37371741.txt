37371741|t|Pick's Disease, Seeding an Answer to the Clinical Diagnosis Conundrum.
37371741|a|Pick's disease (PiD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by dementia, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and the aggregation of 3R tau in pathognomonic inclusions known as Pick bodies. The term PiD has adopted many meanings since its conception in 1926, but it is currently used as a strictly neuropathological term, since PiD patients cannot be diagnosed during life. Due to its rarity, PiD remains significantly understudied, and subsequently, the etiology and pathomechanisms of the disease remain to be elucidated. The study of PiD and the preferential 3R tau accumulation that is unique to PiD is imperative in order to expand the current understanding of the disease and inform future studies and therapeutic development, since the lack of intervention strategies for tauopathies remains an unmet need. Yet, the lack of an antemortem diagnostic test for the disease has further complicated the study of PiD. The development of a clinical diagnostic assay for PiD will be a vital step in the study of the disease that will greatly contribute to therapeutic research, clinical trial design and patient recruitment and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Seed aggregation assays have shown great promise for becoming ante mortem clinical diagnostic tools for many proteinopathies, including tauopathies. Future research on adapting and optimizing current seed aggregation assays to successfully detect 3R tau pathogenic forms from PiD samples will be critical in establishing a 3R tau specific seed aggregation assay that can be used for clinical diagnosis and treatment evaluation.
