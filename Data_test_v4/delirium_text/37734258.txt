37734258|a|Neurodegenerative processes characterizing Alzheimer's disease (AD) are strictly related to the impairment of cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems which provoke synaptic loss. These experimental evidences still represent the foundation of the actual standard-of-care treatment for AD, albeit palliative, consisting on the coadministration of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and the NMDAR antagonist memantine. In looking for more effective treatments, we previously developed a series of galantamine-memantine hybrids where compound 1 (ARN14140) emerged with the best-balanced action toward the targets of interest paired to neuroprotective efficacy in a murine AD model. Unfortunately, it showed a suboptimal pharmacokinetic profile, which required intracerebroventricular administration for in vivo studies. In this work we designed and synthesized new hybrids with fewer rotatable bonds, which is related to higher brain exposure. Particularly, compound 2, bearing a double bond in the tether, ameliorated the biological profile of compound 1 in invitro studies, increasing cholinesterases inhibitory potencies and selective antagonism toward excitotoxic-related GluN1/2B NMDAR over beneficial GluN1/2A NMDAR. Furthermore, it showed increased plasma stability and comparable microsomal stability in vitro, paired with lower half-life and faster clearance in vivo. Remarkably, pharmacokinetic evaluations of compound 2 showed a promising increase in brain uptake in comparison to compound 1, representing the starting point for further chemical optimizations.
