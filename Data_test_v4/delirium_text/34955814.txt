34955814|t|Psychographic Segmentation: Another Lever for Precision Population Brain Health.
34955814|a|Dementia prevention interventions that address modifiable risk factors for dementia require extensive lifestyle and behavior changes. Strategies are needed to enhance engagement and personalization of the experience at a population level. Precision Population Brain Health aims to improve brain health across the lifespan at a population level. Psychographic segmentation is a core component of Precision Population Brain Health with untapped potential. Psychographic segmentation applies behavioral and social sciences to understanding people's motivations, values, priorities, decision making, lifestyles, personalities, communication preferences, attitudes, and beliefs. Integrating psychographic segmentation into dementia care could provide a more personalized care experience and increased patient engagement, leading to improved health outcomes and reduced costs. Psychographic segmentation can enhance patient engagement for dementia and shift the clinical paradigm from "What is the matter?" to "What matters to you?" Similar benefits of psychographic segmentation can be provided for dementia caregivers. Developing dementia prevention programs that integrate psychographic segmentation could become the basis for creating a shared framework for prevention of non-communicable diseases and brain health disorders at a population level. Integrating psychographic segmentation into digital health tools for dementia prevention programs is especially critical to overcome current suboptimal approaches. Applying psychographic segmentation to dementia prevention has the potential to help people feel a sense of empowerment over their health and improve satisfaction with their health experience-creating a culture shift in the way brain health is approached and paving the way toward Precision Population Brain Health.
