15756482|t|Factors relating to the use of physical restraints in psychogeriatric care: a paradigm for elder abuse.
15756482|a|The purpose of this study was to address one component of the complex topic "elder abuse". A prospective observational study in the psychogeriatric unit of an acute psychiatric hospital demonstrated that 30% (n=37) of all included patients (n=122) were physically restrained. The highest incidence (48%) was found in elderly patients with severe cognitive impairments (diagnosis of dementia and/or delirium) (n=60). The most commonly used devices of physical restraints were bed rails (100%), belts (trunk 93%, limbs 40%) and chair-tables ("gerichair") (41%). Most restraints occurred at the beginning of hospitalization (83%). Physical restraints were continued for many days and on average of many hours a day. Patients with low cognitive status and serious mobility impairments showed a very high risk of being restrained (p=0.015; OR 32.0 [95% CI:2.0-515.1]). Inability to perform ADL activities increased the frequency of restraint use (p=0.035; OR27.7 [95%CI: 1.3-604.1]). As possible co-factors repetitive disruptive behaviors were found. There was no significant difference between the frequency of falls in restrained or unrestrained patients during the observational period, but fall-related fractures (n=2) only occurred in restrained patients. It is possible that restraints increase the use of benzodiazepines and classical neuroleptics. These results confirm that physical restraints remain a common practice in psychogeriatric care. No evidence-based data support the value of restraints in regard to fall prevention and control of behavioral disturbances in elderly people with serious mental illness. In contrast, these devices can have serious adverse effects and mean one of the most severe interventions in fundamental human rights.
