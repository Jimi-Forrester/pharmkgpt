35213378|t|Serum Amyloidogenic Nanoplaques and Cytokines in Alzheimer's Disease: Pilot Study in a Small Naturalistic Memory Clinic Cohort.
35213378|a|BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation is a central component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlates closely with amyloid pathology. Markers of inflammation such as cytokines, and amyloidogenic aggregates, so-called nanoplaques, are both promising biomarker candidates for AD. We have previously shown that there is a relationship between the levels of nanoplaques and cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid, but it is unknown whether this association extends to serum. OBJECTIVE: Investigate in a naturalistic memory clinic cohort whether the associations between nanoplaques and cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid extends to serum. METHODS: We collected serum from 49 patients assessed for cognitive complaints at the Oslo University Hospital Memory Clinic (15 with clinical AD). We assessed the levels of serum nanoplaques with the novel Thioflavin-T fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (ThT-FCS) assay. Serum levels of nine cytokines (eotaxin-1, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], interleukin [IL]-6, IL-7, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), gamma induced protein 10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-1alpha, and MIP-1beta) were quantified with a multiplex assay and read on a Luminex IS 200 instrument. RESULTS: Serum nanoplaques were not increased in clinical AD patients compared to non-AD memory clinic patients and nanoplaques were not associated with any cytokines. The cytokines IL-8 and G-CSF were increased in patients with clinical AD compared to non-AD patients. CONCLUSION: In this small pilot study, serum nanoplaques were not associated with serum cytokines. Nanoplaque levels could not be used to separate clinical AD patients from non-AD patients in this unselected memory clinic cohort.
