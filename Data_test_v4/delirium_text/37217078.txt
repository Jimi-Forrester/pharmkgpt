METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and AlzForum from inception to January 21, 2023 to include randomized controlled clinical trials. Random effects meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Forty-one clinical trials (20929 participants, 9167 male) were included. Anti-Abeta drugs had significant but relatively low efficacy in preventing cognitive decline (ADAS-Cog SMD -0.07, 95% CI: -0.10 to -0.03, p < 0.001; CDR-SOB -0.05, -0.09 to -0.01, p = 0.017). Instrumental variable meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis confirmed the reliability of the pooled estimation. Beneficial effects were also observed by assessing other cognitive and activity of daily living scales and biomarkers, with acceptable safety of anti-Abeta drugs. Meta-regression demonstrated significant association between higher baseline mini-mental statement examination scores (MMSE) and better cognitive protective effects on cognitive function (ADAS-Cog beta: -0.02, -0.05 to 0.00, p = 0.017) and clearance of pathological productions of anti-Abeta drugs. Network meta-analysis ranked the passive immunotherapy drugs to have the best cognitive efficacy, followed by active immunotherapy and small molecule drugs. CONCLUSION: Anti-Abeta drugs have relatively low efficacy in preventing cognitive decline, and they reduce pathological productions with acceptable safety. Patients with higher baseline MMSE scores benefit more from anti-Abeta drugs. Passive immunotherapy anti-Abeta drugs show relatively better efficacy than active immunotherapy and small molecule anti-Abeta drugs.
