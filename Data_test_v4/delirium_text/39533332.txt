39533332|a|Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a frequent neurological complication encountered during the perioperative period with unclear mechanisms and no effective treatments. Recent research into the pathogenesis of POCD has primarily focused on neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, changes in neural synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter imbalances. Given the high-energy metabolism of neurons and their critical dependency on mitochondria, mitochondrial dysfunction directly affects neuronal function. Additionally, as the primary organelles generating reactive oxygen species, mitochondria are closely linked to the pathological processes of neuroinflammation. Surgery and anesthesia can induce mitochondrial dysfunction, increase mitochondrial oxidative stress, and disrupt mitochondrial quality-control mechanisms via various pathways, hence serving as key initiators of the POCD pathological process. We conducted a review on the role and potential mechanisms of mitochondria in postoperative cognitive dysfunction by consulting relevant literature from the PubMed and EMBASE databases spanning the past 25 years. Our findings indicate that surgery and anesthesia can inhibit mitochondrial respiration, thereby reducing ATP production, decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential, promoting mitochondrial fission, inducing mitochondrial calcium buffering abnormalities and iron accumulation, inhibiting mitophagy, and increasing mitochondrial oxidative stress. Mitochondrial dysfunction and damage can ultimately lead to impaired neuronal function, abnormal synaptic transmission, impaired synthesis and release of neurotransmitters, and even neuronal death, resulting in cognitive dysfunction. Targeted mitochondrial therapies have shown positive outcomes, holding promise as a novel treatment for POCD.
