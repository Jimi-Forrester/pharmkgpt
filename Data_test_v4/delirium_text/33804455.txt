33804455|t|The Importance of Epigenetics in Diagnostics and Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder.
33804455|a|Recent studies imply that there is a tight association between epigenetics and a molecular mechanism of major depressive disorder (MDD). Epigenetic modifications, i.e., DNA methylation, post-translational histone modification and interference of microRNA (miRNA) or long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), are able to influence the severity of the disease and the outcome of the therapy. This article summarizes the most recent literature data on this topic, i.e., usage of histone deacetylases as therapeutic agents with an antidepressant effect and miRNAs or lncRNAs as markers of depression. Due to the noteworthy potential of the role of epigenetics in MDD diagnostics and therapy, we have gathered the most relevant data in this area.
