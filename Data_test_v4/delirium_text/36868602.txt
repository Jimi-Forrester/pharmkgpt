36868602|t|Effect of multimodal comprehensive communication skills training with video analysis by artificial intelligence for physicians on acute geriatric care: a mixed-methods study.
36868602|a|OBJECTIVES: To quantitatively analyse by artificial intelligence (AI) the communication skills of physicians in an acute care hospital for geriatric care following a multimodal comprehensive care communication skills training programme and to qualitatively explore the educational benefits of this training programme. DESIGN: A convergent mixed-methods study, including an intervention trial with a quasi-experimental design, was conducted to quantitatively analyse the communication skills of physicians. Qualitative data were collected via physicians' responses to an open-ended questionnaire administered after the training. SETTING: An acute care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 23 physicians. INTERVENTIONS: In a 4-week multimodal comprehensive care communication skills training programme, including video lectures and bedside instruction, from May to October 2021, all the participants examined a simulated patient in the same scenario before and after their training. These examinations were video recorded by an eye-tracking camera and two fixed cameras. Then, the videos were analysed for communication skills by AI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the physicians' eye contact, verbal expression, physical touch and multimodal communication skills with a simulated patient. The secondary outcomes were the physicians' empathy and burnout scores. RESULTS: The proportion of the duration of the participants' single and multimodal types of communication significantly increased (p<0.001). The mean empathy scores and the personal accomplishment burnout scores also significantly increased after training. We developed a learning cycle model based on the six categories that changed after training from the physicians' perspective: multimodal comprehensive care communication skills training; increasing awareness of and sensitivity to changes to geriatric patients' condition; changes in clinical management; professionalism; team building and personal accomplishments. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that multimodal comprehensive care communication skills training for physicians increased the proportions of time spent performing single and multimodal communication skills by video analysis through AI.
