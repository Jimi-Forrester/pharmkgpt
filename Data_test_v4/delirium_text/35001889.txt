35001889|t|Anticholinergic Drug Burden and Neurocognitive Performance in the Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging.
35001889|a|BACKGROUND: Studies of cumulative anticholinergic drug burden on cognitive function and impairment are emerging, yet few for Hispanics/Latinos. OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between anticholinergic use and neurocognitive performance outcomes among diverse Hispanics/Latinos. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included diverse Hispanic/Latino participants, enrolled in the Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive, from New York, Chicago, Miami, and San Diego (n = 6,249). Survey linear regression examined associations between anticholinergic use (measured during baseline [Visit 1] and average 7-year follow up [Visit 2]) with global cognition, episodic learning, memory, phonemic fluency, processing speed, executive functioning, and average 7-year change. RESULTS: Anticholinergic use was associated with lower cognitive global cognition (beta= -0.21; 95% CI [-0.36; -0.05]), learning (beta= -0.27; 95% CI [-0.47; -0.07]), memory (beta= -0.22; 95% CI [-0.41; -0.03]), and executive functioning (beta= -0.22; 95% CI [-0.40; -0.03]) scores, particularly among those who took anticholinergics at both visits. Anticholinergic use was associated with faster decline in global cognition, learning, and verbal fluency (beta: -0.28 [95% CI: -0.55, -0.01]; beta: -0.28 [95% CI: -0.55, -0.01]; beta: -0.25, [95% CI -0.47, -0.04], respectively). Sex modified associations between anticholinergic use with global cognition, learning, and executive functioning (F3 = 3.59, F3 = 2.84, F3 = 3.88, respectively). CONCLUSION: Anticholinergic use was associated with lower neurocognitive performance, especially among those who used anticholinergics at both visits, among a study population of diverse Hispanics/Latinos. Findings will support evidence-based decisions regarding anticholinergic prescriptions and efforts to minimize cognitive impact.
