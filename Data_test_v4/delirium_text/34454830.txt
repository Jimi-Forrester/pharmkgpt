34454830|a|Alzheimer's disease is one of the most frequent forms of dementia. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterized by presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Obesity is regarded as abnormal fat accumulation with deleterious impact on human health. There is full scientific evidence that obesity and the metabolic comorbidities (e.g., insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, and type 2 diabetes) are related to Alzheimer's disease and likely in the causative pathway. Numerous studies have identified several overlapping neurodegenerative mechanisms, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. In this review, we present how obesity and the associated lipotoxicity as well as chronic inflammation initiate a state of insulin resistance that in turn, may have a role in causing the characteristic cerebral alterations of AD. In particular, we focus on the molecular mechanisms linking the obesity-induced impairment in insulin signalling to the upregulation of Abeta aggregation, tau hyper-phosphorylation, inflammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.
