16386371|t|Acetylsalicylic acid decreases tau phosphorylation at serine 422.
16386371|a|Tau protein pathology in Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the hyperphosphorylation of tau at some specific sites. One of these sites is serine 422 which modification has been correlated with a possible toxic effect of phosphotau in neural cells. In this work, we have found that in the presence of acetylsalicylic acid, at a concentration like that used for anti-inflammatory treatments, tau phosphorylation at serine 422 decreases.
