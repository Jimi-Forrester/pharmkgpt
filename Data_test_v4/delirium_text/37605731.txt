37605731|t|Phytomedicinal properties of Hygrophila schulli (Neeramulliya).
37605731|a|Hygrophila schulli which is known as "Neermulli'' in the vernacular is an herbaceous plant native to Sri Lanka. Ancient medicinal literature suggests the use of H. schulli whole plant or its parts for the treatment of different communicable and non-communicable diseases including diabetes mellitus and tuberculosis. Active constituents and secondary metabolites including alkaloids, tannins, steroids, proteins, flavonoids, and glycosides are identified to possess antimicrobial, antitumor, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, anthelmintic, nephroprotective, antidiabetic, anticataract, anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, hematopoietic, diuretic, antiurolithiatic, antipyretic, neuroprotection, and anti-endotoxin activities. In this review, we reviewed clinical studies, patents, and analytical studies from the earliest found examples from 1886 to the end of 2021. We critically analyzed and attempt to summarize the information based on bioactivities and chemical composition of H. schulli plant extracts which will be of future use for researchers in this field.
