30929309|t|Nrf2 in cancers: A double-edged sword.
30929309|a|The Nrf2/Keap1 pathway is an important signaling cascade responsible for the resistance of oxidative damage induced by exogenous chemicals. It maintains the redox homeostasis, exerts anti-inflammation and anticancer activity by regulating its multiple downstream cytoprotective genes, thereby plays a vital role in cell survival. Interestingly, in recent years, accumulating evidence suggests that Nrf2 has a contradictory role in cancers. Aberrant activation of Nrf2 is associated with poor prognosis. The constitutive activation of Nrf2 in various cancers induces pro-survival genes and promotes cancer cell proliferation by metabolic reprogramming, repression of cancer cell apoptosis, and enhancement of self-renewal capacity of cancer stem cells. More importantly, Nrf2 is proved to contribute to the chemoresistance and radioresistance of cancer cells as well as inflammation-induced carcinogenesis. A number of Nrf2 inhibitors discovered for cancer treatment were reviewed in this report. These provide a new strategy that targeting Nrf2 could be a promising therapeutic approach against cancer. This review aims to summarize the dual effects of Nrf2 in cancer, revealing its function both in cancer prevention and inhibition, to further discover novel anticancer treatment.
