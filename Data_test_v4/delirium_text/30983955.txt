30983955|a|Western societies experienced drastic changes in eating habits during the past century. The modern nutritional profile, typically rich in saturated fats and refined sugars, is recognized as a major contributing factor, along with reduced physical activity, to the current epidemics of metabolic disorders, notably obesity and diabetes. Alongside these conditions, recent years have witnessed a gradual and significant increase in prevalence of brain diseases, particularly mood disorders. While substantial clinical/epidemiological evidence supports a correlation between metabolic and neuropsychiatric disorders, the mechanisms of pathogenesis in the latter are often multifactorial and causal links have been hard to establish. Neuroinflammation stands out as a hallmark feature of brain disorders that may be linked to peripheral metabolic dyshomeostasis caused by an unhealthy diet. Dietary fatty acids are of particular interest, as they may play a dual role, both as a component of high-calorie obesogenic diets and as signaling molecules involved in inflammatory responses. Here, we review current literature connecting diet-related nutritional imbalance and neuropsychiatric disorders, focusing on the role of dietary fatty acids as signaling molecules directly relevant to inflammatory processes and to neuronal function.
