37732818|t|Appraising causal risk and protective factors for rheumatoid arthritis.
37732818|a|Aims: Mendelian randomization (MR) is considered to overcome the bias of observational studies, but there is no current meta-analysis of MR studies on rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The purpose of this study was to summarize the relationship between potential pathogenic factors and RA risk based on existing MR studies. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were searched for MR studies on influencing factors in relation to RA up to October 2022. Meta-analyses of MR studies assessing correlations between various potential pathogenic factors and RA were conducted. Random-effect and fixed-effect models were used to synthesize the odds ratios of various pathogenic factors and RA. The quality of the study was assessed using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology using Mendelian Randomization (STROBE-MR) guidelines. Results: A total of 517 potentially relevant articles were screened, 35 studies were included in the systematic review, and 19 studies were eligible to be included in the meta-analysis. Pooled estimates of 19 included studies (causality between 15 different risk factors and RA) revealed that obesity, smoking, coffee intake, lower education attainment, and Graves' disease (GD) were related to the increased risk of RA. In contrast, the causality contribution from serum mineral levels (calcium, iron, copper, zinc, magnesium, selenium), alcohol intake, and chronic periodontitis to RA is not significant. Conclusion: Obesity, smoking, education attainment, and GD have real causal effects on the occurrence and development of RA. These results may provide insights into the genetic susceptibility and potential biological pathways of RA.
