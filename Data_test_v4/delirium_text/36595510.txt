36595510|t|Vestibular contribution to path integration deficits in 'at-genetic-risk' for Alzheimer's disease.
36595510|a|Path integration changes may precede a clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease by several years. Studies to date have focused on how spatial cell changes affect path integration in preclinical AD. However, vestibular input is also critical for intact path integration. Here, we developed the vestibular rotation task that requires individuals to manually point an iPad device in the direction of their starting point following rotational movement, without any visual cues. Vestibular features were derived from the sensor data using feature selection. Machine learning models illustrate that the vestibular features accurately classified Apolipoprotein E epsilon3epsilon4 carriers and epsilon3epsilon3 carrier controls (mean age 62.7 years), with 65% to 79% accuracy depending on task trial. All machine learning models produced a similar classification accuracy. Our results demonstrate the cross-sectional role of the vestibular system in Alzheimer's disease risk carriers. Future investigations should examine if vestibular functions explain individual phenotypic heterogeneity in path integration among Alzheimer's disease risk carriers.
