32431555|a|Traditional Chinese medicine has usually been recognized to be efficacious to treat chronic diseases from the western point-of-view. However, there is a long history in China of applying traditional Chinese medicine in many acute and urgent medical conditions. In this review, selected methods documented in traditional Chinese medicine including blowing air to ear, nose insufflating therapy, acupuncture and moxibustion were presented as the common practices to promote consciousness recovery from coma. We aimed to explore the mechanism of these four methods with current scientific evidence, further discuss the potential of traditional Chinese medicine to be applied in emergency medicine and provide a path forward to more rigorously validate these procedures. The development of the integrated traditional Chinese medicine and western medicines provides a new therapeutic direction for the new first-aid treatment.
