26738339|t|Age-related macular degeneration and Alzheimer disease.
26738339|a|This review highlight the similarities in the pathogenesis between Alzheimer disease and age-related macular degeneration. All studies published between 1990 and 2014 were reviewed to identify the common pathological pathways. Alzheimer disease and age-related macular degeneration share common features such as vitronectin and amyloid-beta accumulation, increased oxidative stress, and apolipoprotein and complement activation pathways, which are reviewed as histologic and immunologic common features.
