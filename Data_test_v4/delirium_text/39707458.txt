39707458|a|BACKGROUND: Post-operative delirium (POD) is a relatively common occurrence following surgical procedures, particularly cardiac surgeries. Given that the majority of pharmacologic treatments for delirium have demonstrated inadequate efficacy, it is of great importance to identify risk factors to prevent delirium or reduce its complications. Consequently, in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we identified risk factors of POD after cardiac surgery. METHOD: A comprehensive search of the literature was conducted using the databases Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science from the inception to April 22, 2024. The objective was to identify prospective cohorts that had assessed the risk factors associated with POD in patients undergoing cardiac surgery using multivariate regression. RESULTS: Of the 3,166 studies that were initially screened, 23 were included in the review. Nine risk factors were evaluated including age (OR 1.06, 95% CI (1.04, 1.08), p < 0.001), pre-operative depression (OR 3.71, 95% CI (2.45, 5.62), p < 0.001), post-operative atrial fibrillation (AF) (OR 2.39, 95% CI (1.79, 3.21), p < 0.001), hypertension (HTN) (OR 1.64, 95% CI (0.75, 3.56), p = 0.212), age >= 65 (OR 3.32, 95% CI (2.40, 4.60), p < 0.001), pre-operative AF (OR 4.43, 95% CI (2.56, 7.69), p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR 2.16, 95% CI (1.39, 3.35), p = 0.001), combined coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) + valve surgery (OR 2.73, 95% CI (1.66, 4.49), p < 0.001), and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (OR 1.02, 95% CI (1.01, 1.04), p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A total of nine risk factors were evaluated, from which eight were found to have a statistically significant effect on the risk of developing POD. These factors can be employed to more effectively identify at-risk patients and to prevent the occurrence of POD. Furthermore, this approach can facilitate earlier diagnosis and more effective patient care.
