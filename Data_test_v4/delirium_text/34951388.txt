34951388|t|The Implication of Glial Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors in Alzheimer's Disease.
34951388|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) was first identified more than 100 years ago, yet aspects pertaining to its origin and the mechanisms underlying disease progression are not well known. To this date, there is no therapeutic approach or disease-modifying drug that could halt or at least delay disease progression. Until recently, glial cells were seen as secondary actors in brain homeostasis. Although this view was gradually refuted and the relevance of glial cells for the most diverse brain functions such as synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission was vastly proved, many aspects of its functioning, as well as its role in pathological conditions, remain poorly understood. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in glial cells were shown to be involved in neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. Besides its relevance for glial function, glutamatergic receptors are also central in the pathology of AD, and recent studies have shown that glial mGluRs play a role in the establishment and progression of AD. AD-related alterations in Ca2+ signalling, APP processing, and Abeta load, as well as AD-related neurodegeneration, are influenced by glial mGluRs. However, different types of mGluRs play different roles, depending on the cell type and brain region that is being analysed. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the current understanding of glial mGluRs and their implication in AD, providing an insight for future therapeutics and identifying existing research gaps worth investigating.
