33813550|t|Age-Specific Dose Regimens of Dexmedetomidine for Pediatric Patients in Intensive Care Following Elective Surgery: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-Label Clinical Trial in Japan.
33813550|a|OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine as a potential sedative for pediatric surgery patients in the ICU. DESIGN: Phase 3, multicenter, open-label study. SETTING: This study included 61 patients at 13 tertiary hospitals in Japan. PATIENTS: Pediatric patients (>= 45 wk corrected gestational age to < 17 yr) undergoing intensive care treatment with mechanical ventilation requiring greater than 6 hours estimated duration of sedation following elective cardiac surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Dexmedetomidine was IV administered without a loading dose at age-specific dose regimens 0.2-1.4 (< 6 yr) and 0.2-1.0 microg/kg/hr (>= 6 yr). The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who did not require a rescue sedative (midazolam) infusion during mechanical ventilation or for the first 24 hours of a greater than 24 hours ventilation following the commencement of dexmedetomidine administration. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Overall, 47 of the 61 patients (77.0%) did not require rescue midazolam. Adverse events were reported in 53 patients (86.9%). Frequently observed adverse events were hypotension (47.5%), bradycardia (31.1%), and respiratory depression (26.2%). Most of these adverse events were mild, a few moderate, and none severe. Although serious adverse events occurred in four patients, including one cardiac tamponade resulting in the withdrawal of dexmedetomidine, none of the adverse events resulted in mortality or were directly related to dexmedetomidine. The plasma dexmedetomidine concentration generally reached the target concentration of 0.3-1.25 ng/mL at 1-2 hours prior to completion of administration or immediately prior to the commencement of tapering. CONCLUSIONS: The age-specific dose regimens of dexmedetomidine without an initial loading dose achieved an adequate sedation level during mechanical ventilation and caused no clinically significant adverse events in the intensive care pediatric patients. These effects were achieved within the therapeutic range of dexmedetomidine plasma concentration and were accompanied by minimal effects on hemodynamics and respiration.
