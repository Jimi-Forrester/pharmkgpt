36836206|t|Comparison and Evaluation of Outcomes of Ureteroscopy and Stone Laser Fragmentation in Extremes of Age Groups (<=10 Years and >=80 Years of Age): A Retrospective Comparative Analysis of over 15 Years from 2 Tertiary European Centres.
36836206|a|AIM: To assess and compare the outcomes associated with ureteroscopy and laser fragmentation (URSL) for extremes of age group (<=10 and >=80 years). METHODS: Retrospective consecutive data were collected from two European centres for all paediatric patients <=10 undergoing URSL over a 15-year period (group 1). It was compared to consecutive data for all patients >=80 years (group 2). Data were collected for patient demographics, stone characteristics, operative details, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 168 patients had 201 URSL procedures during this time (74 and 94 patients in groups 1 and 2 respectively). The mean age and stone sizes were 6.1 years and 85 years, and 9.7 mm and 13 mm for groups 1 and 2 respectively. While the SFR was slightly higher in group 2 (92.5% versus 87.8%, p = 0.301), post-operative stent rate was also significantly higher in the geriatric population (75.9% versus 41.2%, p = 0.0001). There was also no significant difference in pre-operative stenting (p = 0.886), ureteric access sheath use (UAS) (p = 0.220) and post-operative complications. Group 1 had an intervention rate of 1.3/patient as compared to 1.1/patient in group 2. The overall complications were 7.2% and 15.3% in groups 1 and 2 respectively (0.069), with 1 Clavien IV complication related to post-operative sepsis and brief ICU admission in group 2. CONCLUSION: The paediatric population had a marginally higher incidence of repeat procedure, but the overall SFR and complications were similar, and post-operative stent insertion rates were much better compared to geriatric patients. URSL is a safe procedure in the extremes of age groups with no difference in the overall outcomes between the two groups.
