38280848|a|Kupffer cells are liver resident macrophages and play critical role in fatty liver disease, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that activation of G-protein coupled receptor 3 (GPR3) in Kupffer cells stimulates glycolysis and protects mice from obesity and fatty liver disease. GPR3 activation induces a rapid increase in glycolysis via formation of complexes between beta-arrestin2 and key glycolytic enzymes as well as sustained increase in glycolysis through transcription of glycolytic genes. In mice, GPR3 activation in Kupffer cells results in enhanced glycolysis, reduced inflammation and inhibition of high-fat diet induced obesity and liver pathogenesis. In human fatty liver biopsies, GPR3 activation increases expression of glycolytic genes and reduces expression of inflammatory genes in a population of disease-associated macrophages. These findings identify GPR3 activation as a pivotal mechanism for metabolic reprogramming of Kupffer cells and as a potential approach for treating fatty liver disease.
