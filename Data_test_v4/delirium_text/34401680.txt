34401680|a|Osteosarcoma is the most common primary sarcoma of bone among adolescents, often characterized by early lung metastasis resulting in high mortality. Recently, exosomes have been used in liquid biopsy to monitor tumors. Herein, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to profile human plasma exosomes for the evaluation of osteosarcoma lung metastasis. Forty patients with osteosarcoma with (n = 20) or without (n = 20) lung metastasis as well as 12 heathy controls were recruited. Exosomes were isolated from human plasma for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Multivariate statistical analyses were performed based on the MALDI-TOF mass spectra. The strategy can efficiently differentiate osteosarcomas from healthy controls and further discriminate osteosarcoma lung metastasis from non-lung metastasis. We identified seven exosomal proteins as potential biomarkers of osteosarcoma lung metastasis. The proposed method holds great promise to clinically diagnose osteosarcoma and monitor osteosarcoma lung metastasis.
