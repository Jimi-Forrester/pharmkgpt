37536983|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases the risk for seizures and sleep disorders. We show here that germline deletion of beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) in neurons, but not in astrocytes, increased epileptiform activity. However, BACE1 deletion at adult ages did not alter the normal EEG waveform, indicating a less concern for BACE1 inhibition in patients. Moreover, we showed that deletion of Bace1 in the adult was able to reverse epileptiform activity in 5xFAD mice. Intriguingly, treating 5xFAD and APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F (APP KI) mice of either sex with one BACE1 inhibitor Lanabecestat (AZD3293) dramatically increased epileptiform spiking, likely resulting from an off-target effect. We also monitored sleep-wake pathologies in these mice and showed that increased wakefulness, decreased non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in both 5xFAD and APP KI mice; BACE1 inhibition in the adult 5xFAD mice reversed plaque load and sleep disturbances, but not in APP KI mice. Further studies with and without BACE1 inhibitor treatment showed different levels of plaque-associated microgliosis and activated microglial proteins in 5xFAD mice compared to APP KI mice. Together, BACE1 inhibition should be developed to avoid off-target effect for achieving benefits in reducing epileptic activity and sleep disturbance in Alzheimer's patients.Significance Statement:BACE1 is widely recognized as a therapeutic target for treating Alzheimer's disease patients. However, BACE1 inhibitors failed in clinical trials due to inability to show cognitive improvement in patients. Here we show that BACE1 inhibition actually reduces sleep disturbances and epileptic seizures, both are seen in AD patients. We further showed that one of clinically tested BACE1 inhibitors does have off-target effects, and development of safer BACE1 inhibitors will be beneficial to AD patients. Results from this study will provide useful guidance for additional drug development.
