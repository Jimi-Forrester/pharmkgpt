33777649|t|Interventions to Preserve Cognitive Functioning Among Older Kidney Transplant Recipients.
33777649|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the research on effective interventions for preserving cognitive function and prevent cognitive decline in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) who are undergoing dialysis and/or kidney transplantation (KT). RECENT FINDINGS: Among ESKD patients undergoing hemodialysis, exercise training has been administered through home-based and intradialytic interventions. Additionally, one pilot study identified intradialytic cognitive training, electronic brain games, as an intervention to preserve cognitive function among patients undergoing hemodialysis. Fewer studies have investigated interventions to preserver cognitive function among KT recipients. To date, the only randomized controlled trial in this population identified B-vitamin supplements as an intervention to preserve cognitive function. The evidence from these trials support a short-term benefit of cognitive and exercise training as well as B-vitamin supplementation among patients with ESKD. Future studies should: 1) replicate these findings, 2) identify interventions specific to KT candidates, and 3) investigate the synergistic impact of both cognitive and exercise training. SUMMARY: Cognitive prehabilitation, with cognitive and/or exercise training, may be novel interventions for KT candidates that not only reduces delirium risk and long-term post-KT cognitive decline but also prevents dementia.
