37325266|t|Life before Death in India: A Narrative Review.
37325266|a|Palliative care is an ever-increasing need in India, with its large population and rising burden of chronic illness. India ranks 67th out of 80 countries in the quality of death index, which measures the availability and quality of palliative care. Community-led projects in Kerala have proven successful in improving palliative care access with modest resources and volunteer involvement. In India, the number of hospice facilities is increasing; however, <1% of the Indian population has access to palliative care. Financial and human resources limitations in the health-care system, poverty and high health-care expenditure, the lack of awareness among the public about end-of-life care, hesitance to seek care due to social stigma, strict laws regarding opiates that hinder adequate pain relief and the apparent conflict between traditional social values and western values regarding death are the major obstacles to improving palliative care. Significant efforts focused on public awareness of end-of-life care and locally-tailored programmes with family and community involvement are necessary to address this issue and integrate palliative care into the primary care system. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that has been managed effectively by palliative care involvement.
