2189660|t|Psychiatric, psychosocial, and rehabilitative aspects of lung transplantation.
2189660|a|The psychosocial assessment of applicants to the Toronto Lung Transplant Program provides the team with a variety of information including coping style; adjustment to illness; presence and management of psychiatric disorders; ability to adhere to medical recommendations; and available social support. This information facilitates the organization of resources to match each patient's strengths and vulnerabilities. The period of awaiting transplantation may be prolonged, and is often associated with high levels of anxiety. A support group, brief individual and family psychotherapies, and pharmacologic interventions have each been useful in ameliorating symptoms of stress during this time. A physical rehabilitation program is prescribed to most candidates and contributes to improved physical endurance as well as emotional well-being. Postoperative delirium has commonly occurred in lung transplant recipients, and appears to be associated with prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass when used, the administration of cyclosporine, and other nonspecific factors. Delirium has been managed with preoperative psychologic preparation and a routine postoperative protocol using intravenously administered haloperidol. Other immunosuppressant-associated organic mental disorders have also occurred in recipients. Postoperative recovery and rehabilitation are facilitated by both the preoperative exercise program and a postoperative exercise regimen. Recovery following transplant may require abrupt adjustment to new activity levels and reintegration into social and vocational roles. After 7 months, over 50% of surviving recipients have returned to employment and most report high satisfaction with physical and emotional well-being.
