37698853|a|Morphine addiction is closely associated with dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. miRNAs play a crucial role in regulating intestinal bacterial growth and are involved in the development of disease. Ginsenoside Rg1 exhibits an anti-addiction effect and significantly improves intestinal microbiota disorders. In pseudo-germfree mice, supplementation with Bacteroides vulgatus (B. vulgatus) synergistically enhanced Rg1 to alleviate morphine addiction. However, it is currently unknown the relationship between fecal miRNAs in morphine-exposed mice and their potential modulation of gut microbiome, as well as their role in mediating the resistance of ginsenoside Rg1 to drug addiction. Here, we studied the fecal miRNA abundance in mice treated with morphine to explore the different miRNAs expressed, their association with B. vulgatus and their role in the amelioration of morphine reward by ginsenoside Rg1. Our results indicated ginsenoside Rg1 attenuated the significant increase in miR-129-5p expression observed in the feces of morphine-treated mice. The miR-129-5p, specifically, inhibited the growth of B. vulgatus by modulating the transcript of the site-tag BVU_RS11835 and increased the levels of 5-hydroxytryptophan and indole-3-carboxaldehyde in vitro. Subsequently, we noticed that oral administration of synthetic miR-129-5p increased 5-HT levels in the hippocampus and inhibited the reversal effect of ginsenoside Rg1 both on the relative abundance of B. vulgatus in the feces and CPP effect induced by morphine exposure. In short, Ginsenoside Rg1 might play an indirect role in remodeling the B. vulgatus against morphine reward by suppressing miR-129-5p expression. These results highlight the role of miR-129-5p and B. vulgatus in morphine reward and the anti-morphine addiction of ginsenoside Rg1.
