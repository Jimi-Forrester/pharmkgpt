35017285|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess awareness of the neurological manifestation of COVID-19 on the Saudi population. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted using a Google Form survey to obtain responses randomly from the Saudi population between February and March 2021 using social media. RESULTS: A total of 831 participants completed the questionnaire. The distribution of the identified isolated neurological manifestations of COVOD-19 infections by participants' age was assessed among the respondents. Loss of smell (88.9%), loss of taste (86.8%), and headache (72.6%) were the most identified first manifestations among all the age groups, while stroke (13.4%) was the least identified for all ages with no statistical significance (p>0.05 for all). Regarding COVID-19 related neurological symptoms, the same was reported: loss of smell, taste, and headache were the most identified symptoms among all the age groups, while stroke was the least identified for all ages with no statistical significance (p>0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: The study concluded that awareness of COVID-19's neurological symptoms could help detect an atypical case, which can help in early intervention and its medical treatment. Moreover, the study also suggested conducting educational programs that emphasize the early identification of neurological symptoms of COVID-19.
