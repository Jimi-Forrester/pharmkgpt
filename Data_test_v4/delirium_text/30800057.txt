30800057|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and strongly associated to aging. AD has been related to excess of neurotoxic oligomers of amyloid beta peptide (Abetao), loss of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and mitochondrial damage. However, the intimate mechanisms underlying the pathology remain obscure. We have reported recently that long-term cultures of rat hippocampal neurons resembling aging neurons are prone to damage induced by Abeta oligomers (Abetao) while short-term cultured cells resembling young neurons are not. In addition, we have also shown that aging neurons display critical changes in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis including increased Ca2+ store content and Ca2+ transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria. Aging also promotes the partial loss of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), a Ca2+ entry pathway involved in memory storage. Here, we have addressed whether Abetao treatment influences differentially intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in young and aged neurons. We found that Abetao exacerbate the remodeling of intracellular Ca2+ induced by aging. Specifically, Abetao exacerbate the loss of SOCE observed in aged neurons. Abetao also exacerbate the increased resting cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, Ca2+ store content and Ca2+ release as well as increased expression of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) observed in aging neurons. In contrast, Abetao elicit none of these effects in young neurons. Surprisingly, we found that Abetao increased the Ca2+ transfer from ER to mitochondria in young neurons without having detrimental effects. Consistently, Abetao increased also colocalization of ER and mitochondria in both young and aged neurons. However, in aged neurons, Abetao suppressed Ca2+ transfer from ER to mitochondria, decreased mitochondrial potential, enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and promoted apoptosis. These results suggest that modulation of ER-mitochondria coupling in hippocampal neurons may be a novel physiological role of Abetao. However, excess of Abetao in the face of the remodeling of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis associated to aging may lead to loss of ER-mitochondrial coupling and AD.
