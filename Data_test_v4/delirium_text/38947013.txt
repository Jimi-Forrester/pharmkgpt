38947013|a|Introduction: Emerging evidence suggests a connection between vulnerability to infections and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The nectin cell adhesion molecule 2 (NECTIN2) gene coding for a membrane component of adherens junctions is involved in response to infection, and its single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6859 was significantly associated with AD risk in several human cohorts. It is unclear, however, how exactly rs6859 influences the development of AD pathology. The aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (pTau) is a key pathological feature of neurodegeneration in AD, which may be induced by infections, among other factors, and potentially influenced by genes involved in both AD and vulnerability to infections, such as NECTIN2. Materials and methods: We conducted a causal mediation analysis (CMA) on a sample of 708 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The relationship between rs6859 and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with AD (yes/no) as the outcome and pTau-181 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acting as a mediator in this association, was assessed. Adjusted estimates from the probit and linear regression models were used in the CMA model, where an additive model considered an increase in dosage of the rs6859 A allele (AD risk factor). Results: The increase in dose of allele A of the SNP rs6859 resulted in about 0.144 increase per standard deviation (SD) of pTau-181 (95% CI: 0.041, 0.248, p<0.01). When included together in the probit model, the change in A allele dose and each standard deviation change in pTau-181 predicted 6.84% and 9.79% higher probabilities for AD, respectively. In the CMA, the proportion of the average mediated effect was 17.05% and was higher for the risk allele homozygotes (AA), at 19.40% (95% CI: 6.20%, 43.00%, p<0.01). The sensitivity analysis confirmed the evidence of a robust mediation effect. Conclusion: This study reported a new causal relationship between pTau-181 and AD. We found that the association between rs6859 in the NECTIN2 gene and AD is partly mediated by pTau-181 levels in CSF. The rest of this association may be mediated by other factors. Further research, using other biomarkers, is needed to uncover the remaining mechanisms of the association between the NECTIN2 gene and AD.
