29985601|t|Dual-Specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation-Regulated Kinase 1A (DYRK1A) Inhibitors as Potential Therapeutics.
29985601|a|Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is a member of an evolutionarily conserved family of protein kinases that belongs to the CMGC group of kinases. DYRK1A, encoded by a gene located in the human chromosome 21q22.2 region, has attracted attention due to its association with both neuropathological phenotypes and cancer susceptibility in patients with Down syndrome (DS). Inhibition of DYRK1A attenuates cognitive dysfunctions in animal models for both DS and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, DYRK1A has been studied as a potential cancer therapeutic target because of its role in the regulation of cell cycle progression by affecting both tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Consequently, selective synthetic inhibitors have been developed to determine the role of DYRK1A in various human diseases. Our perspective includes a comprehensive review of potent and selective DYRK1A inhibitors and their forthcoming therapeutic applications.
