34948013|a|Ischemia-like (oxygen-glucose deprivation, OGD) conditions followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R) cause massive death of cerebral cortex cells in culture as a result of the induction of necrosis and apoptosis. Cell death occurs as a result of an OGD-induced increase in Ca2+ ions in the cytosol of neurons and astrocytes, an increase in the expression of genes encoding proapoptotic and inflammatory genes with suppression of protective genes. The deuterated form of linoleic polyunsaturated fatty acid (D4-Lnn) completely inhibits necrosis and greatly reduces apoptotic cell death with an increase in the concentration of fatty acid in the medium. It was shown for the first time that D4-Lnn, through the activation of the phosphoinositide calcium system of astrocytes, causes their reactivation, which correlates with the general cytoprotective effect on the cortical neurons and astrocytes in vitro. The mechanism of the cytoprotective action of D4-Lnn involves the inhibition of the OGD-induced calcium ions, increase in the cytosolic and reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, the enhancement of the expression of protective genes, and the suppression of damaging proteins.
