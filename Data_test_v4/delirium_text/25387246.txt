25387246|t|Nitration of Y10 in Abeta1-40: is it a compensatory reaction against oxidative/nitrative stress and Abeta aggregation?
25387246|a|Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) aggregation is considered to be a crucial pathological biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It was found that Abeta and heme can form an Abeta-heme complex, which results in increased heme pseudoperoxidase activity. Recently, we found that increasing pseudoperoxidase activity induces elevated tyrosine nitration on Abeta in the presence of nitrite and hydrogen peroxide. However, the nature of tyrosine nitration of Abeta and its physiologic significance are still unknown. In this study, we revealed that Abeta1-40 can be nitrated in vitro by binding to heme in the presence of nitrite and hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, we found that tyrosine nitration had little effect on Abeta1-40's binding activity with heme. A TMB assay also revealed that the peroxidase activity of the heme-Abeta1-40Y10(3N)T (tyrosine 10 was replaced with 3-nitrtotyrosine in Abeta1-40) complex was moderately increased compared with that of the heme-Abeta1-40 complex. Furthermore, Thioflavin T fluorescence and transmission electron microscopic characterization indicated that tyrosine nitration significantly decreased the aggregation of Abeta1-40. In addition, a cytotoxicity test verified that wild-type Abeta1-40 was more cytotoxic than that of Abeta1-40Y10(3N)T. These results suggest that nitration of Abeta1-40 might be an Abeta detoxicant process and a compensatory reaction to nitrative stress. Our findings may lead to a detailed understanding of the function of Abeta1-40 and may be helpful in preventing and curing AD.
