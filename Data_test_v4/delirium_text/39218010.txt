39218010|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the gradual death of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to fatal paralysis. Socioeconomic status (SES) is a measure of an individual's shared economic and social status, which has been shown to have an association with health outcomes. Understanding the impact of SES on health conditions is crucial, as it can influence and be influenced by health-related variables. The role of socioeconomic status in influencing the risk and progression of ALS has not been established, and understanding the various factors that impact ALS is important in developing strategies for treatment and prevention. To investigate this relationship, we recruited 413 participants with definite, probable, or possible ALS according to the El Escorial criteria, from three tertiary centers in London, Sheffield, and Birmingham. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between case-control status, socioeconomic criteria, and ALS risk. Linear regression was used to examine the association between age of onset and socioeconomic variables. Two sensitivity analyses were performed, one using an alternative occupational classifier, and the other using Mendelian Randomization analysis to examine association. There was no significant relationship between any variables and ALS risk. We found an inverse relationship between mean lifetime salary and age of ALS onset (Beta = -0.157, p = 0.011), but no effect of education or occupation on the age of onset. The finding was confirmed in both sensitivity analyses and in Mendelian Randomization. We find that a higher salary is associated with a younger age of ALS onset taking into account sex, occupation, years of education, and clinical presentation.
