38645290|t|Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Mitral Valve Repair in a Patient With Anderson-Fabry Disease.
38645290|a|Severe degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR) is one cardiac manifestation of the multiorgan metabolic enzyme disorder Anderson-Fabry Disease (AFD). Although DMR is normally managed surgically, many patients with AFD are unsuitable for this. We present the first case of mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair in a patient with AFD.
