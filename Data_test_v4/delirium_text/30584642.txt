30584642|a|BACKGROUND: Active and healthy aging (AHA) is an important phenomenon in aging societies. AIMS: Our aim was to investigate midlife predictors of AHA in a socioeconomically homogenous male cohort. METHODS: In 2010, AHA was defined in the Helsinki Businessmen Study (men born in 1919-1934) with six criteria: (1) being alive, (2) responding to the mailed survey, (3) no reported cognitive problems, (4) feeling of happiness, (5) no difficulties in activities of daily living (ADL), and (6) no significant chronic diseases. Midlife factors were assessed in 1974 (n = 1759, mean age 47 years). Of the survivors in 2010 (n = 839), 10.0% (n = 84) fulfilled all AHA criteria, whilst 13.7% (n = 115) had chronic diseases but fulfilled other five criteria. Midlife predictors of AHA were analyzed with logistic models. RESULTS: Of the midlife factors, smoking [Odds ratio (OR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25-0.77], higher body mass index (BMI) (OR 0.75, 0.59-0.96), and higher total cholesterol (OR 0.76, 0.60-0.97) prevented significantly full AHA criteria, whereas higher self-rated health (SRH) (OR 1.73, 1.07-2.80) predicted significantly of fulfilling all AHA criteria. Midlife smoking (OR 0.87, 0.84-0.91), higher BMI (OR 0.73, 0.61-0.86), and higher alcohol consumption (OR 0.73, 0.60-0.90) prevented significantly of fulfilling the five AHA criteria with chronic diseases, and higher SRH (OR 1.90, 1.37-2.63) predicted significantly the five AHA criteria (chronic diseases present). DISCUSSION: Our study suggests that midlife factors, especially good SRH and low levels of cardiovascular risk factors, are associated with AHA. CONCLUSIONS: The study emphasizes the importance of life-course predictors of healthy aging.
