37958146|a|The effects of concurrent ketamine and propofol (ketofol) constant rate infusion (CRI) were examined in six dogs. The K:P ratio was 1:2, with an initial CRI of 0.25/0.5 mg/kg/min over ten minutes, followed by a 0.5 mg/kg ketamine bolus for induction. During induction, a comprehensive EEG frequency spectrum from delta to gamma was observed, accompanied by subanesthetic-dose ketofol-induced behavioral excitation, including nystagmus, tongue flicking, salivation and active muscle activity. The dogs were maintained on three 15 min decremental doses of ketofol CRI (0.8/1.6, 0.4/0.8 and 0.2/0.4 mg/kg/min). This phase featured a significant decrease in the Patient State Index, electromyographic activity and a shift to low beta waves (SEF95: 13-18 Hz). Additionally, profound antinociception to electric stimulation and a stable heart rate and blood pressure (MBP 81.5-110 mmHg) were observed, as well as a merging of ketamine and propofol EEG characteristics during maintenance. In the recovery phase, a return to beta and gamma EEG patterns and excitement behavior occurred, accompanied by a significant reduction in antinociception, highlighting features of low doses of ketofol. This study reveals biphasic EEG dynamic changes, associated behaviors and robust antinociception and cardiovascular function, suggesting the utility of ketofol as a total intravenous anesthetic combination in dogs.
