34930954|t|A novel ex vivo model for critical illness neuromyopathy using freshly resected human colon smooth muscle.
34930954|a|Patients suffering from critical illness are at risk to develop critical illness neuromyopathy (CINM). The underlying pathophysiology is complex and controversial. A central question is whether soluble serum factors are involved in the pathogenesis of CINM. In this study, smooth muscle preparations obtained from the colon of patients undergoing elective surgery were used to investigate the effects of serum from critically ill patients. At the time of blood draw, CINM was assessed by clinical rating and electrophysiology. Muscle strips were incubated with serum of healthy controls or patients in organ baths and isometric force was measured. Fifteen samples from healthy controls and 98 from patients were studied. Ratios of responses to electric field stimulation (EFS) before and after incubation were 118% for serum from controls and 51% and 62% with serum from critically ill patients obtained at day 3 and 10 of critical illness, respectively (p = 0.003, One-Way-ANOVA). Responses to carbachol and high-K+ were equal between these groups. Ratios of post/pre-EFS responses correlated with less severe CINM. These results support the existence of pathogenic, i.e. neurotoxic factors in the serum of critically ill patients. Using human colon smooth muscle as a bioassay may facilitate their future molecular identification.
