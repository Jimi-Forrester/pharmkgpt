39659598|a|Methylglyoxal (MGO) plays an important role not only in physiological processes but also in pathological conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, developing accurate quantitative tools for MGO is of great significance for studying pathogenesis. Among the various methods available, the fluorescent probe method has garnered considerable attention due to its noninvasive detection capability, exceptional optical properties, good biocompatibility, and high sensitivity. In this review, we provide a brief overview of recent research on fluorescent probes used for MGO biosensing and bioimaging in living cells, tissues, and animals. Additionally, we summarize the advantages and existing challenges and also discuss future directions for development in this field.
