31863758|t|Novel Markers for Predicting Type 2 Neurologic Complications of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.
31863758|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 neurologic complications of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) include postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium. Although relevant clinically, they are rarely properly recognized outside of dedicated research setting, as their identification is complex and time-consuming. The aim of this study was to examine the diagnostic potential of 4 novel brain-injury biomarkers for predicting these sequelae at the completion of off-pump CABG. METHODS: A total of 100 consecutive patients scheduled for elective isolated off-pump CABG were enrolled. Control group of patients without neurological complications (n = 48) was compared separately to study groups diagnosed with postoperative cognitive dysfunction (n = 39) and delirium (n = 26). Serum concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein, neuroserpin, phosphorylated axonal neurofilament subunit H, and visinin-like protein 1 were evaluated at baseline, end of surgery, as well as on postoperative day 1 and 7. RESULTS: Increased end of surgery to baseline ratio of neuroserpin predicted the occurrence of both postoperative cognitive dysfunction (area under the curve = 0.655, 95% confidence interval 0.54-0.77) and delirium (area under curve = 0.643, 95% confidence interval 0.52-0.77). Concentrations of neuroserpin were significantly higher on postoperative day 7 compared with end of surgery and postoperative day 1 in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among novel biochemical markers of brain damage, neuroserpin may be a promising predictor of type 2 neurological complications and may express neuroregeneration after off-pump CABG, whereas glial fibrillary acidic protein, phosphorylated axonal neurofilament subunit H, and visinin-like protein 1 may not be suitable for this clinical setting.
