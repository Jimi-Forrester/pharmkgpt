37701257|t|Prolonged Transient Global Amnesia: Part of the Clinical Spectrum or a Separate Disease Entity?
37701257|a|Background: Transient global amnesia (TGA) is the prototypical neurologic disease for acute-onset reversible amnesia. It is currently defined by resolution of symptoms within 24-hours. In this case report we describe an atypical case of prolonged TGA, emphasizing our current lack of knowledge surrounding this disease entity and its pathophysiology. Results: A 66-year old female presented acutely with profound anterograde amnesia and variable retrograde amnesia with no inciting event. A thorough workup to exclude alternative causes of amnesia (including computed tomography angiogram and electroencephalogram) was normal. Her magnetic resonance imaging was consistent with TGA, with punctate diffusion restriction changes bilaterally in the hippocampi. She was also mildly hypoxemic with no discernible cause. She was ultimately diagnosed with TGA although her diagnosis remains controversial as her symptoms persisted for 72-hours. Conclusion: Our patients clinical and imaging features (apart from her protracted time-course and hypoxemia) were in keeping with a diagnosis of TGA. The association of hypoxemia, COVID-19, obstructive sleep apnea, and the development of TGA remains to be elucidated. Although the underlying pathophysiology for TGA is unknown several mechanisms have been postulated including cortical spreading depression and reversible hypoxic-ischemic injury. The time course for symptom resolution, could be an important clue in discerning the pathophysiology of TGA on an individual basis. Importantly, a clinician should not be deterred by amnestic symptoms lasting >24-hours, if the patients clinical/radiologic presentation is consistent with TGA.
