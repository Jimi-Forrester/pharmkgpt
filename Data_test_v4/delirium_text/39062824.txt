39062824|a|This study examined the patterns of epidermal growth-factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1) deposition in the small intestine and colon to evaluate the association between the histopathological severity of EFEMP1 deposition and constipation and determine the colocalization of amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) and EFEMP1 deposits. In 40 older cases (>=80 years of age), EFEMP1 deposition in the small intestine initiated in the submucosal and subserous vessels, subserous interstitium, and serosa (early stage), progressing to the muscularis propria and peri-Auerbach plexus area (intermediate stage), and finally spreading diffusely to other areas, excluding the mucosa and muscularis mucosa (advanced stage). The colon had a similar pattern of progression. During the middle-to-advanced stages, amyloid formation was observed in some vascular and serous deposits. A subgroup of cases was identified in which EFEMP1 deposition was the only presumed cause of constipation. Additionally, we demonstrated the colocalization of ATTR and EFEMP1 deposition. Apple-green birefringence was detected under polarized light only in approximately one-half of the cases in the small intestine and one-third of the cases in the colon. These findings strongly suggest that EFEMP1 deposits are correlated with pathological conditions of the lower gastrointestinal tract. As the histopathological diagnosis using Congo red-stained specimens is challenging, the combined use of elastic fiber staining and EFEMP1 immunohistochemistry is recommended to identify EFEMP1 deposition.
