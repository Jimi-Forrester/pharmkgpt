38599243|t|Correlation between abnormal cellular immune and changes of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
38599243|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence from previous studies indicates that neuroinflammation contributes to the onset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Moreover, cellular dysfunction is induced by impaired signaling of neurotransmitters. This study aimed to explore the correlation between cellular immune dysfunction and neurotransmitter changes through cranial Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) in AD patients. METHODS: Here, 32 AD, 40 Vascular Dementia (VD), and 35 Non-Dementia Elderly Control (NDE) cases were enrolled. Flow cytometry was performed to characterize lymphocyte subsets in plasma samples. The IL-1beta and Caspase-1 levels were detected by ELISA. The NLRP3 expression level was measured by Western Blot (WB). The equivalence of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), Creatine (Cr), Choline (Cho), and Inositol (MI) in bilateral hippocampi of patients was examined by MRS. The association of NAA/Cr or MI/Cr ratios with the proportion of T lymphocyte subsets or NK cell subsets was determined through single-factor correlation analysis. RESULTS: The proportion of T lymphocyte subsets was significantly lower in the AD group than in the NDE group (P < 0.01). On the other hand, the Caspase-1, NLRP3, and IL-1beta protein expression levels were significantly higher in the AD group than in the other groups. Further analysis showed that the NAA/Cr ratio was lower in the AD group than in the NDE group. Additionally, a significant positive correlation was found between the NAA/Cr ratio and the MMSE score (r = 0.81, P < 0.01). Moreover, a significant positive correlation was observed between the NAA/Cr and T lymphocyte ratios. The NAA/Cr ratio was significantly negatively correlated with the proportion of NK cells in the blood (r = -0.83, P < 0.01). A significant negative correlation was also recorded between the MI/Cr and T cell ratios in blood samples. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired cellular immune dysfunction in AD patients was significantly correlated with abnormal MRS. Neuroimmune dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD and alter the metabolism of neurotransmitters such as aspartic acid and MI in the brains of AD patients.
