30586872|t|The Synergistic Effects of APOE Genotype and Obesity on Alzheimer's Disease Risk.
30586872|a|The APOE gene has three common alleles-E2, E3, and E4, with APOE4 being the strongest genetic risk factor for developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Obesity is a global epidemic and contributes to multiple metabolic problems. Obesity is also a risk factor for cognitive decline. Here, we review the effects of APOE4 and obesity on cognition and AD development, independently and together. We describe studies that have associated APOE4 with cognitive deficits and AD, as well as studies that have associated obesity to cognitive deficits and AD. We then describe studies that have examined the effects of obesity and APOE genotypes together, with a focus on APOE4 and high fat diets. Both human studies and rodent models have contributed to understanding the effects of obesity on the different APOE genotypes, and we outline possible underlying mechanisms associated with these effects. Data across approaches support a model in which APOE4 and obesity combine for greater detrimental effects on metabolism and cognition, in ways that are influenced by both age and sex.
