36974565|t|Efficacy and Safety of Liver Resection in Super Elderly Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
36974565|a|OBJECTIVE: Liver resection in the super elderly patients remains challenging because of comorbidities and operative tolerability. METHODS: In this study, we compared postoperative complications and survival in patients aged >=85 yr included five patients aged >=90 yr with those aged 70-79 and 80-84 yr at a single institution. RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-seven patients aged >=70 yr underwent liver resection and were divided into three groups based on age at operation between 2010 and 2022; (a) 70-79 yr (median of 74 yr, n=245), (b) 80-84 yr (median of 82 yr, n=81), and (c) >=85 yr (median of 87 yr, n=41). In the >=85 yr group (90-yr-old group), twenty-five patients (four) had hypertension, fourteen (one) had diabetes mellitus, seven (one) had cardiovascular disease, and five patients (one) had dementia. The rate of comorbidities did not differ significantly among three groups. The rate of postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade 3a<=) was 25% in the 70- to 79-yr-old group, 27% in the 80- to 84-yr-old group, and 17% in the >=85-yr-old group (20% in the >=90-yr-old group) (N.S.). The 1- and 5-yr patient survival rates in the >=85-yr-old group were 90.1% and 48.5% respectively, compared with 86.7% and 60.9% in the 70- to 79-yr-old group and 83.8% and 66.3% in the 80- to 84-yr-old group, respectively (N.S.). CONCLUSION: Despite the management of comorbidities, liver resection for well-selected super elderly patients, such as those aged >=85 yr included >=90yr, has acceptable outcomes. The age of patient is not an absolute contraindication to liver resection.
