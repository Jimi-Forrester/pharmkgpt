37313061|t|Emotional Incontinence: A Case Report of Pseudobulbar Affect in the Setting of Alcohol Use Disorder.
37313061|a|Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) manifests as a disconnect between emotional feelings and emotional expressions. The impact of pseudobulbar affect on social, occupational, and interpersonal functioning is substantial. It results in poor quality of social interactions and poor overall quality of life. Instances of pseudobulbar affect with no underlying neuropsychiatric disorders are rarely reported in the literature. Although alcohol use has been associated with traumatic brain injuries (TBI), alcohol as a direct cause of pseudobulbar palsy has rarely been reported. Our case presents a unique situation with no known underlying primary neurologic disorder but evidence from clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests indicative of severe alcohol use disorder. This case represents the rare instances where the disease etiology is unusual and reminds the health care provider to consider the role of alcohol in the pathophysiology of pseudobulbar affect. More research is needed to understand the role of alcohol in the etiology of pseudobulbar affect in the absence of any known underlying neuropsychiatric disorder.
