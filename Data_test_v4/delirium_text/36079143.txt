36079143|a|Since the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), many studies have shown that besides common COVID-19 symptoms, patients may develop various neuropsychiatric conditions including anxiety, mood disorders, psychosis, neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., dementia), insomnia, and even substance abuse disorders. COVID-19 can also worsen the patients underlying neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions during or after the system phase of disease. In this review, we discuss the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on development or status of neuropsychiatric conditions during or following COVID-19.
