38643562|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an enigmatic neurological illness that offers few treatment options. Recent exploration has highlighted the crucial connection of the Wnt signaling pathway in AD pathogenesis, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets. The present study focuses on the dual targeting of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and casein kinase-1delta (CK-1delta) within the framework of the Wnt signaling pathway as a possible technique for AD intervention. GSK-3beta and CK-1delta are multifunctional kinases known for their roles in tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid processing, and synaptic dysfunction, all of which are major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. They are intricately linked to Wnt signaling, which plays a pivotal part in sustaining neuronal function and synaptic plasticity. Dysregulation of the Wnt pathway in AD contributes to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. This review delves into the molecular mechanisms by which GSK-3beta and CK-1delta impact the Wnt signaling pathway, elucidating their roles in AD pathogenesis. We discuss the potential of small-molecule inhibitors along with their SAR studies along with the multi-targetd approach targeting GSK-3beta and CK-1delta to modulate Wnt signaling and mitigate AD-related pathology. In summary, the dual targeting of GSK-3beta and CK-1delta within the framework of the Wnt signaling pathway presents an innovative and promising avenue for future AD therapies, offering new hope for patients and caregivers in the quest to combat this challenging condition.
