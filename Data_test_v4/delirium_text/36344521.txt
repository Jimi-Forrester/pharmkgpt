36344521|t|Regulome-based characterization of drug activity across the human diseasome.
36344521|a|Drugs are expected to recover the cell system away from the impaired state to normalcy through disease treatment. However, the understanding of gene regulatory machinery underlying drug activity or disease pathogenesis is far from complete. Here, we perform large-scale regulome analysis for various diseases in terms of gene regulatory machinery. Transcriptome signatures were converted into regulome signatures of transcription factors by integrating publicly available ChIP-seq data. Regulome-based correlations between diseases and their approved drugs were much clearer than the transcriptome-based correlations. For example, an inverse correlation was observed for cancers, whereas a positive correlation was observed for immune system diseases. After demonstrating the usefulness of the regulome-based drug discovery method in terms of accuracy and applicability, we predicted new drugs for nonsmall cell lung cancer and validated the anticancer activity in vitro. The proposed method is useful for understanding disease-disease relationships and drug discovery.
