35910121|t|Synthesis, Crystal Structures, and Density Functional Theory Studies of Two Salt Cocrystals Containing Meldrum's Acid Group.
35910121|a|Two salt cocrystals, C31H34N4O8 (DDD) and C17H20N2O8 (MDD), were synthesized and their structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. DDD is made up of one (C13H13O8)- anion, one (C9H11N2)+ cation, and one 5,6-dimethyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole molecule. MDD consists of one (C4H7N2)+ cation and one (C13H13O8)- anion. DDD and MDD belong to the monoclinic, P21/c space group and triclinic, P-1 space group, respectively. A 1D-chained structure of DDD was constituted by N-H   N and N-H   O hydrogen bonds. However, a 1D-chained structure of MDD was bridged by N-H   O hydrogen bonds. Their density functional theory-optimized geometric structures with a B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) basis set fit well with those of crystallographic studies. By calculating their thermodynamic properties, the correlation equations of C 0 p,m , S 0 m , H 0 m , and temperature T were obtained. By comparing the experimental electronic spectra with the calculated electronic spectra, it is found that the PBEPBE/6-311G(d,p) method can simulate the UV-Vis spectra of DDD and MDD. In addition, the fluorescence spectra in the EtOH solution analysis show that the yellowish-green emission occurs at 570 nm (lambdaex = 310 nm) for DDD and the purplish-blue emission occurs at 454 nm (lambdaex = 316 nm) for MDD.
