36230910|t|Loss of Homeostatic Microglia Signature in Prion Diseases.
36230910|a|Prion diseases are neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and animals. They are always fatal and, to date, no treatment exists. The hallmark of prion disease pathophysiology is the misfolding of an endogenous protein, the cellular prion protein (PrPC), into its disease-associated isoform PrPSc. Besides the aggregation and deposition of misfolded PrPSc, prion diseases are characterized by spongiform lesions and the activation of astrocytes and microglia. Microglia are the innate immune cells of the brain. Activated microglia and astrocytes represent a common pathological feature in neurodegenerative disorders. The role of activated microglia has already been studied in prion disease mouse models; however, it is still not fully clear how they contribute to disease progression. Moreover, the role of microglia in human prion diseases has not been thoroughly investigated thus far, and specific molecular pathways are still undetermined. Here, we review the current knowledge on the different roles of microglia in prion pathophysiology. We discuss microglia markers that are also dysregulated in other neurodegenerative diseases including microglia homeostasis markers. Data on murine and human brain tissues show that microglia are highly dysregulated in prion diseases. We highlight here that the loss of homeostatic markers may especially stand out.
