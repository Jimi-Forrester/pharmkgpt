39754544|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of eight weeks of aerobic training (AT) and vitamin C supplementation (VC) on apoptotic markers in hippocampus tissue of AD rats treated with trimethyltin (TMT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, 32 Sprague- Dawley rats (mean age: 14-18 months and mean weight 270-320 g) were treated with (10 mg/kg) TMT and divided into 4 groups including: 1) ADcontrol, 2) VC, 3) AT and 4) AT+VC groups. In order to investigate the effects of AD induction on research variables, 8 healthy rats selected as healthy control group (HC). Groups 3 and 4 trained for eight weeks, three sessions per week and each session lasted 15-48 minutes with an intensity of 10-24 m/min. Groups 2 and 4 received 4 mg/kg VC orally. One-way ANOVA with Tukey's post- hoc tests were used for statistical analysis of data (p <= 0.05). RESULTS: The gene expression levels of Caspase 3, FasL, Cyt-C and AP-1 in the AT, VC and AT+VC groups were significantly lower than TMT group (p <= 0.05); Caspase 3, FasL and Cyt-C levels were significantly lower in the AT+VC group compare to VC and ET groups (p <= 0.05). CytC levels in AT group were significantly lower than VC group (p = 0.002). Also, AP-1 levels in AT+VC group were significantly lower than AT group (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: It seems that AT and VC, both alone and interactively, can probably induce their anti-apoptotic effects in the hippocampus tissue of rats with AD via a common signaling pathway.
