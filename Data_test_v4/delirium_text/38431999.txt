38431999|a|Resting-state eyes-closed electroencephalographic (rsEEG) alpha rhythms are dominant in posterior cortical areas in healthy adults and are abnormal in subjective memory complaint (SMC) persons with Alzheimer's disease amyloidosis. This exploratory study in 161 SMC participants tested the relationships between those rhythms and seed-based resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) connectivity between thalamus and visual cortical networks as a function of brain amyloid burden, revealed by positron emission tomography and cognitive reserve, measured by educational attainment. The SMC participants were divided into 4 groups according to 2 factors: Education (Edu+ and Edu-) and Amyloid burden (Amy+ and Amy-). There was a statistical interaction (p < 0.05) between the two factors, and the subgroup analysis using estimated marginal means showed a positive association between the mentioned rs-fMRI connectivity and the posterior rsEEG alpha rhythms in the SMC participants with low brain amyloidosis and high CR (Amy-/Edu+). These results suggest that in SMC persons, early Alzheimer's disease amyloidosis may contrast the beneficial effects of cognitive reserve on neurophysiological oscillatory mechanisms at alpha frequencies and connectivity between the thalamus and visual cortical networks.
