38884106|t|A Prospective Longitudinal Cohort Study of Serum Stanniocalcin-1 as a Potential Prognostic Biomarker of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.
38884106|a|Background: Stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) may harbor anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects. This study was done with the intent to determine the role of serum STC1 in severity assessment and prognosis prediction of severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). Methods: In this prospective longitudinal cohort study of 104 sTBI patients and 104 healthy individuals (controls), serum STC1 levels were quantified. Severity indicators were Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Rotterdam computed tomography classification. Follow-up time was 180 days and extended Glasgow outcome scale (GOSE) score 1-4 was deemed as poor prognosis. Multivariate analyses were applied to assess severity correlations and prognosis associations. Discriminative efficiencies were estimated in terms of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Patients exhibited significantly higher serum STC1 levels than controls. Serum STC1 levels were substantially elevated in order of GCS scores from 8 to 3, Rotterdam scores from 3 to 6 and 180-day GOSE scores from 8 to 1. Also, serum STC1 levels were independently correlated with GCS scores, Rotterdam scores and 180-day GOSE scores. Serum STC1 levels were independently associated with 180-day death, overall survival and poor prognosis, as well as were efficiently predictive of death and poor prognosis. Prediction model containing GCS scores, Rotterdam scores and serum STC1 levels, as opposed to any of them, showed higher discriminative ability for the risks of death and poor prognosis. Alternatively, serum STC1 levels were linearly correlated with risk of death, overall survival and poor prognosis under restricted cubic spline. Subgroup analysis showed that serum STC1 levels non-statistically significantly interacted with age, gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, etc. Conclusion: A significant elevation of serum STC1 levels is highly related to severity and clinical outcome, suggesting that serum STC1 may be a potential prognostic biomarker of sTBI.
