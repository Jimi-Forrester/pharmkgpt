37591482|a|BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) can improve the physical and psychological health of prostate and colorectal cancer survivors, but PA behavior change maintenance is necessary for long-term health benefits. OncoActive is a print- and web-based intervention in which prostate and colorectal cancer patients and survivors receive automatically generated, personalized feedback aimed at integrating PA into daily life to increase and maintain PA. We evaluated the long-term outcomes of OncoActive by examining the 12-month follow-up differences between OncoActive and a control group, and we explored whether PA was maintained during a 6 month non-intervention follow-up period. METHODS: Prostate or colorectal cancer patients were randomly assigned to an OncoActive (n = 249) or a usual care waitlist control group (n = 229). OncoActive participants received PA advice and a pedometer. PA outcomes (i.e., ActiGraph and self-report moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) min/week and days with >=30 min PA) and health-related outcomes (i.e., fatigue, depression, physical functioning) were assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Differences between groups and changes over time were assessed with multilevel linear regressions for the primary outcome (ActiGraph MVPA min/week) and all additional outcomes. RESULTS: At 12 months, OncoActive participants did not perform better than control group participants at ActiGraph MVPA min/week, self-report MVPA min/week, or ActiGraph days with PA. Only self-report days with PA were significantly higher in OncoActive compared to the control group. For health-related outcomes only long-term fatigue was significantly lower in OncoActive. When exploratively examining PA within OncoActive, the previously found PA effects at the end of the intervention (6 months follow-up) were maintained at 12 months. Furthermore, all PA outcomes improved significantly from baseline to 12 months. The control group showed small but non-significant improvements from 6 months to 12 months (and from baseline to 12 months), resulting in a decline of differences between groups. CONCLUSION: The majority of previously reported significant between-group differences at 6 months follow-up were no longer present at long-term follow-up, possibly because of natural improvement in the control group. At long-term follow-up, fatigue was significantly lower in OncoActive compared to control group participants. Computer-tailored PA advice may give participants an early start toward recovery and potentially contributes to improving long-term health.
