28058207|t|Memory loss: Five new things.
28058207|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Memory loss can be due to a wide variety of causes. We provide new information about the biology of common genetic and acquired causes of memory loss in older adults. RECENT FINDINGS: New data are available about the genetics of Alzheimer disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal dementia. Amyloid PET, FDG-PET, and MRI have improved our understanding of how mild cognitive impairment evolves to AD. Several studies have shown links between concussion and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Healthy eating and regular exercise have been demonstrated to slow cognitive decline in older adults. Randomized trials continue to show benefits for cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine in patients with AD and DLB. SUMMARY: New causes of memory loss are still being identified. More sophisticated diagnostic tools have improved our ability to make earlier diagnoses in older adults with memory loss.
