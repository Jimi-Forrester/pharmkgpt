32096000|t|Update of the organoprotective properties of xenon and argon: from bench to beside.
32096000|a|The growth of the elderly population has led to an increase in patients with myocardial infarction and stroke (Wajngarten and Silva, Eur Cardiol 14: 111-115, 2019). Patients receiving treatment for ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) highly profit from early reperfusion therapy under 3 h from the onset of symptoms. However, mortality from STEMI remains high due to the increase in age and comorbidities (Menees et al., N Engl J Med 369: 901-909, 2013). These factors also account for patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Reperfusion therapy has been established as the gold standard within the first 4 to 5 h after onset of symptoms (Powers et al., Stroke 49: e46-e110, 2018). Nonetheless, not all patients are eligible for reperfusion therapy. The same is true for traumatic brain injury patients. Due to the complexity of acute myocardial and central nervous injury (CNS), finding organ protective substances to improve the function of remote myocardium and the ischaemic penumbra of the brain is urgent. This narrative review focuses on the noble gases argon and xenon and their possible cardiac, renal and neuroprotectant properties in the elderly high-risk (surgical) population. The article will provide an overview of the latest experimental and clinical studies. It is beyond the scope of this review to give a detailed summary of the mechanistic understanding of organ protection by xenon and argon.
