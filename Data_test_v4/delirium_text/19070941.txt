Moreover, amyloid-induced toxicity has been shown to be dependent on TNFR-signaling. However, it is still unclear whether TNFRs are involved in the early stages of dementia. METHODS: We analyzed soluble TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at baseline in 137 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 30 age-matched controls. The MCI patients were followed for 4-6 years with an incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or vascular dementia (VaD) of 15% per year. RESULTS: The patients with MCI who subsequently developed these forms of dementias had higher levels of sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 in both CSF and plasma already at baseline when compared to age-matched controls (p<0.05). In the CSF of MCI subjects and controls the levels of both sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 correlated strongly with beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) activity (r(s)=0.53-0.68, p<0.01) and Abeta 40 levels (r(s)=0.59-0.71, p<0.001). Similarly, both sTNFRs were associated with Abeta 40 (r(s)=0.39-0.46, p<0.05) in plasma. Finally, the levels of both sTNFRs correlated with the axonal damage marker tau in the CSF of MCI subjects and controls (r(s)=0.57-0.83, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: TNFR-signaling might be involved in the early pathogenesis of AD and VaD, and could be associated with beta-amyloid metabolism.
