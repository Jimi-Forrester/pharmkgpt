34355024|t|Bioinformatics Analysis Reveals the Potential Diagnostic Biomarkers for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.
34355024|a|Objectives: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are associated with high mortality rates. The genes and pathways linked with AAA remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) linked to the progression of AAA using bioinformatics analysis. Methods: Gene expression profiles of the GSE47472 and GSE57691 datasets were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. These datasets were merged and normalized using the "sva" R package, and DEGs were identified using the limma package in R. The functions of these DEGs were assessed using Cytoscape software. We analyzed the DEGs using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis. Protein-protein interaction networks were assembled using Cytoscape, and crucial genes were identified using the Cytoscape plugin, molecular complex detection. Data from GSE15729 and GSE24342 were also extracted to verify our findings. Results: We found that 120 genes were differentially expressed in AAA. Genes associated with inflammatory responses and nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process were clustered in two gene modules in AAA. The hub genes of the two modules were IL6, RPL21, and RPL7A. The expression levels of IL6 correlated positively with RPL7A and negatively with RPL21. The expression of RPL21 and RPL7A was downregulated, whereas that of IL6 was upregulated in AAA. Conclusions: The expression of RPL21 or RPL7A combined with IL6 has a diagnostic value for AAA. The novel DEGs and pathways identified herein might provide new insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of AAA.
