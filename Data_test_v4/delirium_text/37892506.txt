37892506|t|Early Intervention in Cognitive Aging with Strawberry Supplementation.
37892506|a|Late-life dementia is a growing public health concern lacking effective treatment. Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) develop over a preclinical period of many years beginning in midlife. The prevalence of insulin resistance, a prominent risk factor for late-life dementia, also accelerates in middle-age. Consumption of berry fruits, including strawberries, has been shown to influence metabolism as well as cognitive performance suggesting potential to mitigate risk for dementia. In this controlled trial, we enrolled overweight middle-aged men and women with insulin resistance and subjective cognitive decline and performed a 12-week intervention with daily administration of whole-fruit strawberry powder. Diet records showed that participants in both groups maintained the prescribed abstinence from berry product consumption outside the study. We observed diminished memory interference (p = 0.02; Cohen's f = 0.45) and a reduction of depressive symptoms (p = 0.04; Cohen's f = 0.39) for the strawberry-treated participants; benefits consistent with improved executive ability. However, there was no effect of the intervention on metabolic measures, possibly a consequence of the sample size, length of the intervention, or comparatively low anthocyanin dose. Anti-inflammatory actions of anthocyanins were considered as a primary mechanistic factor. The findings support the notion that strawberry supplementation has a role in dementia risk reduction when introduced in midlife. However, further investigation with longer intervention periods, larger samples, and differing dosing regimens will be required to assess the benefits of strawberry intake with respect to cognition and metabolic function in the context of aging.
