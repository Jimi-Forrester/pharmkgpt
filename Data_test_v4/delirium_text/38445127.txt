38445127|t|Emergency Department Management of Common End-of-Life and Palliative Care Symptoms: Three Cases.
38445127|a|The emergency department (ED) is at times the only place where patients can turn for symptom relief. Patients of all ages may turn to the ED for help with the management of end-of-life (EOL) and palliative care (PC) symptoms. Emergency medicine (EM) is a specialty that manages disease-directed treatment for a variety of acute conditions. In contrast, EOL and PC are focused on improving quality of life. Patients with serious illness, even hospice patients, present to the ED in increasing numbers for symptom management. It has become essential for emergency physicians to care for patients who are not seeking life-sustaining measures but instead need quality-of-life interventions. The development of a clear, concise review of the most common acute symptoms can provide a framework for EM physicians to adequately address the needs of patients at the EOL. Here, we discuss three cases that highlight the management of five of the most common EOL and PC presentations to the ED.
