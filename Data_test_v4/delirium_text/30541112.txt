METHODS: Seventy-four participants were rigorously evaluated using a battery of cognitive tests and a detailed clinical assessment to verify normal cognitive status. We then screened for sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and depressive symptoms using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Five subjects were excluded due to mild depression. Overall 38 individuals with mean age 70.7 +- 7 were classified as poor sleepers and 31 with mean age of 69.6 +- 6 years as normal sleepers. Structural MRI and Freesurfer brain parcellation were used to measure aMCI-related brain regions. RESULTS: Relative to normal sleepers, poor sleepers exhibited significant reductions in cortical and subcortical volumes bilaterally in the hippocampi, as well as in the superior parietal lobules and left amygdala. The effects were strongest in the left superior parietal lobule (p < .015), followed by the hippocampi. Diffuse patterns of cortical thinning were observed in the frontal lobes, but significant effects were concentrated in the right mesial frontal cortex. Lower sleep duration was most correlated with cortical volume and thickness reductions among all subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Atrophy related to poor sleep quality impacted a number of regions implicated in aMCI and Alzheimer's disease (AD). As such, interventions targeted towards improving sleep quality amongst the elderly may prove an effective tool for modulating the course of aMCI and AD.
