38427187|t|CSF N-Glycomics Using MALDI MS Techniques.
38427187|a|In this chapter, we will present the methodology currently applied in our laboratory for the structural elucidation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) N-glycome. N-glycans are released from denatured carboxymethylated glycoproteins by digestion with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) and purified using both C18 Sep-Pak  and porous graphitized carbon (PGC) HyperSep  Hypercarb  solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges. The glycan pool is subsequently permethylated to increase mass spectrometry sensitivity. Molecular assignments are performed through matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS) analysis considering either the protein N-linked glycosylation pathway or MALDI TOF MS/MS data. Each stage has been optimized to obtain high-quality mass spectra in reflector mode with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio up to m/z 4800. This method has been successfully adopted to associate specific N-glycome profiles to the early and the advanced phases of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
