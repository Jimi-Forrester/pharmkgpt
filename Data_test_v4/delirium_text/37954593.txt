37954593|a|Background: HIV infection induces a 75% increase in the risk of developing neurocognitive impairment (NCI), which has been linked to immune activation. We therefore looked for immune activation markers correlating with NCI. Method: Sixty-five people aged 55-70 years living with controlled HIV-1 infection were enrolled in the study and their neurocognitive ability was assessed according to the Frascati criteria. Fifty-nine markers of T4 cell, T8 cell, NK cell, and monocyte activation, inflammation and endothelial activation were measured in their peripheral blood. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) were identified by magnetic resonance imaging. Double hierarchical clustering was performed for the activation markers and 240 patients including the 65 whose neurocognitive performance had been evaluated. Results: Thirty-eight percent of volunteers presented NCI. Twenty-four percent of them were asymptomatic and fourteen percent had a mild disorder. Strikingly, activated (HLA-DR+) as well as senescent (CD57+CD28-CD27+-) T4 cells and T8 cells were less prevalent in the peripheral blood of participants with NCI than in participants without the disorder. Accordingly, the percentage of HLA-DR+ T4 cells was lower in volunteers with periventricular and deep WMH. The double hierarchical clustering unveiled six different immune activation profiles. The neurocognitive performances of participants with two of these six profiles were poor. Here again, these two profiles were characterized by a low level of T4 and T8 cell activation and senescence. Conclusion: Our observation of low circulating levels of activated and senescent T cells in HIV-1 patients with NCI raises the interesting hypothesis that these lymphocytes may be recruited into the central nervous system.
