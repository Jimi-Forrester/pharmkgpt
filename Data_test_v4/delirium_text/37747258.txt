37747258|t|Precision Anaesthesia: Advancing Patient-Centered Precision Care Through Repetitive Assessment of PROMs with the Safe Brain Initiative Approach.
37747258|a|This article aims to introduce the Safe Brain Initiative (SBI) approach, focusing on collecting and leveraging Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) to enhance patient-centred precision anaesthesia and prevent postoperative delirium (POD) and neurocognitive disorders (NCD). The SBI was implemented to systematically address the feedback gap in perioperative care by collecting and analysing real-world data. The initiative focuses on monitoring and preventing POD and NCD, providing effective anaesthesia care, assessing patient and team satisfaction, and evaluating environmental sustainability impact. Based on international guidelines, 18 core recommendations were established to address potential complications and challenges associated with anaesthesia. Preliminary results showed a notable reduction in POD and increased awareness among anaesthesia team members regarding PROMs. The SBI approach demonstrated significant benefits during emergency situations, such as the February 2023 earthquake in Turkey, by providing crucial support and comfort to victims requiring multiple surgical interventions. The SBI presents an innovative, cost-effective, and patient-centred approach to perioperative care. By integrating PROMs and systematic feedback mechanisms, the SBI aims to expedite the advancement of efficient, patient-centered precision perioperative care, improve patient outcomes, and elevate the quality of care. The initiative has shown promising results, and its adoption is growing globally. Collaboration among healthcare providers, researchers, and patients is crucial in shaping the future of anaesthesia practice and further improving patient outcomes. Turkish hospitals are encouraged to join the SBI to benefit from international collaborations and contribute to positive change in perioperative care standards. The SBI project significantly advances precision anaesthesia, emphasising personalised care and patient well-being.
