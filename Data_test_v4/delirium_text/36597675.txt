The present study was to investigate the impact of consultation-liaison psychiatry on postoperative delirium in elderly hip fracture patients. METHODS: From March 2012 to September 2013, 89 patients with hip fractures hospitalized in Wuhan Mental Health Center were included in this prospective study as the consultation-liaison group. A total of 81 patients selected from August 2010 to February 2012 were defined as the conventional group. The delirium was evaluated using the confusion assessment method (CAM) recommended by the American Psychiatric Association guidelines. RESULTS: There was no difference of sex, age, trauma, surgical methods, and anesthesia between two groups (p > 0.05). The consultation rate of consultation-liaison group was significantly higher than that of conventional group (37.07% vs 17.28%, p < 0.05). After the consultation, there were 26 cases (78%) and nine cases (64%) of delirium in the consultation-liaison and conventional group, respectively (p > 0.05). In the consultation-liaison group, three patients (9.09%) were diagnosed with anxiety and three patients (9.09%) were diagnosed with depression, while in the conventional group, three patients (21.42%) were diagnosed with communication and one patient (7.14%) was diagnosed with depression. In addition, this study showed the incidence of delirium in consultation-liaison group was significantly higher than that of conventional group (29.21% vs 11.11%, p < 0.05). The average hospital stay in consultation-liaison group was significantly lower than that of conventional group (11.42 +- 2.63 vs. 15.17 +- 2.38 days, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Consultation-liaison psychiatry could improve the recognition rate of postoperative delirium in elderly hip fracture patients, shorten hospitalization time. The training of mental health knowledge for non-psychiatrists could improve the ability of early identification and treatment of delirium.
