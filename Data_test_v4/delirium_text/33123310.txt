33123310|t|The Antiaggregative and Antiamyloidogenic Properties of Nanoparticles: A Promising Tool for the Treatment and Diagnostics of Neurodegenerative Diseases.
33123310|a|Due to the progressive aging of the society, the prevalence and socioeconomic burden of neurodegenerative diseases are predicted to rise. The most common neurodegenerative disorders nowadays, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, can be classified as proteinopathies. They can be either synucleinopathies, amyloidopathies, tauopathies, or TDP-43-related proteinopathies; thus, nanoparticles with a potential ability to inhibit pathological protein aggregation and/or degrade already existing aggregates can be a promising approach in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. As it turns out, nanoparticles can be a double-edged sword; they can either promote or inhibit protein aggregation, depending on coating, shape, size, surface charge, and concentration. In this review, we aim to emphasize the need of a breakthrough in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and draw attention to nanomaterials, as they can also serve as a diagnostic tool for protein aggregates or can be used in a high-throughput screening for novel antiaggregative compounds.
