37015192|a|INTRODUCTION: Little is known regarding genetic factors associated with treatment outcome of psychotic depression. We explored genomic associations of remission and relapse of psychotic depression treated with pharmacotherapy. METHODS: Genomic analyses were performed in 171 men and women aged 18-85 years with an episode of psychotic depression who participated in the Study of the Pharmacotherapy of Psychotic Depression II (STOP-PD II). Participants were treated with open-label sertraline plus olanzapine for up to 12 weeks; those who achieved remission or near-remission and maintained it following 8 weeks of stabilization were eligible to participate in a 36-week randomized controlled trial that compared sertraline plus olanzapine with sertraline plus placebo in preventing relapse. RESULTS: There were no genome-wide significant associations with either remission or relapse. However, at a suggestive threshold, SNP rs1026501 (31 kb from SYNPO2) in the whole sample and rs6844137 (within the intronic region of SYNPO2) in the European ancestry subsample were associated with a decreased likelihood of remission. In polygenic risk analyses, participants who had greater improvement after antidepressant treatments showed a higher likelihood of reaching remission. Those who achieved remission and had a higher polygenic risk for Alzheimer's disease had a significantly decreased likelihood of relapse. CONCLUSION: Our analyses provide preliminary insights into the genetic architecture of remission and relapse in a well-characterized group of patients with psychotic depression.
