36530766|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an interstitial state between normal aging and dementia. Objective: In this study, we investigated working memory (WM) profiles of MCI patients using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). We also examined the diagnostic accuracy and possible associated factors as secondary outcomes of the study. Methods: We conducted an electronic search on EMBASE, PubMed, and ScienceDirect databases. Studies with MCI participants and using CANTAB battery subtests for the assessment of WM were included. Meta-analysis was conducted using the CMA2 software. Results: Out of 1537 records, 14 studies were covered in this systematic review, and 7 of them were included in the meta-analysis. There was a significant difference between MCI patients and healthy controls in spatial working memory (SWM) (SDM: 0.535; 95%CI 11-96; p-value=0.014), spatial span (SSP) (SDM: 0.649 95%CI 0.297-0.100; p-value<0.01), and rapid visual information processing (RVP) (SDM: 0.52; 95%CI 0.386-0.654; p-value<0.01). WM function of MCI patients was associated with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of tau-protein and amyloid-beta (Abeta). Conclusions: WM is an impaired cognitive domain in MCI. CANTAB WM subtests including SSP, SWM, and RVP are accurate enough to be used as a proper assessment tool for the diagnosis of MCI in clinical settings. Tau-protein and Abeta are associated with lower WM scores in MCI patients; however, sex, age, psychiatric disorders, apolipoprotein 4 allele, and functional activity scores cannot affect WM.
