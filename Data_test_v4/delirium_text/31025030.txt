31025030|a|To date, dysregulation of the insulin signaling pathway in the brain has not been demonstrated unequivocally in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of the study was to examine the possible dysregulation of insulin signaling pathway in an AD rat model. Furthermore, the present study investigated the effect of Donepezil and Curcumin on insulin signaling, insulin, and glucose levels in AD rat brain. The rats were induced to develop AD by intraperitoneal administration of Scopolamine. We found that glucose levels in plasma and brain were decreased in AD rats, whereas the insulin levels was increased in plasma but decreased in brain in AD rats. In addition, insulin signaling proteins IR-beta, IGF-1, IRS-1, IRS-2 p-Akt (Ser473), and Akt were markedly reduced in the AD rats. Furthermore, GLUT3 and GLUT4 levels in the brain were markedly reduced in AD rats. All these data were compared to Saline-treated control rats. Curcumin significantly increased glucose levels in plasma and in brain. However, insulin levels was decreased in plasma and was increased in AD rats' brain. Moreover, GLUT3 and GLUT4 levels were significantly increased in Curcumin-treated AD rats. All these data were compared to Scopolamine- induced AD rats. Thus amelioration of impaired insulin signaling and improved glucose regulation in AD rats by Curcumin may be beneficial in the management of AD.
