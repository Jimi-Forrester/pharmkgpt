36702822|t|Actigraphy-based sleep and activity measurements in intensive care unit patients randomized to ramelteon or placebo for delirium prevention.
36702822|a|Patients in the ICU often sleep poorly for various reasons, which may predispose to delirium. We previously conducted a clinical trial in which we tested the efficacy of ramelteon, a melatonin-receptor agonist used to treat insomnia, versus placebo, in preventing ICU delirium in patients who underwent elective pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) surgery. Here we examine sleep, activity, and circadian patterns, measured with actigraphy, to understand changes in these metrics with our intervention and in those with and without delirium. Participants wore wrist actigraphy devices while recovering post-operatively in the ICU. For sleep analysis, we extracted total sleep time and sleep fragmentation metrics over the 22:00 to 06:00 period nightly, and daytime nap duration from the daytime period (0:600 to 22:00) for each participant. For activity analyses, we extracted the following metrics: total daytime activity count (AC), maximum daytime AC, total nighttime AC, and maximum nighttime AC. Next, we performed a nonparametric circadian analysis on ACs over each 24-h day and extracted the following: interdaily stability (IS), intra-daily variability (IV), relative amplitude (RA), and low and high periods of activity (L5 and M10) as well as their start times. These metrics were compared between patients who received ramelteon versus placebo, and between patients who became delirious versus those who did not develop delirium. We additionally made comparisons between groups for daytime and nighttime light levels. No differences in sleep, activity, circadian metrics or light levels were found between drug groups. Delirious patients, when compared to those who were never delirious, had a lower IS (0.35 +- 0.16 vs. 0.47 +- 0.23; P = 0.006). Otherewise, no differences in IV, L5, M10, or RA were found between groups. L5 and M10 activity values increased significantly over the post-extubation for the whole cohort. No differences were found for daytime or nighttime light levels between groups. Overall, ramelteon did not impact sleep or circadian metrics in this cohort. Consistent with clinical experience, delirious patients had less inter-daily stability in their rest-activity rhythms. These data suggest that actigraphy might have value for individual assessment of sleep in the ICU, and for determining and detecting the impact of interventions directed at improving sleep and circadian activity rhythms in the ICU.Trial registration: REGISTERED at CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: NCT02691013.
