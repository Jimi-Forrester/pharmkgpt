32722000|t|beta-Carbolines in Experiments on Laboratory Animals.
32722000|a|Some studies have ascribed a protective effect against neurodegenerative diseases to the beta-carbolines harman (H) and norharman (NH), which occur mostly in coffee and coffee substitutes. We determined the concentrations of beta-carbolines and undesirable compounds (such as acrylamide) in roasted coffee substitute ingredients and found that chicory coffee was optimal. Two in vivo experiments were conducted with seventeen-month-old male Sprague Dawley rats fed a diet with the addition of pure carboline standards in the first stage, and chicory in the second. We observed an increase in the level of H and NH in blood plasma, as well as higher activity of animals in the battery behavioral test, particularly in the second stage. The results of in vitro studies-particularly the level of the expression in brain tissue of genes associated with aging processes and neurodegenerative diseases-clearly show the benefits of a diet rich in beta-carbolines.
