28680785|t|A Case Report of Probable Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease: How to Approach Early Diagnosis?
28680785|a|Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is a rare and fatal spongiform encephalopathy characterized by rapidly progressive dementia and myoclonus. The rarity of this disease and varied initial symptoms make the early diagnosis fairly challenging. Here, we present a case initially admitted for confusion and bizarre behaviors. She had acute deterioration of mental status, akinetic mutism, and myoclonus jerks four weeks later. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was positive for protein 14-3-3. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hyperintensities in the bilateral cortex, basal ganglia, and thalami in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed bihemispheric periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges. The probable diagnosis of sCJD was reached based on the clinical features, characteristic findings in her MRI, the EEG, and a positive 14-3-3 CSF assay. The literature was also reviewed for early diagnosis of sCJD.
