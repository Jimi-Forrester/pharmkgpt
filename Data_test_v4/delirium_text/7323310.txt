7323310|t|rCBF measurements by 133Xe inhalation: applications in neuropsychology and psychiatry.
7323310|a|This review describes recent advances in the application of rCBF measurements by the 133Xe-inhalation method to neuropsychological and psychiatric research. Studies mapping cortical activity, as indicated by flow variations during visual, auditory and tactile tasks of varying complexity are described. The bilateral rCBF measurements do also offer information concerning lateralization of mental processes. Some clinical applications in psychiatry are finally reviewed demonstrating the use of the technique in differential diagnosis of dementia of organic ethiology (Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia) against pseudodementia due to psychosis. The method is also very useful in the study of cases with toxic influence by alcohol and other agents.
