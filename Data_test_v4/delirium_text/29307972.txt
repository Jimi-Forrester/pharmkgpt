29307972|t|Rabies: A Novel Clinical Presentation.
29307972|a|Rabies is a fatal disease. Saliva of a rabid dog is a rich source of rabies virus. We report a patient who suffered of rabies, who was infected by abrasion caused by the nails of a rabid dog. Dogs often lick their nails and thereby transfer the rabies virus-contaminated saliva to their claws. Despite treatment in our Intensive Care Unit and application of various pharmacological antidotes, we were unable to prevent the fatal outcome.
