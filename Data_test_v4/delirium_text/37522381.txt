37522381|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Depressive symptoms are frequently reported in patients affected by frontotemporal dementia (FTD). At structural MRI, cortical features of depressed FTD patients have been poorly described. Our objective was to investigate correlations between cortical measures and depression severity in FTD patients. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Neuroimaging Initiative (FTLDNI) database. We included 98 controls and 92 FTD patients, n = 38 behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), n = 26 non-fluent variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (nfvPPA), and n = 28 semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA). Patients underwent clinical and cognitive evaluations, as well as a 3D T1-weighted MRI on a 3 Tesla scanner (Siemens, Trio Tim system). Depression was evaluated by means of Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Surface-based analysis was performed on T1-weighted images to evaluate cortical thickness, a measure of gray matter integrity, and local gyrification index (lGI), a quantitative metric of cortical folding. RESULTS: Patients affected by svPPA were more depressed than controls at NPI and depression severity at GDS was higher in svPPA and bvFTD. Severity of depression correlated with a decrease in lGI in left precentral and superior frontal gyrus, supramarginal and postcentral gyrus and right precentral, supramarginal, superior parietal and superior frontal gyri. Furthermore, depression severity correlated positively with cortical thickness in the left medial orbitofrontal cortex. DISCUSSION: We found that lGI was associated with depressive symptoms over brain regions involved in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder. This finding provides novel insights into the mechanisms underlying psychiatric symptoms in FTD.
