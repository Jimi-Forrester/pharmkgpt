32365918|a|The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is frequently missed or delayed in clinical practice. To remedy this situation, we developed a screening, paper-based (P-ELISA) platform to detect beta-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Abeta42) and provide rapid results using a small volume, easily accessible plasma sample instead of cerebrospinal fluid. The protocol outlined herein only requires 3 muL of sample per well and a short operating time (i.e., only 90 min). The detection limit of Abeta42 is 63.04 pg/mL in a buffer system. This P-ELISA-based approach can be used for early, preclinical stage AD screening, including screening for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. It may also be used for treatment and stage monitoring purposes. The implementation of this approach may provide tremendous impact for an afflicted population and may well prompt additional and expanded efforts in both academic and commercial communities.
