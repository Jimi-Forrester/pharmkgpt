34453725|t|Assessing Rab5 Activation in Health and Disease.
34453725|a|The endocytic pathway is a system of dynamically communicating vesicles, known as early endosomes, that internalize, sort, and traffic nutrients, trophic factors, and signaling molecules to sites throughout the cell. In all eukaryotic cells, early endosome functions are regulated by Rab5 activity, dependent upon its binding to GTP, whereas Rab5 bound to GDP represents the biologically inactive form. An increasing number of neurodegenerative diseases are associated with endocytic dysfunction and, in the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS), an early appearing highly characteristic reflection of endocytic pathway dysfunction is an abnormal enlargement of Rab5 positive endosomes. In AD and DS, endosome enlargement accompanying accelerated endocytosis and fusion, upregulated transcription of endocytosis-related genes, and aberrant signaling by endosomes are caused by pathological Rab5 overactivation. In this chapter, we describe a battery of methods that have been used to assess Rab5 activation in models of AD/DS and are applicable to other cell and animal disease models. These methods include (1) fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay; (2) quantitative measurement of endosome size by light, fluorescence and electron microscopy; (3) detection of GTP-Rab5 by in situ immunocytochemistry in vitro and ex vivo; (4) immunoprecipitation and GTP-agarose pull-down assay; (5) biochemical detection of Rab5 in endosome-enriched subcellular fractions obtained by OptiPrep  density gradient centrifugation of mouse brain.
