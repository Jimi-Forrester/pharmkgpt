36708860|a|Astrocytes are highly energy-consuming glial cells critical for metabolic support to neurons. A growing body of evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes is involved in age-related neurodegenerative disorders and that fish oil, rich in docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) fatty acids, may alleviate cognition impairment in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The present study examines the effect of DHA and EPA on mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), apoptosis activation and ATP levels in astrocytes cultured in medium containing glucose or galactose, which limits oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). MMP, expressed as the ratio of red to green JC-10 and MitoTracker fluorescence, increased in EPA-incubated cells in a dose dependent manner and was higher than in DHA-incubated astrocytes, also after uncoupling of OXPHOS by carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). In cells cultured in glucose and galactose medium mitochondrial hyperpolarization had no impact on intracellular ATP level. Furthermore, both EPA and DHA elevated mitochondrial cardiolipin content, however only EPA did so in a dose-dependent manner and reduced apoptosis which was analyzed by flow cytometry.
