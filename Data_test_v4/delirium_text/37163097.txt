37163097|a|Adult neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) reside in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus throughout the lifespan of most mammalian species. In addition to generating new neurons, NSPCs may alter their niche via secretion of growth factors and cytokines. We recently showed that adult DG NSPCs secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is critical for maintaining adult neurogenesis. Here, we asked whether NSPC-derived VEGF alters hippocampal function independent of adult neurogenesis. We found that loss of NSPC-derived VEGF acutely impaired hippocampal memory, caused neuronal hyperexcitability and exacerbated excitotoxic injury. We also found that NSPCs generate substantial proportions of total DG VEGF and VEGF disperses broadly throughout the DG, both of which help explain how this anatomically-restricted cell population could modulate function broadly. These findings suggest that NSPCs actively support and protect DG function via secreted VEGF, thereby providing a non-neurogenic functional dimension to endogenous NSPCs.
