11698032|a|It is well established that neuroinflammation plays an important role in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, stroke, traumatic brain- and spinal cord injury and demyelinating diseases. Likewise, it has been suggested that neuroinflammation plays an important role in nociception and hyperalgesia. Most research concerning inflammatory aspects of pain has concerned the effects of proinflammatory cytokines, prostaglandins and growth factors. Recently, it has been suggested that chemokines play a role in inflammatory pain. Chemokines do not only attract blood leukocytes to the site of injury but also contribute directly to nociception.
