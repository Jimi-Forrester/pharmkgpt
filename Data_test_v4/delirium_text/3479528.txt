3479528|t|A model hypocholinergic syndrome produced by a false choline analog, N-aminodeanol.
3479528|a|N-aminodeanol is an analog of choline that serves as a less effective substrate in all of its known enzymatic and transport mechanisms. It was utilized to test the hypothesis that the selective vulnerability of cholinergic neurones in Alzheimer's disease is due to competition for the available choline between pathways for acetylcholine and phospholipid synthesis. Rats placed on a choline free diet containing an equivalent amount of N-aminodeanol develop a model hypocholinergic state comprising hyperreactivity, hyperalgesia, aggressive behavior and a deficit in learning and memory. These effects are associated with a progressive replacement of free and lipid-bound choline and acetylcholine with N-aminodeanol and its corresponding esters. Choline acetyltransferase is reduced in some brain regions, suggesting a loss of cholinergic neurones. We propose that this represents a potentially useful animal model of Alzheimer's disease which deserves further investigation.
