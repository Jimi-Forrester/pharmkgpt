30768735|a|Two kinds of microglia are known, classical M1 and alternative M2 phenotypes. Amyloid beta (Abeta), a critical cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD), promotes M1 microglial polarization, leading to neuroinflammation and neuronal death. M2 microglia play important roles in anti-inflammatory effects, Abeta clearance, and memory recovery in AD. Therefore, increasing of M2 microglia is expected to recover from AD. We previously found that naringenin, a blood-brain barrier penetrating compound, decreased Abeta deposits and recovers memory function in transgenic AD model mice. Naringenin reportedly showed anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we aim to investigate potential effects of naringenin on microglial polarization and to reveal the underlying mechanisms of Abeta reduction. Primary cultured cortical microglia were treated with Abeta1-42 , following administration of naringenin. Naringenin remarkably promoted M2 microglia polarization and inhibited Abeta1-42 -induced M1 microglia activation. Because microglia reportedly played a critical role in cerebral Abeta clearance through Abeta degradation enzymes after phagocytosis, we investigated the expression of Abeta degradation enzymes, such as neprilysin and insulin degradation enzyme. After naringenin treatment, these Abeta degradation enzymes were downregulated in M1 microglia and upregulated in M2 microglia. Taken together, our results showed that naringenin increased Abeta degradation enzymes in M2 microglia, probably leading to Abeta plaque reduction.
