34884298|t|Effects of Anesthetic Techniques on the Risk of Postoperative Complications Following Lower Extremity Amputation in Diabetes Patients with Coagulation Abnormalities: A Retrospective Cohort Study Using Propensity Score Analysis.
34884298|a|Diabetic foot amputation is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. To prevent cardiovascular complications along with vasculopathy in the course of diabetes mellitus, a high number of patients receive anticoagulant therapy. However, anticoagulants are contraindicated in neuraxial anesthesia limiting available anesthetic modalities. Therefore, in this retrospective study, we aimed to compare between general anesthesia and peripheral nerve block (PNB) with respect to postoperative complications following lower extremity amputation (LEA) in patients with coagulation abnormalities. In total, 320 adult patients who underwent LEA for diabetic foot were divided into two groups according to the anesthetic type (general anesthesia vs. PNB). The inverse probability of treatment weighting was performed to balance the baseline patient characteristics and surgical risk between the two groups. The adjusted analysis showed that compared with the general anesthesia group, the PNB group had lower risks of pneumonia (odds ratio: 0.091, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.010-0.850, p = 0.0355), acute kidney injury (odds ratio: 0.078, 95% CI: 0.007-0.871, p = 0.0382), and total major complications (odds ratio: 0.603, 95% CI: 0.400-0.910, p = 0.0161). Additionally, general anesthesia was associated with a higher amount of intraoperative crystalloid administration and a requirement for more frequent vasopressors. In conclusion, PNB appears to be protective against complications following LEA in diabetes patients with coagulopathy.
