34572474|t|Looking at Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis from the Nuclear Side.
34572474|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder representing the most common form of dementia. It is biologically characterized by the deposition of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, constituted by hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The key protein in AD pathogenesis is the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is cleaved by secretases to produce several metabolites, including Abeta and APP intracellular domain (AICD). The greatest genetic risk factor associated with AD is represented by the Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE epsilon4) allele. Importantly, all of the above-mentioned molecules that are strictly related to AD pathogenesis have also been described as playing roles in the cell nucleus. Accordingly, evidence suggests that nuclear functions are compromised in AD. Furthermore, modulation of transcription maintains cellular homeostasis, and alterations in transcriptomic profiles have been found in neurodegenerative diseases. This report reviews recent advancements in the AD players-mediated gene expression. Abeta, tau, AICD, and APOE epsilon4 localize in the nucleus and regulate the transcription of several genes, part of which is involved in AD pathogenesis, thus suggesting that targeting nuclear functions might provide new therapeutic tools for the disease.
