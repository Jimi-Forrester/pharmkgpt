37163421|t|The Role of cGAS-STING in Age-Related Diseases from Mechanisms to Therapies.
37163421|a|With aging, the incidence of age-related diseases increases. Hence, age-related diseases are inevitable. However, the mechanisms by which aging leads to the onset and progression of age-related diseases remain unclear. It has been reported that inflammation is closely associated with age-related diseases and that the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, which can sense the aberrant presence of cytosolic DNA during aging and induce an inflammatory response, is an important mediator of inflammation in age-related diseases. With a better understanding of the structure and molecular biology of the cGAS-STING signaling axis, numerous selective inhibitors and agonists targeting the cGAS-STING pathway in human age-related diseases have been developed to modulate inflammatory responses. Here, we provide a narrative review of the activity of the cGAS- STING pathway in age-related diseases and discuss its general mechanisms in the onset and progression of age-related diseases. In addition, we outline treatments targeting the cGAS-STING pathway, which may constitute a potential therapeutic alternative for age-related diseases.
