36871998|t|Delirium Prevention and Management in Frail Surgical Patients.
36871998|a|Delirium, an acute, fluctuating impairment in cognition and awareness, is one of the most common causes of postoperative brain dysfunction. It is associated with increased hospital length of stay, health care costs, and mortality. There is no FDA-approved treatment of delirium, and management relies on symptomatic control. Several preventative techniques have been proposed, including the choice of anesthetic agent, preoperative testing, and intraoperative monitoring. Frailty, a state of increased vulnerability to adverse events, is an independent and potentially modifiable risk factor for the development of delirium. Diligent preoperative screening techniques and implementation of prevention strategies could help improve outcomes in high-risk patients.
